            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with the World; and to make an ingenuous confession to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, my design in this <hi>second</hi> Dedication is not <hi>purely</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you the due Respects of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to his <hi>Diocesan;</hi> nor to tender those <hi>just</hi> Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I ow to your Lordship for the happiness I have enjoy'd, with the rest of your Clergy, under the <hi>auspicious</hi> Influence of your <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; no nor yet to express the <hi>grateful</hi> sense I have, and shall always retain, of the <hi>personal</hi> Obligations you have laid upon me; no, my Lord, though <hi>these</hi> were all of them sufficient Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet I confess that together

               <hi>with</hi> these I had a certain <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> end in my eye.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHEN I wrote the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Christian Life,</hi> of which <hi>this</hi> and <hi>another</hi> Volume, now in the Press, is a <hi>second</hi> Part, I had no design of engaging any further in that Argument; but <hi>now</hi> I find by experience that <hi>Writing</hi> is like <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> wherein the undertaker, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply some <hi>defect,</hi> or serve some <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience</hi> which at first he <hi>foresaw</hi> not, is usually forced to <hi>exceed</hi> his first <hi>Model</hi> and <hi>proposal,</hi> and many times to <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> the <hi>charge</hi> and <hi>expence</hi> of it. For after that Treatise began to be a little known in the World, I was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from several hands that there


<pb facs="tcp:60130:6"/>
was one thing <hi>wanting</hi> in it, which is the common <hi>defect</hi> of most <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Treatises, and that was, an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> of those main <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion in which the <hi>Obligation</hi> of our Christian Duty is <hi>founded,</hi> which they thought might be sufficiently done within a very <hi>narrow</hi> compass, though herein I find that either <hi>they</hi> were very much <hi>mistaken,</hi> or that I have very much <hi>exceeded</hi> the necessary limits of my Argument, which I am not <hi>yet</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, but <hi>that</hi> I must submit to the judgment of the World. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the prospect of doing it in that <hi>narrow</hi> compass <hi>they</hi> talk'd of was a great inducement with me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, and perhaps had I <hi>foreseen</hi> at first what a <hi>large</hi> field of discourse it would oblige me to traverse, I should never have <hi>entered</hi> on it, but when once I was <hi>in,</hi> I could not handsomly <hi>retreat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60130:6"/>AND indeed considering with what prodigious <hi>rudeness</hi> and <hi>inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> the very <hi>foundations</hi> of Religion are struck at in this <hi>dissolute</hi> Age, he who would <hi>now</hi> treat of them to any purpose will find himself obliged not only to give a distinct and clear <hi>explication</hi> of them, but also to assert the <hi>truth</hi> of them with convincing <hi>evidence,</hi> and to <hi>answer</hi> and <hi>expose</hi> those Atheistical <hi>Cavils</hi> that are level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against them; which <hi>later</hi> would have been much less necessary in an Age of a more <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Genius. And upon this account I have been forced upon a much <hi>larger</hi> and more <hi>laborious</hi> proof of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion than I first intended. Not that I have any great hope of reclaiming those who are <hi>professed</hi> Atheists to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>truth</hi>; for when men are <hi>seduced</hi> by <hi>lust,</hi> as I verily believe most Atheists are, there is little reason


<pb facs="tcp:60130:7"/>
to expect they will be <hi>reduced</hi> by <hi>reason.</hi> But that which I chiefly aimed at is to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>establish</hi> those that are wavering, and to <hi>Antidote</hi> all against this spreading contagion of <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Atheism,</hi> which in a fatal Chain draws after it not only the ruine of mens Souls <hi>hereafter,</hi> but also the utter subversion of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society <hi>here</hi>; And it is <hi>this</hi> hath constrained me to enlarge this <hi>Second</hi> Part into <hi>two</hi> Volumes, which at first view I promised my self to finish in <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN this <hi>first</hi> Volume I have treated only of <hi>those</hi> Principles which are common to <hi>natural Religion</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> together; as an Introduction to which I have in the <hi>first</hi> Chapter <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>demonstrated</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> distinction of Humane Actions into <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> by some <hi>eternal</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> them; and having shewn at large that God hath made


<pb facs="tcp:60130:7"/>
this distinction sufficiently <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> to all men to enable them to conduct themselves to their own <hi>happiness,</hi> and that those actions of men which fall under this <hi>natural</hi> distinction are the principal subject matter of the <hi>commands</hi> and <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Religion, I proceed in the <hi>second</hi> Chapter briefly to explain the nature of Religion in <hi>General,</hi> and of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Religion in <hi>particular</hi>; from the nature of <hi>both</hi> which I have deduced those <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Principles from whence the <hi>Obligations</hi> of Religion are <hi>derived</hi>; the five first of which being common to <hi>natural Religion</hi> with <hi>Christianity</hi> I have handled in this first Volume in so many distinct Chapters.</p>
            <p>AND then as for the <hi>last, viz.</hi> the acknowledgment of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our <hi>Mediator,</hi> which contains under it all those Religious Principles that are <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> though I have


<pb facs="tcp:60130:8"/>
endeavoured to treat of it with all the <hi>brevity</hi> that is consistent with a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>satisfactory</hi> account of the whole Argument, yet it is run out into a <hi>second</hi> Volume, which is now in the Press, and, I hope, within a few Weeks will be ready to follow <hi>this.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps when the Reader considers the <hi>copiousness</hi> of the Argument it han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, he will rather blame me for being too <hi>brief</hi> than too <hi>tedious</hi>; for in treating of those Doctrines which have been handled <hi>at large</hi> in <hi>other</hi> English Treatises of the Christian Faith, and especially in that <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> one of our most learned Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> on the <hi>Creed</hi> (a Book which next to the <hi>Bible</hi> I thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my self more beholden to for my instruction in the Doctrines of Religion than to any <hi>one</hi> I ever read) I have contracted my self into as <hi>narrow</hi> a compass as the barely


<pb facs="tcp:60130:8"/>
               <hi>necessary</hi> explication of them would permit me; but where that <hi>renowned</hi> Pen hath insisted more <hi>Cursorily</hi> (as for instance on the particular Offices of our blessed <hi>Mediator</hi>) I have most <hi>enlarged</hi> my self, though even <hi>there</hi> I have for brevity sake <hi>pretermitted</hi> some things I intended less <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> appertaining to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole I can truly say, that to the best of my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have herein delivered nothing but what is agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which as the most <hi>faithful</hi> Comment on the holy Writings of our Saviour and his Apostles I have all along <hi>carefully</hi> consulted in <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and this is the reason why it hath stuck so long in hand, the pains I have taken in <hi>consulting</hi> the <hi>ancient</hi> Monuments of Christianity about it being, as I may truly say, at least


<pb facs="tcp:60130:9"/>
               <hi>double</hi> to that of <hi>composing</hi> it; and in following the <hi>Primitive</hi> Doctrine, I have followed the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which in its <hi>Faith, Government,</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> I believe in my conscience, is the <hi>most</hi> Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church in the World.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Method</hi> I have chosen, which is to deduce all the Doctrines of Christianity from one <hi>general</hi> Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> it is the most <hi>convenient</hi> I could think of for <hi>my</hi> purpose, which was to represent at once to the Readers view <hi>all</hi> the parts of our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in their natural connexion <hi>with</hi> and dependence <hi>on</hi> one another, that so he might be the better able to judge of the <hi>beautiful</hi> contexture and <hi>admirable</hi> contrivance of the whole, and that by seeing how <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly</hi> all the parts of it proceed out of <hi>one</hi> common <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire</hi> in <hi>one</hi> common <hi>end,</hi> he may be

the better satisfied that Christianity is so far from being a heap of <hi>incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies,</hi> as some have <hi>injuriously</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it, that considering it merely as an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> abstracted from all that <hi>external</hi> evidence that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, the very <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> of it, the <hi>proportion, symetry,</hi> and <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence</hi> of its parts, their <hi>subserviency</hi> to each other, and the <hi>concurrence</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi> of them all together to the common <hi>ends</hi> of Religion, are such as do apparently exceed all <hi>humane</hi> Invention, and argue it to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a <hi>divine</hi> mind. For as he who would form a true <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>beauty</hi> of a <hi>Picture,</hi> must not contemplate the parts of it <hi>separately,</hi> but survey them all <hi>together,</hi> and consider them in their <hi>proportions</hi> and <hi>correspondencies</hi> with each other, so he who would frame a right Notion of Religion must not look upon it as it lies <hi>scattered</hi> and <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> into <hi>single</hi> parts and propositions,


<pb facs="tcp:60130:10"/>
but consider them in <hi>contexture,</hi> and as they are connected all together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one <hi>body</hi> or <hi>hypothesis.</hi> For it is in their apt <hi>Junctures,</hi> their mutual <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies</hi> and admirable <hi>coherencies</hi> with one another that the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> of the whole consists. And therefore to do <hi>right</hi> to Christianity, and enable the Reader to contemplate it with the greatest <hi>advantage,</hi> I have endeavoured to represent to him the whole in a <hi>view,</hi> and to give him a prospect of <hi>all</hi> the parts of it <hi>together,</hi> in an harmonious <hi>union</hi> and <hi>connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with each other. For I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>mean</hi> opinion which some witty men have entertained of Christianity, proceeds in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from their <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> apprehensions of it; they understand it <hi>piecemeal,</hi> and take it asunder into <hi>single</hi> propositions, which they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>separately</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> by themselves, without ever putting them together


<pb facs="tcp:60130:10"/>
into one <hi>regular</hi> System, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their thoughts in that <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> connexion wherein the holy <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> have delivered them to us. For I can scarce imagine how any man of sense should contemplate Christianity <hi>all together,</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> consider the <hi>harmonious</hi> coherence of all its <hi>parts,</hi> and the <hi>wonderful</hi> contrivance of the <hi>whole,</hi> without being captivated with the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>elegancy</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>AND now I have nothing further to add concerning this Treatise but only to intreat the Reader not to be too <hi>severe</hi> in the perusal of it. For though as for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it, I see no reason at all to <hi>Apologize</hi> for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am fully persuaded of the <hi>truth</hi> of it, yet being forced, as I was, to compose it by <hi>snatches,</hi> and in the more <hi>quiet</hi> intervals of a <hi>busie</hi> and <hi>uneasie</hi> life, I very much suspect the <hi>exactness</hi> both of the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of it; and therefore all the favour I


<pb facs="tcp:60130:11"/>
desire is this, that where I have <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> or <hi>obscurely</hi> express'd my self I may be construed in the most <hi>favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> sense, and that wherever I may seem to be <hi>confused</hi> or <hi>immethodical</hi> it may be attributed to those frequent <hi>interruptions</hi> which the <hi>disorders</hi> of my <hi>body</hi> have given to my <hi>thoughts.</hi> And these are requests so very <hi>just</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,</hi> that I am confident none will be so <hi>peevish</hi> as to deny me, but they who read Books only to <hi>carp</hi> and <hi>find fault,</hi> and without any design to <hi>Edifie</hi> their own understandings. But I hope the Reader will consider that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument here treated of is of too <hi>great</hi> moment to him to be so wretchedly <hi>trifled</hi> with, and that therefore he will not be either so <hi>disingenuous</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> or <hi>uncharitable</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> as to peruse with such a <hi>spiteful</hi> design that which I <hi>sincerely</hi> intended for his good, and which he, I am sure, if he pleases, may be the <hi>better</hi> for <hi>for ever.</hi>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the Being, and Nature of <hi>Moral</hi> Goodness.</head>
               <p>ALL Humane Actions are either Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or Sinfull, or Indifferent. The <hi>Necessary</hi> are such as are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> the <hi>Sinful</hi> such as are <hi>forbidden</hi> by God, the <hi>Indifferent</hi> such as are neither commanded nor forbidden, but left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free to our Choice and Discretion. Again, the necessary and the sinful actions are either such as are necessary and sinfull <hi>in themselves,</hi> and are commanded and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden upon the account of some Good and Evil that is <hi>inseparable</hi> to their Natures; or such as are <hi>indifferent</hi> in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to any good or evil <hi>inherent</hi> in them, but are made necessary or sinful by


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60130:14"/>
some <hi>positive</hi> Command or Prohibition su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced upon them. Of the first sort are those which we call <hi>Moral</hi> Actions; as being the subject matter of the Moral Law, which commands, and forbids nothing but what is <hi>essentially</hi> and <hi>immutably</hi> good and evil: and whilst there was no other Law but this, every Action which did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige by some <hi>eternal</hi> Reason, or which is the same, by some <hi>inseparable</hi> good or evil, was left <hi>free</hi> and <hi>indifferent.</hi> But in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time God superadded to this <hi>Moral</hi> Law a great many <hi>Positive</hi> ones, whereby he obliged men to do, and forbear sundry of those <hi>indifferent</hi> things, which were left to their liberty by the Law of <hi>Nature.</hi> For such we call the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Mosaick Law</hi>; all which were <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> before they were <hi>imposed,</hi> and as soon as ever the <hi>Imposition</hi> was taken off from them, did immediately return to their Primitive <hi>Indifferency</hi>; so that by the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of their <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, the <hi>Jews</hi> were restored to all the Liberties of the <hi>Moral</hi>; excepting only the matter of the two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and of maintaining a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Communion</hi> with the Church, which are determined by positive Laws of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. And of this later sort of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and sinful Actions, are, not only all


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60130:14"/>
those indifferent ones which God himself has commanded and forbidden <hi>immediately,</hi> but also all those which he commands and forbids by his <hi>Vice-roys</hi> and <hi>Representatives,</hi> in this World. For whatsoever he hath not commanded or forbidden by <hi>his own immediate</hi> Dictate and Authority, he hath Authorized his Vicegerents to command or forbid, as <hi>they</hi> shall judge it most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Publick. So that when they command what God hath not forbidden, or forbid what he hath not commanded, <hi>their will</hi> is <hi>God</hi>'s, who commands us by their Mouths and stamps their Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with his own Authority.</p>
               <p>And of this distinction between actions that are <hi>morally</hi> and <hi>positively</hi> Necessary, the Scripture frequently takes notice, and particularly, <hi>Mich.</hi> vi.6.7, 8. <hi>Wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all shall I come before the Lord and bow my self before the high God? shall I come before him with Burnt-Offerings, with Calves of a year old,</hi> &amp;c. No, these are not the things that will render me acceptable in his eyes, and procure me a welcome Admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Presence; and yet it is certain that these things were then <hi>required</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> and therefore were <hi>positively</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; but that they were not necessary <hi>in themselves</hi> upon the account of any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick</hi>


                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60130:15"/>
Goodness that was in them, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what follows, <hi>He hath shewed thee O man what is good</hi>; as much as if he should have said, the things above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med are in their <hi>own</hi> nature indifferent, having neither good nor evil in themselves; and are <hi>made</hi> necessary meerly by <hi>positive</hi> Command, upon which account they are insufficient to recommend you to God: but there are other things that carry an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> Beauty and Goodness in their Nature by which they strictly oblige you to imbrace and practise them, and do thereupon recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you by their own <hi>native</hi> Charms, to the Love and Favour of God; and what these good things are he hath sufficiently shewn or discovered to you, <hi>viz. To do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God,</hi> which are the main and principal Duties that he <hi>requires of you.</hi> Which plainly implies that there are some Actions which are <hi>morally,</hi> that is, in their own Natures, <hi>eternally</hi> good, and therefore eternally necessary, and some that are necessary only because for some <hi>present</hi> Reason God Wills and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them. For no account can be given why he should be more pleased with <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> than with <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> unless we suppose the former to


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60130:15"/>
be good, and therefore necessary upon <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable</hi> Reasons, and upon that account to be immutably pleasing to him; and the latter to be necessary only upon <hi>mutable</hi> reasons which therefore were to lose their Necessity as soon as those reasons did alter or cease. For had Sacrifices been good in their <hi>own</hi> Natures, their goodness had been as <hi>unalterable</hi> as their Nature; whereas, on the contrary we find, that whereas their <hi>Nature</hi> neither is nor can be altered, yet their <hi>Goodness</hi> or <hi>Necessity</hi> is. For as before God adopted them into the Rubrick of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by his own positive Institution they were <hi>indifferent</hi> things; so after this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was repealed by a contrary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they became <hi>unlawful.</hi> So that it is <hi>now</hi> as necessary that we should <hi>not</hi> Offer them in the Worship of God, as it was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> that we <hi>should.</hi> And the same may be said of all the other Rites of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law: which being in their own Nature In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, could no otherewise be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either into Necessary or Sinful, but by God's express Command or Prohibition. Whereas <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. are good in themselves <hi>abstractly</hi> considered from all Will and Command; and are not good meerly because they are <hi>Commanded,</hi> but are commanded because they are <hi>good</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60130:16"/>
they carry with them such <hi>unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Reasons as do in themselves render the practice of them eternally necessary. For tho there be very good reason why men should not offer material Sacrifices, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were once injoyned; yet it can <hi>never</hi> be reasonable for them to be <hi>unjust</hi> or <hi>cruel</hi> or <hi>proud,</hi> because the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vertues carry such <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> Reasons with them as will bind and oblige us to eternity; insomuch that tho we had a Dispensation to be proud under the Broad-Seal of Heaven, yet 'twould still be very <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> to be so. And as things that are only <hi>positively</hi> necessary or sinful, derive all their necessity and sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from God's <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>express</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Prohibition; so they cannot be commanded or forbidden by <hi>Consequence.</hi> For if the Matter of them be <hi>antecedently</hi> Lawful or Indifferent, it must necessarily remain so till it is <hi>directly</hi> commanded or forbidden; there being no other Reason to bound and limit it, but only the Will of the Law-giver in whose disposal it is: and therefore till he <hi>directly</hi> signifies his Will either for or against it, it must remain as it is, i. e. <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Indifferent.</hi> But you will say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suppose God hath commanded <hi>such</hi> an indifferent thing for <hi>such</hi> a Reason,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60130:16"/>
doth it not thence follow that he thereby commands every <hi>other</hi> indifferent thing that hath the same reason for it? I answer, No; for if the Reason why he commands it be <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> it is not a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> but <hi>morally</hi> necessary, and so is every thing else that hath the <hi>same</hi> Reason for it; and consequently the reason of the Law, tho it be applyed but to one thing, extends to every thing of the same Nature; because in all moral Cases the <hi>Reason</hi> of the Law is the <hi>Law.</hi> But if the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be in it self <hi>indifferent,</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it is commanded cannot be <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>; and therefore tho there be the same <hi>Reason</hi> why another thing of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should be commanded, yet it doth not necessarily oblige unless it be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>actually</hi>; because in such Cases it is not the <hi>Reason</hi> but the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Law that obliges: and therefore where there is only the Reason and not the Law, it lays no obligation on the Conscience.</p>
               <p>From the whole therefore it is evident what is the difference between things that are <hi>positively</hi> and <hi>morally</hi> Necessary and Sinful; which I thought very necessary to explain at large for the giving a fuller light to the ensuing Discourse; in which I shall endeavor to shew,</p>

the Perfection and Satisfaction of its Sense, or in having perfect Feeling and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of such things as are most grateful to its Appetite and Senses. Its <hi>respective</hi> Good is the Means by which its Senses are perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or rendred lively and vigorous, and by which it's provided for with such things as are grateful and pleasing to them. For there being in every <hi>animate</hi> nature a Principle whereby it's necessarily inclined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its own Preservation and Well-being, that which hath in it a fitness to promote this End is called <hi>Good,</hi> as on the contrary that which is apt to hinder it <hi>Evil.</hi> Now Man being not only a <hi>sensitive</hi> but a <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Creature, hath a twofold Good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Nature, the first Sensitive which is the same with that of brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, consisting in the Perfection and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his bodily Senses and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and in those means which conduce thereunto; and this for distinction sake is called his <hi>Natural</hi> Good: the second Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which consists in the Perfection and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Rational Faculties, and in those means which tend thereunto; and this is stiled his <hi>Moral Good,</hi> though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality 'tis as much <hi>Natural</hi> as the former. For Man being naturally as well Rational as Sensitive, that which promotes his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60130:18"/>
Perfection and Happiness, is no less <hi>naturally</hi> good for him than that which promotes his Sensitive: Nay his Rational Nature being the much more <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> part of him, that which naturally promotes the Perfection and Happiness of it, is in it self a much <hi>greater</hi> good to his Nature and ought to be preferred by him before any of those Natural goods, which conduce only to the happiness of his sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nature; and he who indulges his <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Part in any Pleasure which his Rational disallows, doth thereby create a torment to himself, and raise a Devil in his own mind. For tho Reason and Religion doth allow that the Sensitive nature should be gratified in all its natural Appetites and Desires, yet neither allow that it should be pampered and indulged in any such Excsses as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial either to it self or to that Rational Nature whereunto it is joyned; and he who indulges his Sense in any such Exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, renders himself obnoxious to his own. Reason, and to gratifie the <hi>Brute</hi> in him displeases the <hi>Man,</hi> and sets his two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at variance. So that there is nothing can be <hi>naturally</hi> good for us, that is any way inconsistent with what is <hi>morally</hi> so, <hi>i. e.</hi> with what conduces to the Perfection and Happiness of our rational Nature; and


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60130:18"/>
tho this Natural and Moral Good are no way inconsistent with one another, yet it is the Moral that is the Supreme Good of a Man, because it is the good of his most excellent Nature. Having thus premised what I mean by <hi>Good</hi> in general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by <hi>Moral</hi> Good, I proceed to shew that in some Humane actions there is such an <hi>intrinsick moral</hi> Good as renders 'em for ever obliging to us. And this I shall endeavour in these following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> THAT the Happiness of Humane Nature is founded in its <hi>Perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> THAT the Perfection of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature consists in acting suitably to the most <hi>perfect Reason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THAT the most perfect Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is that wherein all reasonable Beings do <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>agree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THAT there are certain Rules of Moral Good, wherein all Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Beings are <hi>agreed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THAT to act suitably to those Rules hath been always found by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal experience <hi>conducible</hi> to the Happiness of Humane Nature, and the contrary <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous</hi> thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. THAT the Happiness of Humane Nature is founded in its <hi>Perfection.</hi> For


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60130:19"/>
the Perfection of Beings consists in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>compleatly</hi> disposed and adapted for the End whereunto they are designed. Now the End of all Beings that have Life and Sense, is that sort of Happiness that is sutable to their Natures; for 'tis thither that they all of them naturally tend, and therein that their Faculties do all concenter. When therefore their Faculties or Powers of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are compleatly disposed to enjoy the proper Happiness of their Natures, then are they perfect in their Kind. Thus for instance, the End of Brutes which have only Bodily Sense, is <hi>Sensitive</hi> and <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> Happiness; and thererefore then is the Brute Creature perfect in its kind, when it hath not only all the Parts and Senses that are necessary to procure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy its Happiness, but hath them also <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> sitted, tempered, and qualified to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and relish it. And supposing that all the pleasure or happiness of a Beast consisted in the Taste and Smell of its Pasture, it could never be compleatly happy so long as the Organs of its Smell or Taste were imperfect. So that the perfection of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sensible Nature consists in being perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed to enjoy its Natural Happiness. And accordingly herein consists the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Humane Nature, in being perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60130:19"/>
fitted and disposed to enjoy and relish Humane Happiness. For this being its proper End, it is impossible it should ever be perfect in its Kind till 'tis compleatly contempered and adapted thereunto. So that our Happiness must necessarily be founded in our <hi>Perfection,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the perfect Disposition of our Natures to relish and enjoy those Goods wherein the Happiness of our Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; and till our Nature is perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to enjoy them, all the good things of Heaven and Earth will be insufficient to render us perfectly happy.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THAT the Perfection of Humane Nature consists in acting sutably to the most <hi>Perfect Reason.</hi> For Reason being the top and Crown of Humane Nature, hath a natural Right to <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Dispose</hi> of its Motions; to be the Eye of its Will, and the Guide of its Affections, and the <hi>Law</hi> of all its Powers of Action. And indeed, for what other use serves the Reason of a Man, but to prescribe Rules to his unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Affections, to <hi>light</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them to their proper Objects, and as they are moving towards them to <hi>moderate</hi> their Excesses and to <hi>quicken</hi> their Defects and to lead them on to true Happiness in an even Course through all the wild Mazes


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60130:20"/>
of popular Mistakes? And unless it be thus imployed, the man is Reasonable <hi>in vain,</hi> and his light like a Candle inclosed in a Dark-Lanthorn burns out in wast and spends it self in an useless and unprofitable blaze. And whilst to please our Appetites and Passions we run counter to the advice of our Reason, we forsake the rule of our Natures and act like Beasts and not like Men; in which course of Action if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, we must necessarily <hi>degenerate</hi> from our selves, and <hi>sink</hi> by degrees into the most sordid Brutality. For when once our Appetites have gotten the Command of our Reason, and not only <hi>dethroned</hi> but <hi>inslaved</hi> it, the very Order of our Nature is <hi>transposed</hi> and we are become our own <hi>Reverse</hi> and <hi>Antipodes.</hi> If therefore we would arrive at our own Perfection it must be by following our Reason, and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all our Affections and Appetites to its Government. For what else can be the Perfection of a Rational Nature, but to be perfectly Rational; and what is it to be perfectly Rational, but to have our Minds throughly <hi>instructed</hi> with the Principles of Right Reason, and our Will and Affections intirely <hi>regulated</hi> by them? For herein consists the Supream Perfection not only of Men, but of Angels, yea and of God


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60130:20"/>
Himself, the Crown and Glory of whose Nature it is, that he always <hi>knows,</hi> and <hi>chuses</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> what is <hi>fittest</hi> and <hi>best</hi> and <hi>most reasonable.</hi> And when once our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is so far <hi>inlightned</hi> as that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>dictates</hi> right Reason to us; and our Will and Affections are so far <hi>subdued</hi> as that they always freely and chearfully <hi>comply</hi> with it, we have arrived to the very top of our Nature, and are Commenced perfect Men in Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THAT the most perfect Reason is that wherein all Reasonable Beings do <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>agree.</hi> For if there be any such matter as <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False, Reasonable,</hi> and <hi>Vnreasonable</hi> in the Nature of things, and if there be any such thing as <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> among Beings, whereby they are capable of distinguishing between the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi>; either that must be True and Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable which <hi>all</hi> Understandings do <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>agree</hi> in, or all the Understandings that are in the World must be under a fatal <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Delusion.</hi> Which later be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed inevitably destroys all <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> and lays a foundation for the wildest <hi>Scepticism.</hi> For supposing all Understandings to be <hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> on, it is impossible for us to be <hi>certain</hi> of any thing, and for all we know, a Part


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60130:21"/>
may be bigger than the Whole, two and two may make twenty, and both parts of a Contradiction may be true. Nay we can never be certain whether we are not Dreaming when we think we are Awake, and whether we are not Awake when we think we are Dreaming. Either therefore we must <hi>renounce</hi> all Certainty whatsoever, and <hi>fluctuate</hi> in eternal Scepticism, or <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> that to be True and Reasonable which all Understandings do unanimously vote so.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. THAT there are certain Rules of Moral Goodness concerning the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reason whereof all Understandings are <hi>agreed.</hi> For such are all those which prescribe the Dueness of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to God, of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> to our Parents and Superiours, of <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> to our selves, and of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to one another; to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Reasonableness of which Rules, all Understandings do as unanimously <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> as to the truth of any Proposition in the Mathematicks. Now of all the orders of Reasonable Beings, that which we most <hi>converse</hi> with and with whose Consent and Agreement in any matters we are best <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,</hi> is that of <hi>Men</hi>; and therefore if among Men we can discover such an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60130:21"/>
                     <hi>Agreement</hi> concerning the Goodness of these Rules as will warrant us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other Rational Beings to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting</hi> with them, this will be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Demonstration of the Truth of the Proposition. These two things therefore I shall endeavour to make out, 1. That the Reason of Men is <hi>Vniversally</hi> consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is an <hi>immutable</hi> Goodness in these Rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. 2. That this Universal Consent of <hi>Mens</hi> Reason in this matter is a sufficient Demonstration that all <hi>other</hi> reasonable Beings are consenting with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> THEREFORE there is nothing more evident than that <hi>Men</hi> are Universally agreed in this matter, that to <hi>Worship</hi> God, to <hi>Honour</hi> their Parents and Superiours, to be <hi>temperate</hi> in their Passions and Appetites, and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> towards one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are things in their own nature <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably</hi> good; that this is not an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peculiar to such an <hi>Age,</hi> or to such a <hi>Nation,</hi> or to such a <hi>Sect</hi> of Religion, but the <hi>Vniversal</hi> Judgment of all Mankind of whatsoever Age, Nation, or Religion. For 'tis upon this judgment that all that <hi>Conscience</hi> is founded which approves of or condemns mens actions; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is nothing else but a Sense or Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60130:22"/>
of Moral Good and Evil; and is every whit as natural to Mens minds, as the Sense of pleasant or painful touches to their Bodies. Since therefore general <hi>Effects</hi> must spring from general <hi>Causes,</hi> it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follows that the <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> which Mens minds generally feel upon the Commission of <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Actions, must be resolved into some general Cause; and what else can that be, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Consent</hi> of their Reason concerning the immutable Evil of the <hi>one</hi> and Good of the <hi>other</hi>? I know 'tis pretended by some of our Modern Navigators that there are a sort of People in the World who have not the least sense of Good and Evil, and do own neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Religion</hi> nor <hi>Morality.</hi> But considering the short Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and imperfect Intercourse which these our new Discoverers have had with those Barbarous Countries, it is fairly suppose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the Inhabitants may have Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> of which Strangers who understand not their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Customs, and Manners, can make little or no Discovery. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that what they report were <hi>true</hi>; yet by their own confession these wretched <hi>Barbarians</hi> are in all other things so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Brutish, that they discover no


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60130:22"/>
other token of their Humanity but their Shape. For they live altogether <hi>regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> of themselves; of the <hi>Conveniences</hi> of their Lives, and of the <hi>Dignity</hi> of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; without making any <hi>Reflections</hi> on their own minds, or any <hi>Observations</hi> from their own experience. Since therefore all Knowledge is acquired by Attention, it is not at all impossible for Creatures so utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>supine</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> to be ignorant of the most common Notions. But for any man to question the truth of this <hi>general</hi> Rule, because there are a few <hi>Exceptions</hi> from it, is every whit as absurd as if he should question whether Men are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>two-legg'd</hi> Animals, because there have been some Monsters with <hi>three.</hi> And what if among men there are some Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in respect of their <hi>Minds,</hi> as well as others in respect of their <hi>Bodies?</hi> This is no more a prejudice to the standing Laws of <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, than Prodigies are to the Regularity of the constant course of <hi>Vniversal</hi> Nature. <hi>Specimen naturae cujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet,</hi> saith <hi>Tully, à natura optima sumendum est,</hi> i. e. <hi>The true sample of every Nature is to be taken from the best Natures of the kind.</hi> Since therefore the men of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ages and Religions who have in any measure attended to the Nature of


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60130:23"/>
things, and made but any tolerable use of their Reasons, are, and always have been <hi>universally</hi> agreed that there is an immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Good in Vertue, and Evil in Vice; it is no Argument at all that this is not the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sense</hi> of Mankind, supposing it <hi>true</hi> which is very <hi>questionable,</hi> that there are some <hi>few</hi> such inhumane Barbarians in the World as make no distinction at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em. But then</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> THIS Universal Consent of <hi>Mens</hi> Reason in this matter, is a sufficient Demonstration that all <hi>other</hi> Reasonable Beings are consenting with them. For it shews that God himself is of this mind; and if <hi>He</hi> be, we may be sure that all <hi>other</hi> Reasonable Beings are. For if we believe that God made us, we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he made us for some <hi>End</hi>; and if he made us for any End, he must esteem those Actions <hi>good</hi> which <hi>promote</hi> it, and those <hi>evil</hi> which <hi>obstruct</hi> and <hi>hinder</hi> it. And what other End can an infinitely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and blessed Being have in making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings; but only to do 'em good and according to their several Capacities to make them partakers of his own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And if this be the end for which God made us, to be sure those Actions must be <hi>good</hi> in his esteem that are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,</hi> and those <hi>evil</hi> that are <hi>hurtful</hi>


                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60130:23"/>
and <hi>mischievous</hi> to our Nature. And therefore since he hath implanted in us not only a natural <hi>Desire</hi> of Happiness; but also a rational <hi>Faculty</hi> to discern what Actions make for our Happiness and what not, we may be sure that whatsoever this Faculty doth <hi>Vniversally</hi> determine to be good or evil for us, <hi>is</hi> good or evil in the Judgment of <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis true when the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that is in <hi>one</hi> man judges contrary to the Reason that is in <hi>another,</hi> there must be a <hi>Disagreement</hi> on one side or the other from the Reason and Judgment of <hi>God</hi>; but when <hi>all</hi> mens Reason is agreed that <hi>this</hi> is good and <hi>that</hi> evil, it is plain that this is is the Judgment of the Rational Faculty which <hi>naturally</hi> makes such a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> of things. For there is no man that uses his Reason can possibly think that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood, Justice</hi> and <hi>Injustice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> are equally <hi>good</hi> in themselves; his Rational Faculty being so framed as that at the first glance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, it naturally <hi>distinguishes</hi> 'em into <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> When therefore God hath created us with such a <hi>Faculty</hi> as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes such a <hi>Judgment</hi> of Good and Evil, that <hi>Judgment</hi> must be Gods as well as the <hi>Faculty</hi> which made it. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is the <hi>unanimous Judgment</hi> of


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60130:24"/>
all Men, must be the <hi>Natural Language</hi> of the Rational Faculty; and that which is the natural Language of the Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty must be the Language of the <hi>God of Nature.</hi> For he who created me with such a Faculty as naturally judges <hi>this</hi> Good and <hi>that</hi> Evil, must either have the same Judgment <hi>himself,</hi> or create in me a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his <hi>own</hi> Judgment; and that Judgment which he hath created in <hi>me,</hi> he must be supposed to create in <hi>all other</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are capable of Judging; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he would be the author of <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> Judgments. For, should one Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Faculty naturally judge <hi>this,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>contrary,</hi> they must necessarily be so framed as to <hi>contradict</hi> each other, and consequently he who framed both must be the Author of the Contradiction. So that this <hi>universal Consent</hi> of Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> of Humane Actions is a plain Evidence that God and all other Rational Beings are <hi>consenting</hi> with 'em.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. AND Lastly, that Mens acting <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably</hi> to these Rules of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in which they are thus <hi>universally consenting,</hi> hath by long and constant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience been found most <hi>conducive</hi> to Mens Welfare and Happiness. For the


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60130:24"/>
Proof whereof I shall need urge no other Argument than this, that the great <hi>Design</hi> of all Humane Laws and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath been to <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>inforce</hi> these Rules of <hi>Morality</hi>; which is a plain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Men have always found by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> that they are naturally good and productive of their Happiness and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. For how can it be thought that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men have had so many thousand years <hi>Trial</hi> of Piety and Justice and Mercy and Temperance, they should still be so solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to <hi>fence</hi> and <hi>guard</hi> 'em with Laws, had they not found 'em highly <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> and their Contraries as <hi>mischievous</hi> to Mankind. For do but suppose that the Contraries to all Vertue were for <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-sake</hi> imposed for some time upon Mankind, and it were made as Penal by the Laws of Nations to be <hi>Pious,</hi> and <hi>Just, Merciful,</hi> and <hi>Temperate</hi> as it is now to be the contrary; is it imaginable that that which we now call <hi>Vice</hi> should in process of time acquire the same Universal <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> that <hi>Virtue</hi> hath always had among men? Or at least, is it probable that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some <hi>thousand</hi> years Trial and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>such</hi> a Law, Men should still be as much concerned to guard and inforce it, as they are and always have been to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60130:25"/>
the Laws of Piety and Virtue? No, it is most certain they would not. For the very injoyning of <hi>Impiety, Injustice,</hi> and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> would be in effect to injoyn men to render themselves most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi>; to surrender up all the <hi>Supports</hi> of their Hope, the <hi>Peace</hi> of their Consciences and the <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of their Minds; to live in everlasting <hi>Broils</hi> and <hi>Discords,</hi> and turn <hi>Robbers</hi> and <hi>Cut-throats</hi> to one another, and utterly deprive themselves of all the <hi>Comforts</hi> and <hi>Securities</hi> of Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that there is no doubt but after a <hi>few</hi> Years Experience of the mischievous Consequents of such a Law, the whole World would <hi>groan</hi> under it as an insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Tyranny, and even the most <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> would soon grow quite <hi>weary</hi> of it, and heartily wish that it were for ever <hi>Repealed,</hi> and the good old Laws of Piety and Virtue <hi>restored</hi> and <hi>inforc'd</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind. And if so, it is plain that Virtue and Vice are distinguished by their <hi>Natures</hi> into good and evil; and that the Obligations we lie under to <hi>practise</hi> the one, and <hi>abstain</hi> from the other, are not founded in any <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Constitution, but in the <hi>essential</hi> Goodness and Malignity that inseparably adheres to them.</p>

All which is as plain and obvious to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Mankind as any Matter of Fact that is before us.

So that as in the Course of a <hi>virtuous</hi> Life we are growing up into a State of <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>everlasting</hi> Vertue, wherein we shall be everlastingly <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Happy</hi>; so on the contrary, in a course of <hi>vicious</hi> Actions we are sinking into a state of <hi>everlasting</hi> Viciousness, wherein we shall be everlastingly <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> For since Virtue is <hi>good</hi> for and Vice <hi>evil</hi> to us in its own Nature, it necessarily follows that according as we remain <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> or <hi>Vicious</hi> for ever, our Condition must be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for ever. And this being so, of what unspeakable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are the Actions of Men, that thus draw after 'em a Chain of <hi>Joys</hi> or <hi>Woes</hi> as long as Eternity?

O would to God men would at last be so wise as to consider these things before it be too late, and not live at Random, as they do, without any Regard to the certain and unavoidable Fate of their own Actions!

                  <head>SECT. II. That God hath sufficiently <hi>discovered</hi> to us what those Humane Actions are, which are <hi>Morally</hi> Good, and upon that account perpetually obliging.</head>
                  <p>THE Truth of which will evidently appear by considering the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, what it is that God hath done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the making this great <hi>Discovery</hi> to us; the most considerable of which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to these six Heads,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> HE hath implanted in us a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Desire</hi> of Happiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> HE hath given us Reason to <hi>discern</hi> what Actions they are that make for our Happiness, and what not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> HE hath so contrived our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as that we are thrust on by our own <hi>Instincts</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> to those Actions which make for our Happiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> HE hath taken care to excite and oblige us to those Actions by annexing natural <hi>Rewards</hi> to them and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing natural <hi>Punishments</hi> on their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To strengthen and inforce this Obligation, he hath frequently superadded to these <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Punishments <hi>supernatural Blessings</hi> and <hi>Judgments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60130:27"/>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> THAT to enforce all this he hath made sundry supernatural <hi>Revelations</hi> wherein he hath plainly told us what those things are that carry with 'em this intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Good and Necessity,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. GOD hath taken care to discover to us what is Morally Good by implanting in us a natural <hi>Desire</hi> of Happiness; which is so inseparable to Humane nature, that 'tis <hi>impossible</hi> for us to forbear desiring what <hi>is</hi> good for us, or at least what <hi>appears</hi> so. For tho through our own Ignorance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration we many times mistake <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> for <hi>Happiness,</hi> yet such is the Frame of our Nature, that we cannot desire Evil <hi>as</hi> Evil, or Misery <hi>as</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; but whensoever we imbrace a <hi>real</hi> Evil, 'tis either under the Notion of a <hi>less</hi> Evil, or of a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial</hi> Good. Now by this unquenchable <hi>Thirst</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> of Happiness which God hath implanted in our Natures, we are continually <hi>importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> and <hi>excited</hi> to search out and enquire by what Ways and Means we may arrive to be happy. So that as <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> and the sense of bodily <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> forceth men upon the invention of <hi>Trades</hi> and civil <hi>Occupations</hi> to supply their Necessities and Conveniences: So this vehement Hunger and Thirst after Happiness, which God hath created in our


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60130:28"/>
Bosoms, doth almost <hi>necessitate</hi> and <hi>constrain</hi> us to pry into the Nature of our Actions; that so we may discover what Trade and Course of life it is that tends most direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our own Felicity. And by thus <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning</hi> us by our own <hi>self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>love</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Nature of our Actions and into their natural tendencies to our Weal or Woe, he hath not only expressed his good will towards us by taking <hi>Security</hi> of our selves for our own Welfare, and obliging us to be happy by the most <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Passion in our Natures, but hath also taken an effectual Course to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us the Good and Evil of our own Actions; Considering,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THAT he hath given us Reason to <hi>discern</hi> what Actions they are that make for our Happiness and what not. 'Tis true, had he only implanted in our Breasts a <hi>blind</hi> Desire of Happiness, without any Eye of Reason in our Heads to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> our Actions towards it, we must have wandered in the dark for ever, till we had pined away our wretched Beings with a <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>unsatisfied</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. But by giving us a <hi>quick-sighted</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Reason to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> this our blind Desire, he hath taken sufficient care not only to <hi>excite</hi> our Enquiry after the Way to Happiness, but also to <hi>inable</hi>


                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60130:28"/>
us to find it. For the natural tendencies of our Actions to our Happiness or Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are so very <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>visible,</hi> that we can scarce open our Eyes and look abroad without <hi>observing</hi> them. For how can any man who makes any observations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things, be so stupid as not to <hi>discern</hi> the vast Difference there is between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood, Justice</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> as to their natural tendency to the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Hurt, Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? 'Tis true, if men will neglect <hi>using</hi> their Reason, they may be ignorant of the <hi>plainest</hi> Propositions; but if they be, 'tis their <hi>inexcusable</hi> Folly. But if men will be so true to their own Interest, as calmly to <hi>reflect</hi> upon their Actions, their Sense cannot more readily distinguish between <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Gall,</hi> than their Reason will beween <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi>; the fundamental Reasons of which are so <hi>legible</hi> in all the Appearances of Nature, so <hi>necessary</hi> to the Being and Preservation of Mankind, and their equity is so <hi>apparent,</hi> and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience so <hi>obvious,</hi> that a man can hardly reflect upon any thing either <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> him, without being convinced of their Force and Obligation. So that for a man that hath the use of his Reason not to observe the Difference of his Actions, as


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60130:29"/>
to their <hi>intrinsick</hi> Good and Evil, and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> Tendency to his Happiness and Misery, would be as <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>unexcusable</hi> a Stupidity, as if he should pass through the World without ever taking notice that two and two make four. God therefore by giving us a Reasonable Faculty to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi> the nature of things, upon which the Differences of Good and Evil are so <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>legibly</hi> imprinted, hath hereby taken sufficient Care to shew us the difference of our own Actions. For, to inspire us with a Faculty of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> by which we can <hi>form</hi> true Notions of things from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Experiments and <hi>infer</hi> one truth from another, and <hi>immediately</hi> to inspire this Faculty with <hi>Divine</hi> Truth, are only two different Modes of Divine <hi>Revelation</hi>; and God did as <hi>really</hi> reveal himself to us when he <hi>gave</hi> us Reason to understand his Will, as when he <hi>sent</hi> to us his Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from Heaven to make known his mind and Will to us. For God hath so framed our Understandings, as that whensoever we impartially reason about things, we are <hi>forced</hi> to distinguish between Good and Evil, and cannot persuade our selves without doing infinite <hi>Violence</hi> to our own Faculties, that to <hi>Blaspheme</hi> God or to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> him, to <hi>lie</hi> or <hi>speak Truth,</hi> to


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60130:29"/>
                     <hi>honour</hi> our Parents or to <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> them are things of an indifferent Nature; but as soon as ever we open the Eye of our Reason we discern such an <hi>essential</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, as forces us to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> the one and <hi>approve</hi> the other. And accordingly as for the great strokes of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, we find they have as much the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Judgment of our Reason against them as any <hi>false Conclusion</hi> in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks; whilst the Goodness of their contrary Vertues is as universally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by us as the Truth of any <hi>first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in Philosophy. Since therefore God hath so framed our Understanding as that it cannot calmly reflect upon our Actions without distinguishing between the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> he hath hereby sufficiently <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to us what that good is that <hi>immutably</hi> binds and obliges us.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. GOD hath so contrived our Natures as that we are thrust on by our own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> to those Actions which are morally Good and do make for our Happiness. For we are framed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted with such Passions and Affections as do naturally <hi>point</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> us unto vertuous Actions; and tho by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of our Natures, our Passions are subjected to our Reason, and all our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60130:30"/>
consists in being <hi>reasonably affected,</hi> yet in the very Nature of our Passions there is a certain <hi>Tendency</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> to Vertue, antecedent to all our <hi>Reasoning</hi> and <hi>Discourse.</hi> Which <hi>Theages</hi> the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean</hi> stiles a <gap reason="foreign">

Of the first sort are the Affections of Love and Hatred, Complacency and Horror, Glory and Shame, Repentance and Self-satisfaction; which plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that there are <hi>answerable</hi> Objects in the Nature of Things and Actions; that there is a Good to be <hi>beloved</hi> and an Evil to be <hi>hated</hi>; a Deformity to be <hi>abhorred</hi> and a Beauty to be <hi>delighted</hi> in; an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to be <hi>gloried in</hi> and a Filthiness to be <hi>ashamed of</hi>; a Well-doing to be <hi>satisfied</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60130:30"/>
the Nature of Things and Actions, all these Affections in us would be utterly <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>impertinent.</hi> And as <hi>these</hi> Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Nature do signifie in the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> that there <hi>is</hi> a moral Good and Evil in our Actions, so there are others which do <hi>particularly</hi> point out <hi>what</hi> Actions are morally Good and what Evil. Thus for Instance, the Passions of <hi>Veneration</hi> and <hi>Disdain</hi> do plainly direct us to Honour God and our Superiors, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in good Courses out of a generous <hi>Scorn</hi> of all Temptations to the contrary. Thus <hi>Commiseration</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> direct us to Charity and Justice, to <hi>lament</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> those who are <hi>undeservedly</hi> unfortunate, and to be <hi>displeased</hi> with the Advancement of <hi>base</hi> and <hi>undeserving</hi> People; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> in our Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, and to <hi>proportion</hi> them to mens Merit and Desert. For by this Passion of Envy Nature teaches us that there is such a thing as <hi>just</hi> and <hi>unjust, equal</hi> and <hi>unequal,</hi> and that the former is to be <hi>embraced</hi> and the latter to be <hi>shunned.</hi> And to name no more, thus <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> doth by a silent Language disswade us from <hi>injuring</hi> and perswade us to <hi>benefit</hi> one another. For so by the mournful Voice, the deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eyes and Countenance, the Sighs and


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60130:31"/>
Groans and Tears of the <hi>sorrowful</hi> and <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,</hi> (all which are the powerful Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Nature) we are importuned not only to <hi>forbear</hi> heaping any further Injuries upon them, but also to <hi>commiserate</hi> their Griefs, and by our timely Aids to <hi>succour</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> them. As on the contrary the florid and chearful Looks, the pleasant and grateful Air which we behold in those that <hi>rejoyce,</hi> are so many Charms and Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives by which Nature allures us to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Vrbanity</hi> and <hi>Sweetness</hi> of Behaviour, and a continual Study to <hi>please</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi> one another. By these and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instances I might give, it is evident that tho by our own ill Government we too often <hi>deprave</hi> our Affections and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> them into Vices, yet their <hi>natural</hi> Drift and tendency lies towards Vertue. Thus by their own natural Light which they carry before us, they <hi>direct</hi> our steps to the Way we are to walk in, and point out all those Tracts of eternal Goodness that lead to our Happiness. For since these Affections are in us antecedently to all our Deliberations and Choices, it is evident they were placed there by the <hi>Author</hi> of our Natures; and therefore since 'tis <hi>He</hi> who hath inclined them to all that they naturally incline to, <hi>He</hi> doth in Effect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60130:31"/>
and guide us by <hi>their</hi> Inclinations. So that <hi>their</hi> natural Tendencies and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are the <hi>Voice of God</hi> in our Natures, which <hi>murmurs</hi> and <hi>whispers</hi> to us that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law which our Reason indeed doth more <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>articulately</hi> promulge. And from this natural Tendency of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Good proceeds that <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Sense of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> Actions which we experience in our selves before ever we can discourse. For thus before we are capable of reasoning our selves into any Pleasure or Displeasure, our Nature is <hi>rejoyced</hi> in a kind or just Action either in our selves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and we are sensibly <hi>pleased</hi> when we have pleasured those that oblige us, and as sensibly <hi>grieved</hi> when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of having grieved and offended them. We <hi>love</hi> to see those fare well who we imagine have deserved well; and when any unjust Violence is offered them, our Nature <hi>shrinks at</hi> and <hi>abhors</hi> it. We <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>compassionate</hi> the miserable when we know not <hi>why</hi>; and are ready to offer at their Relief when we can give no Reason for it; which shews that these things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not either from our <hi>Education</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate <hi>Choice,</hi> but from the Nature of our Affections which have a <hi>Sympathy</hi> with Vertue, and an <hi>Antipathy</hi> to Vice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60130:32"/>
in their very Constitution. And hence it is that in the Beginnings of Sin our Nature is commonly so <hi>shy</hi> of an evil A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that it approaches it with such a modest <hi>Coyness,</hi> and goes <hi>blushing</hi> to it like a bashful Virgin to an Adulterers Bed; that it passes into it with such <hi>Regret</hi> and <hi>Reluctancy,</hi> and looks back upon it with such <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi>; which in our tender years, when as yet we are not arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Exercise of our Understandings, cannot be supposed to proceed from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> and therefore must be from the <hi>natural</hi> Sense of our Affections, which by these and such like Indications do signifie that they are <hi>violated</hi> and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</hi> Now this natural Sense of Good and Evil which springs from the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of our Affections, was doubtless intended by God to be the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

GOD hath also entailed upon our Actions natural <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> and thereby plainly declared which are <hi>good</hi> and which <hi>evil.</hi> For it is easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable by an Induction of Particulars, that every Vertue hath some natural Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in it to advance both our <hi>publick</hi> Good and our <hi>private</hi> Interest. That <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>Charity, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> are not only <hi>convenient,</hi> but absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to our Joy and Comfort, our Peace and Quietness, our Safety and Contentment; to the Health of our <hi>Body</hi> and the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our <hi>Mind,</hi> and the Security and Happiness of our <hi>Society</hi> with one another. Whereas on the contrary, Vice naturally teems with <hi>mischievous</hi> Effects, and is ever productive of <hi>Horror</hi> in the Conscience, <hi>Anguish</hi> in the mind, <hi>Discord</hi> in the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Diseases</hi> in the Body, and <hi>Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Disturbances</hi> in Humane Society. Since therefore the Divine Wisdom and Contrivance hath thus inseparably coupled good Effects to good Actions and evil ones to evil, it hath hereby very <hi>plainly</hi> and


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60130:33"/>
                     <hi>sensibly</hi> declared to us what it would have us <hi>do</hi> and what <hi>not.</hi> For seeing it hath so constituted things as that in the Course of Nature such Proportions of <hi>Happiness</hi> do necessarily result to us from <hi>such</hi> Actions, and such Proportions of <hi>Misery</hi> from their <hi>Contraries,</hi> what can be more evident than that its Design was hereby to <hi>encourage</hi> us to the one and <hi>affright</hi> us from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? So that by these <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Punishments which in the Course of things God hath chained to our Actions, he hath as <hi>expresly</hi> prescribed us what to do and what not, as he could have done if he had spoken to us in an <hi>audible</hi> voice from the Battlements of Heaven. For since the whole Train of Natural Effects is to be resolved into the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, and since his Providence hath so <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> and <hi>contrived</hi> things as that in the ordinary Course of them <hi>good</hi> Effects do spring out of <hi>good</hi> Actions and <hi>evil</hi> out of <hi>evil</hi> ones, what else could he intend by it but to <hi>allure</hi> us to the one, and <hi>terrifie</hi> us from the other? For it is by <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> that all Lawgivers declare their Will and Pleasure concerning those Actions which they <hi>command</hi> and <hi>sorbid</hi>; and therefore since God in his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Government of the World hath


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60130:33"/>
thought good to link natural <hi>Rewards</hi> to <hi>such</hi> Actions, and natural <hi>Punishments</hi> to <hi>such,</hi> these are to be lookt upon as the great <hi>Sanctions</hi> of the Law of Nature, whereby he commands what <hi>pleases</hi> and prohibits what <hi>displeases</hi> him. For when God had no otherwise revealed himself to the World than only by the establsht <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of things, <hi>that</hi> was the great <hi>Bible</hi> by which alone Mankind was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in their Duty; and there being no <hi>revealed</hi> Threats or Promises annexed to good and bad Actions, Gods Will and Pleasure concerning them was <hi>visible</hi> only in the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> Consequents which they drew after them; which are so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> to the Observation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that 'twould be the most <hi>inexcusable</hi> Inadvertency not to take Notice of them. So that the <hi>moral</hi> Good and Evil of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, finally resolves into the <hi>natural</hi> Good and Evil that is appendant to them; and therefore are our Actions morally <hi>good</hi> because they are naturally <hi>beneficial</hi> to us, and therefore morally <hi>evil</hi> because they are naturally <hi>prejudicial</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi>; and those which in their own nature are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil, are <hi>indifferent</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and left altogether <hi>undetermined</hi> by the Law of Nature, which <hi>commands</hi>


                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60130:34"/>
and <hi>forbids</hi> nothing but under the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in the Course of things are made necessary to Humane Actions.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. TO these <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which God hath entailed upon good and bad Actions, he hath thought good many times to superadd <hi>supernatural Blessings</hi> and <hi>Judgments.</hi> For tho he had before sufficiently expressed his Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Humane Actions in the great <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Nature,</hi> and by their <hi>natural</hi> Effects had plainly enough distinguished the <hi>good</hi> from the <hi>bad</hi>; yet considering what <hi>heedless</hi> and <hi>inobservant</hi> Creatures we are, and how apt to <hi>overlook</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Consequents of our Actions, he hath not altogether abandoned us to the easie Instructions of Nature, but out of his superabundant Care to shew us what is Good and lead us to our Duty and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, he hath from time to time second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Punishments of our Actions with <hi>supernatural Favours</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi>; that so by these he might awake our <hi>drowsie</hi> Attention, and revive in us the <hi>languishing</hi> sense of our Duty. Of which we have infinite Instances in the several Ages of the World; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scarce any History either Sacred or


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60130:34"/>
Prosane that abounds not with them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of which both Blessings and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do as plainly evince themselves to be <hi>intended</hi> by God for <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,</hi> as if they had been attended with a Voice from Heaven proclaiming the Reasons for which they were sent. For how many famous Instances have of we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous <hi>Deliverances</hi> of <hi>Righteous</hi> Persons, who by an <hi>Invisible</hi> Hand have been <hi>res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued</hi> from the greatest Dangers, when in all outward appearance their Condition was <hi>hopeless</hi> and <hi>desperate</hi>; and of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Blessings</hi> that have hapned to them not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>contrary</hi> to all secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Causes; of some that have been so eminently rewarded <hi>in kind,</hi> as that the Goods which they <hi>received</hi> were most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Significations of the Goods which they <hi>did</hi>; of others who have received the Blessings which they have asked, <hi>whilst</hi> they were <hi>praying</hi> for them, and obtained them with such <hi>distinguishing</hi> Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as plainly signified them to be the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers</hi> and <hi>Returns</hi> of their devout Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to Heaven? And so on the contrary, how many notable Examples are there of such miraculous <hi>Judgments</hi> inflicted upon <hi>unrighteous</hi> Persons, as have either <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the Power of secondary Causes or been


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60130:35"/>
caused by them <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>natural</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies; of men that have been punished in the very <hi>Act</hi> of their Sin, and sometimes in the very <hi>Part</hi> by which they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; that have had the evil of their <hi>Sin</hi> retaliated upon them in a <hi>correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Evil of <hi>Suffering,</hi> and been <hi>struck</hi> with those very Judgments which they have <hi>imprecated</hi> on themselves in the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a known Falshood? All which <hi>supernatural</hi> Judgments and Blessings of God are only his <hi>Comments</hi> on the <hi>Text</hi> of Nature, by which he farther explains to us the <hi>Meaning</hi> of those <hi>natural</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments which Vertue and Vice draw after them, and shews us what clear <hi>Indications</hi> they are of his Almighty <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Displeasure.</hi> For when he <hi>rewards</hi> men <hi>supernaturally</hi> it is for those Actions that carry a <hi>natural</hi> Reward with them, and when he <hi>punishes</hi> them <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally</hi> it is for such Actions as do carry a <hi>natural</hi> Punishment with them; so that his <hi>supernatural</hi> Rewards and Punishments do speak the <hi>same</hi> Sense and Language with his <hi>natural,</hi> only they speak <hi>plainer</hi> and <hi>louder</hi> to rouse and awake those <hi>stupid</hi> Souls that are <hi>deaf</hi> to and <hi>regardless</hi> of the soft and still voice of <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Punishments. Thus when the old


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60130:35"/>
World by not attending to the <hi>natural</hi> Consequents of their own Actions had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguished their Sense of Good and Evil, God by a <hi>supernatural Deluge</hi> in which he drowned the <hi>wicked</hi> and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>righteous,</hi> consigned to all future Generations a standing <hi>Monument</hi> of his <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi>; that so by the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of it he might keep Mens <hi>heedless</hi> Minds more attentive to the <hi>natural</hi> Rewards and Punishments of their Actions. And when the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>this</hi> was almost <hi>worn out,</hi> and with it mens <hi>natural</hi> Sense of good and evil, God by <hi>raining down</hi> Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> and <hi>rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> from that dire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration, alarmed the World with a new <hi>Declaration</hi> of the wide Distinction he makes between Vertue and Vice. And lastly, when the Vertue of these great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples was almost <hi>spent,</hi> God raised up the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> and by the miraculous <hi>Blessings</hi> he bestowed on them when they did <hi>well,</hi> and the stupendous <hi>Judgments</hi> he inflicted when they did <hi>wickedly,</hi> exposed them to all the Nations round about for a standing <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the vast Difference he makes between Good and Evil. For so the Psalmist tells us,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60130:36"/>
                     <hi>Psalm</hi> 98. verse 2. compared with <hi>Psalm</hi> 102. verse 15. <hi>The Lord hath made known his Salvation, his Righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the Heathen; that the Heathen might fear the Name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the Earth his Glory.</hi> Thus by frequent Examples of <hi>supernatural</hi> Rewards and Punishments God hath been always <hi>instructing</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate World in the essential Differences between Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. AND lastly, To inforce all this God hath made sundry supernatural <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> wherein he hath plainly instructed us what Actions are <hi>good</hi> and what <hi>evil.</hi> That he hath made sundry <hi>Revelations</hi> to the World is evident in Fact, because there are sundry Revelations <hi>extant,</hi> which by those many miraculous Effects of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Power</hi> that attended the Ministration of them, have been sufficiently demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of a <hi>divine Original.</hi> And such are those contained in the five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which have been all most amply <hi>confirmed,</hi> both by the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> which were wrought by their inspired Authors, and the exact <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of the several <hi>Predictions</hi> contained in them. And such is also the <hi>last</hi> and <hi>best</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contained in the <hi>New Testament</hi>; which


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60130:36"/>
both by the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Predictions</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the infinite <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> wrought by <hi>Jesus</hi> and his Followers, together with its own <hi>inherent</hi> Wisdom and Goodness, hath been so effectually proved a <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> that nothing but Ignorance or inveterate Prejudice can cause any man to <hi>disbelieve</hi> or <hi>suspect</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>NOW if you consult these several Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, you will find that the main Drift and Design of them is to <hi>detect</hi> and <hi>expose</hi> what is morally evil, and <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend</hi> to us what is morally good. For thus the several Revelations made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Children, were only so many <hi>Repetitions</hi> of that <hi>Covenant of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> which God had struck with them, to encourage them to persevere in Well-doing. Thus the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> consisted partly of <hi>Ceremonial Rites,</hi> which were either intended for Divine <hi>Hieroglyphics</hi> to instruct that <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>stupid</hi> People in the Principles of inward Purity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or else for <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of the holy Mysteries of the Gospel: and partly of Precepts of <hi>Morality,</hi> together with some few of <hi>Policy,</hi> suited to the Genius of that People; and partly of such <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> and <hi>Threats</hi> as were judged most apt to oblige them to the Practice of Piety.


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60130:37"/>
And as for the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the substance of their Revelations was either <hi>Reprehensions</hi> of Sin together with severe <hi>Denunciations</hi> against it; or <hi>Invitations</hi> to Vertue and Piety together with gracious <hi>Promises</hi> to encourage them to practise it; or <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Messias</hi> and of that <hi>everlasting Righteousness</hi> which was to be introduced by him. And then as for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> all the Duty of it consists either in <hi>Instances,</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and all the <hi>Doctrins</hi> of it are nothing but powerful <hi>Arguments</hi> to oblige us to the Practice of those Duties. Thus the great Intendment of all Gods Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations is to <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>enforce</hi> the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Morality; to discover the <hi>Nature,</hi> and lead us on to the <hi>Practice</hi> of them by the most powerful Obligations. And in this most perfect <hi>Map</hi> of the Road to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, all the <hi>Tracts</hi> of Piety and Vertue are so plainly <hi>described</hi> and <hi>delineated</hi> to us, that no man can possibly <hi>miss</hi> his Way, that sincerely <hi>inquires</hi> after it. For tho in matters of <hi>Opinion</hi> men may be <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently</hi> mislead and deceived, yet there is no Article either of <hi>Doctine</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> upon which our Happiness necessarily depends, wherein it is possible for an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> Mind to be mistaken. And thus you


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60130:37"/>
see by how many excellent Ways God hath <hi>discovered</hi> to us which of our Actions are good and which evil. So that if after all this we proceed in any sinful and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courses, we are utterly <hi>inexcusable.</hi> For if after God hath thus <hi>plainly</hi> made known his Will to us, we still persist to contradict it in our <hi>Practice,</hi> we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in effect declare that we <hi>regard not</hi> the Almighty, and that we will <hi>do</hi> what we list, let him <hi>will</hi> what he pleases. And what an unpardonable Insolence is it for us who depend upon his Breath, and hang upon his Providence every moment, to treat him as if he had nothing to do with us, and were the merest <hi>Cypher</hi> and most <hi>insignificant</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Being in the World? For though 'tis true he hath not made so <hi>full</hi> a Discovery of his Will to <hi>some</hi> as to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> yet he hath so <hi>sufficiently</hi> discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to <hi>all,</hi> that none can pretend to the Excuse either of <hi>invincible</hi> or <hi>unaffected</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. For as for the Heathen, though they have no Revelation of Gods Will <hi>without</hi> them, yet they have the Bible of Conscience <hi>within</hi> them, and the large and legible Bible of Nature that lies continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally open <hi>before</hi> them, in which they may easily read the <hi>principal</hi> Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Good and Evil, and all the great


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60130:38"/>
Principles of Morality. And if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this they will be so regardless of God as not to <hi>attend</hi> to and <hi>comply</hi> with those natural Discoveries of his Will, what Pretence can be made for them why they should not perish for ever in their Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy? For as the Apostle tells us, <hi>though they had not the Law,</hi> that is, the revealed Law, <hi>yet they did,</hi> or at least might have done, <hi>by nature the things contained in the Law; and therefore as many of them,</hi> saith he, <hi>as sinned without</hi> this revealed <hi>Law, shall perish without the Law,</hi> that is, by the Sentence of the Law of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12, 14. And then as for the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those <hi>natural</hi> Indications of Gods Will which they had in common with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, they had sundry <hi>supernatural</hi> ones; they had sundry great and notorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods <hi>rewarding</hi> good men, and <hi>punishing</hi> bad; and besides they had the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Moral</hi> part of which was but a <hi>new Edition</hi> of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as for the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Part of it, it was though an <hi>obscure,</hi> yet an <hi>intelligible</hi> Representation of all those sublime Motives to Piety and Vertue, which the Gospel more <hi>plainly</hi> proposes. So that would the <hi>Jews</hi> but have heedfully attended either to the <hi>spiritual Sense</hi> of their Law, or to


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60130:38"/>
the <hi>Sermons</hi> of their <hi>Prophets</hi> which very much <hi>cleared</hi> and <hi>explained</hi> it, they could not have been ignorant either of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Part of their <hi>Duty,</hi> or of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Motive</hi> by which it is pressed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. And if notwithstanding, they would be so <hi>regardless</hi> of God, as to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi>; so rude to his Authority as not to mind either his Law <hi>within</hi> or his Law <hi>without</hi> them, upon what reasonable Pretence can they excuse themselves? But then as for us Christians we have not only all those <hi>natural</hi> Discoveries of our Duty which the <hi>Heathen</hi> had, and all those <hi>Supernatural</hi> ones which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, but a great deal more. For in our Revelation the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of Vertue are set before us in a much <hi>clearer</hi> Light, and are neither wrapt up in <hi>Mystical</hi> Senses, nor overcast with <hi>typical</hi> Representations, but laid before us in the most plain and easie Propositions. For that which was the <hi>Mystical</hi> Sense of the Jewish Law, is the <hi>literal</hi> Sense of the Christian; in which all those Precepts and Promises and Threats which were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>dark</hi> Riddles, <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> Adumbrations, are brought forth to us from behind the Curtain, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in plain and popular Articles. So


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60130:39"/>
that if <hi>we</hi> still continue in our sinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we are of all men the most <hi>inexcusable.</hi> The Heathen may plead against the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>their</hi> Law of Nature was not so <hi>clear</hi> in its Precepts, nor yet so <hi>cogent</hi> in its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; the <hi>Jews</hi> may plead against us Christians, that <hi>their</hi> Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was neither so <hi>express</hi> in its Precepts, nor yet so <hi>intelligible</hi> in its best and most powerful Motives as <hi>our</hi> Gospel; but as for us Christians, we have nothing to plead, but by our own Obstinacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>clearest</hi> Discoveries of our Duty do stand condemned to everlasting Silence. So that when it shall appear at the dread Tribunal of God, that we have persisted in our wickedness notwithstanding all <hi>these</hi> Advantages, we must expect to be <hi>reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by all the Reasonable World, to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded</hi> and <hi>hiss'd at,</hi> not only by Saints and Angels, but by the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Devils themselves, who will all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire with our own Consciences to <hi>second</hi> our woful Doom with the Loud Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Just and Righteous art thou O Lord in all thy Ways.</hi> Wherefore as we would not perish for ever without <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Excuse,</hi> let us make hast to forsake all <hi>ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present World.</hi>

                  <p>THE truth of which is most evident from the abovenamed Text, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. <hi>and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Which Interrogation tho it implies not an <hi>absolute</hi> Negation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord required <hi>nothing else</hi> of them (for under the Law he required <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and sundry other positive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as under the Gospel he requires <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word, &amp;c. which are <hi>positive</hi> Duties as well as those legal Institutions of <hi>Moses</hi>;) yet it plainly implies a <hi>comparative</hi> Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord requires nothing else so <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>affectionately,</hi> so for the sake of the <hi>things themselves</hi> and upon the account of their own <hi>inherent</hi> Beauty and Goodness, as he doth these Moral Duties here specified. He did indeed <hi>require</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> to offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to him and to perform those other <hi>Ceremonial Rites</hi> specified in the


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60130:40"/>
Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; and for them wilfully to have neglected those Duties would have been such an avowed Defiance to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as would have rendred them justly obnoxious to all the Judgments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Law; but yet he did much more <hi>earnestly</hi> require them to be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be far better pleased with <hi>one</hi> Act of Moral Goodness than with a <hi>thousand</hi> Sacrifices. And thus he requires of us Christians that we should communicate with him and with one another in our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Sacraments,</hi> and dutifully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to all those sacred <hi>Institutions</hi> and <hi>Solemnities</hi> of Religion which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gospel; and if we wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them we justly incur all that everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Vengeance which is there denounced; but yet our sincere compliance with the <hi>immutable</hi> Obligations of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is a thousandfold <hi>more</hi> acceptable to God than our strictest Observation of these his <hi>positive</hi> Institutions. So that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in the Text <hi>what doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee</hi> plainly implies this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that tho God doth exact of us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Duties which are <hi>not</hi> moral, <hi>i. e.</hi> have no <hi>intrinsick</hi> necessity in them, yet it is the Moral Duties, such as <hi>Justice</hi> and


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60130:40"/>
                     <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> which he principally requires at our hand. Thus concerning <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> God plainly tells us, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, i. e.</hi> I will have Mercy <hi>rather</hi> than Sacrifice, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.6. And the Wise man assures us that <hi>to do Justice is more acceptable to the Lord than Sacrifice,</hi> Prov. 21.3. And to the same purpose our Saviour himself pronounceth, even before that Ceremonial Worship was Abolished, that <hi>to love the Lord with all our heart, with all our understanding, with all our Soul, and with all our strength, and to love our neighbour as our selves is more than all burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices, Mark</hi> 12.33. But for the clearer Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this great and necessary Truth, I shall endeavour, First, to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of it by some Scripture Arguments, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to assign the <hi>Reasons</hi> of it. As for the <hi>Proof</hi> of it, the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars will be abundantly sufficient,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> THAT the Scripture plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that the great <hi>Design</hi> of all the <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of Religion hath always been to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>perswade</hi> men to the practice of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> THAT the main <hi>Drift</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of all the <hi>positive</hi> Duties of Religion hath been always to <hi>improve</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> men in Moral Goodness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60130:41"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THAT God expresses in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture a great <hi>Contempt</hi> of all the <hi>positive</hi> Duties of Religion when ever they are <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi> from Moral Goodness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THAT where ever we find the <hi>Whole</hi> of Religion <hi>summ'd up</hi> in a few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, they are always such as are Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Moral Goodness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THAT wherever such <hi>Persons</hi> as have been most <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to God are <hi>described</hi> in Scripture, their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> always consists of some Instances or other of Moral Goodness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> THAT the Scripture plainly declares that at the <hi>great Account</hi> between God and our Souls, the main <hi>Inquisition</hi> will be concerning our Moral Good or Evil.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. THE Scripture expresly declares that the great <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Doctrins</hi> of Religion is to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>perswade</hi> men to Moral Goodness. For so the Apostle speaking of the <hi>Grace of God, i. e.</hi> the Gospel, assures us that its great Design is <hi>to teach men to deny all ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present World. Tit.</hi> 2.12. And if we consider the Doctrines in <hi>Particular,</hi> we shall find that they all conspire in this great Design. For so the Doctrine of <hi>eternal life</hi> is proposed by God to perswade us <hi>to


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60130:41"/>
cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. So also the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our <hi>future Punishment</hi> is levell'd against <hi>all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men, Rom.</hi> 1.18. And as for those Doctrines which concern the <hi>Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of our Saviour, they are all proposed to us as <hi>Arguments</hi> to perswade us to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue. For 'twas <hi>for this cause that Christ was manifested, to destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. 'twas for this purpose that <hi>he bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin should live to Righteousness,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. 'twas for this end that he <hi>rose from the dead,</hi> that thereby he might prevail with us to <hi>walk in newness of life, Rom.</hi> 6.4. and 'tis for this end that he <hi>intercedes for us</hi> at the right hand of God, that thereby he might encourage us <hi>to come to God by him, Heb.</hi> 7.2. and in a word, for this cause he hath told us he will <hi>come to Judgment,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man according to his works, that thereby he might stir us up to Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vigilance and to <hi>all holy conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Godliness, Mat.</hi> 24.42. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. verse 11. Thus you see all the Doctrines of Religion are only so many <hi>Topics</hi> of divine <hi>Perswasion,</hi> whereby God addresses himself to our


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60130:42"/>
                     <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> and every other <hi>Affection</hi> in us that is capable of Perswasion, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> us to comply with the eternal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Morality; and there is no one <hi>Article</hi> in all our Religion, that is matter of mere <hi>Speculation,</hi> or that entertains our Minds with <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>empty</hi> Notions that have no Influence on our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> For since the Design of Religion in <hi>General,</hi> is to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>fasten</hi> our Souls to God, we may be sure that there is no <hi>Part</hi> of it but what doth in some measure contribute hereunto. Since therefore 'tis moral Goodness that God chiefly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to us by the Perswasions of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may be sure that what his <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> do chiefly <hi>perswade</hi> us to, that his <hi>Commands</hi> do chiefly <hi>oblige</hi> us to.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. FROM Scripture it is also evident that the main <hi>Drift</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of all the <hi>positive</hi> Duties of Religion is to <hi>improve</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> men in moral Goodness. We find the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with <hi>positive</hi> Precepts; for <hi>such</hi> were all those sacred <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Solemnities</hi> of which the Bark and Outside of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion consisted; of all which 'tis true what the Psalmist saith of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in particular, <hi>thou desirest not Sacrifices, thou delightest not in burnt Offerings, Psal.</hi>


                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60130:42"/>
51.16. that is, thou takest no delight in them upon the score of any <hi>internal</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that is in them, but desirest them merely as they are <hi>instituted means</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> of Moral Goodness. For so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Rites of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law were instituted in opposition to the <hi>Magical, Vnclean</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Rites of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Heathen. As particularly, that Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>sowing their Fields with mingled Seed, Lev.</hi> 19.19. in Opposition to that <hi>Magical</hi> Rite which the Heathens used as a <hi>Charm</hi> for Fructification. So also that Command of sprinkling the Blood of their Sacrifices upon the Ground like Water and covering it with Dust, in Opposition to that <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Rite of gathering the Blood into a <hi>Trench</hi> or <hi>Vessel,</hi> and then <hi>sitting round</hi> it in a Circle, whilst they imagined their gods to be <hi>licking</hi> it up. And to name no more of this kind, the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>seething a Kid in his Mothers Milk, Exod.</hi> 23.19. was in Opposition to a Custom of the Ancient Heathen, who at the <hi>Ingathering</hi> of their Fruits were wont to take a Kid and seeth it in the milk of its Dam, and then in a <hi>Magical Procession</hi> to sprinkle all their <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Fields</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> with it, thereby to render them more fruitful the following Year. Besides all


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60130:43"/>
which you may find a World of other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in <hi>Maimonides More-Nevoch. lib.</hi> 3. who tells us, that the Knowledg of the Opinions and Customs of these Eastern Heathens was <hi>porta magna ad reddendas praeceptorum causas, the great Rationale of the Mosaic Precepts</hi>; and that <hi>multarum legum rationes &amp; causae mihi innotuerint ex cognitione fidei, rituum &amp; Cultus Zabio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>; i. e. <hi>that by being acquainted with the opinions and customs of those Eastern Heathens he understood the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of many of the Laws of</hi> Moses, <hi>More-Nevoch. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. So that tho these Precepts were <hi>not</hi> Moral, yet were they set up as so many <hi>Fences</hi> by God, to keep his People from <hi>stragling</hi> into those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Immoralities.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, there are <hi>other</hi> Rites of their Religion, which were instituted to <hi>shadow</hi> out the <hi>Holy Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel; the great Design of which Mysteries was to <hi>invite</hi> and <hi>perswade</hi> men to comply with the eternal Laws of Morality. Thus their Laws of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> were instituted to <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to them the great Transactions of their future <hi>Messias</hi>; his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and immaculate Life, his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Ascension</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> at the right hand of God. So also their <hi>Festival</hi> Laws,


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60130:43"/>
and particularly their Laws of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> were made to <hi>shadow</hi> out the Doctrines of our <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>eternal Life</hi>; and their powring out <hi>Water</hi> in their Sacrifices, and their Ritual <hi>Purgations</hi> from uncleanness, were intended for obscure <hi>Intimations</hi> of the <hi>Effusion</hi> of the holy Spirit, and the Doctrine of <hi>Remission of Sins</hi>; all which Doctrines carry with them the most <hi>preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Invitations to Piety and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly.</hi> THERE are other Rites of that Law which were appointed to <hi>instruct</hi> them in Moral Duties. For God finding them not only a <hi>perverse</hi> but a <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>sottish</hi> People, as those generally are that have been born and bred in <hi>Slavery,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that the most effectual way to instruct them would be by <hi>Signs</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <hi>Representations,</hi> even as Parents do their Children by <hi>Pictures.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 28.10. he tells us that <hi>he gave them line upon line, and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, with a stammering tongue; i. e.</hi> he look'd upon them as <hi>Children,</hi> and so condescended to their <hi>Weakness,</hi> and spake to them in their own <hi>Dialect.</hi> And this way of instructing them by <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> Signs, being much in use in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, and more especially in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whose manners


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60130:44"/>
they were infinitely <hi>fond</hi> of, was of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the most <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>taking.</hi> And accordingly a great part of the Jewish Rites consisted of <hi>Hieroglyphics,</hi> or <hi>visible</hi> Signs, by which their minds were <hi>instructed</hi> in the Precepts of Morality. Thus by <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> God signified to them the necessity of <hi>mortifying</hi> their <hi>unchast</hi> Desires; by their <hi>Legal Washings</hi> he intimated to them their Obligation to <hi>cleanse</hi> themselves from all <hi>Impurities</hi> of Flesh and Spirit; yea this, as St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> in his Epistle tells us, was the Intent of all that Difference of <hi>Meats</hi> in the Jewish Law, which pronounced <hi>Swines flesh unclean,</hi> to instruct them not to live like Hogs, that <hi>wallow</hi> in the Mire while they are <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>whine</hi> and <hi>clamor</hi> when they are <hi>empty</hi>; which forbid them to feed on <hi>Eagles</hi> and other Birds of <hi>Prey,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them to live by <hi>honest Industry,</hi> and not by <hi>Rapine</hi>; which prohibits Fish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Scales,</hi> that generally live in the <hi>Mud,</hi> to teach the evil of <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedness,</hi> &amp;c. From all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Moral Goodness was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Mark</hi> at which all the positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their Law were <hi>levelled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND then as for the <hi>Christian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the <hi>positive</hi> Precepts it contains are directed to the <hi>same</hi> End. It requires us


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60130:44"/>
to <hi>believe</hi> in Jesus Christ, and in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation to <hi>draw near unto God</hi>; the Design of which <hi>Faith</hi> it expresly tells us is to <hi>Sanctifie our natures, Acts</hi> 26.18. and to <hi>purifie our hearts, Acts</hi> 15.9. It enjoyns us to be <hi>Baptized</hi> into the name of Jesus; and for what purpose? but to oblige us thereby to <hi>die to sin and to walk in newness of life, Rom.</hi> 6.4. It requires us to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate</hi> our Saviour's Passion in a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion</hi> of his Body and Blood; and to what End? but only to excite us to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> to God, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> towards one another, 1 <hi>Cor. 5.7, 8.</hi> In a word, it requires us to live in <hi>Vnity</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> and not to <hi>separate</hi> our selves from her sacred Assemblies; and for what other reason? but that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>an holy Temple, and an habitation of God,</hi> by being <hi>compacted</hi> together into an <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Society, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. Since therefore all the Precepts both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Testament which are <hi>purely positive,</hi> do bear a <hi>Respect</hi> to Moral Goodness, and were imposed by God in <hi>subserviency</hi> thereunto, it is evident that that is the <hi>principal</hi> Mark which he <hi>designs</hi> and <hi>aims</hi> at.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. ANOTHER Evidence from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that Moral Goodness is the <hi>principal</hi>


                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60130:45"/>
Matter of our Duty, is the great <hi>Contempt</hi> which God expresses of the <hi>positive</hi> Duties of Religion when ever they are <hi>separated</hi> from moral Goodness. For thus concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Positives of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, we are told that <hi>the Sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord. Prov.</hi> 15.8. And concerning the <hi>Whole</hi> of their <hi>positive</hi> Religion, the Prophet thus pronounces in the Name of God, <hi>to what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices to me saith the Lord? I am full of the burnt-Offerings of Rams, and of the fat of fed Beasts, i. e,</hi> so full as that I loath them; <hi>and I delight not in the Blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of He-Goats. When ye come to appear before me, who hath required these things at your hands, to tread my Courts? bring no more vain Oblations, Incense is Abomination to me; the new Moons and Sabbaths, the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Ass<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emblies I cannot away with; it is Iniquity, even the Solemn meetings. Your new Moons and your appointed Feasts my Soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them. And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes, yea, when ye make many Prayers I will not hear.</hi> And what I beseech you is the reason that God should thus dislike his <hi>own</hi> Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? why he plainly tells you, <hi>your hands


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60130:45"/>
are full of blood,</hi> your <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> doth <hi>prophane</hi> your Worship, and turn it all into <hi>Impiety, Isai.</hi> 1.11. to the 16th. For so <hi>Isai.</hi> 66.3. he plainly tells them, <hi>he that killeth an Ox, is as if he slew a Man; he that Sacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs neck; he that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Oblation, as if he offered Swines blood; he that burneth Incense, as if he blessed an Idol</hi>; and why so? why <hi>they have chosen their own ways, i. e.</hi> of Impiety and Wickedness, and <hi>their Soul delighteth in their Abominations.</hi> Nor doth God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a less <hi>Contempt</hi> of the Positives of <hi>Christianity,</hi> when <hi>separated</hi> from Moral Goodness. For thus St. <hi>James</hi> tells us even of our <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Belief</hi> in Jesus, that <hi>without Works it is dead</hi>; that is a <hi>sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, squalid</hi> thing that hath neither <hi>Life</hi> nor <hi>Beauty</hi> in it, <hi>James</hi> 2.17. And S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> compares <hi>Baptism</hi> to <hi>the washing of a Swine</hi> when it is separated from Purity of Life and Manners, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. And our receiving the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Devotion is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiled <hi>coming together to Condemnation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. All which is a plain Demonstration that moral Goodness is the <hi>principal</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that God insists on; since 'twas <hi>this</hi> that <hi>sanctified</hi> the Sacrifices of the Jews,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60130:46"/>
and <hi>crowned</hi> all their Ceremonial Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances with the divine Acceptation, and <hi>without</hi> this all their other Services were <hi>noisom</hi> and <hi>offensive</hi> to him; and it is this that <hi>perfumes</hi> our Faith and our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our Prayers and Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and renders them a <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>sweet smelling savor</hi> in the Nostrils of God, and <hi>without</hi> this they are all a hateful <hi>stench</hi> and <hi>Annoyance</hi> to him. Doubtless there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>principal</hi> Matter of Duty which God requires of us, is that which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Fragrancy</hi> of all our other Duties.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. ANOTHER Evidence from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that moral Goodness is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal matter that God requires of us, is, that where ever we find the <hi>Whole</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>summed up</hi> in a few Particulars, they are always such as are <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of moral Goodness. Thus in the above cited <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. <hi>what doth the Lord require of thee? but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Thus also the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to his People what they were to do in order to their Reconciliation with God, thus directs them, <hi>wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60130:46"/>
seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judg the Fatherless, plead for the Widow; come now, and let us reason together saith the Lord, Isai,</hi> 1.16.17, 18. So also our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour sums up the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> into two Particulars, and what are they? why <hi>thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; this is the first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self; on these two Commandments hang the Law and the Prophets, Mat.</hi> 22.37, 38, 39, 40. Thus St. <hi>James, True Religion and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the Word, James</hi> 1.27. And elsewhere the Apostle <hi>sums up</hi> the whole Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one leading <hi>Head</hi> of Morality, and that is <hi>Love, for love,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13.10. So this Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on generally holds true, that in all those <hi>Summaries</hi> of Duty mentioned in the holy Scripture, only <hi>such</hi> Duties are taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of as are <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Instances</hi> of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Which is a plain Demonstration that 'tis this which God principally <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,</hi> since 'tis this which he most <hi>takes notice of</hi>; and it may be reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

that in those Summaries of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein but a <hi>few</hi> Parts are enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are such as are the <hi>Chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi>; it being contrary to all Rules of Language to express the <hi>Whole</hi> of any thing, by the <hi>meanest</hi> and most <hi>inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Parts of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. ANOTHER Evidence from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that Moral Goodness is the <hi>principal</hi> Matter of Duty that God requires of us, is, that wheresoever such <hi>Persons</hi> as have been most <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to God are <hi>described,</hi> their <hi>Character</hi> is always made up of Instances of Morality. Thus the Description of <hi>Job</hi> is, <hi>that he was a man perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil, Job</hi> 1.1. And in the 15th. <hi>Psalm</hi> the Description which <hi>David</hi> gives of the man who should abide in the Tabernacle of the Lord, is this, that <hi>he walketh uprightly, and worketh righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and speaketh the truth in his heart; that he backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his Neighbour, &amp;c. he that doth these things,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall never be moved.</hi> And the greatest Character that is given of <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>Darling</hi> and <hi>Favorite</hi> of God, is, that <hi>he was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60130:47"/>
Earth, Numb.</hi> 12.3. Thus also the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Cornelius</hi> by which he was so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared</hi> to God, is, that <hi>he was a just and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout man, one that feared God with all his house, who gave much Alms to the people and prayed to God always, Acts</hi> 10.2. And in a word, the <hi>general</hi> Character of those whom God <hi>accepts,</hi> is, <hi>in every Nation he who doth righteousness is accepted of God, Acts</hi> 10.35. Thus moral Goodness is the great <hi>Stamp</hi> and <hi>Impress</hi> that renders men <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> in the Esteem of God; whereas on the contrary, the common <hi>Brand</hi> by which <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and false Pretenders to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are <hi>stigmatized,</hi> is their being <hi>zealous</hi> for the <hi>Positives,</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> as to the <hi>Morals</hi> of Religion. For so our Saviour Characters the Pharisees; <hi>woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Scribes, and Pharisees, Hypocrites; for ye pay tyth of Mint, Annis, and Cummin</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which yet was a <hi>positive</hi> Duty, <hi>and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faithfulness; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind Guides, ye strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel, Math.</hi> 23.23.24. plainly implying the Morals of Religion to be as much greater than the Positives in <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>moment,</hi> as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel is than a Gnat in <hi>bulk.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60130:48"/>
Moral Goodness is always <hi>mentioned</hi> as the great Character of Gods <hi>Favourites,</hi> and the Neglect of it out of a pretended zeal to the <hi>positive</hi> Duties of Religion is always <hi>recorded</hi> as a Mark of the most odious <hi>Hypocrites</hi>; this is a sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument how high a <hi>Value</hi> God sets upon the Moralities of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. and Lastly, ANOTHER Evidence from Scripture that moral Goodness is the <hi>principal</hi> Part of Religion, is, that at the great <hi>Account</hi> between God and us, his main <hi>Inquisition</hi> will be concerning such Actions as are <hi>morally</hi> good or evil, For so <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. we are told that God will <hi>render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for honour and glory and immortality, eternal life. But to them who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, tribulation and wrath, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguish.</hi> And accordingly <hi>Enoch</hi> as he is quoted by St. <hi>Jude</hi> verses 14.15. declares this to be the Occasion of the Lords coming with thousands of his Saints, <hi>viz. to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60130:48"/>
against him</hi>; all which are matters of Fact against the eternal Rules of Morality. And our Saviour himself in that Popular <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Description</hi> he gives of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that one of the principal Matters, he will then inquire into, will be our <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Observance</hi> of that great moral Duty of <hi>Charity</hi> towards the poor and needy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32, 46. Which is a plain Evidence that our <hi>obeying</hi> or <hi>disobeying</hi> the eternal Laws of Morality, is that by which we do most <hi>please</hi> or <hi>displease</hi> God; since 'tis upon this that he will most insist in his final <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration</hi> of our eternal Fate. For since his last Judgment is only the <hi>final Execution</hi> of his Laws, we may be sure that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is that he will <hi>principally</hi> insist on in his <hi>Judgment,</hi> that is the <hi>principal</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Laws.</hi> And now having suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Proposition, I proceed to the <hi>Reasons</hi> of it; upon what <hi>Accounts</hi> it is that God hath made moral Goodness the main and principal Part of our Religion. The chief Reasons of which are these four.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> BECAUSE 'tis by moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that we do most <hi>honor</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> BECAUSE 'tis by this that we do most <hi>imitate</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60130:49"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> BECAUSE 'tis by this that we advance to <hi>our own</hi> Happiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> WHEN all our <hi>positive</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ceast, <hi>this</hi> is to be the <hi>eternal</hi> Work and Business of our Nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. GOD hath made moral Goodness the <hi>principal</hi> Part of our Religion, because 'tis by this that we do him the greatest <hi>Honour.</hi> It is an excellent saying of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi>

                     </gap>, i. e. <hi>the best honour we can do to a self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>sufficient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to receive the good things he holds forth unto us; and therefore 'tis not by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God that you honour him, but by rendring your selves worthy to receive of him</hi>; for, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e. <hi>whosoever gives ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God as to one that wants, doth not consider that he thereby sets himself above God.</hi> For by his own <hi>self-sufficiency</hi> he is infinitely removed above all Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Want,</hi> and so can never need any additional <hi>Contributions</hi> of Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness from his Creatures. For <hi>Glory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing else but the <hi>Resplendency</hi> of Perfection, which always <hi>reflects</hi> its own


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60130:49"/>
Beams upon it self, where ever there is <hi>infinite</hi> perfection (as to be sure there is in the Nature of God) there must an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> Glory proceed from it; and therefore being infinitely glorious in <hi>himself,</hi> it is impossible that any thing we do should add any <hi>further</hi> Glory to him. So that if we would truly <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glorify</hi> him, it must not be by <hi>giving</hi> to, but by <hi>receiving</hi> from him. Now the best thing we can receive from God, is <hi>Himself</hi>; and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self we <hi>do</hi> receive in our strict <hi>compliance</hi> with the eternal Laws of Goodness. Which <hi>Laws</hi> being <hi>transcribed</hi> from the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, from his own <hi>eternal</hi> Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Goodness, we do by <hi>obeying</hi> them, derive <hi>Gods</hi> Nature into <hi>ours.</hi> So that while we write after the <hi>Copie</hi> of his Laws, we write out the <hi>Perfections</hi> of his <hi>Being</hi>; and his Laws being the <hi>Seal</hi> upon which he hath <hi>ingraven</hi> his Nature, we do in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying them take <hi>Impression</hi> from him and <hi>stamp</hi> his blessed Nature on our own. For all those virtuous Dispositions of mind which we acquire by the Practice of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are so many genuine <hi>Signatures</hi> of God, taken from the <hi>Seal</hi> of his <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Participations</hi> of his <hi>Nature.</hi> For so Holiness which consists in a <hi>Conformity</hi> of Soul with the eternal Laws of Goodness, is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60130:50"/>
called the <hi>Signature or impression of the Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed unto the day of Redemption, Eph.</hi> 4.30. and such as <hi>do righteousness,</hi> are said to <hi>be born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.29. which implies their <hi>deriving</hi> from him who is their <hi>divine</hi> Parent, a <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>Godlike</hi> Nature, even as Children do their <hi>humane</hi> Nature from their <hi>humane</hi> Parents. So that by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of moral Goodness we receive from God the <hi>best</hi> thing he can bestow, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>Godlike</hi> Nature; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by so doing, we render him the <hi>highest</hi> Honour and Glory. For since we can no <hi>otherwise</hi> honour him but by <hi>receiving</hi> from him, we doubtless do him the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> honour when we receive <hi>Himself,</hi> by <hi>partaking</hi> of the Perfections of <hi>his</hi> Nature, which are the greatest Gift he can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to us. <hi>Herein,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>is my Father Glorified, that ye bear much fruit, John</hi> 15.8. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Philosopher, <hi>i. e.</hi> he only knows how to honour God who presenrs <hi>himself a Sacrifice</hi> to him, <hi>carves</hi> his own Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a divine <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>composes</hi> his Mind into a <hi>Temple</hi> for the Entertainment of God, and the Reception of the divine Light and Glory. 'Tis then therefore that


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60130:50"/>
we best <hi>honour</hi> God, when by the Practice of true Godliness we <hi>conform</hi> our Wills and Affections to him; and <hi>derive</hi> into our selves <hi>his</hi> Nature and Perfections; and should you erect to him a Temple more magnificent than <hi>Solomons,</hi> and load its Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars with <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Sacrifices, and make it perpetually ring with <hi>Psalms</hi> and resounding <hi>Choirs</hi> of <hi>Halelujahs,</hi> it would not be comparably so <hi>great</hi> an Honour to him, as to convert your own Souls into <hi>living</hi> Temples, and make them the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations</hi> of his Glory and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For he <hi>values</hi> no Sacrifice like that of an <hi>obedient</hi> Will, <hi>delights</hi> in no Choir like that of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Affections, nor hath he in all his Creation an Ensign of Honour so truly <hi>worthy</hi> of him, as that of a <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>God-like</hi> Soul; a Soul that <hi>reflects</hi> his Image, and <hi>shines back</hi> his own Glory upon him. Wherefore since 'tis by the Practice of moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that we <hi>receive</hi> God, and <hi>copie</hi> his Nature into our own, it is no wonder he should make it the <hi>principal</hi> Part of our Duty. For how can it be otherwise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected but that he should exact that <hi>chiefly</hi> of us, which <hi>most</hi> conduces to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Since then nothing we can do can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to his Glory but only our <hi>receiving</hi>


                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60130:51"/>
Benefits from him, and since no Benefit we receive from him can so <hi>much</hi> conduce to it as our receiving <hi>Himself,</hi> and since we can no <hi>otherwise</hi> receive himself but by <hi>practising</hi> that Goodness which is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature, we must <hi>hereby</hi> doubtless render him the greatest Honour and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. GOD hath made moral Goodness the <hi>principal</hi> Part of our Duty, because 'tis by this that we do most truely <hi>imitate</hi> him. For so you find in Scripture, that wherever God is proposed to us for a <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> of Action it is by some Act or other of <hi>Morality</hi> that we are required to <hi>transcribe</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> him. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. <hi>be ye holy, for I am holy</hi>; and <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>be ye merciful as your Father is merciful</hi>; and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>be you perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi> And indeed 'tis <hi>only</hi> in Moral Goodness that God <hi>can</hi> be the Pattern of our Imitation; as for those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his which for Distinction-sake we call <hi>natural, viz.</hi> his <hi>Omniscience,</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence, Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> they are all beyond the <hi>Sphere</hi> of our Imitation, and therefore were never proposed to us as the <hi>Copies</hi> of our Action. But as for his <hi>moral</hi> Perfections, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi>


                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60130:51"/>
and <hi>Mercy,</hi> they are the Fundamental <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> of all moral Action. For the Nature of God, as it is infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> is the eternal <hi>Fountain</hi> whence all the Laws of Morality are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; and all those moral Precepts by which he governs his rational <hi>Creation,</hi> are only so many <hi>Exemplifications</hi> of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perfections of his own Nature. For the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, which comprehends all his moral Perfections, consists in that <hi>essential Rectitude</hi> of Nature, whereby he always <hi>chooses</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> conformably to the Dictates of his own <hi>infallible Reason</hi>; and 'tis to this Rectitude of <hi>choosing</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> that all his moral Laws do <hi>oblige</hi> us. For moral Laws are only the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>right Reason,</hi> prescribing us what to <hi>do</hi> and what to <hi>avoid</hi>; so that in our Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, we follow the Rule of Gods <hi>own</hi> Will and Actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>imitate</hi> the eternal Rectitude of <hi>his</hi> Nature. For tho in those different <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of God and Creature, <hi>right Reason</hi> cannot be supposed to oblige <hi>him</hi> and <hi>us</hi> to all the same <hi>particular</hi> Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Actions, yet it obliges us both to act <hi>reasonably</hi> in our respective States and Relations; it obliges <hi>God</hi> to act <hi>reasonably</hi> and as it becomes the State and Relation


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60130:52"/>
of a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Creator</hi>; and it obliges <hi>us</hi> to act <hi>reasonably</hi> and as it becomes the State and Relation of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Creatures.</hi> And as for God, <hi>He</hi> is <hi>invariably</hi> inclined to do all that <hi>right Reason</hi> obliges him to, by the <hi>essential Rectitude</hi> of his own Nature; and herein consists all his <hi>moral Perfection,</hi> which is nothing else but the <hi>immutable</hi> Inclination of his Nature to do whatever is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>good</hi> and <hi>reasonable.</hi> So that while we live according to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> or, which is the same thing, the <hi>eternal Laws</hi> of Morality, we <hi>trace</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> the moral Perfections of God; and in <hi>our</hi> Place and Station, live at the same Rate and by the same Rule, that <hi>He</hi> doth in <hi>his.</hi> We do what God himself <hi>would</hi> do, if he were in <hi>our</hi> Place, and what the Son of God <hi>did</hi> do when he was in our Nature; and there is no other Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>his</hi> Life and <hi>ours,</hi> but what necessarily arises out of our different States and Relations. Since therefore Moral Goodness is an <hi>Imitation</hi> of God, 'tis no wonder that he so much prefers it <hi>before</hi> all other matter of Duty. For he must needs be supposed to love <hi>that</hi> above all things, which is the true <hi>Copie</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of those Perfections of his Nature, for the sake of which he loves <hi>Himself</hi>


                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60130:52"/>
above all. For he loves himself not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he is <hi>Himself,</hi> but because he is in all respects <hi>morally Good,</hi> and his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are perfectly compliant with the <hi>infallible</hi> Dictates of his own <hi>Reason</hi>; and hence arises his infinite <hi>Complacency</hi> in himself, that there is nothing in him but what his own Reason perfectly <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves,</hi> no <hi>Inclination</hi> in his Will or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but what is exactly agreeable to the fairest <hi>Ideas</hi> of his own Mind. And since it is for his own <hi>Goodness-sake</hi> that he loves himself as he doth, we may be sure that there is nothing <hi>without</hi> him can be so dear to him, as <hi>that</hi> in us which is the <hi>Image</hi> of his Goodness. Every like, we say, loves its like, and <hi>the righteous Lord,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>loveth Righteousness, Psal.</hi> 11.7. <hi>i. e.</hi> being righteous <hi>himself,</hi> he loves Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in <hi>others</hi> by an invincible <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of Nature. His <hi>greatest</hi> Heaven and Delight is in his own most righteous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>next to that</hi> in righteous Souls that <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>resemble</hi> him. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">III. GOD <hi>principally</hi> requires moral Goodness, because 'tis by the Practice of this that we advance to <hi>our own</hi> natural Happiness. For the <hi>natural</hi> Happiness of <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, consists in being entirely <hi>governed</hi> by right Reason; <hi>i. e.</hi> in having our <hi>Minds</hi> perfectly <hi>informed</hi> what it is that right Reason <hi>requires</hi> of us, and our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> reduced to an entire <hi>Conformity</hi> thereunto. And this is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of moral Goodness, which consists in behaving our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>our selves</hi> and all the <hi>World</hi> as right Reason <hi>advises,</hi> or as it <hi>becomes</hi> rational Creatures placed in our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60130:53"/>
and Relations. And when by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising all <hi>that</hi> true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> which moral Goodness implies, we are perfectly <hi>accomplished</hi> in our Behaviour towards God, our selves, and all the World, so as to render to each without any <hi>Reserve</hi> or <hi>Reluctancy</hi> what is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>due</hi> in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>right</hi> Reason, we are arrived to the most <hi>happy</hi> State that a reasonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can aspire to. 'Tis true, in <hi>this</hi> Life we cannot be <hi>perfectly</hi> happy; and that not only because we live in <hi>wretched</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are continually liable to <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Sickness,</hi> but also because we are imperfect <hi>our selves,</hi> and have none to converse with but <hi>imperfect</hi> Creatures. But were we once stript of these <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, wheresoever we lived we should <hi>necessarily</hi> be happy. Were I to live <hi>all alone,</hi> without this <hi>painful</hi> Body, I should necessarily be in a <hi>great</hi> measure <hi>happy</hi> while I followed right Reason, tho I lived in the <hi>darkest</hi> Nook of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For <hi>there</hi> I should still <hi>contemplate</hi> God, and while I did so, my mind would be always <hi>ravish'd</hi> with his Beauty and Perfections; <hi>there</hi> I should most <hi>ardently</hi> love him, and while I did so, I should <hi>sympathise</hi> and <hi>share</hi> with him in his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; <hi>there</hi> I should still <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>praise</hi>

him, and while I did so, I should feel my self continually <hi>drawn up</hi> to him, and <hi>wrapt</hi> into a real Injoyment of him; there I should be <hi>imitating</hi> his Perfections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while I did so, I should enjoy an <hi>unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Self-satisfaction,</hi> perceiving how every Moment I grew a more <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Godlike</hi> Creature; there I should intirely <hi>resign</hi> up my self to his heavenly <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Disposal,</hi> and while I did so, I should be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>exulting</hi> under a joyous Assurance of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi>; in a word, there I should firmly <hi>depend</hi> upon his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and while I did so, I should be always <hi>triumphing</hi> in a <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Hope of a happy Being for ever. Thus were I shut up all <hi>alone</hi> in an <hi>unbodied</hi> State, and had none but <hi>God</hi> to converse with, by behaving my self towards <hi>him</hi> as right Reason directs me I should <hi>always,</hi> enjoy him, and in that Injoyment should be <hi>always</hi> Happy. And if while I thus behaved my self towards <hi>God,</hi> I took care at the same time to demean my self towards <hi>my self</hi> with that exact <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> which right Reason requires, I should hereby create another <hi>Heaven</hi> within me; a Heaven of <hi>calm</hi> Thoughts, <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> Desires, <hi>serene</hi> and <hi>placid</hi> Affections,

which would be so many <hi>everflowing</hi> Springs of <hi>Pleasure, Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</hi> within me. But if while I thus <hi>enjoyed</hi> God and my self, by behaving my self as right Reason directs, I might be admitted to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>converse</hi> among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Spirits, and to <hi>demean</hi> my self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with that exact <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Peaceableness</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> which right Reason requires, the Wit of man could not conceive a true Pleasure <hi>beyond</hi> what I should <hi>now</hi> enjoy. For now I should be possest of every thing my utmost <hi>Wishes</hi> could propose; of a <hi>good</hi> God, a <hi>Godlike, joyful</hi> and <hi>contented</hi> Soul, a <hi>peaceable, kind</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Neighbourhood; and so all <hi>above, within,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> me would be a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Heaven. And indeed when I have <hi>thrown off</hi> this Body, and am <hi>stript</hi> into a naked Ghost, the <hi>only</hi> or at least the <hi>greatest</hi> goods my Nature will be capable of enjoying, are <hi>God, my self,</hi> and <hi>blessed Spirits</hi>; and these are no otherwise <hi>injoyable,</hi> but only by Acts of Piety and Vertue, without which there is no good thing beyond the Grave that a Soul can <hi>tast</hi> or <hi>relish.</hi> So that if, when I go to seek my Fortune in the <hi>World of Spirits,</hi> God should <hi>thus</hi> bespeak me,

So that the <hi>main</hi> Happiness you see of Humane Nature consists in the <hi>Perfection</hi> of moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and it being so, it is no wonder that the good God who above all things <hi>desires</hi> the Happiness of his Creatures, should above all things <hi>exact</hi> of us the Duties of Morality.

For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards our <hi>Duty</hi> no farther than it tends to our <hi>Good,</hi> and values each Act of our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> by what it contributes to our <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>; and 'tis therefore that he prefers <hi>moral</hi> Duties above <hi>positive,</hi> because they are more <hi>essential</hi> to our eternal Welfare.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. and Lastly, GOD <hi>principally</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us moral Goodness, because when all <hi>positive</hi> Duty is ceast, <hi>this</hi> is to be the <hi>eternal</hi> Work and Exercise of our Natures. For Moral Good is <hi>from everlasting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> its Birth was <hi>elder</hi> than the World, and its Life and Duration runs <hi>parallel</hi> with Eternity; before ever <hi>the Mountains were brought forth</hi> 'twas founded in the Nature of God, and as an inseparable <hi>Beam</hi> of his all-comprehending Reason it <hi>shines</hi> from one end of the World to the other. For as soon as ever there was a rational Creature <hi>in being,</hi> the obligations of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality <hi>laid hold</hi> on him, before ever any <hi>positive</hi> Duty was <hi>imposed</hi>; and as long as ever there <hi>remains</hi> a rational Creature, the Obligations of Morality will <hi>abide</hi> on

him, when all positive Duty is <hi>expired.</hi> For <hi>moral</hi> Obligations are not founded like <hi>positive</hi> ones upon <hi>mutable</hi> Circumstances, but upon firm and <hi>everlasting</hi> Reasons; upon Reasons that to all <hi>Eternity</hi> will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the <hi>same</hi> force and necessity. For as long as we are the Creatures of an <hi>infinitely perfect</hi> Creator, 'twill be as much our Duty as 'tis now, to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him; as long as we are <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, 'twill be as much our Duty as 'tis now, to submit our <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to our <hi>Reason,</hi> and as long as we are <hi>related</hi> to <hi>other</hi> reasonable Creatures, 'twill be as much our Duty as 'tis now, to be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> in all our Intercourses with them.

For as I shewed before, all <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Duty is instituted in subserviency to <hi>moral,</hi> and like a Scaffold to a House is only erected for the <hi>Convenience</hi> of Building up this everlasting Structure of Morality; and when this is once <hi>finished,</hi> must be all taken down again as an unnecessary <hi>Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> that now only <hi>hides</hi> and <hi>obscures</hi> the Beauty of that Heavenly Building that was raised <hi>on</hi> it, and shall abide <hi>without</hi> it for ever, to entertain our Faculties through all the future Ages of our Being, and to be the everlasting Mansion of our Natures. Wherefore since positive Duties must all

                     <hi>cease</hi> and <hi>expire,</hi> and only moral Goodness is to be our Business <hi>for ever,</hi> 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God, who is so good a <hi>Master,</hi> takes so much Care in ths short <hi>Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of our Life to train us up in that which is to be our <hi>Trade</hi> for ever.

                  <p>WHAT then remains but that <hi>above</hi> all things we take care to apply our selves to the Practice of <hi>moral</hi> Goodness: to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> God; to <hi>depend</hi> upon him and <hi>resign</hi> up our selves to his Disposal and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>temperate</hi> in our Affections and Appetites, and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>Charitable</hi> and <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another. These are the <hi>great</hi> things which God requires at our hands, and without <hi>these</hi> all our Religion is a fulsome Cheat. 'Tis true the <hi>positive</hi> Parts of Religion are our Duty as well as these,

and God by his Sovereign Authority <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts</hi> them at our hands; and unless when Jesus Christ hath been sufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to us we do sincerely <hi>believe</hi> in him, unless we strike Covenant with him by <hi>Baptism,</hi> and frequently renew that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>; unless we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attend on the <hi>Publick Assemblies</hi> of his Worship, and use an honest Care to avoid <hi>Schism</hi> and to persist in <hi>Vnity</hi> with his true Catholick Church, there is no Pretence of Morality will bear us out when we appear before his dread Tribunal. But then we are to consider that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Use of all these <hi>positive</hi> Duties is to <hi>improve</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> us in <hi>moral</hi> Goodness; and unless we use them to <hi>this</hi> Effect we shall render them altogether <hi>void</hi> and <hi>insignificant.</hi> Wherefore as we would not lose all the <hi>Fruits</hi> of our positive Duties, let us take care to extend them to their utmost <hi>Design,</hi> to improve our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>Obedience,</hi> our <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> our <hi>Hearing</hi> to <hi>Practice,</hi> our <hi>Praying</hi> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> and our <hi>Fasting</hi> to <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> For if we rest in <hi>these</hi> Duties and go no farther, thinking by such short Payments to <hi>Compound</hi> with God for all those Debts we owe to the eternal Laws

his Ambition, than to behold <hi>Himself</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Christs own <hi>Livery</hi> and Worship'd in a <hi>Form of Godliness</hi>; by which he hath the Pleasure of <hi>dividing</hi> Empires with God, and <hi>ravishing</hi> the better share from him; of beholding his hated Creator <hi>mockt</hi> with the Shell and Outside of a Worshiper, whilst himself is <hi>treated</hi> with the Kernol and Inside. For whilst we continue <hi>wicked</hi> under an outward <hi>Form</hi> of Religion, we do in Effect Sacrifice our <hi>Beast</hi> to God, and <hi>our selves</hi> to the Devil; who above all things loves those unnatural Commixtures of <hi>Hearer</hi> and <hi>Slanderer, Worshiper</hi> and <hi>Deceiver, Communicant</hi> and <hi>Drunkard, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer</hi> and <hi>Oppressor</hi>; by which we only <hi>exalt</hi> and <hi>sublimate</hi> Impiety, which never looks so Glorious as when 'tis <hi>Gilded</hi> with Fasts and long Prayers.

               <p>HAVING in the foregoing Chapter briefly discoursed concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of Moral Goodness, and shewn that it is the <hi>principal</hi> Part of Religion, it will be requisite in the next place to <hi>explain</hi> what Religion is, that so from thence we may collect what things are necessary to the <hi>founding</hi> and <hi>securing</hi> its Obligations, which will be the Subject of the ensuing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>RELIGION in the General respects <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Centre</hi> of all its Acts and Offices. For upon Supposition that there is such a Being as a <hi>God,</hi> and that there are such Beings as <hi>reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or <hi>capable Subjects</hi> of Religion, it will necessarily follow that there must be some <hi>Religion</hi> or other to tie and oblige <hi>these</hi> Creatures to <hi>that</hi> God. For by God we mean a Being that hath all <hi>possible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>


                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60130:59"/>
in him, and is the supreme <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all other Being and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and such a Being we must needs acknowledge doth not only <hi>deserve</hi> the worthiest Acts of Religion that <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, who alone are capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding his <hi>Worth,</hi> can render to him, but hath also an unalienable Right to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi> and <hi>require</hi> them; and that not only upon the Account of his own essential <hi>Desert</hi> (for whatever he <hi>deserves</hi> he hath a right to <hi>demand</hi>) but also upon Account of the <hi>Right</hi> he hath to reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who owe their <hi>Beings</hi> to him and all their <hi>Capacities</hi> of serving him, and so cannot dispose of themselves without manifest Injury to him <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to his Will and Orders. By <hi>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures</hi> we mean Beings that are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived</hi> from God and are <hi>indowed</hi> by him with a Capacity of understanding <hi>him</hi> and <hi>themselves</hi>; and such Creatures must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily stand <hi>obliged</hi> to render him such Acts as are <hi>sutable</hi> to and <hi>due</hi> Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of the <hi>Perfections</hi> of his Nature and their own <hi>Dependence</hi> upon him; and this <hi>Obligation</hi> is that which we call <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Which word according to <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Divin.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60130:60"/>
God. So that <hi>true Religion in the general is the Obligation of Reasonable Creatures to render such Acts of Worship to God as are sutable to the Excellency of his Nature and their Dependence upon him.</hi> Which Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition includes both the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuies</hi> of Religion. For the Doctrines are the <hi>Reasons</hi> by which it obliges us to the Duties; and as there is no Duty in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but what derives its <hi>Tie</hi> and <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from some Doctrine <hi>contained</hi> in it, so there is no Doctrine in Religion but what <hi>ties</hi> and <hi>obliges</hi> us to some Duty that is <hi>enjoyned</hi> in it. When therefore I call Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion an <hi>Obligation,</hi> I include in that term all those <hi>Doctrines</hi> of it concerning <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Nature,</hi> and his <hi>transactions</hi> with his Creatures, which are the <hi>reasons</hi> by which we stand obliged to render all acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to him. But for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the nature of true Religion, it is necessary we should distinguish it into <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>revealed.</hi> By <hi>natural</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I mean <hi>the Obligation which natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son lays upon us to render to God all that Worship and Obedience which upon the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Nature and our dependence upon him it discovers to be due to him.</hi> For God having planted in us a <hi>rational</hi> Faculty, by the due <hi>exercise</hi> of which we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

So that whatsoever natural <hi>Reason</hi> rightly exercised teaches us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and our Duty towards him, is true <hi>Religion,</hi> and doth as effectually <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>oblige</hi> us to him as if it had been immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>revealed</hi> by him. It teaches us that God is infinitely <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>good</hi>; that he is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of our Beings, the <hi>disposer</hi> of our Affairs, and the <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of our Fate both here and hereafter; and by these Doctrines it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him, to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>love</hi> him, to <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him.

is <hi>natural Religion,</hi> which consists of such Doctrines as natural <hi>Reason</hi> teaches us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and of such Duties as it <hi>infers</hi> from those Doctrines and <hi>inforces</hi> by them; and all the Doctrines of this Religion upon which it founds its Duties, being <hi>eternal verities,</hi> as they must necessarily be being all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the <hi>immutable</hi> Natures of God and things, all the Duties of it must be <hi>morally,</hi> that is <hi>eternally</hi> good and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because those Doctrines are the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Reasons upon which they are <hi>founded</hi> and by which they <hi>oblige.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is a Duty of <hi>natural</hi> Religion must oblige <hi>for ever,</hi> because it obliges by an <hi>eternal</hi> Reason, and so can never be <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> with or <hi>abrogated</hi> 'till the Natures of things are <hi>cancell'd</hi> and <hi>reversed,</hi> and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Truths</hi> are converted into <hi>Lies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN short therefore, <hi>natural</hi> Religion hath only <hi>natural</hi> Reason for its <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>measure</hi>; which from the Nature of God and things deduces all those <hi>eternal</hi> Reasons by which it <hi>distinguishes</hi> our Actions into <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>dishonest, decorous</hi> and <hi>filthy, good</hi> and <hi>evil, necessary</hi> and <hi>sinful.</hi> For it doth not <hi>make</hi> them good or evil by <hi>judging</hi> them so, but if it judgeth <hi>truly,</hi> it judges of them as it <hi>finds</hi> them; and unless it finds


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60130:61"/>
them good or evil <hi>in themselves</hi> upon some <hi>eternal</hi> Reason <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> them, its judgment is <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erroneous.</hi> So that the <hi>objective</hi> goodness or evil that is in the actions themselves is the measure of our <hi>Natural Reason,</hi> but our natural Reason judging <hi>truly</hi> concerning them is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>refusal</hi> of them; for be our action never so good or evil in <hi>it self,</hi> unless we have some <hi>eternal</hi> reason <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> it, we cannot <hi>judge</hi> it so; and unless we judge it so, we cannot reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>choose</hi> or <hi>refuse</hi> it; but as soon as ever we have <hi>judged</hi> and <hi>pronounced</hi> it good or evil upon an <hi>eternal</hi> reason, we stand obliged by that Judgment to do or forbear it. So that right Reason pronouncing such actions good and such evil, is the <hi>Law</hi> of Nature, and those eternal Reasons upon which it so pronounces them are the <hi>Creed</hi> of Nature, both which together make <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion.</hi> And by <hi>this</hi> Religion was the World Governed, at least the greatest part of it., for some thousands of Years; till by <hi>long</hi> and <hi>sad</hi> Experience it was found too <hi>weak</hi> to <hi>correct</hi> the errors of mens <hi>Minds,</hi> and <hi>restrain</hi> the wild extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of their <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi>; and then God out of his great pity to <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> Mankind, vouchsafed to us


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60130:62"/>
the glorious Light of <hi>revealed</hi> Religion, which in the <hi>largest</hi> acceptation of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all <hi>natural</hi> Religion, as well the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda</hi> as <hi>agenda,</hi> the Doctrines as the Duties of it; both which are contained in that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of his Will which God hath made to the World, to which it hath superadded sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Doctrines and Duties of <hi>supernatural</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>BUT <hi>strictly</hi> speaking, <hi>revealed</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it is distinguished from <hi>natural,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of such Doctrines and Duties as are knowable and discoverable <hi>only</hi> by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>; as are not to be <hi>deduced</hi> and <hi>infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> by reasoning and Discourse from any necessary or natural Principles, but wholly depend upon the <hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>good Will</hi> of God. And where things depend intirely upon Gods <hi>Will,</hi> and their Being or not Being lies wholly in his <hi>free disposal,</hi> it is impossible that our natural Reason should ever arrive at the knowledge of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. For in such matters as these where the Will of God is absolutely <hi>free,</hi> Reason without Revelation hath neither <hi>necessary</hi> nor <hi>probable</hi> Causes and Principles to argue from, and therefore can make neither <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Conclusions nor so much as <hi>probable</hi> guesses concerning them, but must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60130:62"/>
remain altogether in the dark till such time as God hath <hi>revealed</hi> to it which way his Will is <hi>determined</hi>; and of such matters as these consists <hi>all</hi> revealed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>strictly</hi> so called. For tho God hath made <hi>sundry</hi> Revelations of his Will, yet the <hi>subject matter</hi> of them was for the <hi>Main</hi> always the <hi>same, viz.</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Jesus Christ, and the Duties that are <hi>subsequent</hi> thereunto, which from that Promise which God made to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Fall, <hi>the seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head,</hi> to the last promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> hath been the great <hi>Theme</hi> of all divine Revelation. For what else was that Revelation which God made to <hi>Abraham, in thy Seed shall all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth be blessed,</hi> but only the <hi>dawning</hi> of the Gospel? which is nothing but glad tidings of the <hi>Mediator.</hi> What was the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> but only the same Gospel <hi>shining</hi> through a <hi>Cloud</hi> of Types and <hi>symbolical</hi> Representations; and what are all the succeeding <hi>Prophesies</hi> of the Old Testament but only the same Gospel still shining <hi>clearer</hi> and <hi>clearer</hi> till at last it broke forth in its <hi>Meridian brightness?</hi> And were this a proper place, I think I could easily demonstrate that from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> from


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60130:63"/>
the <hi>Prophets</hi> to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the main <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of all Divine Revelation, hath been the gradual <hi>Discovery</hi> of this great Mystery of the <hi>Mediation.</hi> So that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion was for the <hi>matter</hi> of it always the <hi>same,</hi> tho it was not always revealed with the same <hi>Perspicuity,</hi> but <hi>clear'd up</hi> by degrees from an obscure <hi>Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> to a perfect <hi>Day.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> which in strictness is nothing but the <hi>Doctrine of the Mediation</hi> together with its appendant <hi>Duties,</hi> ought not to be lookt on as a <hi>new</hi> Religion of 1600. years Date, for in reality 'tis as <hi>ancient</hi> as the <hi>Fall,</hi> and was <hi>then</hi> Preached to <hi>Adam</hi> in that <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>Mysterious</hi> Promise; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it was a little <hi>more</hi> clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, tho very obscurely <hi>still,</hi> in God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>; and again, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it was much more <hi>amply</hi> revealed in the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which yet like painted Glass in a Window did under their Pompous Shew still <hi>darken</hi> and <hi>obscure</hi> the holy Mysteries within them, which were nothing but the Doctrines and Laws of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So that <hi>Judaism</hi> was only Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>vail'd,</hi> and Christianity is only Judaism <hi>revealed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:60130:63"/>THUS The Religion of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> you see, was the principal <hi>Subject</hi> of all divine <hi>Revelation</hi>; and this <hi>without</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation natural Reason could never have <hi>discovered,</hi> because the whole of it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the <hi>free will</hi> of God. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would admit of <hi>any</hi> Mediator or no; whether he would admit his <hi>own Son</hi> to be our Mediator or no; whether he would deposit such inestimable Blessings for us or no in the hands of our Mediator, was intirely left to his <hi>free</hi> Determination; and there was no <hi>necessary</hi> cause either <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> him, no nor any <hi>probable</hi> one neither, that humane Reason could ever have <hi>discovered,</hi> that could <hi>incline</hi> or <hi>determine</hi> him one way or t'other. So that till such time as he <hi>revealed</hi> his Will to us, we were left utterly in the <hi>dark</hi> as to this matter, and had no manner of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to <hi>argue</hi> from, or so much as to <hi>guess</hi> by. This therefore is strictly the <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Religion as it stands in opposition to the <hi>natural.</hi> But since together with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion God hath put forth a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition</hi> of natural, which was almost <hi>lost</hi> and grown <hi>out of Print</hi> through the wretched Negligence and Stupidity of Mankind; and since he hath not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them <hi>together</hi> but also incorporated


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60130:64"/>
them into <hi>one</hi>; Religion as it is now fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and constituted by this happy <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of natural with revealed, may be thus defined, <hi>It is the Obligation of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures to render such acts of Worship to God through Jesus Christ as he himself hath instituted, and as are in their own Natures sutable to his Excellencies and their dependence upon him.</hi> Where by <hi>acts of Worship</hi> I do not mean such only as are <hi>immediately</hi> directed <hi>to</hi> and terminated <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> God, as all those are which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the first Table of the Decalogue; but all those acts <hi>in general</hi> which God hath <hi>commanded,</hi> which being performed upon a <hi>Religious</hi> account, that is, out of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to Gods Will and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are as <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> acts of Worship to him as <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now having given this short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature of Religion, it will from hence be easie to collect what <hi>Principles</hi> are necessary to the <hi>founding</hi> and <hi>securing</hi> its Obligations; for</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> GOD being the great <hi>Object</hi> of all Religion, it must be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in order to our being truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that we <hi>believe</hi> that God <hi>is.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> RELIGION being an <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of us to God; that this Obligation may take effect upon us, it is necessary we should believe that he <hi>concerns</hi> himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, and consequently that he <hi>Governs</hi> the World by his <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> RELIGION obliging us to render all due <hi>acts of Worship</hi> to him, to <hi>inforce</hi> this Obligation upon us, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary we should believe that he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>reward</hi> us if we <hi>render</hi> those acts to him, and as certainly <hi>punish</hi> us if we do <hi>not.</hi>

                  <hi>HE that cometh unto God,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>must believe that God is, Heb.</hi> 11.6. where by <hi>coming to God</hi> is meant <hi>worshiping</hi> him, that is, expressing our <hi>Veneration</hi> of, and <hi>Affection</hi> to him, by outward and visible <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi>; and unless our <hi>outward</hi> Actions in Religion proceed from an <hi>inward</hi> Veneration of, and Affection to him, they are not <hi>Worship</hi> but <hi>Mockery</hi>; but how is it possible a man should inwardly <hi>venerate</hi> God, when he <hi>believes</hi> there is <hi>no</hi> such Being in the World? For how <hi>real</hi> soever any thing may be <hi>in it self,</hi> if we <hi>believe</hi> it <hi>is</hi> not, it is to us as if it <hi>were</hi> not; and therefore tho God doth so <hi>necessarily</hi> exist, as that he cannot <hi>but</hi> be, the very Notion of him implying an <hi>infinite</hi> Distance from <hi>not being</hi>; yet while we <hi>believe</hi> he <hi>is</hi> not, our Thoughts can be no more concern'd about him, than about purchasing an Inheritance in <hi>Vtopia.</hi> So that this Proposition that <hi>God is,</hi> is the <hi>prime Fundamental</hi> of all Religion, and if

                  <p>CONSIDERING how loudly the Voice of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Consent of <hi>Nations,</hi> and the beautiful <hi>Structure</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> of things do proclaim the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, one would think it impossible there should be any such Monster as an <hi>Atheist</hi> among <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it hath been <hi>warmly</hi> disputed among the Learned whether there <hi>be</hi> any such or <hi>no?</hi> A Question, which these later Ages have determined in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> by an <hi>Induction</hi> of too many woful Instances. But doubtless had men impartially attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered themselves up to the <hi>Infatuations</hi> of their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and the inveterate <hi>Prejudice</hi> of a corrupt <hi>Imagination,</hi> it would have been impossible for so many gross <hi>Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as Atheism implies, to have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their minds; but when once mens <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> have espoused a Proposition,


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60130:66"/>
they will make one shift or other, be it never so absurd, to impose it on their <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi>; and considering how many <hi>Causes</hi> there are leading men to Atheism who are <hi>predisposed</hi> thereunto, I cannot think an <hi>Atheist</hi> to be so great a <hi>Wonder.</hi> For so long as mens <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> are led by their <hi>Wills,</hi> and their Wills are <hi>byassed</hi> with inclinations to Impiety, they can hardly forbear <hi>wishing</hi> there <hi>were</hi> no God; and then from wishing there were none to <hi>believing</hi> there <hi>is</hi> none, will be a very short and easie Transition. Since therefore their Atheism proceeds not so much from the Defect of their <hi>Reason</hi> as from the fault of their <hi>Wills,</hi> perhaps the most effectual way to cure it, is rather to <hi>detect</hi> and <hi>remove</hi> those faulty Causes in their <hi>Wills,</hi> than to attempt upon their <hi>Reason</hi> with the <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Demonstrations</hi> of a Deity. And accordingly you see that when God had once <hi>erected</hi> this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Theatre</hi> of Beings, and <hi>imprinted</hi> on it so many glorious <hi>Characters</hi> of his own <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> tho from time to time he hath wrought <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable</hi> Miracles, to reduce men from <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> yet he never wrought <hi>one</hi> to reduce them from <hi>Atheism.</hi> And indeed to what purpose


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60130:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>should</hi> he? it being highly improbable that they who will not be convinc'd of the Being of God by this <hi>standing</hi> Miracle, the <hi>World,</hi> in which there are so many ample <hi>Demonstrations</hi> of his Being, should be convinc'd of it by any <hi>other</hi> Miracles; for other Miracles are only the <hi>Disorders</hi> and <hi>Interruptions</hi> of Nature; and certainly the regular <hi>Course</hi> and standing <hi>Order</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a much more glorious Evidence of Gods <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> than the most miraculous <hi>Interruptions</hi> and <hi>Disorders</hi> of it. And therefore if men will be Atheists notwithstanding God hath imprinted so many <hi>Proofs</hi> of his Being on this visible Creation, 'tis plain it is not their <hi>Reason</hi> but their <hi>Wills</hi> that make them so; and if so, to what purpose is it to urge their Reason with the <hi>Arguments</hi> of Gods Being? since if they will not listen to those that are round about them, and are every where to be found in this great <hi>Volume</hi> of Nature, it is highly improbable that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Miracles</hi> themselves, which are <hi>Gods</hi> peculiar <hi>Arguments</hi> (and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>the Demonstrations of his Spirit</hi>) should ever be able to perswade them.

For the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion which men have of God is, that he is a most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely removed by the Perfections of his Nature from all <hi>Inclinations</hi> that are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the Dictates of <hi>right Reason.</hi> And accordingly in all those <hi>Declarations</hi> which he hath made of his Will, they find him expressing an high <hi>Detestation</hi> of all Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Wickedness, and commanding them to abstain from it under the most dreadful <hi>Penalties,</hi> which they know he hath both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to inflict when he pleases. Notwithstanding which, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming on his <hi>Goodness</hi> and a <hi>future Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> they suffer themselves to be <hi>tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>seduced</hi> into wickedness; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of which <hi>tolls</hi> them on from one Wickedness to another, till their Wills are <hi>captivated</hi> by Custom to inveterate <hi>Habits</hi> of Sinning. So that <hi>now</hi> their <hi>Sense</hi> of God, and of his Almighty Displeasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer able to <hi>master</hi> the stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Wills, only serves to <hi>fret</hi> and <hi>disturb</hi> them, to raise <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Anxieties</hi> in their Consciences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to <hi>imbitter</hi> the Pleasure of their Sin. For so long as this <hi>Sense</hi> remains alive in


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60130:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Bosoms, they can never hope to sin <hi>quietly</hi> for it; and it being so, they have no other Remedy but either to part with <hi>that</hi> or their <hi>Sins.</hi> For while thy <hi>retain</hi> their Sins, the Belief of a God will grow an intolerable <hi>Vexation</hi> to them, unless by <hi>sophisticating</hi> their Belief with false Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion they can <hi>temper</hi> it into an <hi>amicable</hi> Compliance with their Lusts. And this is usually the Artifice of the <hi>dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> sort of People whose Understandings are more <hi>easily</hi> imposed on, <hi>viz.</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle with their Belief of a God such Notions of Religion as may render it <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable</hi> and <hi>propitious</hi> to their Lusts. And hence I doubt not sprang most of those <hi>wicked</hi> Doctrines which from time to time have been <hi>foisted</hi> into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, from the Desire which men have to <hi>accommodate</hi> the Difference between their Consciences and their wicked Wills, and reconcile their natural <hi>sense</hi> of God to their Sins. But alas these Artifices are all so <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>transparent,</hi> that 'tis a hard matter for men of Wit to <hi>impose</hi> them on their Understandings; and tho they have an equal <hi>Good-will</hi> to these wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines with the duller sort of sinners, yet their Reason is too sharp-sighted to be <hi>Chouc'd</hi> and <hi>deceived</hi> by them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60130:69"/>
usually they go another way to work, and being sensible that they can never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their sins in <hi>quiet,</hi> while they are aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> of a Deity, and yet obstinately resolved that they <hi>will</hi> enjoy them, they have no other Expedient but to muster up all their Wit and Reason to dispute the belief of a God out of their Minds; and being <hi>stifly</hi> resolved to persist in their Wickedness, they are obliged by their own <hi>Interest</hi> to wish there were no God to <hi>observe</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> them. And then <hi>facilè credunt quod volunt,</hi> they easily believe what they would have, and the <hi>slenderest</hi> probability will sway their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to vote on the side of their <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> So that when men are <hi>resolved</hi> to be wicked, Atheism is their <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Refuge,</hi> to which they are many times forced to fly in their own Defence, to avoid the Clamors and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of their Consciences. Had these men lived in those Good <hi>Pagan</hi> days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might have <hi>rioted</hi> with Devotion, <hi>Sacrificed</hi> to the gods in drunken Bowls, and <hi>Worshipt</hi> in the Arms of a Strumpet, no men would have been more Religious than they; and could they <hi>now</hi> but <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi> the matter so as that God should let <hi>them</hi> alone to enjoy their <hi>Lusts,</hi> there is no

'tis true could men put out the Sun with <hi>wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or extinguish the Nature of things by an obstinate disbelief of them, it would be very justifiable for those men to <hi>believe</hi> there is no God whose <hi>Interest</hi> it is that there <hi>should</hi> be none. But alas, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things are <hi>unalterable</hi> and will be what they <hi>are</hi> whatsoever our <hi>Opinion</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. If there <hi>be</hi> a God, there <hi>will</hi> be one, whether we think fit to <hi>believe</hi> it

or no; and tho when the Interest of our Lusts requires it, we may possibly <hi>dispute</hi> our selves out of the <hi>Belief</hi> of his Being, yet he is not to be disputed out of his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> We may indeed secure our selves from the <hi>Dread</hi> of his Vengeance by dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selves into a <hi>disbelief</hi> of him, but we can never <hi>secure</hi> our selves by it from the <hi>danger</hi> of his Vengeance. And what a sensless thing is it for a man to shut his eyes against an unavoidable danger, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fear of being <hi>frightned by</hi> it; and when he might <hi>shun</hi> Gods Vengeance by <hi>dreading</hi> it, instead thereof to shun the <hi>dread</hi> of it?

And because he who is fond of <hi>others,</hi> loves others should be fond of <hi>him,</hi> to be sure he will love his <hi>fond</hi> God too, and be far more devoutly affected towards this <hi>Idol</hi> of his own temper, than to the <hi>true</hi> God himself cloathed in all the native Glory of his own Attributes. But on the contrary, those who are <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>peevish</hi> and <hi>implacable</hi> can by no means indure their own temper in <hi>others</hi>; and therefore 'tis no wonder if they hate it in <hi>God</hi> to whom they are wont injuriouslly to attribute it.

And <hi>hence</hi> I doubt not in a great measure proceeds the <hi>Irreligion</hi> of the Age <hi>we</hi> live in; for if you surveigh the present <hi>Sticklers</hi> for Atheism, you will find they chiefly consist of the <hi>hair-brain'd</hi> and <hi>uncatechised</hi> Youths of the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who never troubled themselves to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the first <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> nor to consider the <hi>Dependence</hi> and <hi>Connexion</hi> of its <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and know nothing at all either of the admirable <hi>Contexture</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> of it, or of the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Whole.</hi> For alas, their Study hath been employed <hi>another</hi> way, <hi>viz.</hi> in court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Forms</hi> of Speech and <hi>Punctilioes</hi> of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in <hi>fashionable</hi> Garbs and Oaths and <hi>artificial</hi> Luxuries, in <hi>conning</hi> of fine Jests and Modes of Address, and <hi>retailing</hi> Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Wit from Plays and Romances; but as for the <hi>severer</hi> and more <hi>useful</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they bequeath them to the <hi>dull</hi> men of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>

For how <hi>weak</hi> soever the Arguments of <hi>Infidelity</hi> are, it is a hard case if it cannot <hi>baffle</hi> that Faith which hath no Reason on its side to <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it; especially when they are <hi>second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with a mans <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> as to be sure the Arguments of Infidelity will always be. For when a man hath no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>for</hi> his Faith, but a great many Lusts <hi>against</hi> it, the <hi>slenderest</hi> shews of <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> will suffice to make him an Infidel. But what an horrible Neglect is it for Men that have Reason to <hi>distinguish</hi> between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood,</hi> to take no care to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of their Religion in which their greatest <hi>Interest</hi> is involved; but to <hi>wink hard</hi> and believe at <hi>a venture</hi> they know not <hi>why</hi> nor <hi>what?</hi> what is this but to <hi>cast Lots</hi> for their Souls, and throw <hi>Cross</hi> or <hi>Pile</hi> for their eternal Salvation? They resolve, they say, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Religion of their <hi>Ancestors,</hi> but whether that be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false</hi> they never <hi>inquire</hi>; so that if it be <hi>true,</hi> they may thank their <hi>Stars</hi> for it, but if it be <hi>false,</hi>


                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:60130:82"/>
they have the worse <hi>Luck.</hi> Thus they wholly commit themselves to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Chance</hi> to be conducted to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> as it <hi>happens</hi>; and as if those <hi>distant</hi> Fates were <hi>indifferent</hi> to them, they concern not themselves to inquire whether the way they are in be the <hi>Broad</hi> or the <hi>Narrow,</hi> the <hi>Right</hi> or the <hi>Wrong,</hi> but e'en leave the <hi>Event</hi> to determine it. And can any thing in the World be more <hi>wild</hi> or <hi>extravagant,</hi> than for men who are so <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous</hi> about their smaller concerns, who will not <hi>purchase</hi> an Acre of Land without examining the <hi>Deeds</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> by which the Right to it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, thus to take up their Religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>stake</hi> their everlasting Fate upon such a <hi>desperate</hi> venture?

                     <hi>Evidence</hi> of Religion the more <hi>Shame</hi> it is for them, but methinks it might very well become them to be <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> till they <hi>do</hi>; and in the mean while to take care to <hi>inform</hi> themselves <hi>better</hi>; but thus immediately to leap out of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> into <hi>Atheism,</hi> is first to play the <hi>Fool,</hi> and then run <hi>stark mad</hi> upon it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. ANOTHER cause of Atheism is mens measuring the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> of Religion by the <hi>Practice</hi> of such as make the loudest <hi>Pretence</hi> to it. When a man is unwilling to undergo the trouble of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying his <hi>own Reason</hi> of the Truth of his Religion, his usual Method is to <hi>inquire</hi> what <hi>other</hi> men think of it, who by the <hi>zealous</hi> Profession which they make may be supposed to <hi>understand</hi> it better than <hi>himself</hi>; but because mens Thoughts are <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>invisible,</hi> and do not always <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond</hi> with their <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>; therefore to satisfie himself what other men <hi>think</hi> of Religion, he concludes the safest way is to judge by what they <hi>do,</hi> and not by what they <hi>profess</hi>; and so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is in the right. For to be sure mens <hi>Actions</hi> are a much more <hi>certain</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex of their <hi>Thoughts</hi> than their <hi>Words</hi>; and therefore when he sees those who <hi>profess</hi> Religion <hi>act</hi> as if they did not <hi>believe</hi> it,


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60130:83"/>
and observes how their <hi>Words</hi> do run atilt at their <hi>Practice,</hi> and how <hi>broadly</hi> their Lives <hi>give the lie</hi> to their Professions, he presently concludes that whatever they <hi>pretend</hi> they are <hi>Infidels</hi> in their Hearts; and being once persuaded that those whom he thinks do best <hi>understand</hi> Religion do not <hi>believe</hi> it, he thence immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that they find no <hi>reason</hi> to believe it, and do only put on the <hi>Profession</hi> of it as an <hi>Angelical</hi> Vizor, being minded to play the <hi>Devils</hi> in it with more <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Security.</hi> And by this Popular way of reasoning they conclude Religion to be nothing but a Politick <hi>Device</hi> and <hi>Engine</hi> which wise men have contrived to <hi>beguile</hi> and <hi>manage</hi> the simple; and that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is <hi>pretended</hi> for it, it is a mere <hi>jugling-box</hi> which Knaves play tricks with to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude</hi> and <hi>cozen</hi> Fools. And of this way of mens reasoning themselves into Atheism the Age we live in is full of wofull Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for now adays to <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> Religion is no longer the Prerogative of <hi>Wits</hi> and <hi>Vertuosoes,</hi> but the Infection is spread and propagated into <hi>Shops</hi> and <hi>Stalls,</hi> and the <hi>Rabble</hi> are become <hi>Professors</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism. Now whence should this proceed? alas, it is not to be supposed that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as these should ever be able to <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophise</hi>

                  <p>NOW tho there is no doubt to be made but that these vile <hi>Hypocrites</hi> who have laid this <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> in mens way, shall one day <hi>dearly</hi> answer for the <hi>ruin</hi> of those whom it hath occasioned to <hi>fall,</hi> and for thus <hi>exposing</hi> the Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60130:84"/>
of Religion to the <hi>misprisions</hi> of those that do not <hi>understand</hi> it; yet it is a most inexcusable piece of <hi>folly</hi> for men thus to <hi>infer Atheistical</hi> Conclusions from the ill Example of <hi>Hypocritical Professors.</hi> For in the first place, to conclude a Man an <hi>Infidel</hi> because his Actions <hi>run counter</hi> to the Faith he pretends to, is very <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>fallacious.</hi> For do we not see Men very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten act <hi>against</hi> their Consciences, and fly in the face of their <hi>own</hi> Convictions? why may we not then as fairly suppose those wicked Actions we argue from to be the effects of an <hi>obstinate</hi> Will as of an <hi>Infidel</hi> Judgment; but suppose it were true that those men were all <hi>Infidels</hi> that do thus act against their <hi>Faith,</hi> doth it therefore follow that <hi>you</hi> must turn Infidels too? if it be so <hi>unsafe</hi> and so <hi>unworthy</hi> of a man to carry his Brains in other Mens <hi>Heads,</hi> what a shame is it to carry them in other Mens <hi>Heels,</hi> and to suffer his Faith to be lead by the <hi>Tract</hi> of their Examples through all the wild <hi>Mazes</hi> of Irreligion and Atheism?</p>
                  <p>BUT you will say, by these Mens Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples you plainly see what a Mystery of Iniquity there is in <hi>religious Pretences</hi>; and what then? must Religion be a <hi>Cheat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause bad Men <hi>play tricks</hi> with it, and


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60130:85"/>
make it a <hi>Cloak</hi> for their Knavery? if so, then the best things in the World are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Suspicion</hi>; because there is nothing so <hi>good</hi> but what is capable of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to very <hi>ill</hi> purposes. I confess when we see so many <hi>Cheats</hi> acted under the <hi>Masque</hi> of Religion, we have just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to call it to a more <hi>severe</hi> Examination, and to inquire more <hi>narrowly</hi> into the Proofs and Evidences upon which it is founded; but presently to <hi>reject</hi> Religion because <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> make bold to disguise themselves in it, is every whit as <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> as if a man should deny that there is any such Virtue as <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity</hi> in the World, because there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Prostitutes</hi> that pretend to it.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. ANOTHER cause of Atheism is <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> formed out of little Opinions in Religion. For it is natural to men to place a great part of their Religion in those Opinions, for whose sake they <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> from each other; so that if <hi>hereafter</hi> they happen to be dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with those Opinions of which they are excessively fond at <hi>the present,</hi> they will be under a great Temptation to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Religion it self,</hi> as if that were as ill grounded as those <hi>little Opinions</hi> which they laid so great a <hi>stress</hi> on, and so after


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60130:85"/>
they have run through several <hi>Sets</hi> of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in fine have discovered them to be <hi>all</hi> Delusions, they are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Religion <hi>it self</hi> to be nothing but a System of <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Impostures.</hi> For as weak Heads when they perceive the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements</hi> shake are apt to suspect the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> so weak Understandings will be prone to suspect even the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of of Religion, when once they perceive those darling Notions <hi>totter</hi> which they have confidently presumed to <hi>superstruct</hi> thereupon.</p>
                  <p>AND upon this account I make no doubt but that the Irreligion of this Age is very much to be attributed to the <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> of it. For how many woful Examples have we of Persons who had once a great <hi>Zeal</hi> for and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that upon their <hi>causeless</hi> Separation from the Churches Communion, have run from <hi>Sect</hi> to <hi>Sect,</hi> and from <hi>one</hi> extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Opinion to <hi>another,</hi> till at last being convinced of the <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impostures</hi> of them all, they have totally discarded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>it self,</hi> and made their last Resort into <hi>Atheism.</hi> And as separating into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon <hi>little</hi> Differences in Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the Separatists <hi>themselves</hi> to great Temptations to Atheism, so it doth those


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60130:86"/>
also who are <hi>Indifferent</hi> on both sides, and stand ingaged on <hi>neither</hi> part of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For whilst these men behold the State of Religion thus miserably <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>divided,</hi> and the Professors of it <hi>crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> into so many <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> and each Party spitting <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> at its Adversary; so that if <hi>all</hi> say true, or indeed any <hi>two</hi> of them in <hi>five hundred</hi> Sects which there are in the World, (and for all I know there may be <hi>five thousand</hi>) it is <hi>five hundred</hi> to one but that every one is <hi>damn'd,</hi> because every <hi>one</hi> damns <hi>all</hi> but it self, and <hi>it self</hi> is damn'd by <hi>four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninty nine</hi>; so that 'tis a mighty Chance if in so great a Volly of <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes</hi> which <hi>every one</hi> hath levelled at it, <hi>any one</hi> escape: When, I say, unengaged persons that are not able to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>disputable Opinions</hi> that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute these Sects, and the <hi>Necessaries</hi> and <hi>Essentials</hi> of Religion, shall reflect upon this tumult and confusion of Faiths, they will be apt to conclude without farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that Religion it self is nothing but an infinite Maze of <hi>disputable Opinions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men wander about in the dark and <hi>justle</hi> and <hi>rancounter</hi> one another without any certain Clew on either side to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> their Inquiries; under which


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60130:86"/>
Misapprehension they will either damn <hi>all</hi> Religion for a <hi>Cheat,</hi> or <hi>hover</hi> about in eternal <hi>uncertainty,</hi> not knowing where in so great a Confusion of Religions to <hi>fix</hi> and <hi>settle</hi> their Faith. And hereunto I doubt not is to be attributed a great part of the <hi>Irreligion</hi> of this Age. For while some Men by running themselves out of Breath in pursuit of those <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> or <hi>New Lights,</hi> that have broken and divided our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, have at length quite tired out their Zeal and religious Pretences, and so are at length lain down in the Mire of <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi> and open <hi>Profaneness</hi>; others by looking on and beholding the wild <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> which these new Lights have made, have been tempted to <hi>run away</hi> from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self, as if that were only a <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> of uncertain Opinions contrived on purpose to <hi>distract</hi> and <hi>bewilder</hi> mens Brains.</p>
                  <p>NOW tho the Authors of these <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> whosoever they are, are doubtless highly accountable to God for all that Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion which attends them, yet for Men from hence to draw Atheistical Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is much more imputable to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness</hi> of their <hi>Wills</hi> than to the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their <hi>Vnderstandings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60130:87"/>FOR in the first place, What if you have discovered some Opinions ln Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erroneous,</hi> of the Truth of which you were once very <hi>confident</hi>; doth it therefore follow that there is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> certain in <hi>Religion</hi>? If so, you may as well conclude that there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> neither, since some men have been as confident of the Truth of false <hi>Axioms</hi> in <hi>Geometry</hi> as ever you could be of false <hi>Propositions</hi> in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> That you were once <hi>over-confident</hi> in a disputable Matter was your own <hi>Fault</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> but must it therefore follow that <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Cheat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>you</hi> have been rash and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate? and what tho you once laid the great <hi>stress</hi> of your Religion upon an Opinion which you <hi>now</hi> discern is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, must Religion needs suffer for <hi>your</hi> Mistake, and be branded for an <hi>Imposture</hi> because you took that for Religion which was <hi>not</hi>? For there are a thousand Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions about Religion, which have been Zealously disputed <hi>for</hi> and <hi>against,</hi> which have torn men into <hi>Sects,</hi> and been the Religion of the separate Communions they have <hi>formed</hi> and <hi>denominated,</hi> that yet are very remote <hi>Superstructures</hi> on the true <hi>Foundations</hi> of Religion, and may be <hi>true</hi>

or <hi>false, believed</hi> or <hi>disbelieved</hi> without any damage to Religion. And therefore before you suspect the <hi>Truth</hi> of Religion it self upon your discovering the <hi>Falshood</hi> of any <hi>particular Opinion,</hi> you ought in all Reason to consider whether that Opinion be so <hi>essential</hi> to Religion as that it cannot <hi>subsist</hi> without it; for if it be not, 'tis the most unreasonable thing in the World, to infer a suspicion of the Truth of <hi>Religion</hi> from the Falshood of <hi>Propositions</hi> that have <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no</hi> Dependence on it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the <hi>Gold</hi> and the <hi>precious Stones</hi> for the sake of the <hi>Wood,</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi> that have been superstructed upon them. And then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What can be more absurd than for Men to <hi>reject</hi> Religion because Mens <hi>Opinions</hi> about it have been so <hi>divided?</hi> For if you survey the several <hi>Divisions</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, you will find they generally <hi>concur</hi> in all the <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Doctrines of Religion, and that the Opinions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they <hi>divide,</hi> are for the most part such <hi>unnecessary</hi> Speculations, as that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>indifferent</hi> to Religion whether they be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false</hi>; And with what Reason can we suspect the Truth of <hi>necessary</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines wherein <hi>all</hi> are agreed, because there are Disagreements in <hi>unnecessary</hi> ones?


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60130:88"/>
Because there are some Propositions in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> about which the Opinions of the Mathematicians are <hi>divided,</hi> shall we therefore suspect the Truth of all those wherein they are <hi>agreed</hi>? For if their <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement</hi> be an Argument of the <hi>Falshood</hi> of the <hi>former,</hi> why should not their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi> be as good an Argument of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>later?</hi> But how much soever Mens Opinions about Religion may be <hi>divided,</hi> all that can be thence inferred is, that some Men are <hi>mistaken</hi>; and while some Men judge of Religion by their <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> and others by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> of their <hi>Education,</hi> it is impossible it should be otherwise. But for men in the midst of such apparent causes of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to resolve to be of <hi>no</hi> Religion till all are agreed in <hi>one,</hi> is just as <hi>wise,</hi> and as <hi>rational</hi> as if they should determine not to go to Dinner till all the Clocks in Town strike Eleven together.</p>

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60130:89"/>OF the Truth of which the Age we live in will furnish us with too many <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful</hi> Instances. For as this Nation which hath been always remarqued for a <hi>grave, serious</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Genius, was never so generally <hi>tainted</hi> with Atheism as now; so neither was it ever chargeable with such a general Neglect of the Publick Worship of God, which for several Ages after the Reformation, was duly <hi>frequented,</hi> and devoutly <hi>celebrated,</hi> till by the Prevalence of our <hi>restless</hi> Sects and Factions, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church was gradually <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and at last totally <hi>destroyed</hi>; in the happy Days before which the Families of each Parish went <hi>hand in hand</hi> together to the House of God, and with <hi>one</hi> Heart and Voice celebrated his Praise and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and to absent ones self <hi>ordinarily</hi> from the Publick Assemblies, was hardly consistent with the <hi>Reputation</hi> of being a Christian. By which means their natural <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Dread</hi> of the divine Powers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually <hi>awakened</hi> and <hi>revived,</hi> they were not only <hi>secured</hi> by it from all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical Impressions, but also <hi>animated</hi> and <hi>excited</hi> to a pious and sober Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. But the spirit of Schism <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> against the Power and Discipline of the Church, till it had uttterly <hi>disabled</hi> it


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60130:90"/>
from restraining the Wantonness of that <hi>crooked</hi> and <hi>perverse</hi> Generation; some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated themselves into <hi>separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions,</hi> and others under Pretence of so doing withdrew from the <hi>Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> to the common Resorts of <hi>Idleness, Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi>; and whilst the <hi>Masters</hi> took the Liberty of <hi>Conscience</hi> to go to <hi>Conventicles,</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be of a different Perswasion assumed the Liberty of <hi>Will</hi> to go to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi> and <hi>Ale-houses</hi>; insomuch that it grew a common Observation, that there have been more young People debauched on the <hi>Lords Day</hi> than all the <hi>Week after,</hi> whilst under pretence of <hi>joyning</hi> with a different Communion, they have taken occasion to <hi>withdraw</hi> themselves from the Inspection of their Parents and Masters.

And thus by degrees <hi>Profaneness</hi> hath insinuated it self under the Covert of <hi>Schism,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> became a common Sanctuary for the licentious <hi>Neglect</hi> and Contempt of Gods Worship,

till at last it grew so <hi>common</hi> and <hi>fashionable,</hi> that it almost ceast to be <hi>scandalous.</hi> Yea, so far at length hath this <hi>impious</hi> Humour prevailed, that to <hi>go to Church</hi> and be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> is among too many Men grown a Note of <hi>Disgrace,</hi> and the Character of a <hi>Priest-ridden</hi> fool; and a Man is hardly lookt upon as fit for <hi>genteel Conversation,</hi> that knows any other use of a Holy-day, but only to be at leisure to <hi>lie abed,</hi> or to <hi>Game</hi> or <hi>Drink</hi> and <hi>Debauch</hi>; by which Neglect and Contempt of the Worship of God, that natural Sense of him, which should have been <hi>quickned</hi> and <hi>cherished</hi> by it, hath been gradually <hi>worn out</hi> of Mens Minds; the Consequence of which is, all <hi>that</hi> Atheism and Infidelity that overspreads this present Age. For when once Men have <hi>renounced</hi> the Worship of God, and in Consequence are <hi>abandoned</hi> of their natural Sense of his Majesty, they are upon the brink of Atheism, into which their own <hi>vile</hi> Lusts, whose Interest it is that there <hi>should</hi> be no God, will easily <hi>precipitate</hi> them. But alas, how <hi>ridiculous</hi> as well as <hi>impious</hi> is it for Men to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from their own <hi>Neglect</hi> of Gods Worship, to renounce the <hi>Belief</hi> of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; what is this but to <hi>tail</hi> one folly to another, and to second <hi>Extravagance</hi> with

                     <hi>Madness</hi>? It would make one amazed to think that ever reasonable Beings should be so <hi>besotted,</hi> as to live in a World over which an Almighty Being <hi>presides,</hi> who sees all their Actions, and in whose Hands all events are which concen them, and even the <hi>everlasting</hi> Fate of their Souls; and yet take no more <hi>notice</hi> of him, pay no more <hi>Respect</hi> or <hi>Veneration</hi> to him, than if he were the merest <hi>trifle</hi> or most insignificant <hi>Cypher</hi> in the whole Creation.

And tho our <hi>Reason</hi> doth sometimes <hi>cook</hi> the Injoyments of our Sense, and give them a higher <hi>Relish</hi> and and <hi>Luxury,</hi> yet this advantage is very much out-weighed by the many <hi>Regrets,</hi> and <hi>Remorses,</hi> and <hi>stinging Reflections</hi> it intermingles with our Pleasures; So that had we only the Faculties of <hi>Brutes,</hi> I am verily perswaded we should more <hi>sincerely</hi> enjoy the Happiness of the <hi>brutal</hi> Nature; but to be sure we should bear our Miseries with much more <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Chearfulness.</hi> For supposing there <hi>is</hi> no God, our Reason can afford us no solid support under any Calamity; the main Arguments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as I shall shew by and by, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Consideration of <hi>God</hi> and

his <hi>Providence</hi>; which being taken away, I doubt not but we should bear our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>without</hi> our Reason much better than <hi>with</hi> it.

                  <p>So that were that <hi>true</hi> which the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist concludes for, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no <hi>God,</hi> it would follow that <hi>Reason</hi> in a Man serves to no other purpose, but to render him more <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>despicable.</hi> If there <hi>be</hi> a God indeed, our rational Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are of <hi>excellent</hi> Use; as having an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>commensurate</hi> to their widest Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and every way <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> them; an infinite <hi>Truth</hi> for our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> to dive into, and an infinite <hi>Good</hi> for our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to pursue and embrace. But if there be nothing to be enjoyed by us but what is


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60130:94"/>
                     <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Sensual,</hi> our Reason is so far from being our <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> that it is the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Disgrace</hi> of our Natures.</p>
                  <p>FOR for any Nature to have more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties than what are necessary to its Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, is <hi>monstrous</hi>; and therefore had we nothing to enjoy but the Happiness of <hi>Brutes,</hi> 'twould be a <hi>Deformity</hi> to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to have the Faculties of <hi>Angels</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these Faculties would be in <hi>vain,</hi> there being no <hi>adequate</hi> Object in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things to <hi>employ</hi> and <hi>entertain</hi> them. So that were the Doctrine of the Atheist <hi>true,</hi> it would cashier our Reason for a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>useless</hi> Faculty; a thing that serves our Nature to little other purpose, but only to <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>disquiet</hi> it. And what Man that hath any <hi>Regard</hi> or <hi>Reverence</hi> for himself, would ever be fond of a Belief that thus <hi>sinks</hi> and <hi>depreciates</hi> him, and lays the Glory of his Nature in the <hi>Dust</hi>? For if it be true that there <hi>is</hi> no God, it is as true that Man is a most <hi>despicable Creature,</hi> that his <hi>Reason</hi> upon which he so much values himself is a <hi>frivolous</hi> and <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> Faculty; a Faculty that can serve him to no higher purpose than only to be a <hi>Cook</hi> and a <hi>Taylor</hi> to his Body, to study <hi>Sauces</hi> and <hi>Fashions</hi> for it; and that while it <hi>serves</hi> him in <hi>this, disserves</hi> him in a

thousand <hi>other</hi> Instances, in mingling his Pleasures with <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi> with <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Impatiences, Anxieties</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morses,</hi> and in <hi>aggravating</hi> and <hi>putting Stings</hi> into his Griefs and Calamities. So that when all is done, the only thing that makes it <hi>worth the while</hi> for a Man to be <hi>reasonable,</hi> is, that there is a Being of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfection to be <hi>known,</hi> and <hi>loved,</hi> and <hi>imitated</hi> and <hi>adored</hi> by him; and to <hi>deny</hi> the Existence of this blessed Being, is infinitely to <hi>undervalue</hi> our selves, and to <hi>eclipse</hi> the Glory and Dignity of our Natures. So that by being partial to <hi>Atheism</hi> we are partial to our own <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,</hi> and industriously consult the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> and <hi>Infamy</hi> of Humane Nature; for the Devil himself cannot affix a blacker <hi>Scandal</hi> on our Reason than what is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Assertion, that there <hi>is</hi> no God.</p>
                  <p>AND as it lays the greatest <hi>Reproach</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Nature, so it also renders us the most <hi>Ridiculous</hi> of all Beings. For there are certain Affections interwoven with Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which if there be no God are shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>ridiculous</hi>; such as the <hi>Dread of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Powers,</hi> the <hi>Sense of Good and Evil,</hi> and the anxious Expectation of a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come</hi>; all which are so deeply <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid</hi> in our Beings, as that with all our


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60130:95"/>
Arts and Reasoning we cannat totally <hi>erase</hi> them. And even the Atheists themselves who have tried all possible ways of <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing</hi> them, have found by Experience that the <hi>utmost</hi> they can do is, to <hi>damp</hi> and <hi>stupifie</hi> them at present; but that in despight of them they will <hi>revive</hi> and <hi>awake</hi> again when <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Danger</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches them.

him, would be a great deal less <hi>ridiculous</hi> than <hi>timorous</hi> Man, whose Nature is thus <hi>hagg'd</hi> with <hi>frightful</hi> Imaginations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Powers and a Judgment to come.</p>
                  <p>AND what Man that hath any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the Humane Nature within him, would ever suffer himself to be <hi>bribed</hi> for an Opinion that doth not only <hi>undervalue</hi> but <hi>deride</hi> and <hi>Ridicule</hi> it. Should you hear your self branded with a <hi>contemptible</hi> Character, or ranked among <hi>Apes</hi> or any such <hi>ridiculous</hi> Animals, you would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less be so far from <hi>courting</hi> the Author of it, that you would <hi>resent</hi> it as a great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and think your selves obliged in honour to <hi>return</hi> the Provocation; and yet for the sake of a few base <hi>Lusts,</hi> which are the <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you espouse the Cause of Atheism, tho it <hi>derides</hi> and <hi>affronts</hi> you to your Face, and <hi>stains</hi> the Glory of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the most <hi>contemptible</hi> and <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> Character in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60130:96"/>
Corporation of Mankind, like the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a <hi>dead</hi> Body, must necessarily <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> and <hi>flye abroad</hi> into Atoms. For a <hi>form'd</hi> Society which is an <hi>united</hi> Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude consists in the <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of its Members mutually <hi>united</hi> by Laws and Agreements, and <hi>disposed</hi> into a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> Subordination to one another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which can any Humane Society long continue without the <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> of a God.</p>
                  <p>FOR without this in the first place, 'tis impossible that the Parts of any Society should continue <hi>united</hi> by Laws and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements. For 'tis from the Belief of a God, that all the <hi>Obligations</hi> of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are <hi>derived</hi>; so that take <hi>that</hi> away and <hi>these</hi> must dissolve; and when the Obligations of Conscience are <hi>dissolved,</hi> there is nothing but Mens <hi>temporal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests</hi> can oblige them to <hi>conform</hi> to those Laws and mutual Agreements, by which they are united to one another. And if it be their <hi>Interest</hi> only that obliges them to be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> to their mutual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they will be equally obliged to be <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>unfaithful,</hi> when ever it is their <hi>Interest</hi> to be so. So that this Principle which only obliges them to be <hi>honest</hi> while it is for their <hi>Advantage,</hi> will as effectually oblige


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60130:96"/>
them to be <hi>Knaves</hi> when ever the Case is <hi>altered</hi>; and things being reduced to this Issue, there remains no Foundation of <hi>Trust</hi> and mutual <hi>Confidence</hi> among Men. For what can any Mans <hi>Promise</hi> signifie, if he be under no Obligation but <hi>Interest?</hi> To be sure if it be <hi>for</hi> his Interest he will <hi>do</hi> what he <hi>says</hi> without any <hi>Promise</hi>; but if it be <hi>not,</hi> what Promise <hi>can</hi> oblige him? You will say it is his Interest to keep his <hi>Word,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise he will forfeit his <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the future? But pray what <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> can a Man have to <hi>forfeit,</hi> that owns no other <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Obligation</hi> but his Interest? or who will ever presume upon that Mans <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Engagement,</hi> whose <hi>avowed</hi> Principle it is to be honest no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he can <hi>gain</hi> by it? Thus Atheism you see, resolves all our <hi>Obligations</hi> into our worldly <hi>Interest,</hi> which is so <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>mutable</hi> a Principle, so dependent upon <hi>Chance</hi> and the <hi>Inconstancies</hi> of Fortune, that there is no hold to be taken of those that are governed by it. For that which is their Interest to <hi>Day</hi> may be their Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to <hi>Morrow,</hi> and if it should <hi>so</hi> happen, they must steer a <hi>contrary</hi> Course, or else act <hi>contrary</hi> to their leading Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that for Men to trust each other upon this <hi>fickle</hi> Principle, is all one as to


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60130:97"/>
relie upon the Constancy of a <hi>Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock,</hi> which every contrary Wind turns to a contrary Position. And things being once reduced to <hi>this</hi> Issue, that Men can place no <hi>Trust</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> in one another, their Society will soon become their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> For <hi>every Man</hi> will be forced to stand upon his Guard against <hi>every Man,</hi> and keep himself <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> and <hi>retired</hi> within himself; till at last out of mutual <hi>Distrust</hi> and <hi>Jealousie</hi> of one another, they are forced to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi> their Society, and to <hi>live apart</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Dens for fear of being <hi>intrapt</hi> and <hi>devoured</hi> by each other.</p>
                  <p>AND as <hi>Atheism</hi> cuts in sunder those <hi>Ligaments</hi> of mutual <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Agreement,</hi> by which the Parts of Humane Society are united; so it also <hi>dissolves</hi> that Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Subordination</hi> that is between them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes in his Treatise against <hi>Colot,</hi>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60130:97"/>
if there <hi>be</hi> no God, what should oblige any to <hi>own</hi> any <hi>Superiour,</hi> or <hi>pay</hi> any <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>? And if his <hi>Interest</hi> be his only <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> to his Superiours, when ever he can mend his Fortune by <hi>Rebelling</hi> against them, that very same Interest which at present <hi>restrains</hi> him from it, will with equal force <hi>invite</hi> him to it; nor will it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing that we are obliged to the contrary by <hi>Oaths</hi> of Fidelity and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for if it <hi>be</hi> our Interest to be faithful to the Government, our own Prudence and Discretion will oblige us to it <hi>without</hi> such Oaths as well as <hi>with</hi> them; but if it be <hi>not</hi> our Interest, and this be the only Principle that obliges us, no <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> can hold us. So that in this State of things all the Security that Governors can have of their Subjects, is, that they <hi>will</hi> not Rebel when they are <hi>not able</hi>; but as soon as they think it <hi>safe,</hi> to be sure they will think it <hi>lawful</hi>; which being once admitted will <hi>undermine</hi> the very Foundations of Government, and utterly dissolve that <hi>regular Subordination</hi> by which Humane Society is <hi>supported.</hi> Whereas admitting that the Laws of our <hi>Prince</hi> are bound upon us by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Lord, who can render us eternally <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miserable,</hi> we are

For if once we take away <hi>mutual Trust</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> from the <hi>World, both</hi> which have a necessary <hi>Dependence</hi> on the Belief of a God, we break all the <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> and convert it into a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Canibals.</hi> And what Man in his Wits would ever be found of an Opinion that proclaims <hi>open War</hi> with Mankind, and is pregnant with Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents so <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>destructive</hi> to the World?

our Miseries by our Impatience and Despair, and to <hi>pall</hi> our Enjoyments by expecting more from them than their Natures will afford; considering these things, I say, which way can we turn our selves without a <hi>God?</hi> or where can we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> our restless Thoughts but in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</hi> Verily, could I be <hi>tempted</hi> to believe that there is <hi>no</hi> God, I should look upon <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in its present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as the most <hi>forlorn</hi> and <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi> part of the Creation, and wish that I had had the Luck to be of any <hi>other</hi> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than that of a <hi>Rational Animal.</hi> For in the State I am I find my self liable to a thousand Dangers <hi>against</hi> which I have no <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and <hi>under</hi> which I have no <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> if there be <hi>no</hi> God to govern the World; and having such a dismal Prospect of things <hi>before</hi> me, and a busie Mind <hi>within</hi> me that will be continually <hi>working on</hi> and <hi>aggravating</hi> the Evils of it, what can I do with my self, or how can I enjoy my self without a <hi>God</hi> to <hi>relie</hi> on?

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60130:99"/>
will either <hi>prevent</hi> the Evils I apprehend, or <hi>support</hi> me under them, or <hi>convert</hi> them to my <hi>good,</hi> either of which is sufficient to set my <hi>Heart at ease,</hi> and instate me in a <hi>quiet</hi> Enjoyment of my self. But now by <hi>giving up</hi> the Belief of a God, I <hi>throw away</hi> all these Considerations, and leave my self utterly <hi>destitute</hi> and <hi>supportless.</hi> For what solid ground of <hi>Support</hi> can I have when I have no manner of <hi>Security</hi> either that the Evils I <hi>dread</hi> shall be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,</hi> or that I shall have a Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Strength</hi> to <hi>bear</hi> them, or that I shall ever reap any <hi>good</hi> or <hi>advantage</hi> from them; without <hi>which</hi> Considerations every Evil that <hi>threatens</hi> or <hi>befals</hi> me is <hi>pure unmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled</hi> Misery, against which there is no <hi>Fence</hi> or <hi>Cordial</hi> in <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Philosophy.</hi> For suppose I should argue with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Moralists, that every ill Accident that befalls me is <hi>fatal,</hi> as being the Effect of some <hi>necessary Cause</hi> that is without my <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Disposal,</hi> and therefore 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for me to <hi>grieve</hi> at it; this will be so far from any way <hi>mollifying</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of my Mind, that 'twill rather <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> and <hi>inflame</hi> it.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60130:100"/>
I should reason as the same Moralists otherwhiles do, Why should I <hi>grieve</hi> at the Evils that befal me, when alas! my <hi>Grief</hi> will be so far from <hi>lessening</hi> them that 'twill rather <hi>encrease</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> them, contribute new <hi>Venome</hi> to their <hi>Stings,</hi> and render them more <hi>pungent</hi> and <hi>dolorous</hi>; What a <hi>faint</hi> Cordial would it be to my <hi>oppressed</hi> Mind, to consider that my Grief will but <hi>augment</hi> my <hi>Load?</hi> It is some <hi>Ease</hi> to a dejected Soul to <hi>vent</hi> its Griefs in <hi>Moans</hi> and <hi>Lamentations,</hi> which while she seeks to <hi>smother</hi> in a <hi>sullen silence</hi> like imprisoned Wind will breed a <hi>Collick</hi> in her Bowels; and is it not a sad thing that I must deny my self the <hi>only</hi> Solace of a <hi>miserable</hi> Man, for fear of <hi>augmenting</hi> my Misery? Again, suppose I should reason thus with the same Authors, that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are <hi>indifferent</hi> things, and in themselves neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently <hi>improvable</hi> into <hi>Mischiefs</hi> or <hi>Benefits</hi>; this I confess were a <hi>good</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument supposing that the Affliction came from a <hi>good God,</hi> who can <hi>extract</hi> Good out of all our Evils, and render the <hi>rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Poyson <hi>Medicinal</hi>; but otherwise you will find 'tis but a <hi>cold</hi> Comfort to call your <hi>Misery</hi> by <hi>another</hi> Name; For if there be no God to <hi>temper</hi> our Evils, and


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60130:100"/>
to <hi>ordain</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them to <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Ends, we shall find in the issue they will prove themselves <hi>Evils</hi> to us by what <hi>soft</hi> Name soever we may <hi>call</hi> them. Again, and to name no more, Suppose I should reason thus, as these Masters of Morality do, that to bear Afflictions with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned Mind is <hi>brave,</hi> and <hi>manly,</hi> and <hi>generous</hi>; that it is an Argument of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> Mind, that hath raised it self above the <hi>reach</hi> of Misfortunes; I readily <hi>confess</hi> so it is, supposing a Man hath <hi>good reason</hi> thus to bear his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is the <hi>Question</hi> in debate; for then it is the Triumph of <hi>Reason</hi> over <hi>Passion,</hi> and an <hi>illustrious</hi> Instance of a <hi>well fortified</hi> Mind; but if we have <hi>no</hi> reason for it, all these glorious Words, <hi>Generous, Brave,</hi> &amp;c. are nothing but <hi>empty</hi> Flash and <hi>mere</hi> Rodomontado. For for a Man to be <hi>unconcerned</hi> with Evils <hi>without</hi> reason, is so far from being generous and brave, that 'tis an Argument of his brutal <hi>Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> and <hi>Fool-hardiness.</hi> But yet supposing that there is no <hi>God, these</hi> are the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments we have to <hi>support</hi> our selves under any Calamity. But alas, such <hi>real</hi> Griefs of ours are not to be redress'd with <hi>pretty</hi> Sayings and <hi>grave</hi> Sentences, which tho they may look takingly at a <hi>Distance,</hi>


                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:60130:101"/>

For in this state of things we are compassed about with <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> and which without God is our <hi>greatest</hi> Misfortune, we have a thing called <hi>Reason</hi> within our Breast, which is very <hi>ingenious</hi> in giving <hi>Stings</hi> to our <hi>Miseries,</hi> and <hi>vexing</hi> us with <hi>cutting</hi> Reflections on them, but is not able to <hi>qualifie</hi> one Grief, or minister one dram of <hi>solid Comfort</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>BUT when we lift up our Eyes to <hi>God,</hi> there are such <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>innumerable</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts flowing down to us from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> as are sufficient not only to <hi>allay</hi> our <hi>Sorrows,</hi> but to <hi>convert</hi> them into <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</hi> For in him we behold not only an infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> that always <hi>knows</hi> what is best for us, but also an infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> that always <hi>wills</hi> what it knows to be so, and an infinite <hi>Power</hi> that always <hi>does</hi> what it wills; and whilst we <hi>see</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi> this, there is nothing in the World

neither a <hi>God</hi> nor a <hi>future World</hi> to reward you, would it not be <hi>egregious</hi> Folly in you thus to throw away <hi>present</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for <hi>future</hi> Nothings?

So that as a great Divine of our own hath well observed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very Argument, after all that can be said <hi>against</hi> a thing this will <hi>still</hi> be <hi>true,</hi> that many things possibly <hi>are</hi> which we know <hi>not</hi> of, and that many things more <hi>may</hi> be than <hi>are.</hi> For unless our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing were <hi>extended</hi> to the whole <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass</hi> of Nature, there may be, for all we know, ten thousand things in <hi>Nature</hi> which are not in our <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> So that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>pure Negatives</hi> we can never be <hi>certain,</hi> unless the things which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be absolutely <hi>impossible,</hi> and imply, in the very <hi>Notion</hi> of their <hi>Existence,</hi> a <hi>plain Contradiction</hi>; which cannot be said of the Existence of <hi>God.</hi> For by God we mean nothing but a Being endowed with all <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Perfections</hi>; and to say that it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> that there should be any such Being as is endowed with all the Perfections that 'tis <hi>possible</hi> for a Being to be indowed with, is to assert <hi>Possibilities impossible,</hi> which is a Contradiction <hi>in Terms.</hi> Since therefore

a Spirit that were as <hi>wise,</hi> and as <hi>good,</hi> and as <hi>powerful</hi> as <hi>he</hi> whom we call <hi>God</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be; supposing, I say, there <hi>were</hi> such a Spirit <hi>actually</hi> existing, we could not have <hi>greater</hi> Evidence of it than we have <hi>already</hi> that he <hi>actually exists.</hi> For we could not <hi>see</hi> him with our Eyes, because we suppose him to be a <hi>Spirit,</hi> we could not <hi>demonstrate</hi> his Existence <hi>à priori</hi> or from any Cause, because being the first Cause he must be <hi>un caused</hi> or <hi>Self-Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</hi> It remains therefore that the only Demonstration we could give of his Being, is that which we call <hi>à posteriori</hi> or from such <hi>sensible Effects</hi> as can only be ascribed to the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of such a Being; and of such Effects as <hi>these</hi> we have <hi>infinite</hi> Instances before us. For in sum, we have all this <hi>visible World</hi> about us, whose <hi>changeable</hi> Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates it to be the Effect of <hi>some</hi> supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Cause, and whose unspeakable <hi>Vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> argues it to be the Effect of some most <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> Cause. For as to the first, whatsoever is <hi>changeable</hi> cannot <hi>self-exist,</hi> but must necessarily proceed from some <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Cause</hi>; because whatsoever <hi>Self-exists</hi> is <hi>necessarily,</hi> and whatsoever is necessarily is <hi>always the same</hi>; that which is <hi>without</hi>


                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:60130:108"/>
any Cause cannot <hi>but</hi> be, and that which is <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus</hi> without any Cause, cannot but be <hi>so</hi> or <hi>so</hi> for ever; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if the World were <hi>of it self</hi> without any Cause, it would not only <hi>be</hi> necessarily, but also <hi>be such as it is</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and unchangeably; but contrariwise we plainly perceive that it runs a <hi>perpetual</hi> Course of <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Alteration,</hi> that its Parts are continually <hi>altering</hi> their Figure, and <hi>shifting</hi> their Places with one another, whereas if this <hi>Part</hi> were of it self neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, as it must be if the <hi>Whole</hi> be so, it would necessarily be <hi>where</hi> it is and <hi>what</hi> it is eternally.</p>
                  <p>AND since the <hi>Mutability</hi> of this World argues it to be the Effect of <hi>some</hi> superior Cause, I would fain know whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the <hi>Vastness,</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> of it, it be not most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attribute it to such an <hi>all-good, all-wise,</hi> and <hi>Almighty</hi> Cause as we suppose <hi>God</hi> to be. For what less than an <hi>infinite Power</hi> can bear a due Proportion to such a <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>immense</hi> World? Should you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>magnificent</hi> Palace, and find no Creature in it, but a company of <hi>Mice</hi> or <hi>Weasels,</hi> could you possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that these <hi>impotent</hi> Vermin <hi>built</hi> it? And yet the building of the most Royal


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60130:109"/>
Palace doth not so much <hi>exceed</hi> the Power of these <hi>weak</hi> Animals, as the building of <hi>this World</hi> doth the Power of <hi>any</hi> Cause but a <hi>God.</hi> But then if we consider the infinite <hi>Number</hi> of Beings in the World that are <hi>capable</hi> of Happiness, and the <hi>vast</hi> Provisions that are made to <hi>entertain</hi> them according to their <hi>several</hi> Capacities, we cannot but thence conclude that the <hi>Power</hi> which made them was <hi>acted</hi> by an <hi>infinite Goodness.</hi> Lastly, if we consider the <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>admirable</hi> Contrivance of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Parts</hi> of the World; how <hi>perfect</hi> each one is in <hi>its Kind,</hi> how exactly <hi>fitted</hi> to each other, and what a lovely <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> they all make in the <hi>whole,</hi> how can we otherwise imagine but that that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> which caused it was <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected</hi> by an <hi>infinite Wisdom</hi>? So that the World is <hi>such</hi> an Effect as openly <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims</hi> its Cause to be a <hi>God</hi>; and if <hi>this</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Gods Existence will not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> Men, they are <hi>impregnably</hi> fortified against <hi>all</hi> Conviction; and if God should carry them into those <hi>infinite Spaces</hi> that are <hi>beyond</hi> the Limits of this World, and <hi>there</hi> command a <hi>New</hi> One into Being, while <hi>they</hi> stood <hi>looking on,</hi> and <hi>saw</hi> it springing out of nothing, they might with as good reason conclude <hi>that</hi> World to be


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60130:109"/>
nothing but a <hi>fortuitous</hi> Concourse of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible</hi> Parts of Matter, as they now do that <hi>this</hi> is so. So that in fine, he that <hi>denies</hi> God after all these <hi>Demonstrations</hi> which he hath given of himself, is out of the <hi>reach</hi> of Argument, and if he <hi>pursue</hi> his own <hi>Principles,</hi> can <hi>never</hi> be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any <hi>possible</hi> Reasons. And what a desperate Folly is it for Men to embrace a Belief, which should they be <hi>mistaken</hi> draws after it <hi>everlasting Ruin,</hi> when they have all the Reasons to the <hi>contrary</hi> that the Matter is <hi>capable</hi> of? What is this but to <hi>shut</hi> their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and cast themselves <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> on their own <hi>Destruction,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to <hi>wink hard</hi> and believe <hi>against</hi> all possible Reasons, that so they may ruin themselves without any <hi>Interruption</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. and Lastly, THE Atheist plainly <hi>contradicts</hi> himself in his <hi>own Conclusion.</hi> For by denying that God is, he necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies the <hi>Possibility</hi> of his Being. For if he be <hi>not,</hi> it is impossible he should <hi>ever</hi> be; because <hi>Eternity</hi> of Being is included in the <hi>Notion</hi> of him. For when we speak of <hi>God,</hi> we mean by him a Being that is <hi>before</hi> all Causes, and the <hi>Cause</hi> of all Causes, and that therefore <hi>oweth</hi> not his Being to any <hi>prior</hi> Cause, but doth <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, independently,</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> exist.


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60130:110"/>
So that if he be not <hi>now,</hi> he cannot be <hi>at all,</hi> because he must <hi>begin</hi> to be, which is contradictory to the very essential <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of him. For if he should ever <hi>begin</hi> to be, he cannot be <hi>Eternal,</hi> and if he be not <hi>Eternal</hi> he cannot be <hi>God.</hi> So that to say God is <hi>not,</hi> is by necessary Consequence to say he <hi>cannot</hi> be at all; and yet by a God we mean at the same time <hi>a Being that is endowed with all the possible Perfections that a Being is capable of.</hi> Wherefore as by saying that God is <hi>not,</hi> we do by Consequence assert that it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> he should <hi>ever</hi> be, so by asserting that it is <hi>impossible</hi> he should <hi>ever</hi> be, we do in effect assert this gross Contradiction; that it is impossible <hi>such</hi> a Being should ever <hi>be</hi> as includes all the <hi>Perfections</hi> that are <hi>possible</hi> to a Being. Thus in the same Breath we pronounce that God <hi>can</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> be, that 'tis <hi>possible</hi> he <hi>is,</hi> and yet <hi>impossible</hi> he <hi>should</hi> ever <hi>be.</hi> For by saying that he is a Being endowed with all the <hi>possible</hi> Perfections of Being, we expresly affirm that it is possible he <hi>may</hi> be; but by saying that there is <hi>no</hi> such Being <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> existing, we do as expresly assert that it is <hi>impossible</hi> he should <hi>ever</hi> be. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who asserts that God is <hi>not,</hi> doth by necessary Consequence assert this <hi>express</hi>


                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:60130:110"/>
Contradiction, <hi>that it is impossible there should ever be a Being as perfect as it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> And when if there <hi>be</hi> a God, Mens eternal Fate depends but upon <hi>believing</hi> that he <hi>is</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> accordingly, what a monstrous Folly is it for Men to <hi>contradict</hi> themselves to <hi>deny</hi> him; what is this but to <hi>stake</hi> their Souls upon it, that the very <hi>first Principle</hi> of reasoning is <hi>false,</hi> and put their Fate upon this <hi>desperate</hi> Issue, that unless <hi>both</hi> Parts of a <hi>Contradiction</hi> prove <hi>true,</hi> they must <hi>inevitably</hi> perish for ever?</p>
                  <p>And now having shewn you from what <hi>malignant</hi> Causes Atheism springs, and how desperately <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> it is in it self, let us all endeavour by the <hi>serious</hi> Consideration of what hath been said, to <hi>fortifie</hi> our Minds against it. And since this Proposition that <hi>God is,</hi> is the prime Foundation of <hi>all</hi> Religion, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all to use our utmost Diligence to <hi>establish</hi> our Minds in the <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast</hi> Belief of it; and <hi>this</hi> we cannot fail to <hi>do,</hi> if we heartily <hi>endeavour</hi> it. For the Arguments of Gods Being do shine all round about us with such a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>convincing</hi> Light, that we need do no more than just <hi>open</hi> our <hi>Eyes</hi> to it, and <hi>dispel</hi> those mischievous Causes from our <hi>Wills,</hi> that <hi>hide</hi> and <hi>obscure</hi> it from our <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</hi>


                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60130:111"/>
And when once we have throughly <hi>setled</hi> the <hi>Belief</hi> of Gods Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our <hi>Minds,</hi> it will mightily <hi>influence</hi> all our Powers of <hi>Action</hi>; it will <hi>invite</hi> our Hope, and <hi>alarm</hi> our Fear, and <hi>Address</hi> to every Passion in us that is capable of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,</hi> and be an <hi>everliving</hi> Spring of Religion within us; for God is an Object so infinitely <hi>Great</hi> in <hi>himself,</hi> and of such infinite <hi>Moment</hi> and <hi>Concernment</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> that 'tis next to <hi>impossible</hi> we should <hi>firmly</hi> believe that he <hi>is,</hi> without being <hi>vigorously</hi> impress'd with <hi>religious</hi> Affections upon the Consideration of his <hi>Being.</hi>

               <p>THE main <hi>Influence</hi> which the <hi>Belief</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> hath upon the Minds of Men, proceeds immediately from the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of his <hi>Providence,</hi> without <hi>which</hi> we

are no way <hi>concerned</hi> or <hi>Interested</hi> in him. For a <hi>God</hi> without a <hi>Providence</hi> is a <hi>solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> kind of Being that lives <hi>alone</hi> from the World, altogether <hi>retired</hi> within himself, and never <hi>looks abroad</hi> or any ways <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddles</hi> with any thing <hi>without</hi>; and what have <hi>we</hi> to do with a <hi>Being</hi> that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with <hi>us</hi> or our <hi>Affairs,</hi> but lives <hi>apart</hi> from us in some <hi>unaccessible</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, where neither <hi>we</hi> can go to <hi>him</hi> nor <hi>he</hi> come to <hi>us</hi>? So that it is by his <hi>Providence</hi> that all <hi>Correspondence</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse</hi> between God and his Creatures is <hi>maintained</hi>; which being taken away, <hi>he</hi> is as nothing to <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are as nothing to <hi>him.</hi> For what doth it signifie to <hi>us</hi> that there is a certain <hi>excellent</hi> Being, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>God,</hi> sitting on the Top of the Heavens with his Arms <hi>folded</hi> in his Bosom, and who doth nothing there but <hi>enjoy</hi> himself in a <hi>quiet</hi> Contemplation of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, without regarding any thing <hi>without</hi> him, or doing either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>hurt</hi> to the World?

move us to <hi>love</hi> a God that bestows no <hi>Good,</hi> or to <hi>fear</hi> a God that inflicts no <hi>Evil,</hi> or to <hi>obey</hi> a God that hath no Regard of our <hi>Actions</hi>? Why should we <hi>thank</hi> him if we <hi>receive</hi> nothing from him? For what should we <hi>praise</hi> him if he be no ways <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial</hi> to the World?

All which <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of the Deity without a <hi>Providence</hi> are utterly <hi>void</hi> and <hi>useless.</hi> For his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is the great <hi>Sphere of Activity</hi> wherein he <hi>exercises</hi> and <hi>displays</hi> his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, wherein his Power <hi>executes</hi> the Contrivances of his Wisdom, and his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>contrives</hi> the Methods of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so that without his <hi>Providence</hi> all his <hi>Perfections</hi> will signifie <hi>nothing.</hi> For what doth that Wisdom signifie that <hi>contrives</hi> nothing?

and <hi>Adorable,</hi> what Reason can move us to <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> him?

                  <p n="1">I. To oblige us to be <hi>truly religious,</hi> it is necessary we should believe that God continually <hi>upholds</hi> and <hi>conserves</hi> all things. That he alone is the great <hi>Atlas</hi> on whose almighty Shoulders the whole Frame of things <hi>depends.</hi> For tho the works of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art</hi> do often stand many Ages after the Workmans Hand is <hi>withdrawn</hi> from them, yet the reason is because there is <hi>Something</hi> between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>Nothing, viz,</hi> the <hi>pre-existing Matter</hi> of which they are formed; whereas the Works of God being all produced out of <hi>Nothing,</hi> have nothing between them, but that <hi>creative Power</hi> which produced them. And therefore as <hi>Mans</hi> Works would necessarily perish were


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60130:113"/>
that <hi>pre-existing Matter</hi> taken away, which stands between <hi>them</hi> and Nothing, so <hi>Gods</hi> Works would necessarily resolve into nothing, should that <hi>creative Power</hi> be withdrawn which stands between <hi>them</hi> and nothing. In short <hi>pre-existing Matter</hi> is the Basis of <hi>our</hi> Works, and <hi>creative Power</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi>; and therefore as <hi>our</hi> Works must cease to be were their <hi>pre-existing Matter</hi> withdrawn, so <hi>Gods</hi> Works must cease to be were his <hi>creative Power</hi> withdrawn. So that 'tis the same almighty Power which <hi>raised</hi> the World <hi>out</hi> of Nothing that keeps it from <hi>sinking into</hi> nothing; and that it <hi>is</hi> this Moment is as much the Effect of divine Power, as that it <hi>was</hi> that Moment when it was first created. For the World was no more able to give it self the <hi>second</hi> Moment of Being than it was the <hi>first,</hi> nor the <hi>third</hi> than the <hi>second,</hi> and so on through all the <hi>past</hi> and <hi>future</hi> Moments of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For <hi>one</hi> Moment of Being is as much as <hi>another,</hi> and therefore to give a <hi>second</hi> requires the same Power as to give a <hi>first</hi>; and if so, then each <hi>succeeding</hi> Moment of the Worlds <hi>Duration</hi> and <hi>Continuance,</hi> must be derived from the Cause of the <hi>first</hi> Moment of its <hi>Being.</hi> So that the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Conservation</hi> of the World, is only the <hi>same</hi> Act <hi>continuing</hi> and <hi>flowing</hi> on

                     <hi>owe</hi> not our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Beings</hi> to his Power, what right hath he to <hi>exact</hi> our <hi>Obedience?</hi> But while we look upon our selves as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that <hi>hang</hi> upon him, and <hi>derive</hi> every Breath and Moment of our Beings from him, so that should he <hi>withdraw</hi> from us that almighty Arm that <hi>susteins</hi> us, and leave us to <hi>subsist</hi> of <hi>our selves,</hi> we must presently <hi>drop</hi> into nothing, how can we forbear without infinite <hi>Stupidity</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> to devote <hi>our selves</hi> and all our <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> to his Service?

                  <p n="2">II. IT is also necessary we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God <hi>possesses</hi> all things; that he hath not <hi>given away</hi> this World from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and cast it out of his own <hi>Disposal</hi> as a common <hi>Scramble</hi> among Men; but that he hath <hi>reserved</hi> to himself an <hi>absolute, unalienable</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> Propriety in all that we <hi>enjoy</hi> and <hi>possess.</hi> For all things


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60130:115"/>
                     <hi>owe</hi> their Being to <hi>him</hi> as he is the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Vpholder</hi> of them; and therefore whatsoever <hi>is</hi> must necessarily be <hi>his,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it <hi>is</hi> by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> And if <hi>we</hi> who act by the Power of <hi>God</hi> and can do nothing <hi>without</hi> him, may claim a Right to the Effects of our <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> how much more may God who <hi>contrived</hi> and <hi>produced</hi> all things by his own <hi>independent</hi> Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? For <hi>our</hi> Wisdom and Power being <hi>Gods,</hi> he hath a <hi>Sovereign Right</hi> to all the <hi>Effects</hi> of them; but <hi>his</hi> Wisdom and Power are absolutely <hi>his own</hi> without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on any <hi>superior Cause</hi>; and therefore whatsoever are the Effects of <hi>them</hi> must necessarily be <hi>his</hi> by a most <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> Propriety. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he is stiled <hi>the possessor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth,</hi> Gen. 14.19. and <hi>Moses</hi> tells his People, <hi>behold the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens is the Lords, the Earth also and all that is therein,</hi> Deut. 10.14. and <hi>the Earth</hi> saith the Psalmist <hi>is the Lords and the fulness thereof, the World and they that dwell therein; for he hath founded it upon the Sea and prepared it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Floods,</hi> Psal. 24.1. and 50.12. <hi>and the Heavens</hi> saith he again <hi>are thine, the Earth also is thine; as for the World and


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60130:115"/>
the fulness thereof thou hast founded them,</hi> Psal. 89.11.</p>
                  <p>GOD therefore being the <hi>Supreme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor</hi> of the World, there is nothing can be justly <hi>ours</hi> but by <hi>his</hi> Will and Grant; and nothing can be ours by <hi>his Will,</hi> but what is <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>justly</hi> ours. So that for us to <hi>seise</hi> upon any Part of the World by <hi>Fraud,</hi> or <hi>Violence,</hi> or <hi>Oppression,</hi> is to <hi>trespass</hi> upon God and <hi>invade</hi> his Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to <hi>tear</hi> his <hi>World</hi> from him <hi>against</hi> his Will. Thus whatsoever we possess by <hi>Wrong,</hi> we possess as <hi>Robbers</hi> and <hi>Invaders</hi> of God, and whatsoever we enjoy by <hi>Right,</hi> we enjoy as <hi>Tenants</hi> to the great <hi>Landlord</hi> of the World; and without <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging</hi> this we cannot be <hi>truly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi> For if the World be not <hi>his,</hi> why should we <hi>pray</hi> to him for what we <hi>want</hi> of it, or <hi>praise</hi> him for what we <hi>enjoy?</hi> Why should we patiently <hi>submit</hi> to his Disposal when he <hi>deprives</hi> us of what we <hi>have?</hi> Or thankfully <hi>acknowledg</hi> his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness when he <hi>supplies</hi> us with what we <hi>need?</hi> Why should we employ our <hi>Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in <hi>his</hi> Service, or think our selves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>return</hi> him any Part of them in <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> or <hi>charitable</hi> Works? In a word, why should we be <hi>contented</hi> with a <hi>small</hi> share, and abide by that <hi>unequal</hi> Division of things

that is made in the World, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>increase</hi> our own poor Heap by <hi>pilfering</hi> from other Mens that are ten times bigger than ours? Whence are <hi>these</hi> Obligations but from this <hi>Supposal,</hi> that God is the supreme <hi>Proprietor</hi> and <hi>Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> of all things; which being denied there remains no <hi>solid</hi> Foundation of Reason for any of these <hi>great</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Duties of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To oblige us to be truly <hi>religious</hi> it is also necessary we should believe that God is <hi>present</hi> with and <hi>inspects</hi> all things; that his divine Substance is <hi>diffused</hi> through and <hi>circumfused</hi> about all things, so as to <hi>penetrate</hi> them <hi>within</hi> as an universal <hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>contain</hi> them <hi>without</hi> as an universal <hi>Place.</hi> For so the Jewish Doctors are wont to call God <hi>Hamakom,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Continent</hi> of all things; because all things are <hi>incompassed</hi> by him, and do live and move <hi>within</hi> his infinite Bosom. For so in Scripture the divine Substance is described, as spreading it self <hi>through</hi> and <hi>a round</hi> the World, even to the utmost <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of <hi>Extension. Whither</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>shall I go from thy Spirit, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there, if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there;


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60130:116"/>
if I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost Parts of the Sea, even there shall thy Hand lead me and thy right Hand shall hold me,</hi> Psal. 139.7, 8, 9, 10. And <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee,</hi> 1 Kings 8.27. yea <hi>do not I fill Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord himself,</hi> Jer. 23.24.</p>
                  <p>NOW tho Gods <hi>Omnipresence</hi> be <hi>strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> an Attribute of his <hi>Essence,</hi> and not a part of his <hi>Providence,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>such</hi> an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as <hi>includes</hi> his <hi>universal Providence,</hi> and without supposing of which an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Providence can <hi>hardly</hi> be conceived. For if he <hi>co-exists</hi> and be <hi>present with</hi> all things, he must be supposed to <hi>operate</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; because where ever <hi>he</hi> is, his infinite Wisdom and Power and Goodness <hi>are</hi>; which in their own Nature are such <hi>active</hi> Perfections as cannot be present where such a world of things are to be done, and <hi>sit still</hi> and <hi>do nothing.</hi> For how can we conceive that infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> should be present where a world of things are to be <hi>ordered,</hi> and yet <hi>order</hi> nothing? That infinite <hi>Power</hi> should be present where a world of things are to be <hi>done,</hi> and yet <hi>do</hi> nothing? Or that infinite <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> should be present where a world of <hi>good</hi> is to be done, and do <hi>no good</hi> at all?


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60130:117"/>
Such an <hi>idle, restive</hi> Presence as this, is utterly inconsistent with such <hi>active</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. So that the <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of an infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> necessarily supposes an <hi>universal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> such an Omnipresence an universal Providence can hardly be conceived. For how can God be present by any <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Efficacy</hi> of his Nature, in any Place from whence the real <hi>Substance</hi> of his <hi>Divinity</hi> is excluded? How can he operate by his own immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Efficiency</hi> where he is <hi>not?</hi> Or extend his divine <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> over all things, except his divine <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> in which these Attributes <hi>are,</hi> be <hi>co-extended</hi> with them. Every Agent must <hi>be</hi> where it <hi>acts,</hi> because it <hi>acts</hi> from its <hi>Being,</hi> and it is as possible for that which is <hi>not</hi> to <hi>operate,</hi> as for that which <hi>is</hi> to operate where it is <hi>not</hi>; and hence <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> being asked how it was possible for <hi>one</hi> God to order <hi>all</hi> the Affairs of the World? returns this Answer, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> God is so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>vast</hi> a Being, as that he <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>sees</hi> all things <hi>together,</hi> and is present <hi>every where,</hi> and takes care of all things at the <hi>same time.</hi>


                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:60130:117"/>
Thus Gods <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> you see, doth <hi>so</hi> include his <hi>universal Providence</hi> that <hi>with</hi> it 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>without</hi> it <hi>inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND then from his Presence <hi>with</hi> all things, necessarily follows his Inspection <hi>of</hi> all things; because where ever <hi>he</hi> is, his <hi>infinite Knowledg</hi> is, which is <hi>inseparable</hi> from his Being; and were ever his infinite Knowledge <hi>is,</hi> it must necessarily have a <hi>through</hi> Prospect of all things round about him, so that nothing can be <hi>concealed</hi> from its <hi>Inspection.</hi> For so the Scripture assures us that <hi>the Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. and that <hi>the Eyes of the Lord are in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place beholding the evil and good, Prov.</hi> 15.3. and in a word, that <hi>all things are open and naked to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do, Heb.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>BOTH which are Truths of <hi>vast</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to <hi>Religion.</hi> For while Men look upon God as a Being that dwells at a <hi>great Distance</hi> from them, they will be ready enough to conclude <hi>Procul à Jove procul à Fulmine,</hi> that being <hi>far off</hi> from him, they are out of his <hi>reach,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of his <hi>Thunderbolts</hi>; and that he is too far <hi>removed</hi> from them either to <hi>succour</hi> them when they <hi>want</hi> his <hi>Aid,</hi> or to <hi>punish</hi>


                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:60130:118"/>
them when they <hi>deserve</hi> his <hi>Displeasure</hi>; which must needs extinguish both their <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> which are the Master-Springs of their Religion. And tho we should believe him to be <hi>present</hi> with us, yet unless we also believe that he hath a <hi>full Inspection</hi> into all our <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi> we shall have no Regard to him. For if he <hi>sees</hi> not into our Affairs, how can he <hi>succour</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> us? And if he cannot relieve us, to what end should we <hi>hope</hi> in him, <hi>depend</hi> upon him, or <hi>pray</hi> to him? And unless he hath a <hi>perfect</hi> Insight into all our Actions, how should he <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>punish</hi> us; and if he cannot <hi>reward</hi> us what should <hi>encourage,</hi> if he cannot <hi>punish</hi> us, what should <hi>terrifie</hi> us to our Duty to him? But if we look upon him as a Being that is always <hi>with us,</hi> and <hi>where ever</hi> we are <hi>surrounds</hi> us wirh his boundless Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>includes</hi> and <hi>penetrates</hi> every part of our Substance, <hi>sees</hi> into our <hi>inmost</hi> Thoughts and Purposes, and <hi>ransacks</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Corner</hi> of our Souls with his <hi>allseeing Eye,</hi> and hath a <hi>through</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of all our <hi>Affairs</hi> and <hi>Concerns,</hi> we cannot without infinite <hi>Force</hi> to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son forbear <hi>fearing</hi> and <hi>reverencing, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> him.</p>

                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:60130:118"/>IV. To fasten the Obligations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon us it is also necessary that we <hi>believe</hi> that God continually <hi>orders</hi> and <hi>disposes</hi> of all things; that he is the <hi>Spring</hi> of all the Motions of this great <hi>Machine</hi> of the World, that sets every <hi>Wheel</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> agoing, and by his all-commanding Influence <hi>maintains, directs</hi> and <hi>over-rules</hi> their Motions; and that there is nothing happens in the World, whether by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>Chance,</hi> or <hi>Design,</hi> but by his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> and <hi>Disposal</hi>; that even those <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Causes</hi> which are necessarily <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> to such <hi>particular</hi> Courses and Effects, are <hi>influenced</hi> and <hi>conducted</hi> by him, and that whensoever they <hi>stray</hi> from their Courses, <hi>suspend</hi> or <hi>precipitate</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or move <hi>counter</hi> to their natural Tendencies, it is by his <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; that 'tis he who <hi>drives</hi> and <hi>guides</hi> the heavenly Bodies, <hi>impresses</hi> the Degrees and <hi>chalks out</hi> the Paths of their Motions, and by his own Almighty Hand <hi>turns round</hi> those stupendous Wheels in a perpetual Revolution. For so the Scripture tells us that <hi>he makes his Sun to shine upon the good and bad, Mat.</hi> 5.45. that it is at his <hi>Beck</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> that those vast Bodies of Light <hi>exhale</hi> the Vapours of the Earth and Sea, and <hi>dissolve</hi> them down again in <hi>Hail,</hi>


                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:60130:119"/>
and <hi>Rain</hi> and <hi>Snow.</hi> For so we are told that 'tis he <hi>who covers the Heavens with Clouds, and prepares the Rain for the Earth; that sends forth his Commandment unto the Earth, and giveth Snow like Wool, and scattereth the hoar Frost like Ashes, and casteth forth his Ice like Morsels, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth his Word and melteth them, and causes the Wind to blow and the Waters flow,</hi> Psalm 147.8, 15, 16, 17, 18. that <hi>the Fire, and Hail, and Snow, and Vapours, and stormy Winds do fulfil his Word,</hi> Psalm 148.8. And in a word, that 'tis by his <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> that the Earth sends up its <hi>Sap</hi> into the <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Roots</hi> of Herbs, and Corn and Plants, and causes them to <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>grow,</hi> and that all Animals do <hi>propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> their Kind, and still <hi>replenish</hi> the Store-houses of Nature; for so we are told that <hi>he cloaths the Grass of the Field, and arrays the Lillies in all their glory,</hi> Mat. 2.28, 29, 30. and that <hi>he causes the Grass to grow for the Cattel, and Herb for the use of Man, that he may bring forth Food out of the Earth,</hi> Psal. 104.14.</p>
                  <p>AND then as for <hi>fortuitous</hi> and <hi>casual</hi> Events, which depend upon <hi>Accidental</hi> and <hi>irregular</hi> Causes, as a Mans being <hi>hit</hi> with an Arrow let fly <hi>at random,</hi> or <hi>brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with a Stone falling from the Top of an


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60130:119"/>
House, we must believe that they are all <hi>ordered, directed,</hi> and <hi>over-ruled</hi> by God; so as that to <hi>him</hi> there is nothing <hi>casual</hi> or <hi>contingent</hi>; and tho there are many things happen of which there was no <hi>Necessity</hi> in their <hi>immediate Causes,</hi> yet do they as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily depend upon the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>first Cause</hi> of all, as the <hi>Rising</hi> and <hi>Setting</hi> of the Sun, and <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Sea. So that how <hi>fortuitous</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever these things may be in respect of the <hi>Design</hi> and natural <hi>Tendency</hi> of <hi>second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> yet none of them ever happen besides the <hi>Purpose</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of God, who <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> and <hi>designs</hi> them before they come to pass, and <hi>directs</hi> and <hi>levels</hi> them to his own most <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Ends and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For so the Arrow which the Soldier let fly <hi>at Random</hi> was levelled by God at <hi>Ahabs</hi> Breast, so that his Death was <hi>Chance</hi> in respect of the <hi>Soldier</hi> who shot the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but <hi>Design</hi> in <hi>God</hi> who <hi>directed</hi> it; and accordingly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. we are told that <hi>the Lot is cast into the Lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> And so in the Case of <hi>Chance-Medley</hi> when a Man <hi>accidentally</hi> kills another without any <hi>Design</hi> or <hi>Intention,</hi> tho it be mere <hi>Accident</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> 'tis <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> who, as the Scripture expresses it, <hi>delivers the

Man</hi> he slays <hi>into his Hand, Exod.</hi> 21.13.</p>
                  <p>And then Lastly, As for those Events which happen by the <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Agents, it is necessary we should believe that they are <hi>all over-ruled</hi> by God too; that whatever befalls us in this World whether it be by the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> Design of Men or Angels, is for <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Ends, either <hi>permitted</hi> or <hi>determined</hi> by the sovereign Disposer of all <hi>Events</hi>; so that without his <hi>wise</hi> Permission or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, neither <hi>Angels,</hi> nor <hi>Men,</hi> nor <hi>Devils</hi> can do us either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>hurt</hi>; that every <hi>good</hi> thing we receive from <hi>them,</hi> only passes to us through <hi>their</hi> Hands from <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> are only the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels</hi> and <hi>Conveyances</hi> of the overflowing Streams of his infinite Bounty; and that when ever we suffer any <hi>ill</hi> from them, <hi>they</hi> are but the <hi>Rods</hi> in <hi>Gods Hand</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he <hi>chastens</hi> and <hi>corrects</hi> us; that he hath the <hi>over-ruling</hi> Disposal of all the Ills which they <hi>inflict</hi> upon us, and can render their <hi>Stings</hi> a Sovereign <hi>Balm,</hi> and their <hi>ranckest</hi> Poyson <hi>Medicinal</hi> to us; so that their <hi>Malice</hi> being in <hi>Gods</hi> Disposal, can effect nothing but what <hi>he</hi> will have it; and if it doth us <hi>hurt</hi> 'tis his <hi>Executioner,</hi> but if he pleases it shall do us <hi>good,</hi> and like


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60130:120"/>
                     <hi>Leaches</hi> applied by a skilfull Physician, shall <hi>draw</hi> away our <hi>Disease</hi> while it is <hi>sucking</hi> our <hi>Blood.</hi> For so God made the <hi>Malice</hi> of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren the means of his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>; and by the <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the holy Jesus to his own <hi>right Hand,</hi> and <hi>executed</hi> his Purpose to <hi>redeem</hi> Mankind. Thus God <hi>over-rules</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Men, and when he pleases <hi>directs</hi> them quite <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>their</hi> Intentions; for <hi>the way of Man,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>is not in himself, it is not in Man that walketh to direct his steps, Jer.</hi> 10.23. It is the <hi>Man</hi> that <hi>walks</hi> and <hi>acts,</hi> but it is <hi>God</hi> alone that <hi>leads</hi> his Way, and <hi>directs</hi> his Actions to what End he pleases.</p>
                  <p>ALL which it is <hi>necessary</hi> we should <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in order to our being <hi>truly religious.</hi> For while we look upon God as a <hi>Foreiner</hi> to the World, that hath altogether <hi>reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> himself from the <hi>Affairs</hi> of it, and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned</hi> it to the Disposal of blind <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Necessity,</hi> he must stand for a <hi>Cypher</hi> in our <hi>Esteem,</hi> and signifie no more to us than the <hi>Emperor</hi> of the <hi>World in the Moon,</hi> who for all we know may be a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>puissant</hi> Prince, but is so far <hi>removed</hi> from <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>Affairs,</hi> that he can do us neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>hurt.</hi> And if God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle

he is too <hi>mighty</hi> for us, and not to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> with without infinite <hi>Peril</hi> and <hi>Disadvantage</hi>; but 'tis impossible we should obey those Laws with a <hi>resigned</hi> and <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Will, from which we only fear <hi>ill</hi> but expect no <hi>benefit.</hi> Wherefore to oblige us to render a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unforced</hi> Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods Laws, it is <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary we should <hi>believe</hi> that the great Design of them is the good of <hi>those</hi> they are <hi>imposed</hi> on; and so the Psalmist assures us that <hi>the Statutes of the Lord are perfect, converting the Soul and making wise the simple; right, rejoycing the Heart; pure, enlightning the Eyes, true and righteous altogether, more to be desired than Gold, yea than much fine Gold, sweeter also than the Honey and the Honey-comb, and that in keeping them there is great Reward, Psalm</hi> 19.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. and that <hi>the Law of Gods Mouth was better to him,</hi> that is, for the <hi>good</hi> it did him <hi>than thousands of Gold and Silver,</hi> Psalm 119.72.</p>
                  <p>AND this if we <hi>firmly</hi> believe it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>encourage</hi> our <hi>Obedience.</hi> For when I am sure that God commands me <hi>nothing</hi> but what my own <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> requires, and that every Law of his is both a <hi>necessary</hi> and a <hi>Soverein</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription against the <hi>Diseases</hi> of my Nature, and that he could not have prescribed me

and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him. For how can he be <hi>supreme Governor</hi> of the World, if all <hi>other</hi> Governments are not <hi>immediately under</hi> him? And how can <hi>they</hi> be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>under</hi> him if they are not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>authorized by</hi> him? And by what <hi>other</hi> Right can any Person or Persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>govern</hi> in Gods Kingdom <hi>under</hi> him, but by Commission from him? For every <hi>supreme Authority</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>all other</hi> Authorities, so far as it <hi>extends</hi>; and if it be <hi>not</hi> so, it cannot be <hi>supreme.</hi> And therefore unless <hi>all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> be <hi>derived</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> he can have no such thing as a <hi>supreme Authority</hi> in the World. And this I doubt not is very well understood by our <hi>Atheistical Politicians,</hi> who in <hi>pursuance</hi> of their <hi>Denial</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> derive <hi>all Authority</hi> from the <hi>People</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly <hi>aware</hi> that if the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Governors</hi> can be derived from the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> it will necessarily follow that <hi>both</hi> must be <hi>independent</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> and that to derive <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> from any other <hi>Head</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> is to deny him to be the <hi>supreme Governor</hi> of the World, which is the thing they would be at. If it be said, that <hi>God</hi> hath given <hi>Authority</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>authorise</hi> their <hi>Governors,</hi> and so he is still <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Authority tho it be <hi>derived</hi>

from him <hi>immediately</hi> through the <hi>People</hi>; I answer, That <hi>this</hi> doth very little <hi>mend</hi> the matter.

                  <p n="3">III.

For that which <hi>limits</hi> Beings, is only the <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of their <hi>Causes,</hi> which either <hi>would</hi> not or <hi>could</hi> not bestow any further <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> upon them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only such things as are <hi>caused</hi> are <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,</hi> because they being produced out of <hi>nothing,</hi> are only <hi>so far</hi> and no <hi>farther</hi> brought into Being, as their Cause was <hi>willing</hi> or <hi>able</hi> to bring them.

When we see things <hi>void</hi> of all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> as constantly <hi>directed</hi> to <hi>good</hi> Ends, as they could be if they <hi>had</hi> Sense and Reason, we may be sure that there is a Reason <hi>without</hi> them that <hi>framed</hi> them for those Ends, and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects</hi> them to them; it being unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how <hi>Chance</hi> or blind <hi>Necessity</hi> that have no <hi>Design,</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>Contrivance</hi> in them, should <hi>constantly</hi> operate as <hi>regularly</hi> as <hi>Reason</hi> it self.

The <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> for Instance, are things that are utterly <hi>void</hi> of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and therefore can have no <hi>Design</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance</hi> in them; how then came they to <hi>place</hi> and <hi>continue</hi> themselves at such a <hi>commodious</hi> Distance from one another?

The <hi>Earth</hi> might have found <hi>room</hi> enough to place it self either much <hi>nearer</hi> to or much <hi>remoter</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> than it <hi>is</hi>; but if it had done <hi>so,</hi> it must have either been everlastingly <hi>parched</hi> or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly <hi>frozen</hi> and <hi>benighted,</hi> and either way converted into an <hi>useless, barren</hi> and <hi>inhabitable</hi> Desert; whereas where it <hi>now</hi> is, it stands at the most <hi>convenient</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Sun, to be <hi>warmed</hi> and <hi>cherished</hi> by his <hi>enlivening</hi> Fires, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>roasted</hi> by being too <hi>near</hi> them, nor <hi>frozen</hi> by being too <hi>far</hi> from them; but to receive from them such a <hi>temperate</hi> heat, as is sufficient to <hi>excite</hi> its <hi>seminal</hi> Virtues, and to <hi>draw up</hi> its <hi>Juices</hi> into them, and thereby to <hi>ripen</hi> its natural <hi>Fruits,</hi> and in a word, to <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh</hi> its Inhabitants, and to render it to


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60130:142"/>
them a <hi>pleasant,</hi> a <hi>healthful,</hi> and a <hi>fruitful</hi> Paradise. Since therefore of ten thousand Millions of Places wherein it <hi>might</hi> have fixed in that <hi>Immensity</hi> of <hi>Space</hi> that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds it, it hath <hi>fixed upon</hi> and doth still <hi>continue in</hi> the <hi>best</hi> without any <hi>Design</hi> or <hi>Wisdom</hi> of its own, it is plain that there <hi>is</hi> an over-ruling Wisdom <hi>without</hi> it that <hi>chose</hi> its place and <hi>fixes</hi> and <hi>determins</hi> it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Again, How came the <hi>Sun</hi> (for whether it be the <hi>Earth</hi> that moves about the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the Sun <hi>about</hi> the Earth is all one to our Enquiry) how came this Sun, I say, which hath no <hi>Reason</hi> to govern it self by, to be <hi>determined</hi> to such a <hi>useful</hi> Course of Motion? what makes this <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> Body <hi>move round</hi> the Earth in twenty four hours, in finishing which <hi>spacious</hi> Circle of Motion it must fly far <hi>swifter</hi> than a Bullet from a Canons Mouth; and yet through so many Ages each twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours it hath <hi>constantly</hi> performed it, without being so much as one Minute <hi>faster</hi> or <hi>slower</hi>; whereby it makes those <hi>just</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Returns of <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> to both the <hi>Hemispheres,</hi> so that neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>other</hi> is either too much <hi>heated</hi> by his Presence, or too long <hi>benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by his Absence, because as soon as the <hi>one</hi> hath been sufficiently <hi>warmed</hi> and <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished</hi>

He might have moved all the Year round the Earths <hi>Equator</hi>; but if he had done so, all the <hi>middle</hi> Tracts of Earth both <hi>Northward</hi> and <hi>Southward</hi> would soon have been <hi>scorched</hi> up with his continual <hi>Presence,</hi> and all the <hi>remoter</hi> Parts both ways would quickly have <hi>died</hi>

with <hi>Cold</hi> through his perpetual <hi>Absence</hi>: or he might have run his annual Course on <hi>one</hi> side only of the Earths <hi>Equator,</hi> and made his circular Excursions <hi>to</hi> or <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>Pole</hi>; but if he had done so, he must have left a great Part of the opposite Hemisphere exposed to everlasting <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> whereas in the annual Course of Motion he <hi>now</hi> performs, he sheds forth his <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> over all the World, and by turns gives every Part its <hi>yearly</hi> Seasons; which is a plain Evidence that all his Motions are <hi>conducted</hi> by a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi> Mind, which among so <hi>many</hi> Courses of Motion that lie before him in the <hi>boundless</hi> Space he moves in, hath <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> him to <hi>that</hi> which for Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is much the <hi>best</hi> and most <hi>commodious.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, How came the <hi>Air</hi> which hath no <hi>Design</hi> in it self to place it self so <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously</hi> as it hath done between the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Heavens?</hi> Why is there not a wide <hi>vacuity</hi> between?

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60130:145"/>
but as for the Air which is a <hi>thin, soft, fluid</hi> and <hi>transparent</hi> Body, it is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the most <hi>proper Vehicle</hi> of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Influences.

                  <p>AND now we are come down to this <hi>terrestrial Globe</hi> which consists of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> let us briefly consider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Use of <hi>both,</hi> and of all things <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining</hi> to them. How came the <hi>sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Water to bore <hi>Holes</hi> and <hi>Channels</hi> in the Banks of the Ocean through long <hi>Tracts</hi> of Earth, and <hi>against</hi> its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>climb</hi> up to the tops of Mountains, that so it may be able not only to run down <hi>again</hi> with <hi>Ease,</hi> but also to carry it self to such <hi>Heights</hi> afterwards, as the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Beasts</hi> require, and to

                     <hi>unite</hi> into large <hi>Rivers</hi> that run into all the <hi>inland</hi> Parts of the Earth, watering both <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>thirsty</hi> Animals all along as they <hi>go,</hi> till <hi>at last</hi> they <hi>return</hi> into the Ocean again? How comes this <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>senseless</hi> Element that can consult neither its <hi>own</hi> Convenience nor that of <hi>other</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to be <hi>salt</hi> where it is convenient for <hi>it self</hi> to be <hi>salt, viz.</hi> in the <hi>Ocean,</hi> by which it is preserved from <hi>Putrefaction</hi>; and <hi>fresh</hi> where it is convenient for <hi>other</hi> Beings that it should be <hi>fresh, viz.</hi> in the <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> that so it may be fit to <hi>fructify</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> and be a <hi>wholesom</hi> Drink for its <hi>Animals?</hi> How come so many <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> which do all arise from the <hi>salt</hi> Waters of the <hi>Sea,</hi> to be <hi>stript</hi> of their <hi>salt</hi> Particles, by oosing through the Pores of the Earth, and <hi>thereby</hi> to be rendred both <hi>fruitful</hi> to the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>wholsom</hi> for <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Beasts?</hi> How comes it to pass that so many <hi>Clouds</hi> as are <hi>drawn up</hi> out of the <hi>salt</hi> Ocean, should in their <hi>Ascent</hi> so far <hi>shake off</hi> their <hi>Salt</hi> as to <hi>descend</hi> back again upon the Earth in <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>fresh</hi> Showers? And how come those <hi>Vapours</hi> of which the <hi>Clouds</hi> consist, and which are much <hi>thicker</hi> and <hi>heavier</hi> than the Air, to be drawn <hi>aloft</hi> as they are by the <hi>Rays</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which have neither <hi>Pumps</hi> nor <hi>Buckets</hi> to <hi>exhale</hi> them? And when


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60130:146"/>
they <hi>are</hi> aloft in the <hi>Air,</hi> how come they to <hi>gather</hi> into <hi>thick</hi> Clouds, and not rather to <hi>disperse</hi> themselves about in that vast <hi>Expansum,</hi> or to <hi>return</hi> back again to the Earth in thin Vapors as they <hi>arose</hi>; and while they <hi>hang</hi> in the Air, what is it that <hi>susteins</hi> their <hi>Weight,</hi> and when they <hi>fall,</hi> how comes it to pass that they ordinarily fall in <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> Showers that <hi>water</hi> the <hi>Roots</hi> of the <hi>Grass</hi> and <hi>Corn</hi> without any Prejudice to their <hi>Stalks</hi> and <hi>Blades,</hi> and not rather in <hi>Mists</hi> or <hi>Streams,</hi> which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be <hi>insufficient</hi> to moisten the Earth, or <hi>lay wast</hi> its Corn and Fruit with the <hi>Violence</hi> of their <hi>Fall?</hi> All which are <hi>illustrious</hi> Instances of a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> Providence, that <hi>directs</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> this <hi>senseless</hi> Element, and causes it ordinarily to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>act</hi> as if it had Wisdom in <hi>it self</hi> and did therewithal <hi>industriously</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the <hi>publick good</hi> of the World; but this Argument you may find handled more at large in a late excellent Treatise <hi>de Deo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND now we are arrived to the <hi>Earth</hi> whereon we live and move and have our Beings, which tho it self be of a <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>irregular</hi> Figure, and seems to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>mighty Ruins</hi> of some more <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi> Structure, than an <hi>original Effect</hi> of the divine <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Contrivance,</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

For since the Plants do all <hi>derive</hi> their <hi>Nourishment</hi> from the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Parts of the Earth, it is necessary that some Parts of them should be <hi>buried</hi> under Ground, that so they may <hi>come</hi> at their <hi>Food</hi>; and that <hi>these</hi> Parts should be fitted with <hi>spongy strings</hi> to <hi>fasten</hi> them to the Earth, and to <hi>suck in</hi> those Juices of it whereon they <hi>feed</hi>; and accordingly the <hi>seminal Vertue</hi> of every Plant first <hi>forms</hi> it self a <hi>Root</hi> under Ground, which runs out <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> from the Centre of it into <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>smaller</hi> Strings <hi>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable</hi> to the Magnitude of the Plant it bears, that so how <hi>great</hi> soever it be it may by these <hi>Strings</hi> be so <hi>fastned</hi> to the Earth, as that the Wind to which its <hi>upper</hi> Parts are exposed, may not be able to <hi>tear</hi> them <hi>up</hi>; then this <hi>seminal Form</hi> whatsoever it be, <hi>digests</hi> these Strings into a <hi>porous</hi> and <hi>spongy</hi> Substance fit to <hi>suck</hi> in the Juices of the Earth on every side, and bores little

                  <p>AND if in the Composure of every <hi>Plant</hi> there are such <hi>visible</hi> Footsteps of a <hi>divine Art,</hi> how much more of every <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,</hi> whose Parts for infinite <hi>Variety,</hi> delicate <hi>Smalness,</hi> exquisite <hi>Shape, Position</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> do as far excell the other, as the <hi>Offices</hi> for which they are designed?

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60130:149"/>
were <hi>invisibly</hi> present there, and did <hi>work</hi> upon this <hi>senseless</hi> Heap, and <hi>dispose</hi> its Parts into this <hi>comely</hi> Order? And yet in the Composure of any one <hi>Animal</hi> there is infinitely <hi>more</hi> Art than in the most beautiful <hi>structure</hi> in the World.

                  <p>I might from hence have proceeded to the formation of <hi>Man,</hi> the Masterpiece of all this lower Creation, in whose <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>structure</hi> there are such Miracles of Art as do outreach both the <hi>Imitation</hi> and <hi>Wonder</hi> of the most <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> Minds.

For how is it conceivable that a little Drop of

Water without the Assistance of any <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Providence,</hi> should form it self not only into all the Parts and Lineaments of a Humane <hi>Body,</hi> but also into a Humane <hi>Mind,</hi> a Mind of <hi>vast</hi> Desires and <hi>infinite</hi> Capacities of Knowledg, that can form Ideas <hi>within</hi> it self of every thing that is round <hi>about</hi> it, and from them can frame <hi>innumerable</hi> Propositions, and <hi>deduce</hi> them into Arts and Sciences: and in a word, that can move it <hi>self</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> it lives in, by its own <hi>internal</hi> Springs, and <hi>form</hi> it self into so many <hi>various</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> Affections by the mysterious <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Energy</hi> of its own Reason and Discourse?

                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:60130:151"/>AND thus I have given some brief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the constant Direction of all sorts of things, how <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi> soever, to some <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> End, which is a plain <hi>Evidence</hi> of an <hi>universal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> over the World, that in a <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>uniform</hi> Series directs things to their proper <hi>Ends</hi> that have no <hi>Aim</hi> or <hi>Design</hi> of their own, and so are utterly uncapable to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. ANOTHER <hi>sensible Evidence</hi> of a <hi>divine Providence</hi> is, the <hi>sagacious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of things that have no <hi>Foresight</hi> in themselves. For among irrational Beings that can neither apprehend <hi>for</hi> what <hi>Ends</hi> they act, nor <hi>by</hi> what <hi>Means</hi> they may best effect them, how strange is it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with what <hi>Insight</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> they many of them act in <hi>storing up</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for themselves against a time of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, in <hi>framing</hi> their own Beds and Nests, and <hi>defending</hi> themselves and their Young against approaching Dangers; in <hi>educating</hi> their Young, and propagating their Kind through all succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, insomuch that if they were every one endued with Reason of their own to <hi>foresee</hi> their own Dangers, and <hi>forecast</hi> their own Conveniency and Safety, they would not act with more <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Sagacity</hi> than


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60130:151"/>
they do. For thus the <hi>Plants</hi> that have neither <hi>Sense</hi> nor <hi>Reason</hi> to discern the Periods of their own Growth and Decay, when they have almost spent themselves, and are ready to <hi>wither</hi> and <hi>die,</hi> run up into Seed, as if they <hi>foresaw</hi> their own <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching</hi> Fate, and did thereupon <hi>bethink</hi> themselves of <hi>propagating</hi> their Kind before it be <hi>too late,</hi> and leaving a numerous <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity</hi> behind them. And therefore since they have neither Thought nor Forecast <hi>in themselves,</hi> 'tis evident that there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that <hi>thinks</hi> and <hi>forecasts</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p>Thus also those Plants that shoot up <hi>on high,</hi> but are too <hi>weak</hi> to support them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, such as the <hi>Hop</hi> and <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Ivy,</hi> run out into little <hi>strings</hi> or <hi>tendrils</hi> with which they <hi>lay hold</hi> upon some body that is <hi>stronger</hi> than themselves, as if they were <hi>conscious</hi> of their own weakness, and so to <hi>prop up</hi> themselves did <hi>designedly</hi> twist about those stronger bodies that are best able to <hi>support</hi> them. And therefore since they neither know their own <hi>weakness,</hi> nor yet the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>Trees</hi> or <hi>Wall</hi> they depend on, it is evident that there is a wise Providence that knows <hi>both,</hi> and <hi>guides</hi> and <hi>directs</hi> them to their safety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:60130:152"/>And as there is a visible Providence over <hi>Plants,</hi> so there is also over <hi>brute</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi> Animals, and especially over the <hi>smallest</hi> and most <hi>contemptible,</hi> who by reason of their natural <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> are less able to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For thus the Spider is a Creature as void of <hi>Reason</hi> as the Plant of <hi>Sense,</hi> and yet with what <hi>wondrous</hi> Art doth he spin his Web out of a <hi>viscous</hi> matter within his own Bowels? He <hi>extends</hi> the threads of it cross to one another, leaving equal Angles in the middle, <hi>fastning</hi> the extreme to the opposite threads, and then least through the weakness of the slender threads of which it is composed the Fly he hunts should happen to break through, he weaves several <hi>under-nets</hi> one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with a wondrous Art <hi>fastens</hi> them all together, that so if <hi>one</hi> should fail, the <hi>other</hi> might hold; and when he hath thus fix'd and spread his <hi>subtile</hi> and <hi>strange-contrived</hi> Snares, he lies in wait in a little Den without, made by him on purpose to <hi>conceal</hi> himself; from whence, as soon as the Fly is <hi>entangled,</hi> he swiftly <hi>runs</hi> and <hi>seises</hi> it, and having <hi>killed</hi> it carries it away and lays it up in a safe Repository against a time of Famine. In all which performance this <hi>irrational</hi> Insect proceeds


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60130:152"/>
as <hi>providently</hi> and <hi>wisely</hi> as if in a long deduction he had inferr'd one thing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and acted upon the most <hi>rational</hi> deliberation; and therefore since he is void of reason <hi>himself,</hi> and doth not determine himself by any natural Logic of <hi>his own,</hi> he must proceed by the reason and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of some <hi>wise</hi> Mind <hi>without</hi> him, that hath the <hi>guidance</hi> and <hi>disposal</hi> of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he begins not to exercise his Art after he is arriv'd to a <hi>riper</hi> age, but is <hi>born</hi> with his Trade about him, and <hi>spins</hi> and <hi>weavs</hi> fpom his very Infancy; nor is there any <hi>diversity</hi> in his Manufacture, as there useth to be in those of <hi>rational</hi> Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but 'tis always woven in the same <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>figure,</hi> and <hi>fashion,</hi> which is a plain evidence that he effects it not by any <hi>art</hi> or <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>his own</hi> but by mere <hi>natural instinct,</hi> which is nothing but the <hi>impression</hi> of the art and reason of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of Nature, which impression knows not what it <hi>doth,</hi> nor upon what <hi>reasons</hi> it proceeds, but only <hi>answers</hi> to the <hi>Reason</hi> of God as the <hi>signature</hi> doth to the <hi>Seal</hi> that imprest it, and like an Eccho <hi>articulates</hi> and <hi>resounds</hi> his Voice without <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> what it <hi>means.</hi> And as the <hi>sensless</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho when it <hi>reverberates</hi> words that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in them, supposes the


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60130:153"/>
original Voice to proceed from some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent</hi> Mind; so these <hi>irrational</hi> Instincts of Nature which express so much <hi>art</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> in their operations, do necessarily imply that there is some <hi>wise</hi> Mind or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to which they owe their <hi>original</hi> and <hi>continuance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR thus to instance farther, with what a <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> Art do the <hi>Bees</hi> frame their <hi>Combs,</hi> which they divide on each side into a world of little <hi>six-corner'd</hi> cells, and then prop them up with <hi>middle</hi> walls of pillars which they raise from the floor into an arch, by which as they are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more <hi>strong,</hi> so the Bees have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance through to <hi>repair</hi> them whenever they <hi>decay</hi>; and having thus artificially <hi>built</hi> their houses, with what <hi>industry</hi> do they wander to and fro to gather the <hi>sweet</hi> dews of Heaven, whereon they live, from the <hi>herbs</hi> and <hi>flowers</hi> of the field, and with what care do they <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> them up in those little cells against <hi>winter,</hi> when they can neither go <hi>forth</hi> by reason of the <hi>cold</hi> to <hi>seek</hi> their sustenance abroad, nor yet <hi>find</hi> it if they <hi>could</hi>; and when they have fill'd their cells with their winter provision, they <hi>providently</hi> draw over the mouth of them a thin skin or membrane to <hi>preserve</hi> the grateful liquor


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60130:153"/>
lest it should <hi>drop out</hi> and be <hi>lost</hi>; and in a word, in what a regular order do they <hi>live,</hi> they <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> all together, and in the discharge of <hi>several</hi> offices conspire to the <hi>same</hi> work; some <hi>press</hi> the flowers with their feet, others with their mouths or down of their bodies gather up the <hi>moistures</hi> which these <hi>press out</hi> and carry them home to their cells; some bring home the <hi>materials</hi> of which these cells are compos'd, others <hi>disburthen</hi> them of it, others <hi>build</hi> with it, and others <hi>plane</hi> and <hi>polish</hi> the building. Thus all hands are at work first to <hi>build</hi> the house they are to dwell in, and to <hi>divide</hi> it into its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral apartments, and then to <hi>store</hi> them all with provision against the ensuing time of scarcity. Now therefore (not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their wondrous <hi>polity</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of which so many curious observations have been made) how is it possible they should do all these things with so much <hi>regularity</hi> and exact <hi>order,</hi> without being guided by some <hi>art</hi> and <hi>reason?</hi> But yet 'tis certain 'tis not by any reason of <hi>their own</hi>; they do not at all <hi>consider</hi> when they build, how <hi>needful</hi> houses are for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Winter provisions, nor how <hi>convenient</hi> that waxy matter which they gather is to build <hi>those</hi> houses, nor


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60130:154"/>
what necessity there is of <hi>dividing</hi> them into <hi>distinct</hi> cells and apartments; they <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi> not the nature of those sweet dews which they gather, whether they are <hi>food</hi> or <hi>poison,</hi> and when they gather more than they have present need of they <hi>know</hi> not <hi>why</hi> they do it, they <hi>reason</hi> not with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that Winter is approaching, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in neither these <hi>dews</hi> will <hi>fall</hi> upon which they live, nor themselves be able to go forth and <hi>gather</hi> them, and that therefore it behoves them to <hi>store</hi> themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand against the <hi>ensuing</hi> famine; and when that they have laid up their store and are binding it in with the membrane they draw over it, they do not consider that 'tis a <hi>fluid</hi> matter that will be apt to <hi>run out</hi> and be <hi>lost</hi>; and yet all these things they <hi>perform</hi> with as much <hi>regularity</hi> and <hi>art,</hi> as if they had throughly <hi>weigh'd</hi> and <hi>considered</hi> and perfectly <hi>understood</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of them; which is a plain evidence that they are acted by a <hi>reason</hi> that is not <hi>their own,</hi> and what <hi>other</hi> reason can this be than that of the <hi>divine</hi> mind which <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi> and <hi>disposeth</hi> all things? And the same may be said of <hi>Ants,</hi> and <hi>Moles</hi> and <hi>Palmer-worms</hi> and innumerable other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which though they have no reason of <hi>their own,</hi> are yet in many instances as

evidently conducted by <hi>reason</hi> as any <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> beings whatever.</p>
                  <p>For with what <hi>admirable</hi> art do the <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational</hi> Birds form their <hi>nests</hi> a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their <hi>coupling</hi>; they begin to <hi>build</hi> though they neither <hi>consider</hi> that they are <hi>breeding,</hi> nor yet do <hi>foresee</hi> when they shall <hi>lay</hi>; by which it's plain that there is a Providence which <hi>considers</hi> and <hi>foresees</hi> for them; and though they <hi>understand</hi> not what materials are <hi>fittest</hi> to build their nests nor in what order to <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> them, yet there is a very <hi>wise</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that <hi>directs</hi> them both to <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>contrive</hi> the materials, and this with greater <hi>art</hi> than <hi>we</hi> with all our <hi>reason</hi> can do. For as for the <hi>outward</hi> surface of the nests which comes not near their bodies, they frame it with <hi>sticks</hi> and <hi>thorns</hi> which with <hi>inimitable</hi> art they <hi>twist</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weave</hi> into a <hi>round</hi> and <hi>uniform</hi> hollowness, which they commonly dawb round with mud to render it more <hi>compact</hi> and <hi>warm</hi>; when this is done though they <hi>understand</hi> not their own <hi>specific</hi> frame and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet they proceed as if they <hi>did,</hi> and suit their nests to the <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>weakness</hi> of their natures; for those of them that are of a <hi>hardier</hi> make content themselves with this <hi>inward</hi> plaistering, and when 'tis dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60130:155"/>
proceed to <hi>lay</hi> and <hi>hatch</hi> their eggs on it, without troubling themselves to <hi>line</hi> it with any <hi>softer</hi> materials, as if they knew <hi>beforehand</hi> that the constitution of their young would be such as would not need any <hi>softness</hi> or <hi>delicacy</hi>; whereas those that are of a <hi>tenderer</hi> frame take care to cloath the <hi>hard</hi> plaistering with <hi>straw</hi> or <hi>hay</hi> or <hi>moss,</hi> upon which those that are <hi>tenderest</hi> of all make another layer of <hi>hair</hi> or <hi>down</hi> or <hi>feathers,</hi> as if they perfectly <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood</hi> what degree of <hi>softness</hi> and <hi>warmth</hi> would be necessary for the preservation and nourishment of their tender off spring. Since therefore it's certain that they <hi>know</hi> none of all these things, and yet they act as if they <hi>did,</hi> they must necessarily be supposed to act by the <hi>direction</hi> of some <hi>wise</hi> Mind that perfectly knows them all. And then again considering with what <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> the female sits upon her eggs when she hath <hi>laid</hi> them, as if she <hi>understood</hi> the plilosophy of her own <hi>warmth,</hi> how necessary it is to <hi>form</hi> and <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>hatch</hi> them, and with what <hi>care</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> the male brings her in provision whilst she is <hi>sitting,</hi> that so she may not be forc'd by the necessities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>neglect</hi> her eggs and <hi>leave</hi> them too long expos'd to the cold air which in


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60130:155"/>
a short time would destroy the <hi>tender</hi> principles of life <hi>within</hi> them; and in a word, with what <hi>care</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> they both conspire to <hi>cherish</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> their young when they are <hi>hatch'd,</hi> till such time as they are <hi>cloath'd</hi> and <hi>fledg'd</hi> and can fly abroad to seek provision for themselves; considering, I say, how in all these things they proceed as if they perfectly <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood</hi> the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>necessities</hi> of their own actions, it's plain that they must be <hi>guided</hi> either by a reason in <hi>their own</hi> or in some <hi>other</hi> mind that hath the <hi>command</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of their motions. Now that it is not by a reason of <hi>their own</hi> is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whatsoever they do, they <hi>necessarily</hi> do, and cannot possibly do <hi>otherwise,</hi> for they never <hi>vary</hi> in their operations, never try any <hi>new</hi> experiments, but always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the <hi>same</hi> road and <hi>repeat</hi> the same things in the <hi>same</hi> method, which is a plain sign that they cannot do <hi>otherwise,</hi> and consequently that they act not from <hi>reason</hi> but <hi>necessity</hi>; and therefore since they are <hi>made</hi> and <hi>impelled</hi> to act as they <hi>do,</hi> and yet do act so <hi>rationally</hi> and <hi>wisely,</hi> that which <hi>impels</hi> them must be a <hi>rational</hi> mind either acting upon them <hi>immediately,</hi> or by a <hi>fix'd</hi> and permanent impression of its <hi>art</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> on their motions. For

as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath long since observ'd <gap reason="foreign">

For so men we see for their own <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>others</hi> pleasure can teach Dogs and others animals to <hi>dance</hi> the <hi>measures</hi> of <hi>tunes</hi> and other <hi>artificial</hi> motions, the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of which they understand not; for when they perform <hi>these</hi> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they neither <hi>think</hi> of their masters <hi>profit</hi> nor the spectatour's <hi>pleasure,</hi> which is the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of them, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>proportions</hi> of <hi>musick</hi> which is the <hi>rule</hi> of them, so that the reason of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is only in their teachers mind, who by frequent <hi>use</hi> doth by degrees <hi>imprint</hi> the practice of his art upon their <hi>fancies</hi>; and if a <hi>man</hi> can so imprint his art upon these <hi>artless</hi> creatures, as to make them practice it <hi>without</hi> understanding either the <hi>grounds</hi> or <hi>reasons</hi> of it, how much more may an <hi>allwise</hi> and <hi>Almighty</hi> mind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since <hi>de facto</hi> we behold a world of <hi>curious</hi> art among brute animals, that far exceeds all the <hi>little</hi> feats <hi>we</hi> can teach them, why may we not as reasonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60130:156"/>
that any one of these <hi>dancing</hi> ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals learnt all his <hi>artificial</hi> motions, the reasons of which he <hi>understands</hi> not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>arts-master</hi> to teach him, as that <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Bees</hi> acquir'd all the <hi>art</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> they practice, without either <hi>discovering</hi> the reasons of it by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of <hi>their own,</hi> or being ever <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed</hi> in it by any <hi>other</hi> provident mind; for <hi>art</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> cannot be supposed without <hi>reason,</hi> and therefore since the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of their art is not <hi>in themselves,</hi> it must necessarily be in <hi>some</hi> mind <hi>without</hi> them that hath the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> of all their motions.</p>

                  <p>NOW not to insist any further upon the admirable fitness of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> one to another, which I have largely discoursed already, how exactly is every <hi>animal</hi> fitted for its <hi>element,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>element</hi> for its <hi>animals?</hi> Thus the <hi>Birds</hi> for instance, are fitted with <hi>wings</hi> to fly aloft in the <hi>air,</hi> and the <hi>air</hi> is fitted to <hi>bear</hi> them up, and to yield to the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration</hi> of their wings: the <hi>Fishes</hi> are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to swim in the <hi>water,</hi> having <hi>finns</hi> which serve instead of <hi>oars</hi> to cut through and divide the streams, and the <hi>waters</hi> are fitted for the <hi>fish</hi> to swim in, being a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>fluid</hi> substance that is easily <hi>cut</hi> and <hi>divided</hi>; and as for the <hi>earth</hi> and those <hi>earthy</hi> animals that inhabit it, there is an <hi>admirable</hi> congruity between them; for they being all fram'd to <hi>walk</hi> or <hi>creep</hi> must

                  <p>AND if this attestation be <hi>true,</hi> there <hi>must</hi> be a Providence; for how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that <hi>blind</hi> Nature which neither <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates</hi> nor <hi>chooses,</hi> should of it self ever <hi>vary</hi> or <hi>interrupt</hi> its course without rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into utter <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>disorder</hi>? How should any <hi>part</hi> of it, when 'tis <hi>once</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either <hi>faster</hi> or <hi>slower</hi> than ordinary, so <hi>restrain,</hi> or <hi>quicken</hi> its own motion as to reduce it self back again to its <hi>establish'd</hi> Course? For if it once move <hi>faster,</hi> it must have some degree of motion <hi>super-added</hi> to it, and till that is withdrawn it must move <hi>faster</hi> for ever: if it move <hi>slower,</hi> it must have some degree of motion <hi>withdrawn</hi> from it, and 'till that be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it must move <hi>slower</hi> for ever: how then is it possible that <hi>Nature</hi> or any <hi>part</hi>


                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:60130:164"/>
of it which moves by a <hi>blind</hi> necessity, should of its own accord either <hi>hasten</hi> and then <hi>slacken,</hi> or <hi>slacken</hi> and then <hi>hasten</hi> the course of its motion, as it must do in the production of <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects, without being influenc'd by an <hi>Almighty</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? We have several miraculous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the <hi>diverting</hi> natural Causes <hi>from</hi> their course and <hi>stopping</hi> them <hi>in</hi> it; such as causing the Waters to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>stand still,</hi> and the Sun to move <hi>backward.</hi> Now how is it conceivable that any <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Cause that hath no <hi>will</hi> of its own to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> it, should either <hi>stop</hi> its own motion and then <hi>move</hi> again, or <hi>divert</hi> from its course and then <hi>return</hi> again, if it were not under the command of some will <hi>without</hi> it, that <hi>guides</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposeth</hi> it according to its own Council? But besides these <hi>Scripture</hi> Miracles, there are sundry <hi>miraculous</hi> Instances of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding</hi> good Men and <hi>punishing</hi> bad pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly recorded in the Histories of <hi>all Ages</hi>; some of <hi>vindicating</hi> the <hi>Innocence,</hi> others of <hi>restoring</hi> the <hi>lives,</hi> others of <hi>relieving</hi> the <hi>necessities</hi> of good Men; some of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting</hi> the <hi>Crimes</hi> of bad Men, others of striking them dead in their <hi>impious</hi> facts, others of punishing them <hi>in kind,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>inflicting</hi> on them those very


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60130:165"/>
Plagues which they have <hi>imprecated</hi> on themselves to give <hi>credit</hi> to a <hi>falshood</hi>; of some or other of which there is scarce any Age of the World which hath not been furnished with sundry <hi>notorious</hi> instances; so that unless we will give the <hi>Lye</hi> to all <hi>humane</hi> testimony, and condemn the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of all Ages for publick <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impostures,</hi> we cannot deny but that there have been sundry Miracles in the World, and if of all these Miracles that have been so <hi>strongly</hi> attested there be but any one <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> that <hi>one</hi> is a <hi>sufficient</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an <hi>over-ruling</hi> Providence. For if <hi>ever</hi> any thing hath been effected that is either <hi>above</hi> the Power or <hi>contrary</hi> to the established Course of natural Causes, it must be brought to pass by the Power of <hi>God,</hi> and if God doth <hi>sometimes</hi> visibly exert his own <hi>immediate</hi> efficacy on this World, that is a plain evidence that he <hi>always</hi> governs it; for whenever he <hi>thus</hi> exerts it, it is for <hi>some</hi> reason to be sure, and for <hi>what</hi> other reason should he thus strip his Arm and <hi>visibly</hi> exert his Power <hi>upon</hi> or <hi>before</hi> us, but either to <hi>awaken</hi> our <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> or to <hi>confirm</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>alarm</hi> our <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>encourage</hi> our <hi>hope</hi>; and if <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> he had any <hi>such</hi> design upon us, it must be in order to his <hi>governing</hi> us; for

to what other purpose can an <hi>Almighty</hi> Being be supposed to address himself to <hi>our</hi> Hope and Fear, and Faith and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but to <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>reduce</hi> us under his Rule and Government.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. And lastly, Another <hi>visible evidence</hi> of a <hi>divine</hi> Providence is <hi>Predictions</hi> of <hi>future</hi> aad <hi>remote</hi> contingencies. That there <hi>have</hi> been such things hath been <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally</hi> acknowledged by <hi>Heathens</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> As for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>Tully</hi> gives numerous instances of it in his two Books of <hi>Divination</hi>; In the first of which he sets down this as the great Principle of Prediction: <hi>Esse Deos &amp; eorum providentiâ mundum administrari eosdemque consulere rebus humanis, nec solum universis verum etiam singulis,</hi> i. e. <hi>That there are Gods, and that by their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the World is governed, that they take care of humane Affairs, and this not only in general, but in particular.</hi> And of these Predictions he tells us there was one <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> who wrote a large Book, in which he gives <hi>innumerable</hi> instances of them, <hi>all</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by very <hi>good</hi> Authority. Besides which there were their <hi>Oracles</hi> and their <hi>Sybilline Writings,</hi> among which if there had not been a great many true Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not to be imagined that ever the

                     <hi>wiser</hi> and more <hi>inquisitive</hi> part of Men should be so far imposed on as they were to pay such a mighty <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> to them, and that not only for a <hi>little while,</hi> but for several <hi>Ages</hi> together. But as for their <hi>Oracles,</hi> there are sundry of them <hi>recorded</hi> in ancient Historians together with their <hi>punctual</hi> accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and <hi>Tully</hi> in particular tells us of one of <hi>Apollo</hi> his Oracles which foretold a thousand years before that <hi>Sypselus</hi> the Tyrant should reign at <hi>Corinth.</hi> And <hi>Varro</hi> makes mention of one <hi>Vectius Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> an Augur in the time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> who when <hi>Rome</hi> was building foretold by the flying of <hi>twelve</hi> Vultures that the City should continue a thousand two hundred years, which accordingly hapned. But as for the <hi>reality</hi> of Predictions we need seek no farther than the Holy Scriptures, in which you have sundry <hi>Prophesies</hi> of things which hapned a long time <hi>after,</hi> as particularly of the deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from those <hi>two</hi> Captivities, the one in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the other in <hi>Babylon</hi>; the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of which was foretold four hundred years, and the <hi>latter</hi> above seventy years before it came to pass, and yet both of them accomplished <hi>punctually</hi> to a day, as you may see in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophesie is not only <hi>recorded</hi> in Scripture, but mentioned by <hi>Eupolemus</hi> an heathen Historian cited by <hi>Eusebius, Prepar.</hi> pag. 454.

And then for <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophesies of the grand Revolutions of the Empires of the World, they do so <hi>punctually</hi> describe what hapned long <hi>after,</hi> that <hi>Porphyry</hi> himself, though a mortal Enemy to Christianity, is forced to <hi>confess</hi> the exact agreement of his <hi>Prophesies</hi> with the <hi>succeeding</hi> Events, <hi>vid.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysost. cont. Jud. Tom.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 326. and hath no other way to <hi>evade</hi> the force of them but by affirming without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> that they were written <hi>afterwards</hi> in or near the time of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> though it is evident that the LXX Interpreters who translated the <hi>Old Testament</hi> a hundred years before, translated <hi>this</hi> Prophesie of <hi>Daniel</hi> with it. And <hi>Josephus</hi> expresly tells us, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High Priest shewed this very Prophesie to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who lived long before <hi>Antiochus, Joseph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqu. l.</hi> 11. But to name no more, there

are the Prophesies of the Messias, of the <hi>place</hi> and most <hi>particular</hi> circumstances of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> and <hi>Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> all which were so punctually accomplished in our Blessed Saviour, that did not the Jews, in whose hands they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preserved, <hi>own</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> them, one would be apt to suspect that they were <hi>forged</hi> on purpose by some Christian to countenance our Saviours pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Messias.</p>
                  <p>AND if there <hi>be</hi> any such thing as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, if but any <hi>one</hi> of all these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances be <hi>real</hi> (and that none of them should, would be <hi>very</hi> strange) this <hi>one</hi> will be a sufficient evidence of a Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; for to foresee things at a <hi>distance,</hi> and before their Causes are <hi>in being,</hi> so as to describe before hand the precise <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of their existence, or to foresee things <hi>casual</hi> and <hi>contingent,</hi> that wholly depend upon the free choice and determination of <hi>voluntary</hi> Agents, requires a mind of <hi>infinite</hi> comprehension, that sees through all the whole <hi>Series of Causes,</hi> and hath a perfect prospect not only of those things that <hi>actually</hi> exist, but also of all that are <hi>future</hi> and <hi>possible.</hi> For how is it possible to foresee a <hi>remote</hi> futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

in all its <hi>particular</hi> Circumstances, whose immediate Cause is either <hi>unborn,</hi> or <hi>free</hi> and <hi>undetermined,</hi> without having a <hi>perfect</hi> inspection not only into the <hi>natures,</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> and <hi>tendencies</hi> of things, but also into all their particular <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies</hi>; and that Mind which sees into all <hi>these,</hi> must needs be <hi>all-seeing</hi> and have nothing <hi>concealed</hi> from it, that is either <hi>present,</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> or <hi>possible.</hi> So that if there be any such thing as <hi>Prediction</hi> of <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>contingent</hi> futurities, it must necessarily proceed from an <hi>all-seeing</hi> Mind; and if there be an all-seeing Mind that <hi>oversees</hi> the whole World, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <hi>inspects</hi> all that is <hi>past,</hi> or <hi>present,</hi> or <hi>to come</hi> in it, is it imaginable that <hi>such</hi> a Mind should sit looking on as an <hi>idle</hi> Spectator and <hi>act</hi> no part it self in such a <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>busie</hi> Scene of thihgs?

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">I. IT is objected against the Being of Providence, that it doth not <hi>comport</hi> with the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God to take <hi>notice of,</hi> or <hi>concern</hi> himself about the <hi>little</hi> Affairs of this World. Which is <hi>such</hi> an Objection as carries its own <hi>Answer</hi> with it; for I would fain know which is most <hi>sutable</hi> to Majesty, to <hi>sit still</hi> or to <hi>act,</hi> to <hi>wrap up</hi> it self in everlasting <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleness,</hi> or to <hi>display</hi> it self in a <hi>vigorous Activity?</hi> And if it be <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>Majestick,</hi> as doubtless it <hi>is,</hi> for any Being to <hi>employ</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> its Powers, than to let them <hi>lie asleep</hi> and make no <hi>use</hi> of them, I would fain know in what <hi>higher Sphere</hi> can God exercise his Powers than in <hi>governing</hi> the World. For to govern well is the <hi>best</hi>


                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:60130:169"/>
and <hi>greatest</hi> thing that we can frame an Idea of; 'tis to <hi>do</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> good, to <hi>dispense</hi> the <hi>noblest</hi> Virtues, and to <hi>shed forth</hi> the <hi>amplest</hi> Sphere of Benefits. And therefore since the World is such a <hi>vast</hi> Dominion, doubtless the most <hi>glorious</hi> Employment that the <hi>largest</hi> Mind can undertake, is to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> it; and there is nothing can be <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>Godlike,</hi> than to sit at the <hi>Helm</hi> of this <hi>floating</hi> Universe, and <hi>steer</hi> its Motions to their Ends with a <hi>steady</hi> and <hi>unerring</hi> Hand. What therefore can God do more worthy of himself than to govern the World <hi>well</hi> and <hi>wisely?</hi> Or wherein can he better <hi>display</hi> the Glory of his <hi>own</hi> Perfections, than in keeping this <hi>mighty</hi> Engine in such an admirable <hi>Order,</hi> so as that though its Parts are infinite in <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Variety,</hi> and in their several Lines of Motion do frequenly <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>intersect</hi> each other, yet do they neither <hi>clash</hi> nor <hi>interfere, disturb</hi> nor <hi>confound</hi> one another, but in their different Functions mutually <hi>assist</hi> each other, and all <hi>conspire</hi> in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good, composing out of their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Discords</hi> a most elegant <hi>Harmony,</hi> in which mighty Performance there is scope enough for an infinite <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>exert</hi> its utmost <hi>Activity,</hi> for an infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi>

to <hi>employ</hi> its utmost <hi>skill,</hi> and for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Goodness</hi> to <hi>put forth</hi> its utmost <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that to undertake this Province of <hi>governing</hi> the World, is so far from being <hi>beneath</hi> the Majesty of God, that it would be an unpardonable <hi>Arrogance</hi> for any but a <hi>God</hi> to <hi>undertake</hi> it; and if <hi>Contrivance</hi> be the End of <hi>Wisdom, Action</hi> of <hi>Power, Beneficence</hi> of <hi>Goodness,</hi> as doubtless they are; where can the infinite <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God find a more <hi>ample</hi> Sphere for <hi>Action, Contrivance,</hi> and <hi>Beneficence</hi> than in the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the World? And if it be the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Exercise of Majesty to <hi>govern,</hi> what can better <hi>comport</hi> with the <hi>greatest</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty than to <hi>display</hi> it self in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>largest</hi> Dominion, which is that of the World?</p>
                  <p>BUT then considering that God himself is the <hi>Father</hi> of all this great <hi>Family</hi> of Beings, how can it be <hi>beneath</hi> his Majesty to <hi>take care</hi> of his own <hi>Off-spring?</hi> Why should it be below him to provide for any thing which was not below him to <hi>create?</hi> If there be any thing in this World so <hi>contemptible</hi> as not to deserve his <hi>Regard,</hi> why did he <hi>create</hi> it? If there be not, why should he <hi>disdain</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> it?


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60130:170"/>
And if every thing in this World hath some <hi>End</hi> for the sake of which God thought it <hi>worthy</hi> to be one of the <hi>Objects</hi> of his Creation, why should he not as well think the constant <hi>Direction</hi> of it to that <hi>End,</hi> to be an Object <hi>worthy</hi> of his <hi>Providence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II.

If there were a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> Providence over-ruling the World, how can it be imagined that it should ever <hi>permit</hi> so many <hi>Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as we every day behold in Mens <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> or suffer so many <hi>Calamities</hi> and <hi>Miseries</hi> to befall its Subjects? <hi>Both</hi> which as I shall shew you are very fairly <hi>consistent</hi> with a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>FOR as for the first, to wit, the <hi>moral</hi> Evils or Irregularities of Mens Manners, the <hi>Permission</hi> of them in the World is no <hi>more</hi> inconsistent with the <hi>Goodness</hi> of Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> than his <hi>making</hi> of <hi>free Agents</hi> was with the <hi>Goodness</hi> of his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For his Permission of <hi>sin</hi> is no more than his permitting <hi>free Agents</hi> to act <hi>freely,</hi> and according to that <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> wherewith he <hi>framed</hi> and <hi>created</hi> them; and why may he not as well <hi>permit</hi> them to act freely as <hi>create</hi> them to act freely? But to be <hi>essentially</hi> determined to <hi>good,</hi> so as not to have any <hi>natural</hi> Liberty to <hi>Evil,</hi> seems <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>State</hi> of a <hi>Creature</hi>; for there is no <hi>Will</hi> can be <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>essentially</hi>

determined to good, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by an <hi>infallible</hi> Mind; for whilst the <hi>Mind</hi> which is the Guide may possibly <hi>err,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> which is guided by it must be liable to <hi>go astray.</hi> Since therefore no <hi>Will</hi> can be <hi>essentially</hi> good but that which is <hi>guided</hi> by an <hi>infallible</hi> Mind, and since no Mind can be <hi>essentially</hi> infallible but one that is <hi>omniscient,</hi> it necessarily follows that to be <hi>free</hi> to Good and Evil is as <hi>natural</hi> to all reasonable Creatures, as to be <hi>finite</hi> in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>; and accordingly our Saviour declares that to be <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>essentially</hi> good is the <hi>incommunicable</hi> Prerogative of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> Luke 18.19. and if <hi>so,</hi> then either God must have made us <hi>free</hi> to Good and Evil, or <hi>not</hi> have made us <hi>at all,</hi> and there must have been no such Orders of Being as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> which are the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of all the Creation; and is it not much <hi>better</hi> that there <hi>should</hi> be <hi>such</hi> Beings, than that there should be <hi>no</hi> such thing as <hi>Liberty</hi> to Good and Evil? And if it were not inconsistent with the Divine Goodness to <hi>create</hi> free Agents, why should it be inconsistent with it to <hi>permit</hi> them to act <hi>freely?</hi> 'Tis true indeed <hi>we</hi> are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more <hi>free</hi> to Evil than the <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>some</hi> Angels perhaps were more free to it


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60130:173"/>
than <hi>others</hi>; but what then? Was God obliged in Goodness to make all Kinds of Beings <hi>equally perfect</hi>?

                  <p>IT is true, by partaking of <hi>both</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are not only <hi>free</hi> to Evil <hi>in

common</hi> with <hi>Angels,</hi> but also liable to <hi>strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Temptations to it than they; because we are placed in a tempting <hi>Body</hi> among a great many brutish <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites,</hi> and that Body is placed in a tempting <hi>World</hi> among a great many sensitive <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils,</hi> that are continually importuning <hi>those</hi> Appetites to <hi>mutiny</hi> against <hi>Reason,</hi> and to carry us away captive into <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi>; but to place us in <hi>this</hi> state is so far from being <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, that it is exactly <hi>pursuant</hi> to the <hi>Design</hi> of a most <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> Providence. For since we are placed by the <hi>Condition</hi> of our <hi>Natures</hi> in a <hi>lower</hi> Rank of Being and Perfection than <hi>Angels,</hi> we have no more reason to complain of <hi>that,</hi> than <hi>Ants</hi> or <hi>Flies</hi> have that they are not <hi>Men.</hi> But in this <hi>imperfect</hi> state the <hi>highest</hi> good that Providence could <hi>design</hi> us was to put us into a state of <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Probation,</hi> wherein by the <hi>good use</hi> of our Liberty we might by degrees <hi>fit</hi> our selves <hi>for</hi> and at length <hi>arrive to</hi> a <hi>better</hi> and more <hi>raised</hi> Condition, and by an <hi>orderly</hi> Progression from this <hi>rude</hi> and imperfect state, might in the <hi>different</hi> Periods of our Lives <hi>grow up</hi> into <hi>higher</hi> and more <hi>excellent</hi> Capacities, and at length ripen into Perfection.

it was tequisite we should be placed among <hi>Difficulties,</hi> without which no <hi>Proof</hi> can be made of our <hi>Virtues,</hi> of our <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Equanimity, Meekness</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi>; all which are proper to us as Beings made up of <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Brute</hi>; from the <hi>latter</hi> of which Natures all those <hi>brutal</hi> Appetites arise in us, in the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof consists the Nature of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi> So that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of our Life is intended by God for a <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Combat</hi> between our <hi>Sense</hi> and our <hi>Reason,</hi> our <hi>brutal</hi> and <hi>angelical</hi> Nature, and that the <hi>Victory</hi> of our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> might through the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of it be rendered more <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>rewardable,</hi> God hath furnished its <hi>Antagonist</hi> with the Weapons of worldly <hi>Temptation</hi> to <hi>assault</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> it, to try its <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>Mettle,</hi> and to exercise both its <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive</hi> Virtues; intending when it hath <hi>conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> to translate us <hi>hence</hi> as a <hi>Reward</hi> of our <hi>Victory</hi> into a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>disintangled</hi> state, where we shall be <hi>vexed</hi> and <hi>inticed</hi> no more with the <hi>Importunities</hi> of <hi>sensual</hi> Lust and Affection, but to all Eternity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Serenity and Pleasure of a <hi>pure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Nature.

not every way <hi>answerable</hi> to the Goodness of Providence? 'Tis true, instead of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering,</hi> we may, if we please, yield our selves <hi>captive</hi> to <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi>; but what then? Is Providence to be <hi>blamed</hi> for leaving Mens Hands at Liberty, because some have been so <hi>desperate</hi> as to cut their own Throats?

Intentions, and <hi>obstinate</hi> Resistance to his <hi>powerful</hi> Arts and Methods of <hi>preventing</hi> our Sin and Ruine.

                  <p>AND if the Evil of <hi>Sin</hi> be no way <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with the Goodness of Providence, much less is the Evil of <hi>Misery,</hi> since the <hi>Generality</hi> of those Evils which we <hi>suffer</hi> in this World are either the <hi>natural</hi> Effects, or the <hi>just</hi> Punishments, or the <hi>necessary</hi> Antidotes and Preventives of our sin.

yet it is to be considered that the <hi>true</hi> state of worldly <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> consists not in a <hi>great</hi> but in a <hi>moderate</hi> Fortune, and that the good things of this World are no where so <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> enjoyed, as in the <hi>middle Region</hi> between <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi>; for as Poverty is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Anguish,</hi> so Greatness is attended with <hi>Hurry</hi> and <hi>Tumult, impaled</hi> with Cares, and <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned</hi> with Pomp and tedious Ceremony; so that the <hi>truly</hi> unfortunate are the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous</hi> and the <hi>Great,</hi> while the <hi>middle</hi> State without partaking of the evils of <hi>either,</hi> includes all that is <hi>truly desirable</hi> in <hi>both</hi> Extremes; all that Poverty <hi>wants,</hi> and all that Greatness <hi>enjoys</hi>; and in <hi>this</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py state I dare boldly affirm there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably <hi>far more</hi> good Men than bad; For it is a very <hi>rare</hi> thing for a <hi>good</hi> Man that is <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>industrious,</hi> and <hi>depends</hi> upon God for a Blessing, to be reduced to <hi>extreme Necessity</hi>; so <hi>very rare,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> in all his life time could not produce one Instance of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.25. for <hi>miserable</hi> Poverty is usually the Consequence either of <hi>Idleness,</hi> or <hi>Luxury,</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> or <hi>Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>; all which are <hi>inconsistent</hi> with true Goodness; and a good Man in any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this side <hi>pinching</hi> Necessity, is

                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:60130:178"/>I.

To which in short I

answer, that in some extraordinary cases God <hi>hath</hi> interposed, of which there are innumerable Instances both in <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> History; but to expect that he should <hi>ordinarily</hi> and <hi>constantly</hi> do this, is very <hi>unreasonable,</hi> because it cannot be done without giving a perpetual <hi>Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance</hi> to the <hi>Course</hi> of Nature, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whole most <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>regular,</hi> full of admirable <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Contrivance,</hi> ought not to be <hi>disturbed</hi> and <hi>inverted</hi> upon ordinary Occasions. For if the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Course of things be <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in the <hi>whole,</hi> why should we expect that God should be perpetually <hi>tampering</hi> with it, and <hi>interrrupting</hi> and <hi>varying</hi> it by his immediate Interposals, as if he were <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with his own <hi>Contrivance,</hi> and upon every <hi>Revisal</hi> of this great Volume of the World, did still discover new <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes</hi> in it to be <hi>corrected</hi> and <hi>amended.</hi> The Evils therefore which <hi>good</hi> Men suffer are not ordinarily so <hi>momentous</hi> as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> God to <hi>interrupt</hi> the Couse of Nature to <hi>prevent</hi> them; and it is much better that <hi>some</hi> violences should be offered to good Men, than that a <hi>constant</hi> violence should be offered to the <hi>Nature of things</hi>; and since God can carry on his good Designs to good Men in a <hi>still</hi> and

                     <hi>silent</hi> Path, and cause all their <hi>adverse</hi> Accidents to <hi>unwind</hi> of themselves, and at last to <hi>clear up</hi> into a blessed Close, is it not much better he should do it this way, than by offering <hi>perpetual</hi> Violence and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance to Nature?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THE <hi>happening of all things alike to all</hi> is no Argument <hi>against</hi> a Providence, because the Goods and Evils of this World are so <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable,</hi> that it would be <hi>beneath</hi> the Wisdom of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be very <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> in the distribution of them.

or <hi>ill</hi> this moment, who immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must fare well or ill <hi>for ever</hi>; and therefore he looks on it, as he <hi>justly</hi> may, as a thing <hi>beneath</hi> his infinite Wisdom to be very <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> in dividing to us these <hi>momentary</hi> Trifles in <hi>just</hi> Proportions to our particular Deserts; and did we not strangely <hi>magnifie</hi> them, by looking on them through the <hi>false</hi> Opticks of our own <hi>fantastick</hi> Hopes and Fears, we should be so far from <hi>objecting</hi> against Gods <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> these <hi>unequal</hi> Distributions of them, that were they more <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> we should rather object against his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as thinking it a very <hi>mean</hi> Employment for a Deity to be very <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> in proportioning such <hi>momentary</hi> Enjoyments and Sufferings to the Merit or Demerit of <hi>immortal</hi> Creatures. So that consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what little moment the present <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> are which good Men <hi>suffer</hi> and bad Men <hi>enjoy,</hi> they ought rather to be lookt on as an Argument of Gods <hi>Wisdom</hi> than as an Objection against his <hi>Providence</hi>; for he understands the <hi>just</hi> value of things, and knows that the <hi>best</hi> of these worldly Goods are <hi>bad</hi> enough to be thrown away upon the <hi>worst</hi> of Men, and so expresses his just <hi>scorn</hi> of these <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired</hi> Vanities, by scattering them abroad

with a <hi>careless</hi> Hand; for why should <hi>he</hi> partake of the Errours of <hi>vulgar</hi> Opinion, and express himself so very <hi>regardful</hi> of these Trifles as to put them in gold Scales and weigh them out to Mankind by Grains and Scruples.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THAT <hi>all things here do happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all</hi> is no Argument against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, because this Life is properly the state of our <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Probation,</hi> and not of our <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Punishment.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence hath placed us here as <hi>Candidates</hi> and <hi>Probationers</hi> for those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Preferments it designs us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that so by <hi>training</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> us in all those excellent Virtues that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to our Natures, it may improve us from <hi>one</hi> degree of Perfection to <hi>another,</hi> 'till at last it hath <hi>accomplished</hi> us for the heavenly State; in order to which Design it is necessary that there should be an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi> Distribution of things, whereby good Men may sometimes <hi>suffer</hi> and bad Men <hi>prosper</hi>; otherwise there would be no <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> for any of our <hi>passive</hi> Virtues, nor any <hi>tryal</hi> of our <hi>active.</hi> For Affliction is the Theatre of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Resignation</hi> to God, and without it there would be no room in the Lives of good Men for the Exercise of these virtues, which


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60130:181"/>
for want of Objects to act on, would <hi>rust</hi> and wax <hi>languid.</hi> Again, Difficulty is the Touchstone of our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi>; but should Providence be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>crowning</hi> the Righteous, and <hi>drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> Offenders to Execution, such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure would <hi>determin</hi> our Liberty, and leave us no room for the Exercise of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi>; for then the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of Providence would be so <hi>sensibly</hi> and <hi>continually</hi> present with us, and so <hi>urgently</hi> press upon our Hopes and Fears, that it would be impossible for us <hi>not</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> in God, and next to impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible not to <hi>obey</hi> him; and being thus <hi>forced</hi> to believe and obey, what <hi>Excellency</hi> would there be in our Piety and Virtue? What <hi>Charity</hi> is it for a <hi>Miser</hi> to lend his Money upon Assurance of twenty <hi>per cent?</hi> Or what <hi>Loyalty</hi> for a <hi>Traitor</hi> to discover his <hi>Conspirators</hi> within sight of a Wrack? And just as little Virtue would there be in any of our good Works, were there an <hi>exact</hi> Equality in the Distributions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For then we should never do a <hi>good</hi> Work but upon the <hi>certain</hi> Prospect of an <hi>immediate</hi> Reward, nor <hi>repent</hi> of a <hi>bad</hi> one but upon the <hi>irresistible</hi> Dread of some <hi>immediate</hi> Punishment. But in this <hi>inequality</hi> of things wherein the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60130:181"/>
                     <hi>suffer</hi> and the wicked <hi>prosper,</hi> we are left in a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unconstrain'd</hi> Condition, and whether we are <hi>virtuous</hi> or <hi>vitious, devout</hi> or <hi>profane,</hi> it is out of <hi>Choice</hi> and not of <hi>Necessity.</hi> So that now to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> the sacred Dictates of Religion is <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>ingenuous,</hi> and our Faith and Obedience is our <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> because we believe and obey <hi>without</hi> Force and <hi>against</hi> Temptations and Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>AND as this <hi>unequal</hi> State of things is of absolute Necessity to <hi>try</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> our Virtues, so it is also very <hi>assistant</hi> thereunto. For that Providence doth <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> and not <hi>universally</hi> bless and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper good Men, is a great support to a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Belief. For as a late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Author hath well observed, if things were <hi>constantly</hi> managed one way without any <hi>variation,</hi> we might be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the World was under the <hi>rigid</hi> Laws of a <hi>fatal</hi> Necessity; if on the other side there were no <hi>Rule</hi> observed, no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of <hi>Method</hi> in the Dispensations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we might be tempted to believe that <hi>Chance</hi> rules the World; but when we observe that in the management of things there is an <hi>Intermixture</hi> of these two, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a <hi>general Rule,</hi> and that there


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60130:182"/>
are <hi>particular</hi> Exceptions from it, we have just reason to conclude that all is under a <hi>free</hi> Almighty Agent, that rules the World according to the Determinations of his own Will. As this way of Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>interweave</hi> into good Mens Fortunes <hi>Adversity</hi> with <hi>Prosperity,</hi> is in this respect very advantageous to their <hi>Faith,</hi> so is it also to the <hi>whole State</hi> of their Virtue; for as on the one hand a continued train of <hi>prosperous</hi> Events would be apt to <hi>bloat</hi> and <hi>elevate</hi> their Minds, so on the other a continued series of <hi>Adversity</hi> would be apt to <hi>sink</hi> and <hi>depress</hi> their Spirits, whilst this middle way of <hi>Interchange</hi> in their Condition <hi>balances</hi> them on both sides, and keeps them in an <hi>even, steddy</hi> and <hi>well-poized</hi> Temper. Since therefore this Life is the state of our <hi>Trial,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that an <hi>exact</hi> Equality of things would be a much stronger Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of Providence, than all these <hi>present</hi> Inequalities are against the <hi>Justice</hi> of it. For <hi>Hardships</hi> and <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are necessary to a state of <hi>Trial,</hi> and were good Men always <hi>blest</hi> and bad Men always <hi>punished,</hi> this Life instead of being a <hi>Probation</hi> to either would be the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the <hi>one</hi> and the Hell of the <hi>other</hi>; and since some <hi>Afflictions</hi> are necessary to


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60130:182"/>
try good Men, and some <hi>Prosperities</hi> to try bad, it would be a strange <hi>oversight</hi> of Providence, when it designs the Trial of <hi>both,</hi> to fix them in such a Condition, wherein no through Experment can be made of <hi>either.</hi> So that for us to object against Providence for making such <hi>unequal</hi> Distributions in a state wherein it designs our <hi>Trial,</hi> is in effect to object against <hi>Wisdom</hi> for acting most <hi>sutably</hi> to its <hi>own</hi> Designs.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. THAT <hi>all things here do happen alike to all</hi> is no Argument against Providence, because the Goods and Evils that befal us <hi>here,</hi> are not so truly to be estimated by <hi>themselves</hi> as by their <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</hi> For the divine Providence, which runs through all things, hath <hi>disposed</hi> and <hi>connected</hi> them into such a Series and Order, that there is no single <hi>Event</hi> or <hi>Accident</hi> but what is purely miraculous, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the <hi>whole</hi> System, and hath innumerable <hi>Causes</hi> antecedent to it, and <hi>innumerable</hi> Consequents attending it; and what these Consequents will be, whether <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> is beyond our Skill to <hi>prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticate</hi>; so that though the Event be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so good or bad <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> by it self, yet in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with all those Consequents that will most <hi>certainly</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

it. For wherein could the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence better express its <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> together, than by <hi>benefiting</hi> the good and <hi>punishing</hi> the bad by such <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable</hi> Methods?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. THAT <hi>all things here do happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all,</hi> is no Argument against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, because it is very <hi>requisite</hi> it should <hi>often</hi> do so, to assure us of a <hi>Judgment</hi> to come.

us in the Belief of the <hi>Justice</hi> of Providence, it was requisite the same <hi>plain</hi> Instances should be given of its Distinguishing the good from the bad by present <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi>; so to <hi>confirm</hi> us in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> it was no less requisite that there should be some In equality in the present <hi>Management</hi> and <hi>Distribution</hi> of things, and that the Goods and Evils of <hi>this</hi> World should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred with that exact Regularity as to prevent the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; but that there should be <hi>undecided</hi> Cases enough remaining for a <hi>future</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal to <hi>adjust</hi> and <hi>determine.</hi> So that as in the <hi>present</hi> management of things there is <hi>Equality</hi> enough to induce us to believe a <hi>just</hi> Providence; so there is also <hi>Inequality</hi> enough to induce us to <hi>expect</hi> a <hi>future Judgment</hi>; God having <hi>wisely</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in his <hi>present</hi> Administration of things, to give us Instances enough of his <hi>just</hi> Procedure towards the good and bad, and yet to leave us Instances enough of <hi>unrewarded</hi> Virtue and <hi>prosperous</hi> Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to assure us that he intends an <hi>after Reckoning.</hi> For how can we reflect upon these repeated Examples of just <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> which in every Age al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most God sets before us, and not believe

that he <hi>governs</hi> the World? And how can we reflect upon those <hi>manifold</hi> Evils which some good Men <hi>suffer,</hi> and Goods which some bad Men <hi>enjoy,</hi> without believing that he hath appointed a Day wherein he will <hi>adjust</hi> these <hi>Inequalities</hi> and <hi>vindicate</hi> the Cause of <hi>oppressed</hi> Virtue, and <hi>crush</hi> triumphant Wickedness into <hi>everlasting Confusion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. And lastly, <hi>That all things here do happen alike to all,</hi> is no Argument against Providence, because the <hi>exact</hi> Adjustment of things is reserved for a <hi>future Judgment.</hi> I confess were God to make no <hi>other</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution to the just and unjust, but what is made in <hi>this</hi> Life, the <hi>Inequality</hi> of it would be a <hi>strong</hi> Objection against his Providence; but then considering that all this <hi>cloudy</hi> Scene of things will shortly <hi>close up</hi> in a <hi>righteous</hi> Judgment, wherein for the Evils which the <hi>good</hi> have <hi>suffered</hi> they shall be awarded an <hi>eternal Happiness,</hi> and for the Goods which the <hi>bad</hi> have <hi>enjoyed</hi> they shall be doomed to <hi>everlasting Wretchedness,</hi> this is sufficient to vindicate the Justice of Providence were these <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Inequalities a <hi>thousand</hi> times greater than they are.

one <hi>bad</hi> Men were to live <hi>wretchedly</hi> but for a <hi>thousand</hi> years in this World; we might as well object against Providence this <hi>unequal</hi> Distribution of the <hi>melancholy</hi> Dream to the <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>pleasant</hi> one to the <hi>bad,</hi> notwithstanding the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thousand years of their <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> as we do the <hi>sufferings</hi> of the Righteous and <hi>Prosperities</hi> of the Wicked, which bear far <hi>less</hi> Proportion to that Eternity of Happiness and Misery that is to <hi>succeed</hi> them, than the <hi>Sorrow</hi> or <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of a Moments Dream doth to a thousand years <hi>real</hi> Calamity or Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>FOR the Providence of God from the <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>last</hi> is all but <hi>one</hi> continued Plot, like that of a <hi>well-contrived</hi> Comedy, which at first is very <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>intricate</hi>; so that by what is <hi>past</hi> or <hi>present</hi> there is no guessing at the Conclusion; for all through the <hi>intermediate</hi> Acts <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> fight their way through <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Disappointments,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Hero</hi> acts a <hi>sad,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Villain</hi> a <hi>prosperous</hi> Part, at which the <hi>unskilful</hi> Spectator <hi>grieves,</hi> and is ready to <hi>damn</hi> the Poet for distributing such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Fates; but then in the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>last</hi> Act all the cross Accidents <hi>clear up,</hi> and


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:60130:186"/>
issue in a <hi>fair</hi> Conclusion; and in the close of all, the Hero is <hi>crowned,</hi> and the Villain <hi>hissed off</hi> the Stage. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have but the patience to stay 'till Providence hath <hi>finished</hi> its <hi>whole</hi> Plot, and closed up all its <hi>mighty</hi> Scenes in the <hi>general</hi> Judgment of the World, and then we shall see all these <hi>Inequalities</hi> set <hi>right,</hi> and the Fates of good and bad Men <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> by a most <hi>just</hi> Award. But for us to <hi>quarrel</hi> at Providence <hi>now,</hi> who are yet got no farther, it may be, than to the <hi>middle</hi> of the great <hi>Drama,</hi> and to <hi>find fault</hi> with its Procedure for <hi>crossing</hi> the good and <hi>prospering</hi> the bad, is rudely to <hi>overturn</hi> the Stage before the <hi>Entrance</hi> into the <hi>fifth</hi> Act, and to <hi>hiss</hi> off the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> Poet for not <hi>compleating</hi> his Design before he is arrived to the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> And thus I have endeavoured to answer more <hi>at large</hi> this Objection against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, because it hath been <hi>more</hi> insisted on than any <hi>other,</hi> and hath more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>stumbled</hi> Mens Belief of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. And lastly, It is farther <hi>objected</hi> that the Being of a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Providence, is not to be reconciled with that <hi>wretched</hi> State and Condition to which we behold the <hi>greatest</hi> part of Mankind <hi>abandoned</hi>


                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:60130:187"/>
For if there were a good Providence that over-ruled the Affairs of this World, how is it imaginable that ever so <hi>great</hi> a part of Mankind as the <hi>Infidel World</hi> includes, should be left so utterly <hi>destitute</hi> as they are of the <hi>Knowledg of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Means</hi> of attaining their <hi>everlasting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> To which I shall briefly answer these three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. THAT the <hi>Infidel World</hi> is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps left so <hi>utterly</hi> destitute as we are apt to <hi>imagine</hi>; for they have the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> to <hi>direct</hi> them, by which alone they must be <hi>tried,</hi> and <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> at the Day of Judgment; which as to the <hi>main strokes</hi> of their Duty, is so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,</hi> that no <hi>sincere</hi> Inquirer can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it; and if when they <hi>may</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it they <hi>will</hi> not, or if when they <hi>do</hi> understand it, they wilfully <hi>transgress</hi> and <hi>violate</hi> it, the Divine Providence hath been sufficiently <hi>good</hi> to them to leave them for ever <hi>inexcusable.</hi> For so far as their Ignorance is <hi>invincible</hi> it is not their <hi>Sin,</hi> nor shall they ever be <hi>accountable</hi> for it, or for any sinful <hi>Omission</hi> or <hi>Commission</hi> thence proceeding, and if they only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for not <hi>understanding</hi> their Duty when they <hi>might,</hi> or for not <hi>performing</hi> it so far as they <hi>understood</hi> it, they can have


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60130:187"/>
no reason to complain that they are <hi>hardly dealt</hi> with. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As <hi>they</hi> have not those vast Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that <hi>we</hi> have of <hi>becoming</hi> good, and <hi>growing up</hi> into the state of Perfection and Happiness, so proportionably <hi>less</hi> Degrees of <hi>Good</hi> will be <hi>accepted</hi> of those that do <hi>well,</hi> and <hi>less</hi> Degrees of <hi>Punishment</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of those that do <hi>ill</hi>; for that Maxim of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. <hi>To whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever much is given, of him much shall be required,</hi> necessarily implies the <hi>contrary, viz.</hi> that to whomsoever <hi>less</hi> is <hi>given</hi> of him <hi>less</hi> shall be <hi>required</hi>; and if so, it is certain that so much as <hi>their</hi> means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good are less than <hi>ours,</hi> so much the less good God will accept of <hi>them</hi> than of <hi>us</hi>; and as God will accept less <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>best</hi> Infidels, so he will exact less <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>worst</hi>; for so our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath assured us, that it will be more tolerable for <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the last Day, than for those who persist in their <hi>Vnbelief</hi> and <hi>Disobedience</hi> in despight of the Proposals of the Gospel. If then in Proportion to their present <hi>Disadvantages</hi> less good will be <hi>accepted</hi> of those who make <hi>any</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and less Punishment <hi>exacted</hi> of them who make <hi>none,</hi> neither the <hi>one</hi>


                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:60130:188"/>
sort nor the <hi>other</hi> hath any reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; and though their Condition were <hi>worse</hi> than it is, yet under these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances it would be fairly <hi>consistent</hi> with the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Divine Providence. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And lastly, Though their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>were</hi> a great deal worse than it <hi>is,</hi> yet it would be very unreasonable for us to <hi>object</hi> it against the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the divine Providence, unless we <hi>better</hi> understood than we <hi>do,</hi> how God will dispose of them in the <hi>other</hi> World. Indeed if Mens <hi>Fate</hi> consisted in what they <hi>suffer</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> in this Life, we might better judg of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by what is <hi>before us</hi>; but since our <hi>main</hi> state is beyond the Grave, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befals us <hi>here</hi> is very inconsiderable, compared with what we must suffer or enjoy <hi>hereafter</hi>; and as for the <hi>present</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages which the heathen World lies under, they are but very <hi>short</hi> and <hi>momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> and if Providence <hi>pleases,</hi> it can abundantly <hi>compensate</hi> them in the <hi>World to come</hi>; and therefore since <hi>yet</hi> we know not what it <hi>will</hi> do, as having no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Case, it becomes us to <hi>suspend</hi> our Judgment 'till the <hi>Event</hi> hath <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:60130:188"/>THIS we know, that Providence hath <hi>ways</hi> enough, and <hi>time</hi> enough too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>this</hi> and the Day of Judgment, to supply these <hi>Destitute</hi> Souls with all those spiritual <hi>Advantages</hi> in the <hi>other Life,</hi> which for Reasons best known to it self it hath <hi>hitherto</hi> withheld from them; it may if it pleases extend their <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> beyond <hi>this</hi> Life, and discover in the <hi>other</hi> Life the Light of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to <hi>so many</hi> of them at least as have <hi>here</hi> made any tolerable Improvements under the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> and if they make good use of it, <hi>reward</hi> them accordingly. For though <hi>we</hi> Christians have no reason to expect any <hi>farther</hi> Trial after <hi>this</hi> Life is expired, because we have passed the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> Trial already, yet who knows but God may make a farther Trial of <hi>those</hi> in the other Life, upon whom the <hi>great</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the Gospel was yet <hi>never</hi> made; and therefore since Providence can <hi>yet</hi> be infinitely good to them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their wretched Condition <hi>at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and since for all we know it <hi>will</hi> be so, we ought not to object against it its <hi>present</hi> Disregard of them, till we see the <hi>final</hi> Issue of things; for that their <hi>present</hi> Condition is so <hi>bad</hi> is no ground for us to argue against Providence, unless we were


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60130:189"/>
sure it would <hi>never</hi> be <hi>better</hi>; because for all we know it may <hi>yet</hi> be rendered good enough not only to <hi>justifie,</hi> but to <hi>glorifie</hi> the Goodness of Gods Providence towards them.</p>
                  <p>AND now to conclude this <hi>great</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Since we see how <hi>necessary</hi> the Belief of Providence is to our being <hi>truly religious,</hi> and what <hi>unanswerable</hi> Evidence there is of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of it, what remains but that we heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by a <hi>calm, fixt,</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these things, throughly to <hi>instruct</hi> our selves in the <hi>Nature,</hi> and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>establish</hi> our selves in the <hi>Belief</hi> of it; For our Religion must necessarily <hi>ebb</hi> or <hi>flow</hi> according as it is influenced <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> by our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> of the divine Providence, which are the great Principles that <hi>move</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> it. For every Branch of the Divine Providence is an inexhaustible Fountain of religious <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Persuasion,</hi> and in this <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> Proposition, that God <hi>upholds</hi> and <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi> the World, there are a thousand times <hi>more</hi> Inducements to Piety and Virtue, than in all <hi>other</hi> Topicks in the World. But how <hi>pregnant</hi> soever it is with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how <hi>powerful</hi> soever its Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, 'tis impossible it should prevail

upon any reasonable Mind that <hi>understands</hi> not the <hi>Force</hi>; and <hi>believes</hi> not the <hi>Truth</hi> of it; for all the <hi>possible</hi> Access which <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Objects have to our Minds, is through our <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> of them, without which the most <hi>momentous</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals are no more capable of <hi>affecting</hi> us than one of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Orations is of calming the North wind; but he who firmly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>understands</hi> the full <hi>Emphasis</hi> of a Divine Providence, must necessarily be affected by it, if he be but within the <hi>Reach</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Persuasion; and unless his Will be <hi>impregnably</hi> fortified against all the Force of <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> he will find himself so <hi>besieged</hi> with Motives on every side persuading him to submit to the Obligations of Religion, that it will be almost impossible for him to <hi>defend</hi> himself against their <hi>powerful</hi> Importunities.

certainly <hi>reward</hi> him a thousand-fold if he doth <hi>well,</hi> and if he doth <hi>ill</hi> as certainly pursue him with a dire <hi>Revenge?</hi> This Belief carries with it such constraining <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Allurements</hi> as cannot but <hi>affect</hi> all reasonable Minds, and finally <hi>prevail</hi> with their <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> against all contrary Temptations. Wherefore if ever we would <hi>fix</hi> the Obligations of Religion upon our Minds, it concerns us above all things to be throughly <hi>instructed</hi> in the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> in the <hi>Belief</hi> of the divine Providence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the necessity of believing divine <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> in order to our being <hi>truly Religious.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HUMANE Nature is framed to move upon the Hinges of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and to be <hi>elicited</hi> and <hi>drawn forth</hi> in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either by the Proposal of some <hi>attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Good or Prospect of some <hi>avoidable</hi> Evil, the <hi>former</hi> of which begets Hope in us, and <hi>that</hi> Pursuit; the <hi>latter</hi> Fear, and that <hi>Flight</hi> and <hi>Avoidance</hi>; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find all Laws address to the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> of Men with Proposals of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> as to the <hi>Master-Springs</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of their Action, by which they are moved to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>forbear</hi> according as they are required and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. And indeed to give <hi>Laws</hi> to Men without inforcing them with <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> would be to leave it <hi>indifferent</hi> whether they <hi>obeyed</hi> them or <hi>no,</hi> which is <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Nature of Laws; for Laws <hi>necessarily</hi> imply an


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60130:191"/>
                  <hi>Obligation</hi> to Obedience; but what Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation could we have to obey them, did they leave it <hi>indifferent</hi> as to any Good or Evil accrewing from it, whether we <hi>obeyed</hi> them or <hi>no</hi>; for if it will be as well for us <hi>one</hi> way as <hi>t'other,</hi> what matter is it which way we determine our selves? And this holds good in nothing more than in the Matter of our Obedience to the Laws of <hi>Religion,</hi> to which our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature is above all things <hi>backward</hi> and <hi>averse</hi>; all that spiritual Exercise which those Laws require being quite against the Grain of our <hi>Earthy</hi> and <hi>sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Inclinations; so that were we not <hi>drawn</hi> to it by the <hi>Hope</hi> of Good, and <hi>driven</hi> by the <hi>Fear</hi> of Evil, to be sure our own <hi>bad</hi> natures would keep us at an <hi>eternal</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from it; but unless we believe God to be a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of those that <hi>obey,</hi> and a <hi>Punisher</hi> of those that <hi>despise</hi> him, we have no ground to hope for any <hi>Good,</hi> or to dread any <hi>Evil</hi> at his hands.</p>
               <p>For unless we believe that he will <hi>Crown</hi> those that serve him with some Mark of his <hi>Favour,</hi> how can we think he is <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> with them; there being no <hi>other</hi> way for him to express his being Pleased, but by Crowning 'em with some <hi>signal</hi> Reward; and if he be <hi>not</hi> Pleased with


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60130:191"/>
those that <hi>serve</hi> him, to be sure he is not <hi>Displeased</hi> with those that <hi>Neglect</hi> him; and if he be not <hi>Displeased</hi> with 'em, what Reason have we to apprehend that he will <hi>Punish</hi> 'em? Thus the <hi>unbelief</hi> of Gods being a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of those that <hi>obey</hi> him draws after it an <hi>unbelief</hi> of his being a <hi>Punisher</hi> of those that <hi>Despise</hi> him, and so on the contrary. For unless we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be so much <hi>concerned</hi> for his Service as to <hi>punish</hi> those that <hi>neglect</hi> it, we have no reason to think he is so much concerned for it as to <hi>reward</hi> those that <hi>embrace</hi> it. So that the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of Gods being a <hi>Rewarder</hi> and a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher</hi> do by necessary consequence <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> imply each other; and unless we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Both</hi> there is no reason we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Either.</hi> And when our nature is so <hi>averse,</hi> as it is, to his Service, what should <hi>induce</hi> us to <hi>serve</hi> him when we expect no <hi>Good</hi> from him, or <hi>hinder</hi> us from <hi>slighting</hi> him when we fear no <hi>Evil?</hi> And what is there can <hi>bring us home</hi> to God when we are <hi>carried away</hi> from him with an <hi>impetuous</hi> Tide of <hi>corrupt</hi> Inclinations, and have neither <hi>Hope</hi> nor <hi>Fear</hi> to Bound or Restrain it? So that considering the <hi>Aversation</hi> of our Nature to Gods service, it is morally impossible


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:60130:192"/>
we should ever be heartily <hi>reconciled</hi> to it without being Drawn with the <hi>Hope</hi> of Reward, and Driven with the <hi>Fear</hi> of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>In the Prosecution of this Argument I shall indeavour to shew,</p>
               <p>First, How <hi>far</hi> it's necessary that our <hi>Belief</hi> of divine <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> should <hi>extend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What <hi>Evidence</hi> there is to induce us to <hi>believe</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By what <hi>Means</hi> this is to be <hi>Begotten</hi> and <hi>Confirmed.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I. How <hi>far</hi> it is necessary that our <hi>belief</hi> of divine <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> should <hi>extend.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FOR to induce us to submit to the Obligations of Religion, it is by no means <hi>sufficient</hi> that we believe in the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> that God will <hi>Reward</hi> us if we do well, and <hi>Punish</hi> us if we do wickedly. For this we may <hi>firmly</hi> believe, and yet at the same time prefer the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of sin as


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60130:192"/>
much <hi>greater</hi> Goods than the <hi>Rewards</hi> of Vertue, and Dread the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as much <hi>greater</hi> Evils than the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> of sin; wherefore to Render our Belief of divine Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments an <hi>Effectual</hi> Principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion these four things are necessary.</p>
                  <p>First, That we should believe that God is so <hi>far</hi> a Rewarder of those that serve him, and so <hi>far</hi> a Punisher of those that neglect him, as to make a <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Distinction between them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Considering how <hi>Promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> the Goods and Evils of this World are <hi>distributed</hi> among Good and Bad men, it's necessary we should believe, That there is a <hi>Future</hi> state of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is necessary we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve those <hi>Future</hi> Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be such as do <hi>Infinitely</hi> Transcend any Good we can <hi>Reap</hi> by our sins, and any Evil we can <hi>Incur</hi> by doing our Duty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is necessary we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is no <hi>other</hi> way for us to <hi>Avoid</hi> those Punishments but by <hi>forsaking</hi> our sins, or to <hi>Acquire</hi> those Rewards but by <hi>submitting</hi> to our Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:60130:193"/>I. IT is necessary we should believe that God is so <hi>far</hi> a Rewarder of those that serve, and so <hi>far</hi> a Punisher of those that Neglect him, as to make a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> distinction between them. For unless we believe that God makes <hi>some</hi> Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between those <hi>serve</hi> and those that <hi>neglect</hi> him, we shall <hi>Confound</hi> Good and Evil in our own Apprehensions, and look upon all humane actions as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> and thereby dissolve all the <hi>Ties</hi> and <hi>Obligations</hi> of Religion. For things are in <hi>Themselves,</hi> as they are in the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Esteem</hi> of God, who cannot be <hi>mistaken</hi> in Estimating their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and therefore unless there be some Distinction between <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> in the Esteem of <hi>God,</hi> rhey must be all <hi>Alike</hi> and <hi>Indifferent</hi> in their <hi>Own</hi> natures. And if all Actions are Indifferent in <hi>themselves,</hi> we are <hi>free</hi> from all the Ties and Obligations of Religion, and 'tis left <hi>Indifferent</hi> to us whether we will <hi>Worship</hi> God or <hi>Blaspheme</hi> him. So that unless we believe that <hi>God</hi> makes some <hi>Distinction</hi> between the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> Religion can have no force <hi>at all</hi> upon our minds.</p>
                  <p>But now there is no other way for God


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60130:193"/>
to <hi>Distinguish</hi> between <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> but by <hi>Rewarding</hi> and <hi>Punishing</hi> them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if he make any Distinction in his <hi>Affections</hi> between us, we may be sure his <hi>Love</hi> will incline him to <hi>Reward,</hi> and his <hi>Hatred</hi> to <hi>Punish</hi> us; and since 'tis as <hi>Easie</hi> to him to <hi>follow</hi> his Inclination as <hi>not,</hi> since he can Reward where he Loves, and Punish where he Hates without any <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance</hi> to his own <hi>Happiness,</hi> what should <hi>hinder</hi> him from doing it, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that he really <hi>loves</hi> or <hi>hates,</hi> or makes <hi>any</hi> Distinction in his Affections between those that <hi>serve</hi> and those that <hi>neglect</hi> him? So that unless he Reward the <hi>one</hi> and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the <hi>other,</hi> he can make no <hi>Visible</hi> Distinction in his Affections between them. If he be <hi>Contrarily</hi> affected to Good and Bad men, his <hi>Affections</hi> will infallibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his <hi>Actions</hi>; but if he use them <hi>Alike,</hi> it is plain they are <hi>Alike</hi> to him. So that unless we believe that God <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes</hi> between Good and Bad men by Rewarding and Punishing them, we must look upon Both as <hi>Indifferent</hi> to him, and believe that he concerns himself neither with the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>other</hi>; and if we think it is Indifferent to <hi>God</hi> whether we are <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad,</hi> to be sure it will not be Indifferent to <hi>us,</hi> whose natures are so


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60130:194"/>
                     <hi>Biassed</hi> with <hi>Bad</hi> Inclinations, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither Hope nor Fear to <hi>Restrain</hi> them, will Run towards <hi>Bad</hi> Objects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Rub</hi> or <hi>Interruption.</hi> And what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood is there that <hi>we</hi> who are so <hi>Prone</hi> and <hi>Inclinable</hi> to evil, should <hi>concern</hi> our selves in the service of God, whilst we look upon it as a thing <hi>Indifferent</hi> to him whether we <hi>serve</hi> him or <hi>no</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to the <hi>subduing</hi> our minds to the Obligations of Religion, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary we should believe that God is so <hi>far</hi> a Rewarder of Good, and Punisher of Bad Men, as to make a <hi>sensible</hi> Distinction between them, and demonstrate that he is <hi>differently</hi> affected towards them. For to what end should we serve a God that takes <hi>no notice</hi> of us, that <hi>regards</hi> not what we do, but sits above in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as an <hi>unconcerned</hi> spectator of our Actions; why should we <hi>cross</hi> our own inclinations, and <hi>forsake</hi> our beloved lusts, for his sake, when it is altogether <hi>Indifferent</hi> to him <hi>what</hi> we do, or <hi>whither</hi> we go, or what <hi>becomes</hi> of us?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Considering how <hi>Promiscuously</hi> the Goods and Evils of this life are <hi>distributed</hi> among Good and Bad Men, it is necessary that we should believe there is a <hi>Future</hi> state of Rewards and Punishments. For


<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60130:194"/>
though <hi>sometimes</hi> in <hi>this</hi> life God rewards Good men, and punishes Bad with such <hi>signal</hi> and <hi>Remarkable</hi> Goods and Evils as are sufficient Indications of the vast Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction he makes between them, yet this is <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and besides the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> and <hi>Regular</hi> Course of his Providence, which for <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses doth ordinarily <hi>scatter</hi> Good and Evil among men with an <hi>open</hi> and <hi>undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing</hi> hand; insomuch that as the Wise man observes, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>No man knoweth either Love or Hatred by all that is before him; all things come alike to all, there is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked, and as is the Good so is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and he that sweareth as he that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an Oath; this is an evil among all things that are done under the Sun that there is one Event to all.</hi> Since therefore Gods <hi>love</hi> of Good men and <hi>Hatred</hi> of Bad appears not by any thing <hi>before us,</hi> we must either conclude that they are <hi>both</hi> Indifferent to him, which would be to <hi>Rase</hi> the very <hi>Foundations</hi> of Religion, or that there is a <hi>Future</hi> state of Rewards and Punishments wherein there will be no more such <hi>Promiscuous</hi> Distributions, no more such <hi>Cross-coupling</hi> of Prosperity with <hi>Vice,</hi> and Misery with <hi>Virtue,</hi> but all


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60130:195"/>
things will be Adjusted <hi>sutably</hi> to mens <hi>Deserts</hi> and <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and those that are Good <hi>Advanced</hi> to immortal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Honour, and those that are Bad <hi>Deprest</hi> into eternal Shame and Confusion. For the Difference which God makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the <hi>present</hi> course of his Providence is too <hi>small</hi> and <hi>indiscernable</hi> to induce us to believe that he makes <hi>any</hi> Difference between them in his <hi>Esteem</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi>; and therefore either we must believe that there is <hi>another</hi> state wherein he makes a <hi>far wider</hi> difference between them, or conclude that they are both <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> to him, and that he hath no more Regard to the <hi>one</hi> than the <hi>other,</hi> or that he hath no Regard at all to <hi>Either,</hi> which as I shewed before, utterly <hi>dissolves</hi> the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. IT is necessary we should believe those Future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be <hi>such</hi> as do Infinitely <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend</hi> any Good we can <hi>reap</hi> in our sinful <hi>neglect</hi> of God and any Evil we can <hi>incur</hi> by our <hi>submission</hi> to him. 'Tis true, were our natures <hi>equally</hi> inclined to <hi>submit to</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> him, we should need <hi>no more</hi> Good and Evil to move us <hi>one</hi> way than <hi>t'other</hi>; but the <hi>same</hi> Proportion of <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> which tempts us now to


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60130:195"/>
                     <hi>Forsake</hi> and <hi>Abandon</hi> him, would equally tempt us to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, this is far from <hi>our</hi> case; for in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> to God we move <hi>counter</hi> to our selves, we <hi>cross</hi> the <hi>Grain</hi> of our <hi>Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Nature, and <hi>run away</hi> from our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Inclinations; whereas in <hi>forsaking</hi> him, we <hi>Row</hi> with the <hi>Tide,</hi> and are <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on</hi> with an <hi>impetuous</hi> current of sinful Lusts and Affections; and the case being thus, the temptations on the <hi>one</hi> side <hi>must</hi> be incomparably <hi>greater,</hi> if ever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, than they <hi>need</hi> be on the <hi>other.</hi> For Men are <hi>easily</hi> tempted to act in <hi>compliance</hi> with their <hi>own</hi> Inclinations; and the <hi>smallest</hi> Goods or Evils that can be proposed to 'em from without, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>induce</hi> 'em to do what they have a <hi>mind to</hi>; but to <hi>prevail</hi> with a Man to do that which he is extreamly <hi>averse</hi> to, to act <hi>against</hi> Nature, and live in <hi>defiance</hi> with his own Inclinations, requires a <hi>mighty</hi> force of <hi>outward</hi> temptation; and it must be a very <hi>great</hi> Good that he will not <hi>lose,</hi> a very <hi>formidable</hi> Evil that he will not <hi>incur,</hi> rather than enter into any course of action that is <hi>irksom</hi> and <hi>ungrateful</hi> to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that unless we believe the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> World to be <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably</hi> greater than all the <hi>pleasures</hi> of


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60130:196"/>
Sin, and all the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Piety and Virtue, there will not be force <hi>enough</hi> in our Faith to <hi>persuade</hi> us; because <hi>those</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Goods and Evils move <hi>against</hi> Nature, and persuade us to a course of life we are extreamly <hi>averse</hi> to, whereas <hi>these</hi> present ones <hi>join hands</hi> with our Inclinations, and find a ready <hi>concurrence</hi> in our wills and affections; and a very <hi>small</hi> temptation will prevail against a <hi>great</hi> one, when it hath Nature, that <hi>Bosom Orator,</hi> to <hi>solicite</hi> and <hi>plead for</hi> it. Wherefore unless we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of the <hi>future</hi> state to be such as <hi>infinitely</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh those <hi>present</hi> Goods and Evils that tempt us to sin, they will never be able to prevail against 'em; because they must not only out-tempt <hi>them,</hi> but, which is the much harder task of the two, they must out-tempt the <hi>Reluctances</hi> of our <hi>Degenerate</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet for <hi>future</hi> Goods and Evils to out-tempt <hi>present</hi> ones is not so <hi>easie</hi> a matter neither; especially if <hi>those</hi> future ones are <hi>invisible</hi> and out of the Ken of our <hi>sense,</hi> which is the case here. For <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity</hi> lessens all Objects to the <hi>Mind,</hi> even as <hi>distance</hi> doth to the <hi>Eye,</hi> and makes things appear to us much <hi>smaller</hi> than they are in their <hi>own</hi> natures; So that the <hi>futurity</hi> of the Rewards and Punishments


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60130:196"/>
of the <hi>other</hi> life are a mighty <hi>disadvantage</hi> to 'em when they stand in competition with <hi>present</hi> Goods and Evils; because the <hi>later</hi> appear to us in their <hi>full</hi> Proportion, and Magnitude, with <hi>all</hi> their tempting circumstances about 'em, whereas the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> exhibit to us a <hi>dim</hi> and <hi>confused</hi> Landskip of things <hi>afar off,</hi> of things which we never <hi>saw</hi> nor <hi>felt,</hi> and which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their <hi>distance</hi> imprint very <hi>dark</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's on our minds. And as their Futurity <hi>lessens</hi> their appearance, and renders it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> and <hi>indistinct,</hi> so their Invisibility <hi>weakens</hi> their <hi>force</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> on our minds, which no Objects can so <hi>nearly</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as those that strike upon our <hi>Senses.</hi> So that unless by an <hi>immense</hi> magnitude they <hi>compensate</hi> for being <hi>future</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,</hi> it is impossible they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with such minds as <hi>ours</hi> against <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> Goods and Evils. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to render our belief of a future State <hi>effectual</hi> to reduce us to God and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it's <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of it to be <hi>infinitely greater</hi> than all the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> that can tempt us to Sin; and that not only because our natures are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>averse</hi> to that which <hi>these</hi> Rewards and Punishments tempt us to, but because


<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60130:197"/>
the Goods and Evils which tempt us the <hi>contrary</hi> way have the <hi>prevailing</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of being <hi>present</hi> and <hi>sensible.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. FROM the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God's <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> That <hi>Mankind</hi> is under the <hi>Government</hi> of God, is evident from that Law which he hath <hi>imprinted</hi> on our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which our actions are <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd</hi> into <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Vitious</hi>; of which sufficient proof hath been given, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. and since God hath <hi>given</hi> a <hi>Law</hi> to our natures, there is no doubt to be made but he hath taken sufficient care to <hi>inforce</hi> the <hi>observance</hi> of it by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> otherwise his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over us would be very <hi>insecure</hi> and <hi>precarious.</hi> For that <hi>Law giver</hi> doth only <hi>Petition</hi> his Subjects to <hi>obey,</hi> who doth not <hi>promise</hi> such <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>denounce</hi> such <hi>penalties</hi> as are sufficient to <hi>oblige</hi> 'em thereunto.</p>
                  <p>BUT now there is no <hi>Reward</hi> can be <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to oblige us to <hi>obey,</hi> which doth not abundantly <hi>compensate</hi> any <hi>loss</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> we may <hi>sustain</hi> by our <hi>obedience</hi>; no <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> sufficient to <hi>deter</hi> us from <hi>disobeying</hi> that doth not far <hi>surmount</hi> all the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> and <hi>Pleasures</hi> which we can hope to <hi>reap</hi> from our <hi>Disobedience</hi>; but unless

there be a <hi>future</hi> state, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can propose no <hi>such</hi> Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to us. For if we have nothing to <hi>dread</hi> or <hi>hope for</hi> beyond the <hi>Grave,</hi> our <hi>present</hi> interest is <hi>all</hi> our concern, and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we ought to judg things to be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> according as they <hi>promote</hi> or <hi>obstruct</hi> our <hi>temporal</hi> happiness.

It is <hi>ordinarily</hi> better for me to be an <hi>honest</hi> Man than a <hi>Knave</hi>; it is more for my <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>usually</hi> for my <hi>Profit</hi> too; and it is more for the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good</hi> in which my <hi>own</hi> is involved; but yet in <hi>several</hi> circumstances it may be better for me with respect only to <hi>this</hi> World to be a <hi>Knave</hi> than an <hi>honest</hi> Man. For whensoever I can cheat so <hi>secretly</hi> and <hi>securely</hi> as not to fall under the <hi>publique</hi> lash nor impair my <hi>reputation,</hi> and I can <hi>gain</hi> more by the <hi>Cheat</hi> than I shall <hi>lose</hi>


                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:60130:201"/>
in the damage of the <hi>Publique,</hi> it will be doubtless more <hi>advantageous</hi> for me as to my <hi>worldly</hi> interest to <hi>cheat</hi> than to be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi>; and how often such <hi>fair</hi> opportunities of <hi>cozenage</hi> do occur, no Man can be insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that hath but the <hi>least</hi> insight into the affairs of this World. So that if there were no <hi>future</hi> Rewards and Punishments, this great <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> would not have force enough <hi>universally</hi> to oblige us; because there are a world of instances wherein we might <hi>gain</hi> more <hi>good</hi> and <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew</hi> more <hi>evil</hi> by doing <hi>unrighteously,</hi> than all its <hi>present</hi> Rewards and Punishments do amount to. And the same may be said of all <hi>other</hi> laws of Nature, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>great</hi> motives of <hi>future</hi> happiness and misery can no <hi>longer</hi> induce Men to obey 'em than it is for their <hi>temporal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to do so. For suppose I can secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>stab</hi> or <hi>poison</hi> a Man whom I <hi>hate</hi> or <hi>dread,</hi> or from whose death I may reap any considerable <hi>advantage,</hi> what should <hi>restrain</hi> me from it? If you say the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> pray what <hi>Reward</hi> doth the Law of Nature <hi>propose</hi> that is sufficient to <hi>compensate</hi> for the <hi>disatisfaction</hi> of my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> or for the <hi>danger</hi> I run in suffering my <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>live</hi>; or what <hi>punishment</hi> doth the Law of Nature <hi>denounce</hi> that


<pb n="377" facs="tcp:60130:201"/>
can <hi>ballance</hi> the <hi>advantage</hi> of a thousand or perhaps ten thousand pounds a year that may <hi>accrew</hi> to me by his death?</p>
                  <p>IF you say the Law of Nature <hi>proposes</hi> to me the reward of a <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> Mind, and <hi>denounces</hi> the punishment of a <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>amazed</hi> Conscience; I easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that this <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>horror</hi> which is consequent to the <hi>forbearance</hi> or <hi>commission</hi> of sin, arises from the <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> of <hi>future</hi> Rewards and Punishments; which being taken away, to <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>not</hi> sin will be <hi>indifferent</hi> as to any <hi>peace</hi> or <hi>horror</hi> that can follow upon it; and when <hi>this</hi> restraint is taken off, what <hi>consideration</hi> will there be left that is sufficient to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> me from the <hi>bloody</hi> fact, when ever I have an opportunity to act it <hi>securely,</hi> and am <hi>furiously</hi> spurred on to it by my own <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> and <hi>Covetousness?</hi> So that if there be no Rewards and Punishments in <hi>another</hi> life to <hi>inforce</hi> the commands of the Law of Nature, it's certain that there are no such annex'd to it in <hi>this</hi> as are <hi>universally</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to <hi>oblige</hi> us to observe 'em. For as for the Goods and Evils of <hi>this</hi> life, they are <hi>ordinarily</hi> distributed among Men with so little <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>discrimination,</hi> as not only to <hi>occasion</hi> but to <hi>justifie</hi> that famous observation of the Wise Man, that <hi>all


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60130:202"/>
things happen alike to all.</hi> Either therefore there are <hi>other</hi> Goods to be hoped for, and <hi>other</hi> Evils to be feared, or there are a world of <hi>cases</hi> wherein God hath not <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently</hi> provided to <hi>secure</hi> our obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi>; and to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God should <hi>give</hi> a Law to his Creatures, and take no care to <hi>secure</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of it, is a most <hi>sensless</hi> Blasphemy of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his <hi>Government</hi>; for this would be to <hi>expose</hi> his own Authority to <hi>contempt,</hi> and to <hi>cast</hi> his Laws at the <hi>feet</hi> of his Creatures to be <hi>spurned</hi> and <hi>trampled on</hi> by 'em at their pleasure.</p>
                  <p>IF it be Objected, that all that this Argument proves, is, that to <hi>secure</hi> our <hi>obedience</hi> to the Law of Nature, it's <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> we should <hi>believe</hi> that there are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rewards and Punishments; but that it doth not hence follow that 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> that there should <hi>be</hi> future Rewards and Punishments; because whether there <hi>be</hi> any such things or <hi>no,</hi> our <hi>belief</hi> of 'em will be <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>secure</hi> the Authority of the Law; I answer, That if our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of future Rewards and Punishments be <hi>necessary,</hi> one of these two things must inevitably follow; either that the Objects of our Belief are <hi>real,</hi> which is the thing I am proving, or that to <hi>countenance</hi> the


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60130:202"/>
Authority of his Laws, it's necessary for God to <hi>impose</hi> upon our faith, and <hi>deceive</hi> us into the belief of a <hi>falshood.</hi> For if to <hi>inforce</hi> God's Law, it's necessary we should <hi>believe</hi> that there are future Rewards and Punishments, either there must <hi>be</hi> such things <hi>really existing,</hi> or God must inforce his Law with <hi>our</hi> belief of a falshood; and to imagin, that when God <hi>might</hi> have created for us a <hi>future</hi> state of Reward and Punishment, if he had so <hi>pleased,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned us by the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of it, he hath rather chosen to govern us by <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Lyes,</hi> and to <hi>wheedle</hi> us into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by a <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>delusion,</hi> is a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my no less <hi>sensless</hi> than <hi>horrid.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>secure</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of that Law by which the humane Nature is to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, it is necessary that it should be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd</hi> with the motives of <hi>everlasting</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Punishment, one of these three things <hi>necessarily</hi> follows; either that God hath not <hi>sufficiently</hi> inforc'd his Law, which is a <hi>soul</hi> imputation on his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or that he is <hi>fain</hi> to inforce it with a <hi>Lye,</hi> which is an <hi>impious</hi> reflection on his <hi>Truth,</hi> or that there <hi>are</hi> everlasting Rewards and Punishments.</p>

For without <hi>Justice,</hi> over-ruling power is nothing but an <hi>impotent Tyranny,</hi> whch to attribute to God is far more <hi>dishonourable</hi> and <hi>incongruous</hi> to the nature of his perfections, than to strip him of <hi>all</hi> Providence, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> did, and <hi>shut</hi> him up in the heavens in a state of everlasting <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi> For <hi>not</hi> to Govern, is only to <hi>do Nothing</hi>; but to Govern without <hi>Justice,</hi> is to do <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi>; and 'tis a much <hi>less</hi> Derogation from the Perfection of any Being, to suppose it to be <hi>Idle</hi> than to suppose it to be <hi>Mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</hi> So that allowing that God, who is the most <hi>perfect</hi> of all Beings, <hi>governs</hi> the World, it would not be only <hi>Blasphemous,</hi> but <hi>Nonsense</hi> to imagine that he governs it <hi>unjustly.</hi> Now the proper <hi>justice</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> consists in the <hi>Equality</hi> of its <hi>Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions</hi>; for since there is such a thing as <hi>immutable</hi> Good and Evil in the actions of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> Agents, it is naturally <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>due</hi> that those who <hi>do</hi> good should

                  <p>THOUGH the <hi>evidences</hi> of future Rewards and Punishments be such as are <hi>sufficient</hi> to convince any <hi>reasonable</hi> mind, yet it is evident that in this <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> state of our natures there is a <hi>strong</hi> repugnancy to the <hi>lively</hi> belief of them, insomuch that the <hi>bare</hi> proposal of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not sufficient <hi>effectually</hi> to persuade us; wherefore before we dismiss this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:60130:213"/>
it will be neeessary to add to what hath been said such <hi>means</hi> and <hi>directions,</hi> as, together with the <hi>evidences,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>dispose</hi> our minds to the <hi>effectual</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the future state; and these I shall reduce to these four particulars,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. IF we would <hi>effectually</hi> believe the future state of Rewards and Punishments, we must <hi>fix</hi> and <hi>inure</hi> our minds to <hi>serious</hi> thoughts and considerations. For whilst our minds are taken up with <hi>fancies</hi> and <hi>levities,</hi> with <hi>wild</hi> or <hi>ludicrous</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent</hi> Ideas, or entertained with the <hi>cares</hi> or <hi>pleasures</hi> of <hi>this</hi> life, they will not be <hi>at leisure</hi> to turn their thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>another</hi> World. For to think <hi>close</hi> of another World requires a very <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>thoughtful</hi> mind; because the <hi>other</hi> World doth not press upon our <hi>Senses</hi> as <hi>this</hi> World doth, which wheresoever we turn our selves is <hi>continually</hi> thrusting its <hi>Objects</hi> into our minds through our <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> and whispering to our thoughts through the <hi>Organs</hi> of our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> which are the most <hi>immediate</hi> Entries and Inlets to our Mind. So that the other World being <hi>quite</hi> out of sight, and this <hi>always</hi> in view, it is as difficult for us to keep the one <hi>out</hi> of our Minds as to let the other <hi>in.</hi> For before we can set our


<pb n="401" facs="tcp:60130:213"/>
selves to think <hi>closely</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> World, we must <hi>shut</hi> our Eyes and Ears to the Objects of <hi>this</hi>; otherwise they will <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude</hi> themselves upon us, and <hi>draw away</hi> our thoughts and meditations; we must <hi>gather in</hi> our thoughts from the Objects of Sense that are round about us, <hi>take leave</hi> of this World, and <hi>retire</hi> into our own minds, and <hi>shut up</hi> our selves within our selves, that none of these sensitive things may <hi>come at</hi> us, and that we may be <hi>wholly</hi> at leisure to <hi>entertain</hi> our selves with the <hi>invisible</hi> things of another World. And this we shall never be able to do so long as our Minds are <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>roving,</hi> and <hi>desultory,</hi> and possess'd with <hi>wild</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations or <hi>restless</hi> cares or <hi>extravagant</hi> mirth and Jollities; for these things will put our thoughts upon so many <hi>vagaries,</hi> and render them so <hi>loose,</hi> and <hi>wild,</hi> and <hi>incoherent,</hi> that they will never be able to <hi>hang</hi> long enough <hi>together</hi> to form any <hi>serious</hi> conceptions. So that when we would <hi>fix</hi> them upon the other World we shall scarce be able to <hi>gather</hi> them <hi>in</hi> from those outward Objects among which they are <hi>squandered</hi>; or if we <hi>do,</hi> we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>keep</hi> them long enough <hi>together</hi> to form any <hi>serious</hi> apprehensions of it; but as soon as they have taken a <hi>cursory</hi> view of


<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60130:214"/>
it, they will be <hi>flying abroad</hi> again, and <hi>roving</hi> into vanity and impertinence. So that while our Minds are <hi>light</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> they cannot think <hi>enough</hi> of another World <hi>seriously</hi> to apprehend and believe it; the Rewards and Punishments of that <hi>invisible</hi> state are things too serious for our <hi>wild</hi> thoughts to <hi>dwell on</hi>; and 'till our minds are grown more <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>steady,</hi> till they are more <hi>withdrawn</hi> from sensitive Objects, and more <hi>accustomed</hi> to <hi>retired thinking,</hi> they will be too <hi>volatile</hi> and <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive</hi> seriously to <hi>apprehend,</hi> and heartily to <hi>believe</hi> a future state. If therefore we would attain to a <hi>firm</hi> belief of it, we must indeavour to <hi>reclaim</hi> our <hi>wild</hi> thoughts by accustoming our selves to <hi>serious think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and when by <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have rendred our minds more <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>retired,</hi> we must</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Indeavour to <hi>remove</hi> those <hi>vicious</hi> prejudices which <hi>indispose</hi> us to the <hi>belief</hi> of future Rewards and Punishments. For while men live in opposition to God, and have therefore reason to apprehend his <hi>displeasure,</hi> this will <hi>strongly</hi> prejudice our minds against the <hi>belief</hi> of a future state; because this belief must necessarily <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>disturb</hi> us, and render our <hi>vicious</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses extremely <hi>troublesom</hi> and <hi>uneasie.</hi> For

when a Man is <hi>resolved</hi> to lead an <hi>ill</hi> course of life, and at the same time <hi>believes</hi> it will conclude in eternal wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, his <hi>faith</hi> will be a perpetual <hi>plague</hi> to his Mind, like <hi>Belteshazzars Mene Tekel</hi> it will <hi>scare</hi> and <hi>alarm</hi> him in his <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Carouses, and <hi>imbitter</hi> the gust of them with many a <hi>sad</hi> thought and <hi>dire</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; and 'till he either shakes hands with his <hi>Creed,</hi> or his <hi>ill Resolution,</hi> it will be impossible for him ever to be <hi>quiet.</hi> Whilst therefore he <hi>resolves</hi> to <hi>continue</hi> his ill courses, it is his <hi>interest</hi> to believe there is <hi>no</hi> other World but <hi>this</hi>; he is <hi>obliged</hi> to it in his <hi>own defence,</hi> and as he <hi>hopes</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> without <hi>disturbance</hi>; and then his interest having <hi>bribed</hi> his <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> his affection will be sure so to <hi>biass</hi> his <hi>reason,</hi> that it will be a difficult matter for him to <hi>convince</hi> and <hi>persuade</hi> himself. For if there be future <hi>Rewards,</hi> he knows he hath no <hi>interest</hi> in them; if future <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,</hi> he is conscious he must <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>indure</hi> them; and to <hi>believe</hi> that there are such <hi>goods</hi> as he shall never be the <hi>better</hi> for, and such <hi>evils</hi> as he shall be infinitely the <hi>worse</hi> for, must needs be <hi>extremely</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to his inclinations. For that which men would <hi>not have,</hi> they are <hi>averse</hi> to <hi>believe</hi>; and that which they


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:60130:215"/>
are averse to believe they are not easily <hi>convinced of,</hi> because their <hi>aversion</hi> will cast such a <hi>mist</hi> before their minds as that they will hardly be able to <hi>discern</hi> a fair <hi>Probability</hi> in a clear <hi>Demonstration.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ever you would arrive at a <hi>firm</hi> belief of the future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you must indeavour to <hi>dispel</hi> from your minds those <hi>prejudices</hi> against it with which your own <hi>ill</hi> courses are apt to <hi>inspire</hi> you, by resolving with your selves to <hi>lay aside</hi> your sinful <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>interests</hi> while you are <hi>examining</hi> the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of another World, and not to suffer them to <hi>intermingle</hi> with your <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>; concluding that in a matter of such <hi>infinite</hi> moment 'tis the greatest <hi>madness</hi> in the world to <hi>think</hi> as you <hi>wish</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> as you <hi>affect</hi>; that 'tis not <hi>your</hi> unbelief will either <hi>extinguish</hi> the joys of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>quench</hi> the flames of <hi>Hell,</hi> and that since the nature of things will not <hi>bend</hi> to <hi>your</hi> wishes, and <hi>be</hi> as <hi>you</hi> would have them, it is your <hi>true</hi> interest to <hi>believe</hi> that they are <hi>what</hi> they are, especially in a matter of such infinite concern to you; that if Heaven and Hell are not <hi>dreams</hi> but <hi>realities,</hi> you will most certainly <hi>find</hi> them so whatever you <hi>think</hi> of them, and that therefore it concerns you as <hi>much</hi> as


<pb n="405" facs="tcp:60130:215"/>
an eternity of happiness or misery <hi>amounts</hi> to, to <hi>believe</hi> that they are <hi>real</hi> if they <hi>are</hi> so, lest out of a vain <hi>confidence</hi> that there are <hi>no</hi> such things, you <hi>forfeit</hi> Heaven and <hi>incur</hi> Hell fire. With such thoughts as <hi>these</hi> you must often <hi>encounter</hi> those <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> which <hi>sin</hi> raises in your minds; and when once you have <hi>conquer'd</hi> them, and <hi>reduced</hi> your minds to an <hi>impartial</hi> desire of being <hi>rightly informed</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in order to that, to give an <hi>equal hearing</hi> to the reasons on <hi>both</hi> sides, you are fairly <hi>prepared</hi> for the <hi>belief</hi> of another World, which cannot <hi>fail</hi> to obtain upon your understandings, if</p>
                  <p n="3">III. YOU <hi>duly</hi> examine those <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>credibility</hi> upon which those future Rewards and Punishments are <hi>proposed.</hi> For though <hi>Faith be the gift of God,</hi> yet it is a <hi>gift</hi> which he <hi>confers</hi> upon us as he doth all his <hi>other</hi> blessings, in the use of <hi>due</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> means; and as it is <hi>the blessing of the Lord that makes rich,</hi> but not without the concurrence of the <hi>diligent hand,</hi> so 'tis the <hi>grace</hi> of God that gives us <hi>faith,</hi> but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>our</hi> application to the <hi>natural</hi> means.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:60130:216"/>
                     <hi>proposed.</hi> For though the matter be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so evident in <hi>it self,</hi> yet it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>us</hi> 'till we have duly <hi>considered</hi> it; and if we <hi>believe</hi> without <hi>evidence,</hi> we believe with our <hi>wills,</hi> and not with our <hi>understandings</hi>; whereas in <hi>reality</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is properly an act of the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> whereby it <hi>assents</hi> to a thing as <hi>true,</hi> which it cannot do without some <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> that it <hi>is</hi> so; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we assent to things as true with our <hi>wills</hi> without our <hi>understandings,</hi> or, which is the same thing, without <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> we cannot so properly be said to <hi>believe,</hi> as <hi>not</hi> to <hi>disbelieve</hi> them. For there are a world of things which men do neither <hi>deny</hi> nor <hi>affirm, believe</hi> nor <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe,</hi> that is, about which they never <hi>concern</hi> their thoughts, nor <hi>trouble</hi> their heads one way or t'other. And thus it is here; there are many who <hi>pretend</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> another World, but if you ask them <hi>why,</hi> they can give no <hi>reason,</hi> nor did they ever <hi>enquire</hi> whether there be <hi>any</hi> to be <hi>given</hi>; so that it is plain whatever they <hi>imagine,</hi> they do not <hi>believe</hi> it; for to <hi>believe</hi> without <hi>understanding,</hi> is as perfect nonsense as to <hi>understand</hi> without <hi>evidence,</hi> or <hi>believe</hi> without <hi>faith.</hi> So that <hi>that</hi> which they call <hi>faith,</hi> is only <hi>not disbelieving</hi>;

                  <p>The natural <hi>means</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> therefore, you see, is a due <hi>enquiry</hi> into the <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the things we believe; and therefore if we would <hi>indeed</hi> believe that there is a future World of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments, we must seriously <hi>consider</hi> the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>evidences</hi> that <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>assert</hi> it, and <hi>urge</hi> them <hi>close</hi> to our <hi>understandings,</hi> 'till they have <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>extorted</hi> from them a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>well-grounded</hi> assent; which if we <hi>do,</hi> laying aside all <hi>partiality</hi> and <hi>prejudice,</hi> there is no doubt but they will be found <hi>weighty</hi> enough to <hi>turn the Scale</hi> against all <hi>Objections</hi> to the contrary; especially if</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And lastly, You add to all these means <hi>fervent</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Prayer. For Prayer in <hi>it self</hi> is a very <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> means to <hi>beget</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> in us the <hi>belief</hi> of the other World, because it is an <hi>abstraction</hi> of the mind from those <hi>sensitive</hi> and <hi>material</hi> objects which stand


<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60130:217"/>
like hills and mountains <hi>between</hi> us and the invisible World, and <hi>intercept</hi> our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> of it. For whenever our mind is engaged in a <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> prayer, it <hi>dispels</hi> all earthly things before it, and <hi>scatters</hi> them out of sight, and having no <hi>Mists</hi> or <hi>Clouds</hi> in its way, nothing but a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> heaven above it, <hi>thither</hi> it directs its <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Desires</hi> without any <hi>lett</hi> or <hi>interruption.</hi> Now the very <hi>withdrawing</hi> our minds from <hi>sensible</hi> things to converse with <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> ones, doth, as I shewed before, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>dispose</hi> us to the belief of another World. When therefore by <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> prayer our minds have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to <hi>retire</hi> from the objects of sense, and to <hi>fix</hi> their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations</hi> upon God, they will be able to turn themselves with more <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness</hi> to the <hi>invisible</hi> things of another World, which the more <hi>familiar</hi> they are to us, the better able we shall be to <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But then, by our <hi>fervent</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> prayers we shall also obtain the <hi>assistance</hi> of God, without the <hi>concurrence</hi> of whose <hi>grace</hi> we can do no <hi>good thing,</hi> and much less <hi>effectually</hi> believe the Rewards and Punishments of another life, which is the

                     <hi>root</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of all true Piety and Virtue. For to the forming a <hi>firm</hi> belief of this Doctrine in our minds, there is required a very <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is <hi>founded</hi>; and considering how <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>roving</hi> our thoughts are, how apt to <hi>fly off</hi> from any <hi>serious</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and especially from <hi>this</hi> of another World, which is so <hi>offensive</hi> to our vicious <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> what likelihood is there that we should ever <hi>fix</hi> our mind to such a <hi>through</hi> examination of the Proofs of another World as is necessary to <hi>beget</hi> in us a <hi>lively</hi> belief of it, unless God, who alone can <hi>command</hi> our thoughts, <hi>co-operates</hi> with us, and <hi>animates</hi> our <hi>faint</hi> indeavours with his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi>; unless he by <hi>sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> the evidences of the future state to us, and by <hi>urging</hi> and <hi>repeating</hi> them, <hi>imprints</hi> them on our minds with all their natural <hi>force</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi>; in a word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by <hi>following</hi> our <hi>flying</hi> thoughts with these his <hi>holy</hi> inspirations, and <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning</hi> them <hi>with,</hi> and almost <hi>forcing</hi> them <hi>upon</hi> them, he at last prevails with them to <hi>stay</hi> and <hi>look back</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> and <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> to ponder the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of them, it is very improbable they should ever <hi>abide</hi> long enough upon our minds


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:60130:218"/>
to <hi>settle</hi> into a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>efficacious</hi> belief. Let us therefore <hi>earnestly</hi> implore the <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> of God, and <hi>beseech</hi> him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to <hi>inspire</hi> our minds with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> of a future life, and to <hi>urge,</hi> and <hi>repeat</hi> and <hi>set</hi> them <hi>home</hi> upon our thoughts, 'till by a <hi>due</hi> consideration of them we have <hi>extracted</hi> all their <hi>force</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> and <hi>digested</hi> it into a <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>active</hi> belief; and if to the use of all the abovenamed means you do but add this of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication,</hi> you may <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi> upon it, that he who hath promised to <hi>open</hi> unto all that <hi>knock,</hi> and to be <hi>found</hi> of all that <hi>seek</hi> him, will never <hi>deny</hi> you any <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>assistance</hi> that is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to produce in you this <hi>fundamental</hi> Principle of Religion, <hi>viz,</hi> an <hi>effectual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Argument therefore, since <hi>this</hi> belief is so <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary to <hi>subject</hi> our minds to the <hi>obligations</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, let us endeavour as much as in us lies, to <hi>found</hi> it in our <hi>reason,</hi> by <hi>convincing</hi> our minds of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of those <hi>evidences</hi> upon which it is <hi>proposed.</hi> For while we <hi>believe</hi> upon <hi>trust</hi> and we know not <hi>why,</hi> our faith must needs be very <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>infirm,</hi> and like a Tree without

root in the midst of a storm, be unable to <hi>outstand</hi> any <hi>blast</hi> of temptation. For the temptations of <hi>sin</hi> are such <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>evils</hi> as are evident to our <hi>senses,</hi> which do most <hi>certainly</hi> assure us that there are such things in the World as <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>profit, reproach</hi> and <hi>persecution</hi>; and therefore unless when we are <hi>tempted,</hi> our <hi>faith</hi> can <hi>confront</hi> the evidence of <hi>Sense</hi> with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of <hi>Reason,</hi> and produce <hi>good</hi> proof of those <hi>future</hi> Goods and Evils which it puts in the ballance against these <hi>present</hi> temptations, it will hardly be able to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> 'em. For what likelihood is there that the things which we <hi>believe</hi> without <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> should have compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that <hi>force</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> upon us, as the things which we <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>? So that when we come to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> a Heaven and a Hell of whose <hi>reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>existence</hi> we have <hi>no</hi> evidence, to <hi>pleasures</hi> or <hi>profits, reproaches</hi> or <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which strike <hi>immediately</hi> on our <hi>senses,</hi> it is easie to <hi>prognosticate</hi> which will be most <hi>prevalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT if our <hi>belief</hi> of the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments be <hi>founded</hi> on such <hi>evidence</hi> as satisfies our <hi>reason,</hi> what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the World is there that can <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> against it; what <hi>good</hi> is there that can


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60130:219"/>
                     <hi>outbid</hi> Heaven, or what <hi>evil</hi> that can <hi>vie</hi> terrours with Hell? For we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the Objects of our <hi>faith,</hi> when it is grounded upon <hi>satisfactory</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, do as <hi>much</hi> influence our minds as the Objects of <hi>sense</hi>; they who never saw the <hi>Indies</hi> unless it were in a <hi>Map,</hi> and so can only <hi>believe</hi> that there are such Countries, are yet as <hi>much</hi> affected with the rich Merchandize they abound with as those who have been <hi>there,</hi> and as <hi>ready</hi> to venture their <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through the <hi>danger</hi> of the Sea, in hope of a <hi>prosperous</hi> return. If therefore we believe that there is such a <hi>state</hi> as <hi>Heaven,</hi> with as <hi>full</hi> satisfaction of mind as we do that there is such a <hi>place</hi> as the <hi>Indies,</hi> doubtless our <hi>Faith</hi> would affect us as much as our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and we should be as <hi>forward</hi> to go to Heaven and venture through all <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>difficulties</hi> thither, as if we had been there <hi>already</hi> and had <hi>seen</hi> with our own Eyes all the <hi>Glories</hi> and <hi>Delights</hi> it <hi>flows</hi> and <hi>abounds</hi> with. So that the evidence of our <hi>Faith,</hi> if it be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>satisfactory,</hi> will as much <hi>affect</hi> our minds as the evidence of our <hi>sense</hi>; and <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> will as <hi>vigorously</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> if with a <hi>full</hi> satisfaction of mind we <hi>believe</hi> 'em, as if


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60130:219"/>
we had <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>felt</hi> 'em. Conceive then that you had spent but <hi>one</hi> hour in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, surveying</hi> with your own Eyes the <hi>glories</hi> of that <hi>Place,</hi> the <hi>Triumphs</hi> and <hi>Exultations</hi> of its blessed <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> and the <hi>rapturous</hi> Joys and delights wherewith it <hi>entertains</hi> 'em; conceive that after this you had been sent for <hi>another</hi> hour into <hi>Hell,</hi> and had there been <hi>spectators</hi> of the <hi>horrors</hi> and <hi>agonies</hi> of the damned, of their <hi>torture,</hi> and <hi>rage,</hi> and <hi>dire</hi> convulsions of <hi>Soul,</hi> caused by a <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>remediless</hi> misery; in a word, conceive that after <hi>all,</hi> you had been dismiss'd into this World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to <hi>choose</hi> your own fate and <hi>determine</hi> your selves to <hi>that</hi> happy or <hi>this</hi> miserable portion for ever; think now what your <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> would be; whether you would not be willing to <hi>lose</hi> any thing rather than <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to <hi>endure</hi> any thing rather than <hi>Hell</hi>; whether <hi>any</hi> good or evil sin can <hi>tempt</hi> you withal, would be able to <hi>out-tempt</hi> the Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of Eternity. Doubtless no; the <hi>remembrance</hi> you would have of the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> Joys and <hi>intolerable</hi> Miseries you saw in that other World, would prove an <hi>invincible</hi> Antidote against <hi>all</hi> tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now what your <hi>sense</hi> of the other World would be if you had <hi>seen</hi> it, that


<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60130:220"/>
will your <hi>belief</hi> of it be, when 'tis <hi>found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> upon <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>satisfactory</hi> evidence; 'twill be an <hi>infallible</hi> Counter-charm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the most <hi>bewitching</hi> temptations; 'twill render the <hi>greatest</hi> goods <hi>dreadful</hi> to us that <hi>becken</hi> us to Hell, and the <hi>greatest</hi> evils <hi>desireable</hi> that <hi>drive</hi> us towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For <hi>Faith,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. that is, <hi>it</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders its <hi>invisible</hi> Objects as <hi>real</hi> and <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to us, as our <hi>sense</hi> doth <hi>visible</hi> ones; and when Heaven and Hell are become as <hi>evident</hi> to our <hi>faith</hi> as sensible things are to our <hi>senses,</hi> what good or evil is there in all the World that can <hi>out-tempt</hi> 'em? For what <hi>good</hi> is there so <hi>good</hi> as Heaven, or what <hi>evil</hi> so <hi>bad</hi> as Hell? So that if our <hi>belief</hi> of the future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be but <hi>founded</hi> on such <hi>evidence</hi> as gives a <hi>full</hi> satisfaction to our minds, 'twill <hi>draw</hi> our Souls to God like an <hi>invincible</hi> Loadstone, in despight of all the <hi>opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of temptations from <hi>without,</hi> and of all the <hi>counter-strivings</hi> of a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>within</hi>; and there is nothing in the World will be able to <hi>withstand</hi> it; no <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> that sin can <hi>promise</hi> or <hi>threaten</hi> that will have the power to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi> its <hi>Almighty</hi> persuasions, but 'twill

                  <p>WHEREFORE if ever we mean to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage</hi> our selves from the <hi>slavery</hi> of sin, and entirely to <hi>devote</hi> our selves to God and his Service, let us in the use of the above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Means endeavour to <hi>establish</hi> our minds in a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>well-grounded</hi> belief of the other World; that so our <hi>faith</hi> being built upon a <hi>sure</hi> foundation of <hi>Reason,</hi> may be able to <hi>outstand</hi> all the <hi>waves</hi> of temptation, and to chase all those goods and evils before it that <hi>stand</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> of our <hi>return</hi> to God; and when by our <hi>faith</hi> we have so far <hi>overcome</hi> the <hi>World</hi> as to <hi>submit</hi> and <hi>resign</hi> our selves to God in <hi>despight</hi> of all its temptations, we shall find our <hi>belief</hi> of the other World every day <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> upon our hands, 'till at last it <hi>commences</hi> into a <hi>certain</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

on the <hi>other.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our wills are <hi>taken off</hi> by a <hi>free</hi> resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of 'em to God, all that sinful <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> which renders us <hi>now</hi> so <hi>averse</hi> to believe, will vanish from our minds; and <hi>then</hi> we shall see things as they <hi>are,</hi> and the <hi>arguments</hi> of another World will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to our minds with such a <hi>convincing</hi> evidence, as will quickly <hi>dispel</hi> all our <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>uncertainties,</hi> and render our <hi>Faith</hi> equivalent to a clear <hi>Vision.</hi> So that we shall pass through all the temptations of the World with the same <hi>constancy</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> of Soul, as if we walked in <hi>open view</hi> of Heaven and Hell, and these <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Objects which do so infinitely <hi>transcend</hi> all the Goods and Evils which sin can <hi>tempt</hi> us withal, will have as <hi>victorious</hi> an influence on our lives as if they were <hi>present</hi> and did strike <hi>immediately</hi> on our senses. And then how is it possible that <hi>any</hi> temptation whatsoever should be able to cope <hi>with</hi> or prevail <hi>against</hi> 'em?

When therefore we are <hi>drawn</hi> to God by such <hi>invincible</hi> hopes and fears as

the <hi>firm</hi> belief of the other World will <hi>sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest</hi> to us, how is it possible that any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of sin should either <hi>dissuade</hi> us from <hi>coming</hi> to him, or <hi>persuade</hi> us to <hi>forsake</hi> him?

thirdly, that we <hi>direct</hi> our Services to a right <hi>end</hi>; fourthly, that we be <hi>furnished</hi> with sufficient <hi>motives</hi> to <hi>engage</hi> us to serve him; the want of either of which will prove an <hi>irreparable</hi> flaw in the very <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of our Religion, and render the whole not only <hi>infirm</hi> but <hi>defective</hi> in its very constitution. And in all these <hi>respects right Apprehensions</hi> of God are <hi>indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> necessary.</p>
                  <p>First, They are necessary to <hi>inform</hi> us what <hi>Services</hi> are <hi>pleasing</hi> to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are necessary to <hi>inspire</hi> us with the true <hi>Principle</hi> upon which we must serve him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are necessary to <hi>direct</hi> us to the true <hi>end</hi> for whieh we must serve him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are necessary to furnish us with proper <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>encouragements</hi> to <hi>engage</hi> us to serve him.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. A <hi>right apprehension</hi> of God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to <hi>instruct</hi> us what <hi>services</hi> are <hi>pleasing</hi> to God. For to be sure nothing can be pleasing to him but what is <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>perfections</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> which are the <hi>Originals</hi> from whence the <hi>eternal</hi> Laws of Religion are <hi>transcribed</hi>; unless there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know what his perfections <hi>are,</hi> how is it possible we should know what


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60130:223"/>
                     <hi>services</hi> are <hi>agreeable</hi> to 'em? If you would serve a Prince <hi>gratefully</hi> and <hi>acceptably,</hi> you must inform your self beforehand what his <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>disposition</hi> is, that so you may <hi>accommodate</hi> your self thereunto, and <hi>compose</hi> your actions and behaviour accordingly; that you may <hi>furnish</hi> him with <hi>fresh</hi> pleasures if he be <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous,</hi> or blow him up with <hi>flatteries,</hi> if he be <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>vainglorious</hi>; that if he be <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>tyrannical,</hi> you may <hi>spunge</hi> and <hi>oppress</hi> his people and <hi>drein</hi> their <hi>wealth</hi> into his Coffers; if <hi>just</hi> and <hi>benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> you may <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> him in <hi>righting</hi> the injuries, <hi>correcting</hi> the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and <hi>alleviating</hi> the burthens of his Subjects. And thus if you would <hi>serve</hi> the great King of the World in such ways as are <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, you must <hi>study</hi> his <hi>Nature,</hi> and endeavour to <hi>enform</hi> your selves which way his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perfections do <hi>incline</hi> him, that so you may know how to <hi>comport</hi> your selves towards him and to <hi>render</hi> him such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as are <hi>agreeable</hi> to his Nature. For there is no <hi>rule</hi> in the World but onely that of his <hi>Nature,</hi> by which you can <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> conclude what will <hi>please</hi> him; and though he hath told you by express <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> what <hi>services</hi> he <hi>expects</hi> and what


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:60130:224"/>
will <hi>please</hi> him, yet without recurring to the <hi>rule</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> you can never be <hi>secure</hi> either that what he told you is <hi>true,</hi> or that what he told you was pleasing to him <hi>then,</hi> is still pleasing to him <hi>now.</hi> For how can you be secure either that he told you <hi>truly</hi> what Services were <hi>pleasing</hi> to him, but only from the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of his Nature, or that the Services which were pleasing to him <hi>then,</hi> are pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him <hi>now,</hi> but from the <hi>stability</hi> and <hi>unchangeableness</hi> of his Nature. So that in our <hi>enquiries</hi> after what is <hi>pleasing</hi> to God, we cannot depend upon his <hi>Word</hi> without consulting his <hi>Nature,</hi> which is not only the <hi>Security</hi> but also the <hi>Test</hi> of his Word. For it's certain that <hi>that</hi> cannot be God's <hi>Word</hi> which <hi>contradicts</hi> his <hi>Nature,</hi> and what <hi>plausible</hi> pretence soever any Doctrine may make to <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> if it <hi>teach</hi> or <hi>command</hi> any thing that is apparently <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>divine Perfections,</hi> we ought for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude it an <hi>Imposture</hi>; it being much <hi>more</hi> possible that the most <hi>plausible</hi> pretence to <hi>Revelation</hi> should be <hi>false,</hi> than that God should <hi>reveal</hi> any Doctrine that is <hi>repugnant</hi> to his <hi>Nature.</hi> So that in all our Enquiries what is <hi>pleasing</hi> to God, our <hi>last appeal</hi> must be to his <hi>Nature,</hi> which


<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60130:224"/>
is the great <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> by which we are to <hi>measure</hi> what is <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>displeasing</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>WHILST therefore we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of God's Nature, or possessed with <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>false</hi> apprehensions of it, we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily <hi>wander</hi> in the <hi>dark,</hi> and neither know <hi>what</hi> to <hi>do</hi> nor <hi>how</hi> to <hi>behave</hi> our selves towards him. For how can we <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine</hi> what will <hi>please</hi> or <hi>displease</hi> a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>unknown</hi> Nature, whose <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> we are utterly <hi>unacquainted</hi> with; but if we are under <hi>false</hi> apprehensions of his Nature, <hi>they</hi> must necessarily <hi>mislead</hi> us in our <hi>behaviour</hi> towards him, and put us upon <hi>false</hi> ways of <hi>serving</hi> and <hi>pleasing</hi> him. Thus if we apprehend him to be a <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>testy</hi> Being, that is apt to be <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>displeased</hi> with <hi>Trifles,</hi> in <hi>conformity</hi> to our apprehension of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we shall offer him a <hi>trifling</hi> Service, a Service made up of <hi>Pageantry</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,</hi> of <hi>pompous</hi> shew and <hi>ceremonious</hi> respects and <hi>empty</hi> formalities; For such a <hi>trifling</hi> Worship is in it self most <hi>proper</hi> for such a <hi>humorous</hi> Divinity. So if we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him to be of an <hi>imperious</hi> and <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> nature, that governs <hi>himself</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> by a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>obstinate</hi> Will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the <hi>eternal reasons</hi> of


<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60130:225"/>
things, we shall worship him as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> do their <hi>arbitrary</hi> Devils, <hi>i. e.</hi> follow him with <hi>houlings</hi> and <hi>lamentations,</hi> with <hi>trembling</hi> hearts and <hi>frighted</hi> looks, and <hi>dismal</hi> tones, and by <hi>flattering</hi> him with <hi>praises</hi> and <hi>fauning</hi> upon him with <hi>slavish</hi> submissions and addresses endeavour to <hi>collogue</hi> with Heaven, and <hi>ingratiate</hi> our selves with its <hi>dreadful</hi> Majesty; for what can be more <hi>agreeable</hi> to such a <hi>tyrannical</hi> Divinity than such a <hi>forc'd</hi> and <hi>slavish</hi> Worship? In a word, if we apprehend him to be a <hi>fond</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> Being, that is governed by a <hi>foolish</hi> pity and <hi>blind</hi> commiseration, we shall not fail to render him a <hi>sutable</hi> Worship, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>retire</hi> and grow <hi>melancholly,</hi> to <hi>whine</hi> and <hi>bemoan</hi> our selves; to <hi>deject</hi> our looks and <hi>disfigure</hi> our countenances, and <hi>teaze</hi> our Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fits of <hi>fruitless</hi> compunction, that so by the <hi>soft</hi> Rhetorick of a <hi>well-acted</hi> sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we may <hi>pierce</hi> his bowels and <hi>melt</hi> him into <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi> towards us; for what can be more <hi>prevalent</hi> with such a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> Deity, than such a <hi>mournful</hi> and <hi>passionate</hi> Religion? Thus whilst we have <hi>wrongful</hi> apprehensions of God, they must necessarily <hi>mislead</hi> us into <hi>false</hi> ways of Worship, because we can no otherwise worship him than by <hi>rendering</hi>


                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:60130:225"/>
him <hi>such</hi> Services as are <hi>sutable</hi> to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions we have of his <hi>Nature</hi>; and therefore while we think any <hi>otherwise</hi> of his Nature than <hi>it is,</hi> we must necessarily think such Services <hi>sutable</hi> to it as <hi>are not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT if we <hi>truly</hi> understand what God <hi>is,</hi> we cannot but apprehend what Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is <hi>sutable</hi> to him, by that Eternal <hi>congruity</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>things</hi> and <hi>things</hi>; which is as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to mens <hi>minds,</hi> as sounds and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to their <hi>ears</hi> and <hi>eyes.</hi> If God be a Being endowed with <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, every Mans mind will tell him that between such an <hi>Object</hi> and such <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> there is a <hi>natural</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, and therefore <hi>so</hi> and <hi>so</hi> he ought to be <hi>treated</hi> and <hi>address'd to,</hi> with <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> actions and affections to be <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> and <hi>worship'd.</hi> So that if we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God <hi>truly</hi> as he <hi>is,</hi> circled with all his natural <hi>glories</hi> and <hi>perfections,</hi> our <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> will produce in us such <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and our affections such <hi>deportment</hi> and <hi>behaviour</hi> towards him as are <hi>sutable</hi> to the perfections of his Nature, and we shall worship him with <hi>such</hi> Services as will both <hi>please</hi> and <hi>become</hi> him; with <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring</hi> thoughts and <hi>dutiful</hi> wills and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>

affections; with an <hi>ingenuous</hi> fear, a <hi>humble</hi> confidence and an <hi>obedient</hi> love; with <hi>chearful</hi> Praises and <hi>profound</hi> Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with <hi>sober, wise</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; such as will <hi>wing</hi> and <hi>employ</hi> our <hi>best</hi> affections and most <hi>noble</hi> faculties; For 'tis such a <hi>Worship</hi> only that can <hi>sute</hi> such <hi>Perfections</hi> and <hi>please</hi> such a <hi>Nature</hi> as Gods.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. A <hi>right apprehension</hi> of God is also necessary to <hi>inspire</hi> us with the best <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of serving him. For it's certain that there is no Principle in humane Nature that will so <hi>effectually</hi> engage us to the <hi>service</hi> of God, or render our <hi>service</hi> so <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, as that of <hi>Love</hi>; which will tune <hi>our</hi> wills into such an Harmony with <hi>Gods,</hi> that we shall no longer <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> according to our particular <hi>likings</hi> and <hi>dislikings,</hi> but what is most <hi>pleasing</hi> or <hi>displeasing</hi> to <hi>him</hi> will be so to <hi>us</hi>; and <hi>our</hi> wills being thus <hi>united</hi> and <hi>subjected</hi> to <hi>his,</hi> our obedience will extend to <hi>all</hi> his Commands, and admit no other <hi>bounds</hi> but his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we do not obey him out of <hi>love,</hi> we shall indeavour to <hi>contract</hi> our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into as <hi>narrow</hi> a compass as may be, because we shall render it to him with a <hi>grudging</hi> mind, and consequently with a


<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60130:226"/>
                     <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>stingy</hi> hand; for we shall serve him no farther than we are <hi>driven</hi> by <hi>fear</hi> and the <hi>restless</hi> importunities of a <hi>clamorous</hi> conscience, and so consequently fall <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> short of our duty, and take up in a <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>hypocritical</hi> obedience. For while we do not <hi>love</hi> him, it is impossible we should <hi>obey</hi> him with a <hi>ready</hi> will, which is the proper <hi>seat</hi> of his <hi>Empire</hi>; and while we obey him with a <hi>stubborn</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> will, we are only his <hi>slaves,</hi> but the Devils <hi>subjects.</hi> 'Till therefore we do <hi>obey</hi> him, at least in some measure, from a Principle of <hi>love,</hi> it is impossible our obedience should be either <hi>universal</hi> or <hi>sincere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the <hi>inspiring</hi> our Souls with this <hi>Principle,</hi> there is nothing more necessary than <hi>right apprehensions</hi> of God, who in himself is doubtless the most <hi>amiable</hi> of beings, as having all those Perfections in <hi>infinite</hi> degrees that can <hi>beget</hi> or <hi>deserve</hi> a rational affection. So that we cannot think him to be any way <hi>otherwise</hi> than he <hi>is,</hi> without thinking him <hi>less</hi> lovely, and <hi>detracting</hi> more or less from the infinite <hi>beauty</hi> of his Nature; For since he cannot be <hi>more</hi> lovely than he is <hi>in himself,</hi> every <hi>false</hi> apprehension of him must needs represent him <hi>less</hi> lovely.


<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60130:227"/>
But since of all his Perfections that of his <hi>Goodness</hi> is the most <hi>powerful</hi> motive and ingagement of <hi>Love,</hi> there is nothing more necessary to <hi>kindle</hi> our love to him than <hi>right apprehensions</hi> thereof. For being <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> good, as he is, in his own Nature, it is impossible we should conceive him to be <hi>better</hi> than he is; and therefore every <hi>false</hi> notion we entertain of his <hi>goodness</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily <hi>detract</hi> from it, and so much as we detract from his <hi>goodness,</hi> so much we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the <hi>principal</hi> reason and motive of our loving him. And therefore in order to the ingaging of our <hi>love</hi> to him, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us above all things not to entertain any <hi>Opinion</hi> of him that reflects a <hi>dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> on his <hi>goodness.</hi> For too many such Opinions there are that have been <hi>imbibed</hi> among Christians as the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Principles of their <hi>Orthodoxy</hi>; namely such as these, that Gods <hi>Sovereign Will</hi> is the sole <hi>rule</hi> of his <hi>actions,</hi> and that he doth things not because they are <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> but that they are just and reasonable because he <hi>doth</hi> 'em; as if he were merely an <hi>Omnipotent, blind</hi> Will that acts without <hi>Reason,</hi> and did run through the World like an <hi>irresistible</hi> Whirlwind, <hi>hurrying</hi> all things before him without any consideration of <hi>right</hi> or


<pb n="429" facs="tcp:60130:227"/>
                     <hi>wrong</hi>; That his Decrees of <hi>Governing</hi> and <hi>disposing</hi> his creatures are wholly founded in his <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>irresistible</hi> Will, that determins of the everlasting fate of Souls without any <hi>reason,</hi> or <hi>foresight,</hi> or <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; that by this his <hi>unaccountable</hi> Will he hath <hi>impaled</hi> the far <hi>greater</hi> part of <hi>'em</hi> within an <hi>absolute</hi> Decree of <hi>Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for no other end but that <hi>Nimrod-like</hi> he might have game enough to <hi>sport</hi> and <hi>breath</hi> his <hi>vengeance</hi> for ever; and that having <hi>nailed</hi> 'em to this <hi>woful</hi> cross by this his <hi>dire</hi> Decree, he bids 'em <hi>save themselves</hi> and <hi>come down,</hi> as those cruel Mockers did our Saviour, and because they do not <hi>obey, torments</hi> and <hi>cruciates</hi> 'em for ever, though he knows they are not <hi>able</hi> to do it <hi>of themselves,</hi> and hath <hi>purposed</hi> never to <hi>enable</hi> 'em to do it. Which Opinions do represent God in such a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable</hi> dress, circled with such a <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>gastly</hi> Majesty, as is more apt to inspire us with <hi>horror</hi> than <hi>love.</hi> For though by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading</hi> our selves that <hi>we</hi> are of the small number of his <hi>elected</hi> Favourites, we may work our minds into <hi>some</hi> degree of love to him; yet when we consider how <hi>severely</hi> he hath treated the <hi>rest</hi> of our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without any other <hi>reason</hi> but his own <hi>Will,</hi> this will intermingle such a

                     <hi>grimness</hi> with his smiles, such a <hi>terrour</hi> with those Charms for which we love him, as must necessarily <hi>damp</hi> the fervours of our love, and ever and anon <hi>freez</hi> it into <hi>horror</hi> and <hi>astonishment,</hi> and so <hi>fear</hi> will be at least the <hi>predominant</hi> Principle of our <hi>Obedience</hi>; and while it <hi>is</hi> so, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion must needs <hi>languish</hi> under great <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections</hi> and <hi>infirmities.</hi> For while our <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> of God is the <hi>governing</hi> Principle of our Religion, we shall but do <hi>penance</hi> in all our <hi>addresses</hi> to him, and every act of our <hi>Obedience</hi> will be a kind of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> so that we shall never be able to entertain any <hi>chearful</hi> converse or <hi>friendly</hi> Society with him, and yet serve him we <hi>must,</hi> for fear our <hi>neglect</hi> of him should rouse his <hi>Vengeance</hi> against us; and between this <hi>necessity</hi> of coming to him, and this <hi>fearfulness</hi> of approaching him, what can there be begotten but a <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>constrain'd</hi> Devotion, which because we do not <hi>love</hi> we would willingly <hi>leave,</hi> did not our <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>horror</hi> of him <hi>drag</hi> us to his Altars. And as we shall <hi>serve</hi> him with a <hi>forc'd</hi> Obedience, so we shall <hi>obey</hi> him with a <hi>sordid</hi> and <hi>nigardly</hi> affection; and while we <hi>grudg</hi> him our Obedience, we shall be most <hi>backward</hi> to obey him in those instances of Duty that are of <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>

moment and <hi>most</hi> pleasing to <hi>him,</hi> and most <hi>forward</hi> in those that are of <hi>least</hi> concern and most pleasing to <hi>our selves.</hi> Thus while our minds are ridden with <hi>sour</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> apprehensions of God, <hi>they</hi> will inspire us with a <hi>slavish</hi> dread of him, and <hi>that</hi> will <hi>restrain</hi> and <hi>contract</hi> our Obedience to him.

                  <p>IF therefore we would render him a <hi>chearful, free,</hi> and <hi>universal</hi> Obedience, we must endeavour to represent him <hi>fairly</hi> to our own minds, and to think of him as he <hi>is,</hi> and as he hath represented <hi>himself</hi> in

and <hi>indearing</hi> object in the World; and when by such recommendation they have <hi>captivated</hi> our affections, and <hi>kindled</hi> our hearts into an <hi>unfained</hi> love of him, they have inspired us with such a <hi>vigorous</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of action, as will both <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>innoble</hi> our Religion, and render it truly <hi>worthy</hi> of God and our selves; For then we shall serve him with a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>dutiful</hi> will, a <hi>liberal</hi> affection, and a <hi>chearful</hi> heart, and consequently render him a <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>generous,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> obedience. For so holy <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the ways of thy Commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart, i. e.</hi> when thou shalt <hi>open</hi> and <hi>widen</hi> my heart with the love of thee (for so St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds the Phrase, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.)

As for instance, the right <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>serving</hi> him, is that we may <hi>glorifie</hi> him for ever in an everlasting <hi>participation</hi> of his <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi>; and this we can be no otherwise <hi>certain</hi> of, than by a <hi>true</hi> survey and inspection of his <hi>nature,</hi> which will instruct us that being infinitely <hi>perfect</hi> as he is, he must be infinitely <hi>happy</hi> within himself, and so can design no <hi>self-end</hi> without himself, and consequently that the end for which he requires our service is not any <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> he expects to reap from it, or further <hi>addition</hi> to his own happiness, he being from all Eternity <hi>past</hi> as compleatly happy


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60130:230"/>
as he can be to all Eternity <hi>to come</hi>; and therefore what <hi>other</hi> end can he be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to aim at than <hi>our</hi> good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? It is true indeed, he designs to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>himself</hi> in <hi>our</hi> happiness; but how? Not to render himself himself <hi>more</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by it than he is <hi>in himself,</hi> for that is impossible; but to <hi>display</hi> and <hi>shew forth</hi> his own essential glory to all that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>admiring</hi> and <hi>imitating</hi> him, that thereby he might <hi>invite</hi> them to <hi>transcribe</hi> that <hi>goodness</hi> of his into their natures, of which his glory is the <hi>shine</hi> and <hi>lustre,</hi> and thereby to glorifie <hi>them selves</hi>; and what can more effectually display the glory of a Being who is infinitely <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> than to <hi>contrive</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> the happiness of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and especially of his <hi>rational</hi> Creatures, who of all others have the most <hi>ample</hi> capacity of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Doubtless, the <hi>highest</hi> glory of an infinite <hi>power,</hi> that is conducted by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> is to <hi>contrive</hi> and <hi>execute</hi> the most effectual methods of doing the <hi>greatest</hi> good; and what <hi>greater</hi> good can such a power <hi>effect,</hi> than the <hi>eternal</hi> happiness of <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures? So that <hi>Gods</hi> glory and <hi>our</hi> happiness are so <hi>inseparably</hi> conjoyned, that we cannot aim right at <hi>either,</hi> but we must hit <hi>both</hi>


                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:60130:231"/>
and whether we say that his <hi>end</hi> is his <hi>own</hi> glory or <hi>our</hi> happiness, it is the same thing; for his glory <hi>is</hi> our happiness, and our happiness <hi>is</hi> his glory, and when he hath <hi>perfected</hi> our Nature, and <hi>advanced</hi> it to the highest happiness it is <hi>capable</hi> of, it will <hi>shine back</hi> upon him, even as all other glorious <hi>effects</hi> do on their <hi>causes,</hi> and <hi>reflect</hi> everlasting <hi>honour</hi> on that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> from whence it was <hi>derived.</hi> Thus <hi>right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> of the nature of God will <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> lead us to the great end which <hi>he</hi> proposes in all his transactions with <hi>us,</hi> and thereby <hi>direct</hi> us what end <hi>we</hi> are to propose in our transactions with <hi>him.</hi> For that which is <hi>Gods</hi> end ought to be <hi>ours,</hi> and therefore since <hi>his</hi> end is <hi>his own</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or, which is the same thing, <hi>our</hi> everlasting Happiness, it ought to be <hi>ours</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>But now while we <hi>misapprehend</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God we shall be apt to set up <hi>false</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi> ends of serving him; as for instance, whilst we look upon him as a <hi>selfish</hi> being, that <hi>centers</hi> wholly in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and <hi>separates</hi> his interest from the interest of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> doing every thing meerly for his <hi>own sake,</hi> we shall think our selves obliged in all our addresses

to him to set aside <hi>our own</hi> interest and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and to aim <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>separately</hi> at <hi>his</hi> honour and glory; and yet this is the great <hi>Fundamental</hi> of the whole <hi>Scheme</hi> of some mens Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> That God aims wholly at <hi>himself,</hi> and regards the good of his Creatures no farther than it serves <hi>his own</hi> interest; that he made this World out of mere <hi>ostentation,</hi> to <hi>boast</hi> and <hi>magnifie</hi> his own <hi>power</hi> and <hi>greatness</hi>; and gives <hi>Laws</hi> to his Creatures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts their <hi>obedience</hi> for no other reason but because 'tis for his <hi>honour</hi> to be <hi>served</hi> and <hi>worshipped</hi>; that he created <hi>Hell</hi> only to shew the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>wrath,</hi> and prepare an everlasting <hi>Triumph</hi> for his <hi>vengeance</hi>; and erected <hi>Heaven</hi> for a <hi>Theater</hi> to shew himself on, that so having filled it with a vast <hi>Corona</hi> of <hi>Angelical</hi> and <hi>Saintly</hi> specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, he might <hi>display</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> before them, and thereby provoke them to <hi>extol</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>commend</hi> him for ever. And while we <hi>thus</hi> conceive of God, how can we hope that he will ever be <hi>pleased</hi> with us unless <hi>we</hi> aim at the same end that <hi>he</hi> doth, <hi>i. e.</hi> unless laying aside all regard to <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>our own</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter,</hi> we <hi>intirely</hi> direct all our <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>service</hi> to <hi>his</hi> glory and interest; which being impossible

for us to do, whilst we have so much <hi>self-love</hi> and so much <hi>indigence</hi> together, will either render our Religion wholly <hi>unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,</hi> or perplex us with eternal doubts of its <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>sincerity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And supposing we <hi>could</hi> direct <hi>all</hi> our Religion to <hi>this</hi> end, this instead of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it more <hi>acceptable</hi> to God would only render it more <hi>unworthy</hi> of him; for then we should serve him under the notion of his <hi>Benefactors</hi> rather than of his <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,</hi> with a design to <hi>enrich</hi> him rather than to <hi>be enriched</hi> by him: And what an <hi>unbeseeming</hi> presumption is it for such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent</hi> Creatures as we, to entertain the least thought of <hi>contributing</hi> to God, or making any <hi>addition</hi> to his <hi>infinite</hi> store? He is above all <hi>want,</hi> being infinitely <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> from the <hi>inexhaustible</hi> fountain of <hi>his own</hi> perfections; and for us to imagine that he <hi>needs</hi> our Services, and <hi>requires</hi> them to serve his own <hi>interest,</hi> is to <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme</hi> his <hi>Alsufficiency,</hi> and suppose him a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>indigent</hi> being, that for want of a <hi>perfect</hi> satisfaction <hi>within himself,</hi> is forced to <hi>rome</hi> abroad and raise <hi>taxes</hi> upon his Creatures to <hi>enrich</hi> and <hi>supply</hi> himself. For if we serve him for <hi>any</hi> end at all, it must be either to do <hi>him</hi> good or <hi>our selves</hi>; if it be to do <hi>him</hi> good, we <hi>reproach</hi>


                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:60130:232"/>
and <hi>dishonour</hi> him by supposing that he hath <hi>need</hi> of us and our services, which can do him no <hi>good</hi> unless he hath <hi>some</hi> need of them. So that whatsoever some <hi>high-slown</hi> Enthusiasts may pretend, that it is <hi>sordid</hi> and <hi>mercenary</hi> to serve God for <hi>our own</hi> good, I am sure to serve him for <hi>his</hi> good is <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>blasphemous</hi>; and therefore either we must serve him for <hi>no</hi> good, or serve him for <hi>our own</hi>; and since he is so infinitely <hi>sufficient</hi> to himself, that nothing we can do can <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> him, to what better purpose can we <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>serve</hi> him, than to <hi>receive</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage from him; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being <hi>base</hi> and <hi>mercenary,</hi> is a purpose most <hi>becoming</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>our selves</hi>? For to serve him with an <hi>intent</hi> not to <hi>give</hi> to, but to <hi>receive</hi> from him, is to acknowledg his <hi>fulness</hi> and our own <hi>want,</hi> his <hi>Alsufficiency</hi> and our own <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi>; whereas by serving him to the <hi>contrary</hi> purpose, we do in effect set up our selves <hi>above</hi> him, it being much <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to give than it is to receive; and to make <hi>that</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of our worshipping God, which doth in effect suppose him to be our <hi>inferiour,</hi> is to make our selves <hi>Gods</hi> instead of <hi>Votaries.</hi> What the <hi>true</hi> end therefore is of our <hi>serving</hi> God, may


<pb n="440" facs="tcp:60130:233"/>
be easily inferred from a <hi>right apprehension</hi> of his nature. For do but consider him as a Being that is <hi>above</hi> all want, that is <hi>infinitely</hi> satisfied in <hi>his own</hi> perfections, and an <hi>unbounded</hi> Ocean of happiness to <hi>himself,</hi> and then what <hi>other</hi> end can you propose in <hi>serving</hi> him, but to <hi>derive</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and happiness from him, in the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment</hi> of which <hi>he</hi> and <hi>you</hi> will be <hi>Glorified</hi> together?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And lastly, A <hi>right apprehension</hi> of God is also necessary to furnish us with proper <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>incouragements</hi> to serve him. It is the nature of all reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beings to be <hi>drawn forth</hi> into action by <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi>; and the most <hi>powerful</hi> Arguments to move us <hi>Godward,</hi> are drawn from the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of God, from his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; none of which can have their <hi>just</hi> and <hi>full</hi> influence upon us, unless we have a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> apprehension of them. The consideration of his <hi>Majesty</hi> is naturally apt to <hi>strike</hi> our minds into an <hi>awful</hi> reverence of his <hi>Authority</hi>; but if we look upon it under the notion of a <hi>mere Arbitrary</hi> greatness, that Governs not it self by <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> but by a <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>absolute,</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi>


                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:60130:233"/>
Will, that always chuses and refuses <hi>pro imperio,</hi> without any regard to the <hi>eternal reasons</hi> of things, we may be <hi>astonish'd</hi> and <hi>confounded</hi> at it, but we can never <hi>truly</hi> reverence it. The consideration of his <hi>Holiness</hi> is naturally apt to <hi>deter</hi> us from approaching him with <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>impure</hi> affections; but if we place his holiness in a <hi>mere formal</hi> affectation of external <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, respect,</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> and not in the <hi>immutable</hi> conformity of his Will with the <hi>eternal</hi> Rules of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> it may move us to be very <hi>ceremonious</hi> and <hi>respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to him, as to the <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Garb,</hi> and <hi>Posture</hi> of our Worship, but it will never prevail with us to <hi>cleanse</hi> and <hi>rectifie</hi> our hearts and affections. Again, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>Justice</hi> is naturally apt to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain</hi> us from <hi>affronting</hi> his Authority by <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> violations of his <hi>Laws</hi>; but while we look upon it as a <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>implacable</hi> Attribute, which nothing will <hi>appease</hi> and <hi>satisfie</hi> but <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> it may overwhelm us with <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>despair,</hi> but 'twill never persuade us to <hi>reform</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> Once more, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his <hi>Mercy</hi> is naturally apt when we are gone astray to <hi>invite</hi> us to return, with the <hi>hopeful</hi> prospect it gives us of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>reconciliation</hi>; but while


<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60130:234"/>
we look upon it under the notion of a <hi>blind</hi> pity, or <hi>effeminate</hi> easiness and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Nature, that will admit of no <hi>severity</hi> how <hi>wholsom</hi> soever or <hi>necessary</hi> to the ends of Government, instead of <hi>moving</hi> us to repentance, it will <hi>animate</hi> us in our rebellion. In fine, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>Goodness</hi> is naturally apt to <hi>work</hi> upon our <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> and to draw us Godwards with <hi>the cords of a man, and the bonds of love</hi>; but while we mistake it for a <hi>blind</hi> Partiality, that <hi>chuses</hi> its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites without <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>rewards</hi> them without <hi>respect</hi> to their Qualifications, instead of <hi>captivating</hi> our <hi>love,</hi> 'twill <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> our <hi>disdain,</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> in us a secret <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>aversation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus though the nature of God be in <hi>it self</hi> a most <hi>fruitful</hi> Topick of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> to ingage us to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, yet by the <hi>false</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations that are sometimes made of it, it may be <hi>perverted</hi> into an <hi>inducement</hi> to wickedness, and made a <hi>plausible</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to <hi>encourage</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> us in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions against him. Whilst we look upon God as he is <hi>in himself,</hi> shining with his own <hi>unstained</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi> Glories, there is nothing more apt to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> all the <hi>springs</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> within us;


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60130:234"/>
to <hi>enflame</hi> our love, <hi>encourage</hi> our hope, and <hi>alarm</hi> our fear, and by <hi>these</hi> to set the <hi>Wheels</hi> of our Obedience agoing. For there is nothing in humane nature that is capable of being <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> which hath not an <hi>answerable</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the nature of God to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>affect</hi> it. And as in him there are all the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> that can <hi>affect</hi> us, so there is all the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of those reasons, every thing in him being <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi>; in him there is an infinite <hi>beauty</hi> to attract our <hi>love,</hi> an infinite <hi>good</hi> to inflame our <hi>desire,</hi> an infinite <hi>kindness</hi> to affect our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,</hi> an infinite <hi>Justice</hi> armed with an infinite <hi>power</hi> to awaken our <hi>fear,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>mercy</hi> to invite our <hi>hope,</hi> and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>truth</hi> to confirm and support it. So that 'tis beyond the power of all humane imagination to <hi>frame</hi> or <hi>fancy</hi> an Object that is so every way <hi>fitted</hi> to <hi>affect</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and <hi>influence</hi> all its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of action, as God <hi>in himself</hi> is. Whilst therefore we apprehend him <hi>truly,</hi> and as he is in <hi>himself,</hi> the consideration of him must needs be of <hi>wonderful</hi> force to <hi>oblige</hi> us to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, and there is not <hi>one</hi> of all those <hi>glorious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in which his Nature is <hi>arrayed,</hi> but will suggest to us some <hi>powerful</hi>


                     <pb n="444" facs="tcp:60130:235"/>
persuasive to <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and either by our <hi>hope</hi> or our <hi>fear,</hi> our <hi>love</hi> or our <hi>gratitude,</hi> incline our hearts to keep his Commandments. So that if we are <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> of his perfections, or do entertain <hi>false</hi> Notions concerning them, we shall either <hi>want</hi> those Motives to Piety which they naturally <hi>suggest,</hi> or draw Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them to <hi>encourage</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> us in our rebellions against him. And thus you see in all these instances how indispensably necessary <hi>right</hi> Notions of God are to ingage us to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him.</p>

So that when we behold <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> perfections in the Creature, we may from them most certainly <hi>infer</hi> that the same are <hi>all</hi> in God, who is the <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of them; and though the divine Nature abounds with <hi>innumerable</hi> vertues and


<pb n="446" facs="tcp:60130:236"/>
perfections, yet 'tis impossible for us by our own <hi>natural</hi> light to <hi>discover</hi> any other of them than those of which he himself hath <hi>imprinted</hi> some <hi>specimens</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on created Beings; these being the only <hi>Scales</hi> by which our understanding can <hi>ascend</hi> to the <hi>reach</hi> and <hi>view</hi> of the divine perfections. But because all <hi>created</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are not only <hi>short</hi> in their <hi>degrees,</hi> but also intermingled with <hi>defects</hi> in their very <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>nature</hi>; therefore in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting them to <hi>God</hi> we ought carefully to <hi>abstract</hi> from them whatever is <hi>defective</hi> whether it be in <hi>kind</hi> or in <hi>degree.</hi> For God is the cause of <hi>perfection</hi> only, but not of <hi>defect,</hi> which so far forth as it is <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>created</hi> Beings hath <hi>no cause</hi> at all, but is merely a <hi>negation</hi> or <hi>non-entity.</hi> For every <hi>created</hi> thing was a <hi>negation</hi> or <hi>non-entity</hi> before ever it had a <hi>positive</hi> being, and it had only <hi>so much</hi> of its <hi>primitive</hi> negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>taken away</hi> from it, as it had <hi>positive</hi> being <hi>conferred</hi> on it; and therefore so far forth as it <hi>is,</hi> its <hi>being</hi> is to be attributed to that <hi>soveraign cause</hi> that produced it, but so far forth as it is <hi>not,</hi> its <hi>not being</hi> is to be attributed to that <hi>Original Non-entity</hi> out of which it was produced. For that which was <hi>once</hi> nothing would <hi>still</hi> have been nothing had it not been for the <hi>cause</hi>


                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:60130:236"/>
that gave <hi>being</hi> to it; and therefore that it is <hi>so far</hi> nothing still, <hi>i. e. limited</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> is only to be attributed to its own <hi>primitive</hi> nothingness. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if I give a poor man an hundred pounds; that he is worth so <hi>much</hi> money is wholly owing to <hi>me,</hi> but that he is not worth a hundred <hi>more</hi> is owing only to his own <hi>poverty</hi>; and just so, that I have such and such <hi>perfections</hi> of being is wholly owing to <hi>God</hi> who produced me out of nothing, but that I have such and such <hi>defects</hi> of being is only owing to that <hi>Non-entity</hi> out of which he produced me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since our <hi>perfections</hi> are derived from <hi>God,</hi> but not our <hi>defects,</hi> 'tis altogether as <hi>unreasonable</hi> to attribute the <hi>latter</hi> to to him, as it is <hi>reasonable</hi> to attribute the <hi>former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>defects</hi> of created perfection which we are to <hi>remove</hi> and <hi>abstract</hi> from God in our conceptions of him, are of two sorts: First of <hi>the thing</hi>; Secondly, of the <hi>mode of thing.</hi> The defect of <hi>the thing</hi> is when the thing <hi>it self</hi> is such as that it wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes something much <hi>better</hi> and more perfect; thus <hi>matter</hi> for instance is defective in the thing, because it excludes <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>immaterial</hi> substance, which is much more <hi>excellent</hi> than it self. The defect of the


<pb n="448" facs="tcp:60130:237"/>
                     <hi>mode of the thing</hi> is when the thing is so excellent in <hi>it self</hi> as that it excludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, but yet is deficient in <hi>degrees</hi> of perfection. As for instance, <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness, Reason</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> are things so excellent <hi>in themselves</hi> as that they exclude nothing that is more excellent, but yet as residing in <hi>created</hi> Beings want a great many <hi>possible degrees</hi> of perfection. Now both these defects being <hi>natural</hi> are <hi>uncaused,</hi> and so cannot proceed from the Author of Nature, and not proceeding <hi>from</hi> him, they cannot be supposed to be <hi>in</hi> him, and therefore in our conceptions <hi>of</hi> him ought not to be attributed <hi>to</hi> him. In respect therefore of these <hi>twofold</hi> defects in created perfections, it is necessary we should conceive of God in the way of <hi>Remotion</hi> and <hi>Eminence</hi> as well as of <hi>Causality</hi>; otherwise we shall <hi>injuriously</hi> attribute to him the <hi>Defects</hi> of his Creatures, of which he is <hi>not</hi> the cause, as well as their <hi>perfections</hi> of which he <hi>is.</hi> If therefore we would <hi>do</hi> God <hi>right</hi> in our thoughts and conceptions of him, we must in the first place remove from him all defect <hi>in the thing,</hi> that is, all <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>material</hi> perfections; because they are defective in their very <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> as excluding such substance and perfections


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:60130:237"/>
as are incomparably more <hi>excellent</hi> than themselves; and this is to conceive of him in the way <hi>of Remotion,</hi> which consists in <hi>removing</hi> all kind of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>material</hi> affections from our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of God. And then in the second place we must abstract from him all defect <hi>in the mode of the thing, i. e,</hi> all the defect of <hi>degrees</hi> in those <hi>spiritual</hi> perfections of the Creature which we attribute to him, and <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>exalt</hi> them in our own minds to their utmost <hi>height</hi> and <hi>eminence</hi>; and this is to conceive of him in the way <hi>of Eminency,</hi> which consists in ascribing to God the <hi>short</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> perfections of his Creatures <hi>abstracted</hi> from all <hi>defect</hi> and <hi>limitation.</hi> These <hi>three</hi> ways there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are all indispensably <hi>necessary</hi> to lead us to a <hi>true</hi> discovery of the Nature of God; as will yet farther appear by the following <hi>Rules</hi> I shall lay down for the forming a <hi>right</hi> Notion and Apprehension of him.</p>
                  <p>First, If we would think <hi>aright</hi> of God, we must attribute all <hi>possible perfection</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in <hi>forming</hi> our Notions of <hi>his</hi> Perfections we must take our <hi>rise</hi> from the Perfections we behold in his <hi>Creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:60130:238"/>Thirdly, In <hi>ascribing</hi> to him the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Creatures we must <hi>abstract</hi> from them every thing that is <hi>defective</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In <hi>arguing</hi> from the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Creature</hi> to the perfections of <hi>God,</hi> we must distinguish between the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Though in arguing from the perfections of the Creature to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God we are not to subject him to the <hi>Rules</hi> of a <hi>Creature,</hi> yet we are always to suppose his <hi>Will</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> to be in perfect <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of his <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In conceiving of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we must always suppose them to be exactly <hi>harmonious</hi> and <hi>consistent</hi> with each other.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. To the forming a <hi>right apprehension</hi> of God it is necessary that we ascribe to him all <hi>possible perfection.</hi> For he being the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> cause from whence all the <hi>perfections</hi> of Being are <hi>derived,</hi> must necessarily include all perfection <hi>in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and <hi>be</hi> all those perfections which he hath <hi>communicated</hi> to others; for how can he <hi>give</hi> that which he <hi>hath not?</hi> It is true indeed, <hi>free</hi> causes may give <hi>less</hi> to their effects than they have in themselves, but


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:60130:238"/>
it is impossible they should give <hi>more</hi>; though they may <hi>withhold</hi> from their effects any <hi>perfection</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they <hi>have,</hi> they cannot <hi>derive</hi> to them any which they <hi>have not.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore is a <hi>perfection</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, must necessarily be <hi>essential</hi> to that <hi>supreme</hi> cause from whence all Being is <hi>derived</hi>; otherwise there would be <hi>more</hi> in his <hi>effects</hi> than there is <hi>in himself,</hi> and consequently more than he could <hi>give</hi> or be the <hi>cause of,</hi> which is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p>AND as all those perfections that are in <hi>created</hi> Beings must necessarily <hi>exist</hi> in the nature of God, so must all those too that are <hi>possible in themselves.</hi> For every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that is possible in it self must be <hi>possible</hi> to <hi>him</hi> who is the <hi>cause</hi> of all things; but no perfection can be <hi>possible</hi> to him that is not <hi>actually</hi> in him, for no cause can produce that perfection in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> which it hath not in <hi>it self,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be any perfection that is not <hi>in</hi> him 'tis impossible it should ever be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>by</hi> him, and that which is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>God</hi> must be impossible in its <hi>own nature,</hi> that which is not an object of <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi> power is not an object of <hi>any</hi> power, and that which is not an Object


<pb n="452" facs="tcp:60130:239"/>
of any power is in it self <hi>impossible.</hi> Since therefore every perfection that is possible in <hi>it self</hi> must be possible to <hi>God,</hi> and since no perfection that is not <hi>in</hi> him can be possible <hi>to</hi> him, it necessarily follows that all the perfections that are <hi>possible</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are <hi>actually</hi> existing in the Nature of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. IN <hi>forming</hi> our Notions of <hi>Gods</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections we must take our <hi>rise</hi> from those perfections which we behold in his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> For our understanding being too <hi>short-sighted</hi> to penetrate <hi>immediately</hi> into the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>essence</hi> of things, hath no other way to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>apprehend</hi> them, but either by their <hi>causes,</hi> or by their <hi>effects</hi>; but now God being the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>supreme</hi> fountain of all causes cannot be known by his <hi>cause,</hi> because he hath <hi>none,</hi> and therefore is knowable only by his <hi>effects,</hi> that is, by the <hi>works</hi> of his <hi>Creation</hi> that lie before us, and are within the prospect of our understandings; in the which all that is <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>good</hi> is an illustrious <hi>Comment</hi> and <hi>Paraphrase</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.</p>
                  <p>NOW the <hi>effects</hi> of God are all reducible to these four generals, <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence, Life, Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi>; all which are in <hi>man,</hi> who is the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the World,


<pb n="453" facs="tcp:60130:239"/>
and a compleat <hi>Model</hi> of all the Works of God; and therefore not only all <hi>these,</hi> but all the proper <hi>excellencies</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of these must be supposed to be in <hi>God,</hi> from whom they are <hi>deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE first effect of God is <hi>substance.</hi> Now the proper perfections of substance are <hi>Amplitude</hi> and <hi>Fulness</hi> of Being. By the <hi>Amplitude</hi> of substance I mean its <hi>greatness</hi> or <hi>largeness</hi> as to the <hi>diffusion</hi> or <hi>extent</hi> of it, in opposition to <hi>littleness,</hi> or, which is the same thing, to being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> to, or <hi>circumscribed</hi> within a <hi>small</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> space; by the <hi>Fulness</hi> of substance, I mean its having <hi>more</hi> of Essence or Being, by which it is <hi>more</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from <hi>not being,</hi> in opposition to things that have but <hi>little</hi> being in them, that are of so <hi>fleeting</hi> and <hi>transitory</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that they are <hi>next</hi> to <hi>nothing.</hi> Wherefore in conceiving of God we must ascribe to him these perfections of substance even to their <hi>utmost possibility,</hi> that is, we must conceive him to be a Being of <hi>infinite Amplitude,</hi> that is neither <hi>defined</hi> nor <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed</hi> within any certain space, but <hi>coexists</hi> with, and <hi>penetrates</hi> and <hi>passes through</hi> all things; and by thus conceiving of him we attribute to him <hi>Immensity,</hi>


                     <pb n="452" facs="tcp:60130:240"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>


                     <pb n="453" facs="tcp:60130:240"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>


                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:60130:241"/>
which consists in being <hi>unconfined</hi> by any bounds of space in the <hi>out-spreading</hi> of himself to all places that we can <hi>see</hi> or <hi>imagine,</hi> and infinitely <hi>beyond</hi> them. And then in conceiving of him we must also ascribe to him <hi>infinite Fulness</hi> of Being, by which he is so <hi>infinitely</hi> removed from <hi>not being,</hi> as that he cannot <hi>but</hi> be; and by thus conceiving of him we attribute to him <hi>necessary existence,</hi> which consists in being out of all <hi>Possibility</hi> of <hi>not being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT then secondly, another of those works of God from which we are to take our rise in conceiving of his Perfections, is <hi>Life.</hi> For he is the <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of all that life that is in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must not only have life <hi>in himself,</hi> but the <hi>utmost perfection</hi> of it also that is <hi>possible.</hi> Now the Perfections of life are <hi>Activity</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi>; by <hi>Activity</hi> I mean a vigorous <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to act, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>impotence,</hi> which must needs be a <hi>great</hi> perfection of life, which is the <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by <hi>Duration</hi> I mean a <hi>long</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of life in opposition to that which is <hi>short</hi> and <hi>momentary</hi>; for the more <hi>lasting</hi> the life is, the more <hi>perfect</hi> it is, and the <hi>more</hi> there is <hi>of</hi> it. Wherefore in conceiving


<pb n="455" facs="tcp:60130:241"/>
of God we must ascribe to him the <hi>utmost</hi> perfection of <hi>life</hi> that is <hi>possible</hi>; that is, we must conceive him to be <hi>infinitely active</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> that doth what he <hi>pleases</hi> in Heaven and on Earth, and can effect whatsoever is <hi>possible</hi> in <hi>it self,</hi> and not <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>other</hi> perfections of his Nature; and in thus conceiving of him we attribute <hi>Omnipotence</hi> to him, which consists in an <hi>ability</hi> to do <hi>every thing</hi> that doth not <hi>imply a contradiction</hi> either to the nature of the <hi>things themselves,</hi> or to the nature and perfections of the <hi>doer</hi>; and then in conceiving of him we must also ascribe to him an <hi>infinite duration</hi> of life, that is, a life that is not <hi>bounded</hi> either by a <hi>beginning</hi> or an <hi>end,</hi> but is <hi>from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting to everlasting,</hi> and <hi>coexists</hi> and runs <hi>Parallel</hi> with all Duration <hi>past,</hi> and <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>to come</hi>; and by thus conceiving of him we attribute <hi>Eternity</hi> to him, which consists in a <hi>boundless</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of life without any term of <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT then thirdly, another of these effects of God from which we are to take our rise in conceiving of the Perfections of God, is <hi>Sense</hi>; by which I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>material</hi> sense only, which consists in <hi>perceiving</hi> the <hi>strokes</hi>


                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:60130:242"/>
and <hi>impressions</hi> of <hi>material</hi> Objects on our sensories, but sense in the general, whether it be of <hi>material</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For that <hi>spiritual</hi> Beings have as <hi>exquisite</hi> a sense of <hi>spiritual</hi> Objects, as <hi>corporal</hi> of <hi>corporeal</hi> ones there is no doubt to be made; because otherwise we must suppose them <hi>insensible</hi> both of <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> and <hi>pain.</hi> Now the perfection of sense is <hi>Quickness</hi> and <hi>Sagacity</hi> of Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it be of <hi>painful</hi> or of <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, grateful</hi> or <hi>ungrateful</hi> Objects; and this is to be found not only in <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> but also in <hi>separated</hi> spirits, in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and in <hi>God himself.</hi> For though none of these have any <hi>corporeal</hi> sense to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>perceive</hi> the impressions of <hi>corporeal</hi> Objects, yet that both Angels and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Spirits have a <hi>spiritual</hi> sense of <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> impressions, by which they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; and though God by the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature is exempt from all sense of <hi>pain,</hi> yet it cannot be supposed that he who is the <hi>fountain</hi> from whence all sense is <hi>derived</hi> should himself be <hi>insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>; and if he be not, we ought to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him as sensible of all that is truly <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>good</hi> as it is possible to be; and where there is an <hi>infinite good,</hi> as there


<pb n="457" facs="tcp:60130:242"/>
is in the nature of God, it is possible to be <hi>infinitely sensible</hi> of it; and in thus conceiving, we attribute to him <hi>infinite Happiness.</hi> For what else is an infinite <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>good</hi> but infinite <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>; and this is the happiness of God, that he is infinitely <hi>perfect</hi> in himself, and infinitely <hi>sensible</hi> of his own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and therein infinitely <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>delighted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOURTHLY and lastly, Another of those Works of God from whence we are to take our rise in conceiving of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is <hi>Reason.</hi> For all that <hi>light</hi> of reason which shineth in <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> minds being <hi>rayed</hi> forth, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived</hi> from him, he must be supposed not only to have reason <hi>in himself,</hi> but to have it in its utmost <hi>possible perfection.</hi> Now the perfection of reason consists in <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Rectitude</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi> in the <hi>Will.</hi> By <hi>Knowledg</hi> I mean considering and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing things <hi>absolutely</hi> as they are in their <hi>own Natures,</hi> in their <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties, Differences</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi>; by <hi>Wisdom</hi> I understand a through consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of things as they are <hi>related</hi> to one another under the Notion of <hi>means</hi> and <hi>ends,</hi> and of their <hi>fitness</hi> or <hi>unfitness</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. IT is necessary that in ascribing to him the perfections of the Creature we <hi>abstract</hi> from them every thing that is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> For to be sure there is nothing can be defective or imperfect in the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Author</hi> of all perfection.

                     <pb n="462" facs="tcp:60130:245"/>
and all <hi>degrees</hi> of all kinds of perfection; and so we must conceive of him, if we would <hi>do</hi> him <hi>right</hi> when we attribute to him the above-named perfections. As for instance, when we attribute to him the perfections of <hi>substance,</hi> we must <hi>abstract</hi> from them the defect of <hi>Corporeity</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> extension, which compared with <hi>spirituality</hi> is a mighty <hi>defect</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of substance both as to its <hi>Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and <hi>Fulness</hi> of Essence. For no <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> substance can be at the same <hi>time</hi> in the same <hi>place</hi> where <hi>another</hi> corporeal substance is; because it consists of such parts as cannot <hi>penetrate</hi> each other; so that every <hi>body</hi> must be <hi>limited</hi> in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> because it cannot be where <hi>another</hi> body is; whereas a <hi>Spirit</hi> being pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable <hi>it self,</hi> can penetrate or pass through <hi>all things,</hi> and consequently be present at the same <hi>time,</hi> and in the same <hi>place</hi> where not only other <hi>bodies</hi> are, but other <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> too. So that by attributing <hi>body</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> to God, we must necessarily <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> the <hi>Amplitude</hi> of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which if it be <hi>bodily</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be <hi>excluded</hi> from all those places where <hi>other</hi> bodily substances are, and consequently have but a <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> presence, which utterly destroys the


<pb n="463" facs="tcp:60130:245"/>
infinite <hi>Amplitude</hi> or <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of his substance. And then <hi>bodily</hi> substances being all compounded of <hi>divisible</hi> parts, and consequently liable to be <hi>divided</hi> and <hi>corrupted,</hi> cannot have that <hi>fulness</hi> of Being in them which <hi>Spirits</hi> have, which are <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>uncompounded</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and consequently void of all <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>corruption</hi>; so that by attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>body</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> to God, we <hi>substract</hi> from the infinite <hi>fulness</hi> of his Being, and instead of ascribing to him <hi>necessary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi> which puts him beyond all <hi>possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>not being,</hi> degrade him into a <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> and <hi>corruptible</hi> nature. Wherefore in attributing to God the perfections of substance, we must <hi>abstract</hi> from them all <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>material</hi> affections, and conceive of him as a most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> spirit.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, when we attribute to him the perfections of <hi>life,</hi> viz. <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> and <hi>Duration,</hi> we must wholly <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi> from them all those <hi>imperfections</hi> with which they are <hi>commixt</hi> in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As for instance, <hi>activity</hi> in the <hi>Creature</hi> is attended with <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>pains</hi>; the not abstracting of which from the Activity of <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Epicurus</hi> suppose him to be a <hi>restive</hi> Being, that <hi>withdrew</hi>


                     <pb n="464" facs="tcp:60130:246"/>
himself from action for fear of <hi>disturbing</hi> his own <hi>happiness</hi> by it; whereas <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> are the <hi>imperfections</hi> of activity, and so ought not to be admitted into our conception of <hi>God</hi>'s, which being <hi>infinite,</hi> there is nothing can be <hi>difficult</hi> or <hi>uneasie</hi> to him. For it is because of <hi>imperfection</hi> that <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> do attend any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their operations; could they do what they do <hi>perfectly,</hi> it would be no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>at all</hi> to them. God therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>infinite power</hi> to effect what he pleases, whatsoever he <hi>doth</hi> he doth it most <hi>perfectly,</hi> and consequently without any <hi>toil</hi> or <hi>labour</hi>; and since all things were <hi>derived</hi> from him, and are <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> upon him, they must all be <hi>perfectly</hi> subject to his <hi>power</hi>; and where there is perfect <hi>subjection</hi> there can be no <hi>resistance,</hi> and where there is no resistance there can be no <hi>labour.</hi> And then as for <hi>Duration,</hi> which is the other perfection of life, in the <hi>Creature</hi> it is attended with <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> For there is no life but <hi>depends</hi> upon God, to be <hi>shortened</hi> or <hi>prolonged</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleasure; the lives of all Beings are <hi>maintained</hi> and <hi>supplied</hi> by his <hi>all-enlivening</hi> power and influence, which if he <hi>withdraw</hi> from them but one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they presently <hi>expire</hi>; so that the


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:60130:246"/>
duration of all <hi>created</hi> life is <hi>dependent</hi> and <hi>precarious,</hi> and even those Beings that shall live <hi>for ever</hi> have no other <hi>tenure</hi> of life but Gods <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> who with the <hi>breath</hi> of his Nostrils can <hi>blow</hi> them <hi>out</hi> when he pleases. But the <hi>duration</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> life is altogether <hi>independent</hi>; for he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists <hi>of himself,</hi> from that infinite <hi>fulness</hi> of Being that is in him, and <hi>hath</hi> done so from all Eternity <hi>past</hi> when there was no other cause but himself in being, and therefore <hi>can</hi> do so to all Eternity <hi>to come</hi> without the <hi>support</hi> or <hi>assistance</hi> of any other cause. So that he is not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for his duration to the <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of any <hi>other</hi> Being, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from an inexhaustible <hi>spring</hi> of life within <hi>himself,</hi> whence he also derives life to all other Beings.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, when we attribute to him the perfection of <hi>sense,</hi> viz. <hi>quickness</hi> and <hi>exquisiteness</hi> of perception, we must whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abstract from it all that imperfection with which it is attended in the Creatures; for in them it is attended with sundry <hi>affections</hi> which argue <hi>imperfection</hi> in their <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi>; such as <hi>Fear, Sorrow, Repentance, Desperation,</hi> and the like; all which argue a defect of <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and proceed from a quick sense of evil

When therefore we attribute to God this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>sense,</hi> we must abstract from it all those affections which proceed from the sense of <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>pain.</hi> For he is so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect both in <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>happiness,</hi> that no evil can approach him to <hi>vex</hi> or <hi>disturb</hi> him, or make any <hi>painful</hi> impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on his nature; and being so, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that in propriety of speech he should either <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>grieve,</hi> or <hi>repent,</hi> or <hi>despair.</hi> All these affections indeed are in Scripture attributed to him, but then it is in an <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>Metaphorical</hi> sense; not as if he did at any time <hi>feel</hi> these passions within <hi>himself,</hi> but because he <hi>demeans</hi> himself towards <hi>us</hi> as if he <hi>did</hi>; not as if the affections <hi>themselves</hi> had any place in his <hi>nature,</hi> but because the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>effects</hi> of them appear in his <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>behaviour.</hi> And though there is no doubt but he <hi>resents</hi> all those evils which good men <hi>suffer,</hi> and bad men <hi>commit,</hi> yet it is not from any <hi>painful</hi> impression that they make upon his nature; for he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>feels</hi> the <hi>miseries</hi> he <hi>pities</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,</hi> nor is <hi>vext</hi> at the <hi>sins</hi> he <hi>detests</hi> and <hi>abhors,</hi> but all the resentment he hath both of the evil of our <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>sins</hi> is

perfectly <hi>calm</hi> to himself, and devoid of all <hi>passion</hi> and <hi>disturbance.</hi> 'Tis true, his <hi>Will</hi> being <hi>perfectly reasonable</hi> must be <hi>differently</hi> affected towards <hi>different</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and <hi>contrarily</hi> affected towards <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Objects, because they propose to it different and contrary <hi>Reasons</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it must be affected with <hi>complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> towards <hi>good</hi> Objects, so it must be affected with <hi>abhorrence</hi> towards <hi>bad</hi>; but this abhorrence arises not either from any <hi>sense</hi> of hurt they <hi>do</hi> him, or <hi>fear</hi> of hurt they <hi>can</hi> do him, his Nature being wholly <hi>impassible,</hi> but from the <hi>repugnancy</hi> they bear to his own <hi>infallible</hi> reason; and his abhorrence being wholly founded in his <hi>Reason,</hi> and not in any <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>feeling</hi> he hath of the evils he detests, must upon this account be stript of all <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Wherefore in attributing to God the perfection of <hi>sense,</hi> we must take care to abstract from it all those <hi>affections</hi> which spring out of the <hi>imperfection</hi> either of our <hi>nature,</hi> or our <hi>happiness.</hi>

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:60130:248"/>
                     <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the Creature is attended with <hi>reasoning</hi> and <hi>discoursing,</hi> that is, <hi>inferring</hi> one thing from another, arguing <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> from <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> from <hi>Causes,</hi> which is a great <hi>imperfection</hi> of Knowledge, and a plain indication that it is <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>confined</hi> in it self, and not to be improved without <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>study.</hi> For that we are fain to infer one thing out of another is an evident token that we know but <hi>in part,</hi> because in this way our knowledge must be <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,</hi> and we must know one thing <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> we can know another; we must know the <hi>Principles</hi> before we can know the <hi>Consequents,</hi> and the <hi>Causes</hi> before the <hi>Effects</hi>; else how can we <hi>deduce</hi> the one from the other?

not know one thing <hi>after</hi> another, but comprehends them <hi>all together</hi> in his infinite mind, without any <hi>succession</hi> or <hi>improvement.</hi> So that from all Eternity <hi>past</hi> he knew as much as he doth <hi>now,</hi> and as much as he <hi>will</hi> do to all Eternity <hi>to come</hi>; for his Knowledg was always <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> and what is infinite admits not either of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less.</hi> And then for that other perfection of reason which consists in <hi>Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of <hi>Will,</hi> in the Creature it is <hi>acquired,</hi> even as that Knowledg and Wisdom is by which it is <hi>measured</hi> and <hi>regulated.</hi> For Rectitude of <hi>Will</hi> consisting in <hi>chusing</hi> and <hi>refusing</hi> as right Reason <hi>directs,</hi> must needs be <hi>acquired</hi> in the Creature, because that <hi>Right Reason</hi> is so, by which it chuses and refuses; so that there is the same defect and imperfection in the Rectitude of <hi>our</hi> Wills as there is in <hi>our</hi> Reason and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that is, that it is not <hi>altogether,</hi> but acquired by <hi>degrees,</hi> and so it may be is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>successive</hi> and <hi>improvable.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in attributing to <hi>God</hi> Rectitude of Will, which, as I shewed before, consists in <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> we are wholly to abstract from it this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of being <hi>acquired.</hi> For it is <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to his Will to <hi>follow</hi> the Dictates of his Understanding and Reason, and <hi>essential</hi>

to his Understanding to <hi>dictate</hi> to his Will all the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Goodness, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and Truth; so that the rectitude of his Will is <hi>infinite</hi> both as to the <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of it, there being no <hi>good,</hi> no <hi>degree</hi> of good that an infinite reason can <hi>propose,</hi> but what his Will doth most readily <hi>imbrace,</hi> and perfectly <hi>comply</hi> with; so that the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Will is such as could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired part <hi>after</hi> part, degree <hi>after</hi> degree, because it is <hi>essentially infinite</hi>; and <hi>from</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting he was as good, and as just, and as faithful as <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> everlasting he cannot be better, or juster, or faithfuller than he <hi>is,</hi> because what is essentially infinite admits no <hi>improvement</hi> either of <hi>parts</hi> or <hi>degrees.</hi> And thus you see how in all these respects it is absolutely necessary to the framing a right Apprehension of <hi>God,</hi> that in ascribing to him the perfections of the <hi>Creature,</hi> we abstract all those <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>imperfections</hi> with which they are intermixt.</p>

                  <p n="5">V.

For God who is infinitely exalted <hi>above</hi> all other Beings can be subject to no <hi>other</hi> Law but that of his own Essential <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; and since every thing hath a right to exercise its own faculties so far forth as it is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> God who is subject to no other Law but only that of his own perfections hath an <hi>essential</hi> right

to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>do</hi> whatever <hi>that</hi> Law <hi>allows</hi> and <hi>approves</hi> of. Now the <hi>perfections</hi> of God which give <hi>Law</hi> to his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> are those which, for distinction sake, we call <hi>Moral,</hi> because their Office is the same in <hi>him</hi> with that of <hi>moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> in the <hi>Creature,</hi> viz. to <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>regulate</hi> his Will and Powers of action; and these <hi>Moral</hi> perfections are his <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness, Justice,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which being all <hi>essential</hi> to him are as much a Law to <hi>his</hi> Will and Power, as <hi>Moral Laws</hi> are to <hi>ours</hi>; And to suppose his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> not to be perfectly <hi>subject</hi> to them, is to suppose him a very <hi>defective</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> Being, a <hi>lawless</hi> Will and Power being the greatest <hi>defect</hi> in Nature.

                     <hi>obliged</hi> to regulate himself by <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> or that he <hi>can</hi> do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is to attribute to him a Power to Will and Act <hi>foolishly, maliciously,</hi> and <hi>unjustly,</hi> which indeed is not so properly <hi>Power</hi> as <hi>Impotence</hi>; and to suppose that he can <hi>thus</hi> Will and Act, is to deny that he is <hi>infinitely</hi> Wise, and Just, and Good, which utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all <hi>possibility</hi> of being <hi>otherwise</hi> in any <hi>respect</hi> or <hi>degree.</hi> For to be <hi>infinitely</hi> Wise and Just is to be <hi>infinitely</hi> removed from folly and injustice, which nothing <hi>can</hi> be that hath the least <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>possibility</hi> to act <hi>unwise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>unjustly.</hi> Wherefore in conceiving of God it is always to be supposed that his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are so <hi>immutably</hi> subject to the <hi>Moral</hi> perfections of his Nature, as that it is <hi>impossible</hi> for him to Will or Act <hi>against</hi> them. For all that <hi>liberty</hi> of Will that is determinable to <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil, just</hi> or <hi>unjust,</hi> is a <hi>flaw</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> in the reasonable nature, because it speaks the Will to be <hi>defective</hi> in that which is the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> possibility of <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice, i. e.</hi> in being <hi>immutably</hi> determined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and therefore to attribute <hi>such</hi> a liberty to God, is to <hi>scandalize</hi> his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>reproach</hi> it with imperfection. For all that <hi>Power</hi> which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> is only

power to <hi>do mischief,</hi> to <hi>Tyrannize</hi> over other Beings, and to <hi>sport</hi> and <hi>play</hi> with their miseries; which is so far from being a <hi>perfection</hi> of Power that it proceeds from the most wretched <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>impotence.</hi> So that by attributing <hi>such</hi> a power to God, we foully <hi>asperse</hi> and <hi>blaspheme</hi> him, and instead of a God imagine a <hi>worse</hi> Devil, and <hi>more</hi> qualified to do mischief than any that are now in Hell, who though they are powerful <hi>enough</hi> to do mischief, are none of them <hi>Omnipotently</hi> mischievous; it is to imagine a <hi>God</hi> without a <hi>Deity,</hi> that is, without that <hi>Essential</hi> Rectitude of Will wherein all his <hi>Moral</hi> perfections do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, which are the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of his Nature. For to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>just</hi> are the <hi>brightest</hi> Rays of the Deity, the Rays that <hi>illustrate</hi> and <hi>glorifie</hi> all his other perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and without which infinite <hi>Knowledg</hi> and infinite <hi>Power</hi> would be nothing but infinite <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Mischief</hi>; so that to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he hath any <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> that is not <hi>Essentially</hi> subject to his <hi>Moral</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is to <hi>deface</hi> the very <hi>beauty</hi> of his Nature, and represent him the most <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi> thing in the World. Wherefore in conceiving of God we ought to fix <hi>this</hi> as the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> Rule of our thoughts, that he hath no <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Chuse,</hi>


                     <pb n="480" facs="tcp:60130:254"/>
or <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Act</hi> but what are in <hi>perfect</hi> subjection to infinite <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; and this will secure our minds from all those <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>sour</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of him which by <hi>reflecting</hi> on his <hi>Moral</hi> perfections do him the greatest <hi>dishonour,</hi> and represent him the most <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageously</hi> to mankind.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. AND lastly, It is also necessary that in conceiving of the perfections of God we always suppose them exactly <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious</hi> and <hi>consistent</hi> with each other. For all perfections of Being, so far forth as they are perfections, are <hi>consistent</hi> with each other, and like <hi>strait</hi> lines drawn from the same Center run <hi>Parallel</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any <hi>crossing</hi> or <hi>interfering.</hi> For there is nothing <hi>contrary</hi> to perfection but <hi>imperfection,</hi> and there is no <hi>disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> but what arises from <hi>contrariety.</hi> When therefore we conceive of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, we must so conceive of them, as that there may be no manner of <hi>inconsistency</hi> or <hi>disagreement</hi> between them, otherwise we must admit into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of them something or other that is <hi>defective</hi> or <hi>imperfect.</hi> As for instance, in God there is infinite <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Justice,</hi> infinite <hi>Goodness,</hi> and infinite <hi>Mercy,</hi> wherefore if we would conceive


<pb n="481" facs="tcp:60130:254"/>
aright of these his glorious perfections we must take care not to admit any Notion of any <hi>one</hi> of them that renders it repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to any <hi>other,</hi> but so to conceive of them <hi>altogether</hi> as that they may mutually <hi>accord</hi> and <hi>agree</hi> with each other. For while we apprehend his Goodness to be such as that it will not <hi>accord</hi> with his Wisdom, we must either suppose his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be <hi>Craft,</hi> or his Goodness to be <hi>Folly</hi>; and whilst we apprehend his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be such as that it will not <hi>agree</hi> with his Justice, we must either suppose his Justice to be <hi>Cruelty,</hi> or his Mercy to be <hi>blind Pity</hi> and <hi>Fondness</hi>; and it is certain that that goodness cannot be a perfection which <hi>exceeds</hi> the <hi>measures</hi> of Wisdom, nor that Mercy neither which <hi>transgresses</hi> the <hi>bounds</hi> of Justice, and so on the contrary. For if either Gods goodness <hi>excludes</hi> his wisdom, or his wisdom his goodness; if either his Mercy <hi>swallow up</hi> his Justice, or his Justice his Mercy, there is an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>repugnance</hi> and <hi>contrariety</hi> between them, and where there is a contrariety there must be <hi>imperfection</hi> in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other,</hi> or <hi>both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE if we would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them <hi>altogether,</hi> as they <hi>truly</hi> are in God, that is, under the notion of <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>


                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:60130:255"/>
we must so conceive of them as that in all respects they may be perfectly <hi>consistent</hi> and <hi>harmonious</hi>; as that his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may not <hi>clash</hi> with his Goodness, nor his Goodness with his Wisdom; as that his Mercy may not <hi>justle</hi> with his Justice, nor his Justice with his Mercy; that is, we must conceive him to be as <hi>wise</hi> as he can be with infinite goodness, as <hi>good</hi> as he can be with infinite wisdom, as <hi>just</hi> as he can be with infinite mercy, and as <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> as he can be with infinite justice, which is to be <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> so far as it is a <hi>perfection</hi> to be so. For to be <hi>wise</hi> beyond what is good, is <hi>Craft,</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> beyond what is wise, is <hi>Dotage,</hi> to be <hi>just</hi> beyond what is merciful, is <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,</hi> to be <hi>merciful</hi> beyond what is just, is <hi>Easiness,</hi> that is, they are all <hi>imperfection,</hi> so far as they are <hi>beyond</hi> what is <hi>perfect.</hi> Wherefore we ought to be very careful not to represent these his <hi>Moral</hi> perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as <hi>running a tilt</hi> at one another, but to conceive of them <hi>all together</hi> as one <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> perfection, which though like the Center of a Circle it hath many Lines drawn from it round about, and so is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon sometimes as the term of <hi>this</hi> Line, and sometimes of <hi>that,</hi> yet is but one <hi>common</hi> and <hi>undivided</hi> term to them

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Taking up our Notions of God from <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> passages, and not from the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>general</hi> current of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Indevotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. ONE great cause of our misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of God is <hi>Ignorance</hi> of what is the <hi>true</hi> perfection of our <hi>own</hi> Natures. For, as I shewed before, in conceiving of the perfections of God we must take our <hi>rise</hi> from those perfections we behold in his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and particularly in our <hi>own</hi> Natures, wherein there is a composition of all <hi>created</hi> perfections; so that while we are ignorant of what is the true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our <hi>own</hi> Natures, our thoughts can have no <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>aim</hi> whereby to judg of <hi>God</hi>'s. That he hath all those perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>himself</hi> which he hath derived to


<pb n="486" facs="tcp:60130:257"/>
                     <hi>us,</hi> is the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Maxim upon which we are to erect our Notions of him; and therefore unless we know <hi>what</hi> those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are which he hath derived to us, and <hi>wherein</hi> they consist, our mind hath no <hi>footing</hi> or <hi>foundation</hi> whereon to raise any certain Idea of him. For since we have no other way to conceive of <hi>his</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections but by our <hi>own,</hi> how is it possible that while we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of our own we should ever conceive <hi>aright</hi> of his? This therefore is one great reason why men do so <hi>grosly</hi> misconceive of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no true Notion of their <hi>own</hi> perfection, by which they are to form their conceptions of <hi>his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR whereas the <hi>true</hi> perfection of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature consists In <hi>Moral goodness,</hi> or an <hi>universal</hi> compliance of its <hi>Will, Affections,</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> with those ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>righteousness</hi> which <hi>right reason</hi> prescribes, how many are there that look upon this as a very <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> accomplishment, and place all their perfection in things of a quite <hi>different</hi> nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Ebbs</hi> and <hi>Flows</hi> of their <hi>sensitive</hi> passion, and the extraordinary <hi>Fermentations</hi> of their <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>spirits,</hi> that is to say, in unaccountable <hi>dejections</hi> and <hi>exaltations</hi> of mind, in vehement


<pb n="487" facs="tcp:60130:257"/>
                     <hi>impressions</hi> of <hi>fancy</hi> and Mechanical <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>affection,</hi> in <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacies</hi> and Hypocondriacal <hi>incomes</hi> and <hi>manifestations,</hi> that have nothing of <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi> Vertue or Piety in them, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly any other effect but to cause men to <hi>renounce</hi> that Righteousness which they never <hi>had,</hi> and <hi>rely</hi> upon that which they have no <hi>Title</hi> to, and to <hi>sooth</hi> and <hi>tickle</hi> their fancies, and <hi>blow</hi> them <hi>up</hi> into <hi>glorious</hi> opinions of themselves, and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant</hi> assurances of their being the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> and <hi>Favourites</hi> of God, whilst poor <hi>Moral</hi> men, that make conscience of <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> their <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> by the eternal <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> are look'd upon by them with a <hi>scornful</hi> compassion, and placed in the <hi>lowermost</hi> form of sinners, at the <hi>greatest</hi> distance from the Kingdom of God. Now when men take such <hi>false</hi> measures of their own perfection, how is it possible they should conceive <hi>aright</hi> of the perfections of God, which they have no other way to conceive of but only by <hi>arguing</hi> from their <hi>own?</hi> Wherefore in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the forming our Ideas of <hi>Gods</hi> perfections, it is necessary we should first fix the <hi>true</hi> Notion of our <hi>own</hi>; which is no hard matter for us to do. For our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being <hi>reasonable,</hi> to be sure its


<pb n="488" facs="tcp:60130:258"/>
perfection must consist in willing, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and acting <hi>reasonably,</hi> or which is the same thing, in <hi>Governing</hi> it self in all its <hi>relations</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> by those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>goodness</hi> which <hi>right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> prescribes, and which are <hi>exemplified</hi> to us in the holy Scripture; and when we have fixt in our minds <hi>this</hi> Notion of our <hi>own</hi> perfection, it will naturally conduct our thoughts to <hi>God</hi>'s, and let us see that his perfection consists not in a <hi>lawless</hi> and <hi>boundless</hi> Will, that <hi>decrees</hi> without <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, resolves</hi> without <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> because it <hi>will,</hi> and then <hi>executes</hi> its own <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi> purposes by dint of <hi>irresistible</hi> power without any regard to <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong.</hi> For if we rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our <hi>own</hi> perfection, we cannot but discern that such a Will as <hi>this</hi> is one of the most <hi>monstrous</hi> deformities in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because it is the most Diametrically <hi>opposite</hi> to the <hi>true</hi> Idea of our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which while we <hi>attentively</hi> fix our eyes on, we cannot but <hi>infer</hi> from it that the true perfection of God consists in the <hi>unvariable</hi> determination of his <hi>Will</hi> by the all-comprehending <hi>reason</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi> or in <hi>chusing</hi> and <hi>refusing, decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>executing</hi> upon such reasons as best becomes a <hi>God</hi> to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>act</hi> on, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon


<pb n="489" facs="tcp:60130:258"/>
such as are infinitely <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>merciful.</hi> For if to Will and Act upon such reasons as <hi>these</hi> be the perfection of <hi>our</hi> nature, we cannot but conclude that it is the perfection of <hi>Gods</hi> too; but if we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of our own perfection, we must necessarily think of God <hi>at Rovers,</hi> without any certain <hi>aim</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> to <hi>square</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> our apprehensions.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. ANOTHER cause of our misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of God, is our framing our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him according to the Model of our own particular <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>temper.</hi> For <hi>self-love</hi> being the most <hi>vehement</hi> affection of Humane Nature, and that upon which all its <hi>other</hi> affections are founded, there is no one Vice to which we are more universally obnoxious than that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive <hi>fondness</hi> and <hi>partiality</hi> to our selves, which makes us too often <hi>dote</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>deformities,</hi> and even <hi>Idolize</hi> the <hi>Vices</hi> of our own temper. So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our nature be <hi>stern, sour,</hi> and <hi>imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> or <hi>fond, easie</hi> and <hi>indulgent,</hi> we are apt to <hi>admire</hi> it as a <hi>great</hi> perfection merely because it is <hi>Ours,</hi> without <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring</hi> it by those eternal <hi>reasons</hi> which are the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Perfection</hi> and <hi>Imperfection</hi>; and then whatever we look


<pb n="494" facs="tcp:60130:259"/>
upon as a perfection in <hi>our selves</hi> we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally attribute to <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of all perfection. And hence it comes to pass that mens minds have been always tinctured with such <hi>false</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> opinions of God, because they frame their judgments of him not so much by their <hi>reason</hi> as by their <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>; and so their <hi>different</hi> humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only <hi>unreasonable</hi> in themselves, but <hi>repugnant</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to one another, produce in them not only <hi>false</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,</hi> but <hi>contrary</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of God. Thus for instance, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> who were a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>voluptuous</hi> Sect, intirely addicted to <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> fancied God to be <hi>such a one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> a Being that was wholly <hi>sequestred</hi> from action, and <hi>confined</hi> to an Extra-mundane Paradise, where he lived in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>ease,</hi> and was entertained with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Luxuries,</hi> without ever concerning his <hi>thoughts</hi> with any thing <hi>abroad</hi>; for <hi>this</hi> they thought was the top of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and therefore <hi>thus</hi> they would have chosen to live had <hi>they</hi> been <hi>Gods</hi> themselves. Thus the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who were a sort of very <hi>morose</hi> and <hi>inflexible</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, copied their Notions of God from their own <hi>complexion,</hi> supposing him to be an


<pb n="495" facs="tcp:60130:259"/>
                     <hi>inflexible</hi> Being that was utterly incapable of being <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> by the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of things, but was wholly governed by a <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>inexorable</hi> Fate. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Thracians,</hi> the <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were a people of a <hi>bloudy</hi> and <hi>Barbarous</hi> nature, Pictured their Gods from their own <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> imagining them to be of a <hi>bloud-thirsty</hi> nature, that delighted to feed their hungry Nostrils with the Nidorous <hi>reeks</hi> and <hi>steams</hi> of humane <hi>gore.</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, the <hi>Platonists,</hi> who were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a very <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>amorous</hi> nature, took their measure of God <hi>thereby,</hi> and so framed an Idea of him that was as <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>amorous</hi> as their own <hi>complexion,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed altogether of <hi>loves,</hi> and <hi>smiles,</hi> and <hi>indearments,</hi> without the least intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>vengeance</hi> and <hi>severity,</hi> how <hi>just</hi> soever in it self, or <hi>necessary</hi> to the well-government of the World. Thus as the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> pictured their Gods <hi>black</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were black themselves, so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally men have been always prone to represent God in the colour of their <hi>own</hi> complexions; which is the cause that they many times represent him so utterly <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> because out of an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <hi>partiality</hi> to themselves they first


<pb n="492" facs="tcp:60130:260"/>
mistake the <hi>deformities</hi> of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for <hi>perfections,</hi> and then <hi>Deifie</hi> them them into <hi>Divine Attributes. Thou thoughtest,</hi> saith God, <hi>that I was altogether such a one as thy self,</hi> Psal. 50.21. that is, thou didst frame thy conceptions of me according to the Pattern of thy own <hi>ill-nature,</hi> and so thoughtest <hi>basely</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily</hi> of me. And hence I doubt not spring most of those <hi>misapprehensions</hi> of God which have been received among <hi>Christians.</hi> For how is it possible for any man that is not of a <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> nature <hi>himself,</hi> to believe it consistent with the nature of <hi>God</hi> to snatch poor Infants from their Mothers Womb, that never <hi>actually</hi> offended him, and hurl them into the flames of Hell? And considering the <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>inflexible</hi> temper of the famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Horrible Decree,</hi> though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a rare and admirable person, there is too much reason to suspect that he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed his <hi>own</hi> nature into his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and modelled his <hi>Divinity</hi> by his <hi>Temper.</hi> And so on the contrary, who but a man of excessive <hi>fondness</hi> and <hi>partiality,</hi> that <hi>loves</hi> beyond all <hi>reason,</hi> and invincibly <hi>doats</hi> upon the <hi>deformities</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, could ever imagine it consistent with the <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> of God to <hi>chuse</hi>


                     <pb n="493" facs="tcp:60130:260"/>
his favourites without <hi>reason,</hi> and, when he hath chosen them, not only to <hi>overlook</hi> all their <hi>faults,</hi> but to <hi>hide</hi> them from his own eyes with the <hi>Mantle</hi> of <hi>anothers</hi> Righteousness, that so how <hi>ill</hi> soever they behave themselves, he may never see cause to be displeased with them? From these and other instances it is evident that one great cause of our misapprehensions of God, is our measuring <hi>his</hi> nature by our <hi>own.</hi> For first, our <hi>partiality</hi> to our selves makes us <hi>magnifie</hi> our own <hi>faults</hi> into <hi>perfections,</hi> and then whatsoever we reckon a perfection in <hi>our selves</hi> we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attribute to <hi>God,</hi> and so many times it comes to pass that our <hi>Notions</hi> of God are nothing but the <hi>Images</hi> of our selves, which <hi>Narcissus</hi>-like we fall in love with for no other reason but because they <hi>reflect</hi> our own <hi>sweet likeness.</hi> As therefore we would not <hi>wrong</hi> God in our own thoughts, we must take care not to attribute to him any thing of our <hi>own,</hi> but what is a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in the judgment of the most <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reason</hi>; and because our <hi>self-love</hi> is apt to <hi>bribe</hi> our own <hi>reason</hi> into a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opinion of whatever is our <hi>own,</hi> we ought to admit nothing of our own into our Notion of God but what is <hi>voted</hi> a perfection by the <hi>common reason</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi>

                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:60130:261"/>III. ANOTHER cause of our misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of God is our obstinate <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> to our own sinful <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For while men are <hi>vehemently</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to any <hi>sinful</hi> courses, the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God must needs sit very <hi>uneasily</hi> on their minds, because it will be always <hi>quarrelling</hi> with them, <hi>suggesting</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against them, and <hi>alarming</hi> them with <hi>dreadful</hi> thoughts and <hi>dire</hi> abodeings of a vengeance to come. For there is no <hi>true</hi> conception of Gods <hi>nature</hi> but what is pregnant with some <hi>powerful</hi> argument against <hi>disobedience</hi> to his <hi>Will</hi>; so that while we obstinately persist in disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, our <hi>reason</hi> cannot truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him without waging <hi>War</hi> against our <hi>Lusts,</hi> and while a man is thus at <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance</hi> with himself, and <hi>one</hi> end of his Soul is at <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>other,</hi> so that he cannot <hi>gratifie</hi> his affection without <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting</hi> his reason, nor <hi>comply</hi> with his reason without doing <hi>violence</hi> to his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he can never be at ease <hi>within,</hi> till either he hath forced his affection to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to his reason, or his reason to <hi>submit</hi> to his affection; but while a mans reason hath the <hi>true</hi> Notion of God and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections before it, 'twill be impossible for him to <hi>reconcile</hi> it to his sinful <hi>affections,</hi>

against which, whenever he <hi>coolly</hi> reflects, it must necessarily dictate <hi>bitter</hi> Invectives and denounce <hi>horrible</hi> Sentences. So that if he be <hi>obstinately</hi> resolved to side with his sinful affections, he must either be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent patiently to endure the <hi>clamour</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> of his own reason, which is one of the most <hi>uneasie</hi> Penances in the World, or endeavour to <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>sophisticate</hi> his Notions of God with such opinions as countenance his Lusts. And this, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the mighty influence which mens <hi>affections</hi> have on their <hi>reason,</hi> is no hard matter to do; for the least <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> backt with a <hi>strong</hi> affection for an opinion, is of greater force with <hi>corrupt</hi> minds than the clearest <hi>demonstration</hi> against it. So that if the <hi>Opinion</hi> be but serviceable to the interest of a mans <hi>lust, that</hi> will engage his <hi>affection</hi> on its side, and then the opinion having once retained those <hi>powerful</hi> Orators in its cause, it is secure of a very <hi>favourable</hi> trial at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of <hi>reason,</hi> where in all probability only <hi>one</hi> side of the Question will be weighed, and Judgment will be given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing the Arguments <hi>for</hi> it, without admitting any evidence <hi>against</hi> it.</p>

                     <pb n="496" facs="tcp:60130:262"/>THUS when men are <hi>hunted</hi> and <hi>pursued</hi> through their wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by the <hi>true</hi> Notions of God, it is expedient for them if they <hi>resolve</hi> to go on to take sanctuary in <hi>false</hi> ones, where their <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> their <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> may dwell <hi>quietly</hi> together, and they may be as wicked as they please without any <hi>disturbance.</hi> And abundance of such false Notions there are <hi>prepared</hi> to their hands, which mens wicked minds have <hi>invented</hi> in the defence of their lusts. For thus some, to <hi>ease</hi> their Consciences, have persuaded themselves, that God is so wholly <hi>taken up</hi> with his <hi>own</hi> happiness as that he is not <hi>at leisure</hi> to concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about <hi>humane actions,</hi> and under this persuasion they sin on with full <hi>security</hi> that he will never <hi>punish</hi> them.

                  <p>WHEREFORE if we would form a <hi>right</hi> Notion of God in our minds, and preserve it <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unsophisticated,</hi> we must above all things beware not to let our <hi>Lusts</hi> intermingle with our <hi>Reasonings</hi> about him, or to <hi>bribe</hi> us to <hi>assent</hi> to any <hi>opinion</hi> concerning him.

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:60130:264"/>
is what it <hi>would</hi> be if it were <hi>apart</hi> by it self, but what it <hi>is</hi> in <hi>conjunction</hi> with all the <hi>rest</hi> of his actions, and that <hi>that</hi> which by <hi>it self</hi> might prove very <hi>pernicious,</hi> may by being <hi>contempered</hi> with <hi>others</hi> of a <hi>different</hi> nature become exceeding <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial</hi> to the World. For so in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens there are sundry Stars of a very <hi>malignant</hi> aspect apart by <hi>themselves,</hi> which yet in <hi>conjunction</hi> with other Stars of a <hi>different</hi> temper do many times derive a most <hi>benign</hi> influence upon us. And if men can give no certain judgment of any single <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Scene</hi> of Gods <hi>Providence</hi> without comprehending at once the whole <hi>Drama,</hi> how is it possible they should take <hi>true</hi> measures of his <hi>Nature</hi> by any <hi>particular</hi> event that befalls them? For for all they know those very Events which <hi>singly</hi> considered are most <hi>noxious</hi> to the World, may be most <hi>beneficial</hi> as they are <hi>intermingled</hi> and <hi>contempered</hi> with other Providences; so that while they measure God by <hi>single</hi> Events they will many times deduce <hi>sour</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him from those very Providences which are the highest instances of his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity</hi> and <hi>goodness.</hi> Thus, for instance, should <hi>Joseph</hi> have framed his judgment of Gods <hi>Nature</hi> by his being thrown into


<pb n="501" facs="tcp:60130:264"/>
the <hi>Pit,</hi> sold into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there cast into <hi>Prison</hi> for his <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>innocence,</hi> what could he have thought of him but that he was a very <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> Being, that took <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>afflicting</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and <hi>sported</hi> himself with the <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of his Creatures? And yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what <hi>followed</hi> upon these sad Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and how <hi>these</hi> were all of them but so many <hi>steps</hi> to his <hi>advancement,</hi> it is plain, that had he thought <hi>thus,</hi> he had thought very <hi>injuriously</hi>; those <hi>very</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences from which he must have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Gods <hi>malice</hi> to him, being in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> with what followed most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious instances of his <hi>Goodness</hi> towards him.</p>
                  <p>AND yet how <hi>commonly</hi> do we see men pass judgment on Gods <hi>Nature</hi> from such <hi>particular</hi> Providences?

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:60130:265"/>
doubtless see infinite reason to conclude the quite <hi>contrary.</hi> Sometimes again they behold Wickedness <hi>prosper</hi> in this World, and Vertue and Innocence <hi>depressed</hi> and <hi>trampled on,</hi> from whence they are ready to conclude, either that that which we <hi>call</hi> Vice and Vertue are things <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> to God, or that he is <hi>unjust</hi> in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi>; whereas had they an <hi>intire</hi> comprehension of the whole <hi>train</hi> and <hi>series</hi> of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, they would soon be convinced that even in these <hi>cross</hi> distributions he doth most <hi>equally</hi> and most <hi>effectually</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and reward the <hi>Good,</hi> by rendring the <hi>ones</hi> Prosperity his <hi>Bane,</hi> and the <hi>others</hi> Adversity his <hi>Restorative.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again they are <hi>denied</hi> those <hi>blessings</hi> and <hi>deliverances</hi> which they have a long while <hi>sought</hi> with most importunate <hi>cries</hi> and <hi>supplications,</hi> from whence they are ready to conclude that God is of a <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>inexorable</hi> nature, not to be <hi>moved</hi> or <hi>prevailed with</hi> by <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>intreaties</hi>; whereas could they but see through the whole <hi>drift</hi> of his Providence, they would easily be satisfied that the goods they <hi>pray for</hi> are many times <hi>preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with <hi>evils,</hi> and the evils they <hi>depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> with <hi>goods</hi> which are much <hi>greater</hi>

than <hi>themselves,</hi> and that <hi>that</hi> is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God was <hi>deaf</hi> to their <hi>intreaties,</hi> because he could not <hi>grant</hi> them what they <hi>asked</hi> without doing them some great <hi>unkindness,</hi> and that therefore these denials are so far from arguing him <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable,</hi> that, on the contrary, they are signal instances of his tender <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi> towards us.

                  <p n="5">V. ANOTHER main cause of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions of God, is the taking up our Notions of him from <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>obscure,</hi> and <hi>single</hi> passages, and not from the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>general</hi> current of Scripture. There is no doubt but that whatsoever God hath


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60130:266"/>
                     <hi>revealed</hi> of himself in Scripture, is <hi>true,</hi> because <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>veracity,</hi> being a great <hi>perfection</hi> in <hi>it self,</hi> must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>his</hi> nature which is the Center of <hi>all</hi> perfection; but yet since there are some things in Scripture hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>in themselves,</hi> and other things diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to <hi>us,</hi> who are not throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Controversies</hi> they refer <hi>to,</hi> or with the <hi>Phrase</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of the Age they were written <hi>in,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us many times to comprehend its meaning by the mere <hi>clink</hi> and <hi>sound</hi> of its words, without expounding its <hi>obscure</hi> passages by its <hi>plain</hi> ones, and its <hi>particular</hi> propositions by its <hi>general</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and to found any <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> upon <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Phrases, that <hi>seemingly</hi> contradicts the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>general</hi> drift, and then to expound the <hi>plain</hi> into the <hi>seeming</hi> sense of the <hi>obscure,</hi> and the <hi>general</hi> current into the <hi>seeming</hi> sense of the <hi>particular</hi> Phrase, is a most egregious <hi>prevarication</hi> on the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And yet this <hi>unreasonable</hi> practice hath occasioned many <hi>false</hi> apprehensions of God in mens minds. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more evident than that all along through the <hi>general</hi> current of Scripture God is represented to us as a most <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent</hi>


                     <pb n="505" facs="tcp:60130:266"/>
Being, that knows no <hi>bounds</hi> of <hi>good-will,</hi> but <hi>stretches</hi> out his <hi>arms</hi> unto <hi>all</hi> his Creation, and <hi>receives</hi> his whole Off-spring, excepting only those <hi>Prodigals</hi> that run away from him, with <hi>free</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> imbraces; as one that <hi>would have all men to be saved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,</hi> and <hi>readily</hi> contributes to them all those <hi>aids</hi> and <hi>assistances</hi> that are necessary to the effecting of these <hi>blessed</hi> ends; that <hi>reprobates</hi> none from his <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> but only such as <hi>despise</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> it, and never <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> any to <hi>wretchedness</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> till they have first <hi>baffled</hi> and <hi>defeated</hi> all his <hi>arts</hi> of <hi>saving</hi> them.

For that God hath <hi>destined</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> part of mankind to <hi>endless</hi> calamity, without any <hi>respect</hi> to their <hi>doings</hi>; that he hath <hi>two</hi> Wills, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>secret</hi> and a <hi>revealed</hi> one; that his <hi>revealed</hi> Will is that he would

have <hi>all</hi> men to be <hi>saved,</hi> and his <hi>secret</hi> one, that he would have the <hi>greatest</hi> part of them <hi>perish</hi>; that he hath imposed a Law upon men which without his <hi>irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible grace</hi> they <hi>cannot</hi> obey, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he hath decreed to <hi>withhold</hi> this grace from the <hi>greatest</hi> part of them, is resolved to persecute <hi>all</hi> that <hi>do</hi> not obey it with <hi>everlasting</hi> flames of <hi>vengeance</hi>; These, I say, are all of them such opinions as <hi>reflect</hi> very <hi>dishonourably</hi> upon God, and have no other foundation but a <hi>few, particular</hi> Phrases and <hi>obscure</hi> passages in Scripture, not only <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>plain</hi> Texts, but the <hi>general</hi> drift and scope of it being of a quite <hi>contrary</hi> sense. So that had but this <hi>necessary</hi> Rule been observed, of interpreting <hi>dark</hi> passages by <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> ones by the <hi>general</hi> scope, such <hi>dishonourable</hi> opinions of God could never have found <hi>shelter</hi> under <hi>Scripture Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> For I would fain know whether those Texts which declare God to be an <hi>universal lover</hi> of the Souls of men, be not far more <hi>numerous</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> than those which <hi>seemingly</hi> restrain his affection to a <hi>small select</hi> number, and <hi>reprobate</hi> all the <hi>rest</hi> of mankind; and if it be so, as I think no modest man can deny, how can this Doctrine de deduced from Scripture


<pb n="507" facs="tcp:60130:267"/>
without forcing the far <hi>greater</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Texts to subscribe to the <hi>smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and the <hi>plainer</hi> to the <hi>obscurer,</hi> which is <hi>contrary</hi> to the most necessary <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Interpretation,</hi> and which, if <hi>pursued,</hi> will open a wide door to the <hi>grossest</hi> and most <hi>fulsome</hi> errours in Religion, Wherefore to secure our minds from <hi>false</hi> apprehensions of God, it is necessary that in consulting the Scripture concerning him, we should follow the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>general</hi> drift of it, and not entertain <hi>any</hi> opinion of him upon the credit of a <hi>few,</hi> or of <hi>obscure</hi> Texts, which <hi>more</hi> or <hi>plainer</hi> ones seemingly contradict. For it is certain, that <hi>that</hi> opinion is either <hi>false,</hi> or of <hi>little</hi> moment, that hath but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Texts to countenance it, and <hi>that</hi> very <hi>dubious,</hi> which hath none but <hi>obscure</hi> Texts to relie on; but when there are more and much plainer <hi>against</hi> it than <hi>for</hi> it, it must be <hi>false,</hi> or there is no <hi>relying</hi> upon Scripture, the sense whereof, as to all <hi>particular</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, must be supposed to be that which the <hi>most</hi> and <hi>plainest</hi> Texts do counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. So that he who imbraces any opinion that hath <hi>more</hi> and <hi>plainer</hi> Texts <hi>against</hi> it than <hi>for</hi> it, imbraces it for its <hi>own</hi> sake, and not for the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>

When therefore we are <hi>transformed</hi> into the <hi>likeness</hi> of God, and made <hi>partakers</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Nature, we shall have a <hi>vital</hi> sense and feeling of his perfections <hi>within</hi> us, by which the <hi>true</hi> Notions of him will be more <hi>confirmed</hi> and <hi>ascertained</hi> to us than by all the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>demonstrations</hi> in the World.

                     <hi>improve</hi> our Meditations into the most <hi>glorious</hi> Ideas of him. For, when all is done, there is no man can <hi>think</hi> so <hi>well</hi> of God as he who hath a <hi>Godlike</hi> nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>resemblance</hi> he bears to him will not only frequently <hi>raise up</hi> his thoughts to God, but also <hi>shape</hi> them into a <hi>conformity</hi> with his nature; whereas whilst we are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> to God, we are not only <hi>devoid</hi> of all that evidence of his perfections which the <hi>purified sense</hi> of our nature would give us, and consequently our Notions of him, for want of that evidence, will be only <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> but through our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> to our own <hi>ungodlike</hi> dispositions we shall be apt to entertain such Notions of him as are as unlike him as <hi>our selves.</hi> For either out of fondness to <hi>our selves</hi> we shall look upon our <hi>ill dispositions</hi> as <hi>perfections,</hi> and so attribute them to <hi>God,</hi> or out of fondness to <hi>those</hi> ill dispositions we shall be tempted to admit such opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God as will <hi>license</hi> and <hi>indulge</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE if we would secure our minds against all <hi>false</hi> apprehensions of God, we must above all things endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>purifie</hi> our hearts from those <hi>evil</hi> dispositions which render us <hi>unlike</hi> him; from <hi>sensuality</hi> and <hi>injustice,</hi> from <hi>pride</hi>

                  <p>And now, having seen what the true <hi>causes</hi> of all our <hi>misapprehensions</hi> of God are, let us from henceforth <hi>beware</hi> of them, and, so far as in us lies, labour to <hi>avoid</hi> them; and considering of what <hi>vast</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our Religion <hi>right</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Notions of God are, let us <hi>diligently</hi> apply our selves to the <hi>above-named Rules</hi> for the <hi>regulating</hi> our apprehensions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; that so having throughly <hi>purged</hi> our thoughts of all <hi>erroneous</hi> opinions, we may see God <hi>truly</hi> as he <hi>is,</hi> arrayed in all
