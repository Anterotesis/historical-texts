         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To this Relation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touching your beloued Daughter,</hi> [<hi>the most whereof your selfe, and a good part whereof, your Sonne,</hi> (<hi>by a speciall Prouidence of God, bringing him from</hi> Oxford <hi>hither, at that</hi> time of love,) <hi>haue been both</hi> Eye-<hi>and</hi> Ear-witnesses,] <hi>as you haue the neerest interest of any: so it cannot but be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, to retain such</hi> a Monument of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Riches of GODS GRACE <hi>manifested to her, and uttered by her; that untill</hi> April 6. <hi>for foure yeares together, had been so deeply</hi> afflicted <hi>in Spirit,</hi> tossed with Tempest, and not comforted. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both your selfe, and all your Christian friends in</hi> London, Daintrie, <hi>in and about</hi> Shrewsbury, <hi>and elsewhere, that haue known your</hi> Sisters <hi>sad condition; and haue prayed and mourned for her; now that God hath</hi> restored comforts to her, and to her mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (<hi>Isa.</hi> 57, 18.) <hi>they may the more be stird up to</hi> praise <hi>and</hi> magnifie <hi>the Name of</hi> the God of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
<pb facs="tcp:59951:6"/>
               <hi>the God</hi> that heareth Prayer. <hi>And if the Lord please to moove in the reading hereof, it may administer some</hi> door of hope, <hi>to some other poore soules, that are in as sad a condition, in as wofull and dolefull a plight, as your Daughter lately was in, and had so continued, especially since shee was about eleven or twelve yeares of age, till now of late, that shee is towards sixteen, as you more fully know. I doe acknowledge the LORDS good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and blesse his holy Name for his gracious dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation towards me, that by means of Mr</hi>is Sarah Jones (<hi>then of</hi> Lambeth) <hi>he brought me to sympathize with you, when (about ten or eleven yeeres agoe) your soule was (as it had been for some yeares together,) in sad despair: and that soon after he refreshed me with the refreshings that he gave in to your soule. And that hereby the most wise God, made such way for acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me so fully also, first with your beloved Daughter</hi> Sarah <hi>her</hi> sorrowfull, <hi>and then with her so</hi> joyfull <hi>estate: and that gave me so many opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently with her, that I also with your selfe, might be a witnesse of both; and might be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Publishing to the world, THE EXCEED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING RICHES OF HIS GRACE, EXALTED towards her; and by her to many sad despairing soules, and to others: So as I hope the Lord will make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall for the great refreshing of many poor, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, sorrowfull, weary soules; that thus may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the same.</hi>

               <hi>SARAH WIGHT,</hi> being then still very weak in body, (and keeping bed since <hi>April 6.</hi>) said thus to the <hi>Relator</hi>: I would others might heare how graciously the Lord hath dealt with me, <hi>the chiefest of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that none might DESPAIR and murmure,</hi> as I have done: Though I <hi>murmured</hi> as they in the Wildernes, as much as those that sell, yet he hath brought me into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>: and hath brought <hi>Legion</hi> to her right mind, and set her at his feet. I was strongly perswaded that what I did eat or drink, it was as the unworthy eating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I stil did <hi>cat and drink my own damnation</hi>: every thing I did, or saw, was terror to me. So it remained, and might have remain'd for ever, had not his loving kindnes preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, and drawn me to himselfe.</p>
            <p>O that all creatures, reasonable and unreasonable, might praise the Name of the Lord | And I would others might heare of this, <hi>that none might PRESUME</hi>: For if they knew the terrors that I have felt, the terrors of Hell, for sinning against light, against God, and against a Parent, for murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, revolting; (judging I had committed that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable sin,) if they knew what it is to have God hide his face, and be as an enemy, they would <hi>not presume.</hi>

            <p>MAny of these <hi>precious Pearles,</hi> these hidden Mysteries of the <hi>Treasury</hi> of the glorious Gospel being gathered and stored up together by the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> as they were brought to light day by day, before the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> last: Divers Christian friends, that had been partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, judged it unmeet they should be hid and hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up for a few to enjoy in private: much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they might be <hi>published,</hi> both for better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to themselves, and to many others whom the Lord might please to support, refresh, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich thereby: When no more was gathered then what might be contained in two sheets or three.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earthly Vessell</hi> of conveyance being then most likely to return to earth, within a few dayes. Hence was the more cause of willingnesse to yeild to this desire; and to prefix the Letter foregoing (for the better confirmation hereof) writ <hi>April</hi> 27. 1647. After that day shee remaining as weak as before, and unable to eat at all for <hi>eleven weeks</hi> together; or to drink, but onely once in two or three, or once in foure or five dayes: and still drinking lesse and lesse, then that before: (<hi>Pag.</hi>

               <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his Letter. For my dear and honored Friend <hi>and Cosen, M</hi> H. JACIE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Cosen;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Salute you in the <hi>Lord.</hi> I did much rejoyce in those <hi>breathings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> which I found in your <hi>little Book OF THE RICHES OF GRACE ADVANCED,</hi> &amp;c. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord is <hi>teaching</hi> his people, and fulfilling his promises; <hi>They shall be all taught of God:</hi> (Joh. 6. 45.) And thus his <hi>New Covenant</hi> with his people shall be more and more revealed, and <hi>the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone shall be exalted in that day,</hi> (Isa. 2.11.) When I meet with such <hi>precious manifestations</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> me thinkes I taste those <hi>waters</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> those <hi>rivers of living water which shall show out of the bellies of those, who beleeve in Christ,</hi> (Joh. 7. 38.) There is not a <hi>streame</hi> of this water, but it proceeds from the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.8,9.) though it flow in the <hi>vallies,</hi> in the <hi>poore, low,</hi> and <hi>humble Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde in this <hi>Spirituall Treatise</hi> of yours, two things very <hi>experiment all</hi>; the <hi>one</hi> is her <hi>Legall,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> her more <hi>Gospel</hi> condition: In the <hi>first,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59951:11"/>
shee is in <hi>bondage,</hi> in <hi>blackness,</hi> and <hi>darkness,</hi> and <hi>tempest</hi>; in much <hi>distresse,</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> her life <hi>drawing nigh unto hell:</hi> and <hi>afflicted with all his waues,</hi> (Psal. 88.3.7.) In her <hi>Gospel</hi> state, I find God <hi>shewing wonders</hi> to the <hi>dead,</hi> making the <hi>dead</hi> to <hi>rise</hi> and praise him; shewing his <hi>loving kindnesse</hi> in the <hi>grave,</hi> and his <hi>faithfulness</hi> in <hi>destruction:</hi> and making known his glory in the <hi>dark,</hi> and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse in the <hi>land of forgetfulnesse,</hi> (Psal. 88.10, 11, 12.) And truely the <hi>voice</hi> of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>gladnesse</hi> is in the <hi>tabernacles</hi> of the <hi>righteous,</hi> (Psal. 118. 15.) I finde that when <hi>God</hi> reveales himselfe in <hi>Christ,</hi> in his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> is sweetly <hi>raised,</hi> and <hi>cheered,</hi> and the <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is as <hi>wine,</hi> even as the <hi>spiced</hi> wine. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but the Lord will fill this soule with more <hi>discoveries,</hi> then this of <hi>the Riches of grace</hi>; this <hi>truth</hi> being that <hi>first</hi> discovery of God in <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Cosen,</hi> you do well thus to watch the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> of God in <hi>his,</hi> and to publish them to the <hi>Saints.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Touching her Education:</hi> In the time of her Mothers deep afflictions of Spirit, and sore Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, shee was <hi>well trained up in the Scriptures,</hi> by her godly faithfull Grand-mother, M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Wight</hi> of <hi>Daintree.</hi> And when the Lords <hi>time of Love</hi> was, that he vouchsafed to manifest his Grace in Christ to her Mothers soule, then the Lord
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59951:20"/>
brought her home to her, shee being then about nine yeares old. Shee gave her selfe much to read and study the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> Which though shee then understood not aright; yet the Lord by his Holy Spirit brought to her <hi>remembrance,</hi> and <hi>opened</hi> to her since her restoring, what formerly shee had read for great comfort and soul-refreshing to her selfe, and to many others; as hereafter followeth.
<hi rend="margQuotes">(Which is a great encouragement to all that feare God,</hi>
to train up ther children in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; as, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19.)</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Touching her afflictions.</hi> From her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood she was of a <hi>tender</hi> heart, and oft afflicted in Spirit: Her Temptations were not so great, till shee was about <hi>twelve</hi> yeares old; since which, they have continued with more violence till <hi>April</hi> 6. 1647. it being about foure yeares. [Shee is not <hi>six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> yeares old (as her Mother saith,) till <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following.]</p>
            <p>The beginning of her more violent Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was thus: Her superiour bid her doe a small thing, judging it meet and lawfull: <hi>Shee did it, doubtingly, fearing it was unlawfull:</hi> and as shee did it, <hi>a great Trembling</hi> in her hands and body fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her: being condemned in her selfe. About a moneth after, returning home, having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, she had lost her <hi>hood,</hi> and knew shee had lost it. Her Mother asked her, for her <hi>hood.</hi> Shee suddenly answered, <hi>My Grand-mother hath it.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59951:20"/>
Her heart condemned her instantly, and trembled againe <hi>exceedingly.</hi> And these were the first chiefe occasions of her deep despaire: And upon this, shee had cast into her Conscience, that <hi>shee was both a thiefe, and a lyar,</hi> and was terrified ever since, that shee was shut out of Heaven, and must be damn'd, damn'd, damn'd.</p>
            <p>In the last four yeares, shee was oft in such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, shee could beleeve nothing but Hell and Wrath—to be her Portion; and other times, that there was no heaven; nor no hell, but in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: and that shee was <hi>damn'd already, being an unbeleever:</hi> and therefore if shee could but dispatch this life of hers, there was an end of her sorrows. A subtle deceit of the old Serpent! Hence shee oft attempted <hi>wickedly</hi> to destroy her selfe; as by <hi>drowning, strangling, stabbing</hi>; seeking to beat out her <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>braines</hi>; wretchedly bruising, and wounding her selfe: (The chiefe cause of <hi>such</hi> weaknesse since:) Many particulars whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in her own Relations.</p>
            <p>But the Lord who is her life, and loved her then in her bloud, he wonderfully prevented her destruction, many wayes. Sometimes by one or other at that instant; sometimes staying her in the acting, when no creature was by: Sometimes by bringing to her minde some choice Scripture: as this, <hi>No weapon form'd against thee, shall prosper,</hi> (<hi>Isa.</hi> 54.17.) or this, <hi>None shall take them out of my hand</hi>; or, <hi>out of my Fathers hand,</hi> (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.28, 29.) This
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59951:21"/>
stop'd her sinfull act, but the comfort stayed not.</p>
            <p>Many precious Ministers came to comfort her: In <hi>London</hi> these, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59951:22"/>
what they have seen, or heard, and beleeve: many of them being persons of note, and of much esteem in <hi>London</hi> amongst them that fear the <hi>Lord.</hi> The <hi>Naming</hi> of them, the <hi>Relator</hi> desires may not be offensive to <hi>any</hi> of them, seeing 'tis done for the more assuring this great and <hi>memorable</hi> worke of Gods mercy, to some, that (like <hi>Thomas</hi>) will not <hi>beleeve</hi> it, unlesse (at least) they may speak with some, that have been <hi>present</hi> with her.</p>
            <p>About a moneth before her <hi>great deliverance,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan having but a short time so to torment her, her stormes and tempests were greatest of all. She was grievously hurried with Temptations; so terrified, shee could not rest at all, for many dayes and nights together. Whilst shee was able to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, her Mother would have her goe with her to heare Sermons, on the <hi>Lords dayes,</hi> and on the <hi>Lecture</hi>-dayes there. One <hi>Lecture</hi>-day she was gone forth before her Mother; who missing her, went to the Assembly; and not finding her there, came forth; and sudddenly went, and sent towards <hi>Thames</hi> to seek her: where shee had been, to have cast her selfe in, but was stayd from it by the power and goodnesse of God: and being found, shee had a <hi>command</hi> on her spirit to goe to heare that Sermon, and her Mother coming to her, shee readily yeelded to goe with her Mother to the <hi>Lecture</hi> there. Wherein was proved, what great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour God will shew towards the stock of the <hi>Iews</hi>; that he will <hi>grass</hi> multitudes of them <hi>into their own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59951:22"/>
Olive,</hi> pardoning their sinnes against Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing them to great dignity, &amp;c. He that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, went in to M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Wights</hi> house there, after the Sermon; and spake with her daughter, asking her, if the Lord spake any peace to her thereby. Shee answered, <hi>shee would not for all the world, but shee had heard that Sermon.</hi> Being asked, why so? Shee said, <hi>That God will shew mercy to the Iewes; and they are the basest people on earth</hi>; that so hate the very name of Christians, and much more Christ himselfe: <hi>and yet that God will call them</hi>; This supported her a little at that present; but it stayed not with her, and shee was againe under horrid Temptations, to beleeve there was <hi>no God, no Devill, no Heaven, and no Hell, but what shee felt within her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One day being strongly carried on in that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>that there was no other Hell, but here in the conscience</hi>; As that famous M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Hanywood</hi> had said and done with a <hi>Venice Glasse,</hi> (who said <hi>shee was as sure to be damn'd, as that was to break</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with threw it from her to break it; &amp; yet it brake not;) so did shee with her little white drinking <hi>cup,</hi> an earthen cup; shee said, <hi>As sure as this cup shall breake, there is no other Hell:</hi> and therewith she threw the <hi>cup</hi> with violence, against the far side of the chamber; and though it light against the wood, it brake not. Her mother took it up, &amp; said, <hi>Loe here childe, it is not breke.</hi> Shee got it again, and suddenly said so, &amp; did with it so again, &amp; againe; and once against the edge of the door. Thus shee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59951:23"/>
struggled, and did foure or five times, and yet it brake not; but at the fift time, a little nip brake out. And now since the Lord hath created peace to her, shee hath desired to drinke still out of that <hi>her little cup:</hi> till their Water-bearer unawares cast it downe, and then it brake all to pieces.</p>
            <p>In her despairing fits, shee severall times would turne to the places in <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> where they <hi>cursed the day of their birth</hi>; and shee said to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; <hi>Iob cursed the day wherein he was borne, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought me forth of the womb? Oh, that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.</hi> Shee turning to the places, <hi>Iob</hi> 3.3. <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 18. <hi>And</hi> (<hi>Ier.</hi> 20. 14. to the end) <hi>Ieremy cursed the man that brought tidings of his birth, with bitter curses, because his mothers womb was not his grave,</hi> and said, <hi>Wherefore came I out of the womb, to see toile and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that my dayes should be consumed with shame?</hi> But she said, <hi>Have not I much more cause to say so, then they had? for they were in a blessed condition: but I am curs'd, and must be a fire-brand of Hell for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These and many other desperate expressions, shee frequently used; especially in the <hi>last moneth</hi> of her sorrows. When they encreased daily, so that her soule was exceedingly troubled, and shee was, as it were all shattered to pieces. And shee was so weary of her life, and of her selfe, and of everything, shee was never at such a passe, in such extremitie, in all her life before.</p>
            <p>Her tender and good <hi>Mother,</hi> attending on her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59951:23"/>
continually day and night, to prevent her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving her selfe; being still upheld with great hopes, that the Lord in his good time, would come in to her with his consolations; yea, shee was verily perswaded so, (as was also her <hi>Brother</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi>;) And this made her sore taske the more easie; which els had been intolerable. Yet when this extremitie had continued long, so that for many dayes and nights together, her mother had taken no rest. At last shee was even wearied out with continuall watchings; and to the end her self might enjoy some rest, to prevent harme to her selfe, shee had spoke to a friend, desiring that her daughter might be for a little season with her; which her friend was very willing unto; and her <hi>daughter</hi> was desirous to goe with her, that her <hi>Mother</hi> might enjoy rest. But the <hi>Lord</hi> prevented both in his goodnesse. For when her friend was come, her daughter was taken with such an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding trembling,</hi> and such extremity of sorrow and trouble and <hi>weaknes,</hi> that shee was not able to goe with her. A forerunner of her deliverance.</p>
            <p>Then her <hi>Mother</hi> procured a maid that feared God, to help to look to her, who came that same day of her so trembling, being <hi>Tuesday April</hi> 6. When the maid beforesaid came to her, she found her weeping most bitterly, &amp; wringing her hands grievously, saying, <hi>I am a Reprobate, a Castaway, I never had a good thought in all my life. I have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne ever since I can remember, when I was but a childe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59951:24"/>This heavinesse was greatest, this night was darkest of all, when the day, the joyfull time of her deliverance was neer at hand. And like as at the beginning of her grievous despairing, about foure yeares before, upon those two sinnes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, a <hi>great trembling</hi> fell upon her at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her deep despaire and trouble: so now, at the ending thereof, the <hi>like trembling</hi> fell upon her; such as shee never had, at any other time. And now, thus <hi>trembling</hi> exceedingly, and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wringing her hands; shee said to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <hi>My earthly Tabernacle is broken all to pieces; and what will the Lord doe with me? If I should hang on Gibbets, if I should be cut in pieces, if I should dye the cruellest death that ever any did, I have deserv'd it; I would still justifie God: aye if he cast me to hell.</hi> (Thus it was with patient <hi>Iob; He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> and <hi>justified the Lord,</hi> when his restoring was at hand.) Her hands and her feet were clunched, so as shee could not stand. Shee was tempted and sore urged to blaspheme God and dye. And when shee was ready to speak, her tongue was smitten. Afterward shee being laid down, shee said to her Mother, <hi>Ile lye still, and hear what God will say to me: He will speak Peace, Peace. If God will speak a word of Peace at the last moment, I should be contented.</hi> Then shee desired them that none might trouble her, but that shee might lie in peace. And shee lay still, as in a sleep, (or as in a trance rather,) from that tuesday night, <hi>April</hi> 6. till the last day of that week
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59951:24"/>
(cald <hi>Saturday</hi>) at night; except when shee cald for a little water to drink, and drunk two or three cups of water. No other sustenance shee took all that time. And this was the time of <hi>love</hi>; when <hi>The Exceeding Riches of Grace</hi> was <hi>advanced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 10. 1647. that <hi>Saturday</hi> at night, about midnight, or after midnight, shee began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the first expressions of comforts, of such soule-satisfying comforts, that ever shee so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested: [though her soule enjoyd them from that Tuesday night before; as since her Trances ceas'd, shee hath declared.] Even now, when all mans help faild, and when all meanes before used could not doe it; and when now shee was made uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that way to receive it, being now struck both blind, and deafe: her eyes being fast closed up, wrapt up together: [A. <hi>Saul</hi> (who is called <hi>Paul</hi>) when the Lord converted him, <hi>was three dayes without sight, and neither did eat, nor drinke,</hi> Act. 9. 9.] And thus shee began: <hi>My soule thirsts for the water of life, and I shall have it: My soule thirsts for the water of life, and I shall have it,</hi> (foure times in ardency of spirit uttering those words, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) <hi>a little water good people, a little water.</hi> So shee drank two or three of her little <hi>cups</hi> of water. Then shee sate up, and with a most sweet and heavenly countenance, and with much broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, in an humble melting manner, Teares sometimes trickling downe, shee spake with a low voice, as followeth.</p>

               <hi>Thursday, April</hi> 15. 1647.</p>
            <p>This day, about 7 of the clock in the morning, shee began thus: <hi>Daniel in the Lyons den; the three children in the siery farnace</hi>
               <note n="n" place="bottom">Dan. 6. end: Dan. 3.26, 28.</note>; <hi>the Lord delivered them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59951:29"/>
and so he doth me.</hi> Then calling for water to drink, shee said again, (as formerly,) <hi>Christ hath given you water to drink freely: give me water freely:</hi> so shee drank three or foure times her <hi>little cup</hi> full of water. And shee still remaining deaf, and with her eyes fast closed up, shee said; <hi>Have not I a Mother some where? I pray you pray her to pardon me, the murmurings against her. For nothing els troubles me. God hath pardoned. Hath the Creator pardoned, and shall not the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> Thus speaking, the teares ran fast down her checks for a great while: and shee said; <hi>When the prodigall came home, his earthly father pardon'd him</hi>
               <note n="o" place="bottom">Luk. 15. 20. 32.</note>, <hi>and his heavenly Father pardon'd him. And will not my Mother pardon me? If shee should, its not that, will doe me good. If shee will not, it lyes heavy upon me. But God hath pardon'd mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Another time, when many were present, shee said thus, with teares trickling down; <hi>If any did know, what it is to murmure against a God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Parent, and felt for it what I have felt; they would never doe it. Nothing more burdens me, then my murmurings and disobedience against my Mother.</hi>
This shee spake, weeping. [What a <hi>warning</hi> is this to all children, that have murmured or been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient against father or mother, to repent in time, and seek pardon, and mercy for helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; least it be as heavy a burthen to them, when they are in trouble, as it hath been to this hand-maid, (and to divers others,) Yet she said,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59951:29"/>
               <hi>her disobedience was not wilfull, but shee was hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, in the violence of temptation.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Then shee desired her mother might come to her, to testifie that she had pardon'd her: yet could shee then neither <hi>heare</hi> nor <hi>see:</hi> but said, <hi>I know a Iacob from an Esau.</hi> Her mother came to her, and took her daughters hand, and put it to her own neck, where her daughter felt a skare that was there, through the enemy: whereby her daughter knowing her, cast her head into her mothers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and wept greatly, and kissed her, and stroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her face, and said, <hi>I know you mother; and I love you with another love then I loved you before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then shee asked for <hi>water,</hi> to wash her EYES, desiring she might now <hi>see</hi> her Mother also, and that shee might <hi>heare</hi> her mother speak, and tell her, that shee had pardon'd her disobedience. And water being brought, her eyes were wash'd: and they being still fast folded up,
M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Dupper</hi> her neighbour in <hi>Lawrence Pountney</hi>-lane, held open her eyes, and <hi>shee saw</hi> and <hi>knew</hi> her mother: and then <hi>immediately her</hi> EARES <hi>also were opened,</hi> that shee might heare her mother speake to her, and shee testified to her, that shee had pardon'd her, and lov'd her as her own soule.
And then, her heart was at rest, shee was satisfied: Her <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> then continued about halfe an houre, <hi>viz.</hi> till shee ceased then to speake, and then it was againe taken from her; and her <hi>eyes</hi> were presently closed up again. In this time of her hearing, her mother
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59951:30"/>
told her, that her Brother was come, <hi>viz.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Vaughan</hi>; (her mothers son by her former husband;) [<hi>Who being then a Student of</hi> Alsoules <hi>Colledge in</hi> Oxford, <hi>having remained there severall yeares; was now come to</hi> London, <hi>to see his</hi> Mother, <hi>and</hi> Sister, <hi>and other friends, and was to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again shortly.

            <p>Shee was glad to hear of her <hi>Brother,</hi> that had mourned and pray'd for her, that he was now come at such a time: and shee desired to see and hear him; But at that time, he was abroad. And before he came, shee had ceased speaking, and then remained without speaking, or drinking, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sight or hearing, these being again taken from her from that 15. til the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> On the same 15. day, shee asked if her Brother, or the maid would goe to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Simpson,</hi> to desire him to come to her. When he came, shee had done speaking; and seemed to be in a trance, and would not speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, till her time came.</p>
            <p>On the same 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, before shee ceased, shee further said: <hi>I thought I was the bad theef; but now I see, I am as the good theef. I was really crucified with Christ</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Gal. 2.20.</note>; <hi>though I was not in the appearance of any

            </p>
            <p>Again, shee said; <hi>How old am I?</hi> [Her Mother saith, she shall be <hi>sixteen yeer</hi> old in <hi>September</hi> next, 1647.

            <p>
               <hi>Praise the Lord with me, that hath shew'd mercy on one in so desperate a case as I was in. I could set nothing before me, but curse, and hell, and wrath, night and day. O that others may be are what God hath done for such a one,</hi> (Ps. 66.16.) <hi>I would none may DESPAIR of Gods mercy, that hath done thus for me. If any did know what it is to murmure against God, and against

a Parent, as I have done, and felt what I have felt, they would never doe it.</hi> (A like warning is <hi>pag.</hi> 24.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Relator</hi> having heard shee now had not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any thing at all for twenty-foure dayes or more, and drunk nothing in all this time since <hi>April</hi> 6. but onely faire water; neither that, but two or three little cups together, once in two or three dayes. He desired her, if shee could, to eat, to preserve life: for when the Lord saith, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> he implies the Affirmative, <hi>Thou shalt use all good meanes to preserve life.</hi> (Jam. 2.11.) And though he, and all those present, were so affected, even to admiration, in hearing a child so speak; yet he wished her to forbear speaking too much; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it spent her, shee being so very weak. Shee said; <hi>In rest and returning shall I be saved, in quietnes and confidence shall be my strength</hi>

            <p>☞[<hi>Another time,</hi> when one gave her a <hi>Poesie,</hi> shee looking on it, and smelling its sweetnes, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the workmanship of God in the severall flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: saying to this effect; <hi>The flowers are all fragrant, and some more fragrant then others, they have different colours, and different smels: and all come out of the

            <p>In like humble manner, her tender eyes being covered, and lying still, (as shee had kept her bed, being very weak, since <hi>April</hi> 6.) with a low voice, as speaking to her selfe, shee said: <hi>How sweet is it to my thoughts, that an infinite God, should be a Rock and a Refuge to a finite Creature! a sure Rock and hiding place from all stormes &amp; tempests whatsoever,</hi> Ps. 46. 1.</p>

               <hi>When the man was wounded by theeves, and lay by the way; the Priest and the Levite passed by: they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by and helped not: The creature comfort failes: and then the good</hi> Samaritan <hi>helps</hi>

Yet I obtained mercy, that thought my time of mercy was past, &amp; that I was damn'd already through unbeliefe. I said many a time, There's no hope in thy end: and I thought I saw it. I may say, It was good for me to be afflicted, I prize his mercies the more.</hi> (Psal. 119. 69.) <hi>All terrors could not humble me; but the sight of his mercy did.

               <hi>The hundreth and seventh Psalme</hi>; O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodnes, and declare the wonders that he doth for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. <hi>I would that</hi> Psalm <hi>were often read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The goodnesse of God is unsearchable. How great is the excellency of his Majesty; that yet he would look upon such a one as I! I was full of Terror the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I kept my bed: I rested not day nor night. I thought no death was bad enough for me.

            <p>When he hides his face, who is able to beare it? and when he gives quietnes, who then can trouble? [<hi>Iob</hi> 34.29.] <hi>I can testifie the truth of both these.

But he is not weary: He faileth not. He lets the Creature goe his way for a time, for his own good, to humble him more, and shew his mercy the more. He hath him in a chaine, and the enemy in a chaine. So he hath the soule, to dispose of it. (My times are in thy hands:) that he might magnifie mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and free love indeed. No soule ever was as I have been: I am sure of it.

            <p>Mention was made before, that from the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to the 21. of <hi>April,</hi> in those 24. dayes, shee had not eaten at all; and her drink had been onely two, or three, or four little cups of fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, once in two, or three, or in four dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some having spoken of this, others have counted it a forgery, or pretence: By such injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>the Enemy</hi> would obscure and darken the Works of the <hi>Great God</hi> of Heaven. But many Godly Ministers and Gracious Saints, that know M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Wight,</hi> and the <hi>Maid,</hi> and this Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi>; have ground to judge, they truely feare the Lord: and that they dare not lye, but abhorre lying. Now the <hi>Relator</hi> by conference with them, hath it from their own mouths, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59951:45"/>
from the time of her ceasing to be in <hi>Trances,</hi> and to be <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> (which was <hi>April</hi> 19.) to the day of the writing of this part of the <hi>Relation,</hi>
being <hi>May</hi> 5. <hi rend="margQuotes">shee hath not taken so much suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as shee did take in that time from <hi>March</hi> 27. to <hi>April</hi> 19. [And from <hi>May</hi> 5. till <hi>Iune</hi> 11. [being the longest day in the yeare] lesse then that from <hi>April</hi> 19. The <hi>power of God</hi> appearing therein wonderfully to the beholders, in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her full 75 dayes without one crum of bread or meat, and with so little drink;]</hi>
Shee not being able to eat, or to drink more then shee did, but against her stomack. When shee by urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yeelded to take somewhat, shee could not keepe it, but presently cast it up. Shee never lov'd to drink, <hi>strong waters,</hi> nor <hi>strong drink,</hi> from her infancy.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Relator</hi> was told, they could not get her to take of a <hi>Cordiall</hi> that was sent to her from a <hi>Lady</hi> that had been with her, (as they judged, by the direction of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Worsley,</hi> whom the Lady had lately sent to her:) <hi>he</hi> perswaded her to take of it, and put it to her mouth: But shee said, <hi>Shee could not: and said that the smell of it made her sick.</hi> Which caused him to forbear further urging of her.</p>
            <p>When lately one desired her, if shee could to take some sustenance: Shee answered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would, if I could, but I cannot, it makes me sick to think of it. Iesus Christ feeds me.</hi>

               <hi>Sarah</hi> answered: <hi>I cannot: I have Iesus Christ, I have enough: he feeds mee with delights—He not onely hath drops; but he flows in of himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee was further urged to take somewhat: M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Sarah</hi> answered: <hi>Shee desired not to be urged: God hath given me food for my soule, when my soule was well nigh starving for want of food: but God hath given me Christ to feed upon: and his flesh is meat indeed; and his bloud drink indeed</hi>
               <note n="n" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 55.</note>. <hi>God hath wrought a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in delivering my soule.

            <p>She answered; <hi>What ever is for his glory, he will enable me to doe it: If it be his will, that I should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, he will give me power to take in the Creature.</hi>

                  <hi>I have dreames: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I dreame of the free love of God towards me.

                  <note n="r" place="bottom">Heb. 13.8.</note>. This was <hi>May</hi> 5. 1647.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>At the former Conference with M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Palmer,</hi> the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59951:46"/>
               <hi>Relator</hi> was present, and then writ. Both the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer and the latter, M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Palmer</hi> her selfe writ, from whom the <hi>Relator</hi> had it: and compared both together.</p>
            <p>To another shee declared what torments shee had undergone for a <hi>moneth</hi> together, before shee was forced to keep her bed: (which hath been ever since <hi>April</hi> 6.) How shee walked in terror day and night; what a Hell shee had in her Conscience; and was tempted to beleeve there was neither God nor Devill, neither Heaven nor Hell; but what shee felt in her Conscience: And therefore if shee were but out of this life, there was an end of all her torments. And hence shee sought to beat out her braines, against the wall, many times: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was bloudy and sweld. And sought to cast her selfe down from steep places: and got knives and other things to kill her selfe withall; but was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously preserved: because the Lord had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to her, in her base estate. But then shee thought, If Christ should come in to her, it was as if he should goe into a dunghill, into a carraine. That shee was tempted to blaspheme God, and had much adoe to keep it in: especially the last day of her souls affliction. Wherein shee was very <hi>forcibly urged to blaspheme God and dye, and so be out of her Torment</hi>; which yet shee refused to speake it out: till at last, shee could no longer withhold, but was even ready to utter forth that blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and even then was <hi>her Tongue smit,</hi> that shee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59951:47"/>
could not speake. Shee told moreover that shee usually every morning formerly was wont to read above twenty Chapters, and so would have still'd her Temptations; but was not a jot the better. That shee could remember nothing of what shee had read, but the <hi>judgements,</hi> and they were laid open to her: But all the <hi>promises</hi> were seal'd from me, <hi>said shee. One day I was tempted to throw my Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the fire, and I threw it from me, but it fell not into the fire. But for this I was sore tormented, that I would have throwne it into the fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another time in my trouble, I said,</hi> what I was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to say; it was this; <hi>If the Lord will not save me, let him doe what he will with me: Let him damne me. But afterwards, I was greatly terrified for it, that I should bid him damne me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now shee saw the evill of yeelding to such Temptations: shee thought to have had ease by yeelding: but shee was the more terrified for her yeelding. And yet the Lord magnified his mercy to her; when shee thought, that by such yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, God would surely damne her. [O the depths of Satans wiles: and O the greater depths of the Goodnes of God! even so such seduced soules!]</p>
            <p>Shee further said; <hi>That the same day wherein shee was forced to lye downe</hi> (viz. <hi>April</hi> 6.) <hi>shee was taken in all her body: All was shaken, and shee trembled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. That her hands were clinch'd up together, and so were her feet, as if it were by the Cramp; and her mouth was drawn up, as a purse; and her eyes were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59951:47"/>
with the eylids folded up and closed; and her hearing was taken from her; and shee had no motion nor desire of any good. Mine own eyes</hi> (said shee) <hi>pittied not my selfe; and just then was the time of love</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Ezek. 16. 8.</note>. <hi>And then the Good</hi> Samaritane, <hi>then Iesus Christ came, and powr'd in wine and oyle, when I had most need. I may well shy, He is a refuge</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Psal. 46. 1.</note>, <hi>a very present help in time of Trouble.</hi>

Then his Name was proclam'd to me, that he was a Saviour, to save sinners: mercifull, gracious, long-suffering, abounding in goodnesse, and abounding in truth, to fulfill all that mercy and goodnesse: and he is the way to the Father. Ah! that he should love such a one, and marry such a one! that was a murmurer; disobedient, unholy—Such a one God was pleasd to make an object of mercy. There's an end of my misery, though I thought, there was no end of it: but there's no end of his mercy; my misery, was the misery of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but his mercy, is the mercy of a God, and there's no end of it. I was brought as low, at the lowest hell. The gates were open to receive me: that then mercy should come to shut them! that Christ came to fetch me out! He is good, and doth good: not to them that are good, but he makes good; nor to fill them that are full; but to fill them that are empty.

Thy ways are not my ways; nor thy thoughts my thoughts.</hi> This fild me with joy unspeakable; and I said; <hi>Yea Lord, let it be as thou wilt.</hi> I was perswaded, it was an Answer from God: Then I could not, but send for my <hi>friends,</hi> that they might heare <hi>what God had done for me</hi>; and I told them of this. Then I presumed that I had <hi>faith</hi>: and I looked, that God would doe <hi>great</hi> things for <hi>me,</hi> that he had thus spoken to <hi>me,</hi> and done so much for <hi>me.</hi> I was carried on thus for a time. But after this, I was led to sin againe: and I <hi>fear'd</hi> I should sinne: and I said, <hi>Lord, shall I sin againe?</hi> it went to my heart. The <hi>voice</hi> answered me; <hi>Though thou doe, thy sins are buried in the bottome of the Sea: They are bound in a bundle, and cast into the depth of the Sea.</hi> I was not led to sin by this. But I forgate Gods goodnes, and I fell into sin by little and little: and now I have been a backslider.</p>

to any with me, or did that I should not; when it was brought to mind afterward, then I abused my body for it, most of all. And that I did so then, is the cause why I lie here now.

                  <hi>I do pray: but tis that the Lord would give submission to his will. As long as I am in the body, I have cause to pray. I cannot forget to pray for</hi> troubled soules, <hi>that come hither to me. But for my selfe, my chiefest work is now to PRAISE the Lord, for what he hath done to my soul. For Praises wait for God in Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And for what waits it? but for</hi> Zions deliverance <hi>from her</hi> hand bondage. <hi>Zion was a</hi> Wildernesse, desolate, forsaken, forgotten of God <hi>for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59951:76"/>
in her owne apprehension. And when God is pleased in fulnes of time to manifest himself, and to shew his love to</hi> Zion <hi>freely, and to marry her to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, (such a one as I was,) and to establish</hi> Zion <hi>on a sure foundation, that is, upon himself: that though the mountains and hills depart, yet his loving kindnesse shall not depart: then</hi> PRAISES wait for God in Zion: <hi>for</hi> Zion <hi>then hath answer of her</hi> prayers. <hi rend="sup">Ps.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59951:81"/>
a window to the House-tiles, she crept out, (to do like <hi>Iudas,</hi> so cast her self down to dissolve her selfe;) and in the dark she <hi>saw</hi> there a fire, and <hi>Satan</hi> as a <hi>roaring Lyon</hi> in it: yet still being perswades (through his delusion) there was no other hell, but that she felt in her conscience; she went within a quarter of a yard of the edge, being ready to leap down, when none should see or hear her; and nor was no creature to hinder; then was this spoken to her distinctly; <hi>Thou shalt not fall down, and burst asunder, as</hi> Judas <hi>did, and so dishonour God that make thee.</hi> Vpon this, the <hi>sight</hi> vanished, as if it never has been: and she fell not down, being thus kept from it; and sate down by the <hi>chimney</hi> there; and after a while, beat her head against it, till it <hi>sweld</hi> abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and the more she dashed it, (then, and at other times,) the lesse she felt it.

Whilst shee was about this, two that seem'd to be Ministers, saw her sitting there alone, came to her, and <hi>asked</hi> her, how shee did, (for now they saw her weeping;) and why shee sate there? Shee had no power to conceale it, but said; <hi>I am not well, I am as sad a Creature as any on earth. I see my condemnation, and nothing els.

some of the <hi>despairing</hi> soules, that had been with her; and to <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>them</hi>: and for <hi>her selfe,</hi> that <hi>shee might quietly submit to the will of God, to live or dye; for she found not such contentednesse to live, as she desired, but rather longing to be dissolved, to be with Christ, which was best of al for her.</hi> (Phil. 1. 23.)</p>
            <p>So lie left her more drooping, weak, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, then at any time; shee now to the eye of man, drawing neer to death, as he apprehended, and was much affected with it; &amp; spake of it to some.</p>
            <p>☞But yet remembring some expressions of Faith, that she had uttered before, touching the raising up of her body, as well as her soule (<hi>pag.</hi> 33. 35.) he had hopes the Lord would yet raise up her body, to the praise of his Name, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing of others, that are despairing, disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late soules.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>behold and see the LORDS doing: for it is marvailous, and worthy to be remembred.</hi>

            <p>That day, and untill about ten of the Clock at night, &amp; all that week before-going, especially (on, &amp;) since Tuesday beforesaid, she had these words following her, and still as it were spoken to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain &amp; again: <hi>viz. With long life will I satisfie him.</hi> (<hi>Ps.</hi> 91. 16.) At first she took it to be meant of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life in glory, and rejoyced in it. But when it was opened to her, to be also <hi>of long life here:</hi> Shee thought, that would not satisfie her; and therefore she would not regard it: being so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be <hi>absent</hi> from the body, and to be <hi>present</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:59951:84"/>
with Jesus Christ. 2 Cor. 5.8. a <hi>little glimpse</hi> of him that shee felt, was so sweet, shee so desired the <hi>full fruition</hi> of him, that shee was not so contented to live, as was meet: and as now (having a sight of it) shee desired prayer for her, that shee might be; and that she might quietly lie down at the feet of God, to do with her as he would: that shee might not be <hi>so weary</hi> of the condition the Lord allotted to her. About <hi>ten</hi> at night, this came in, as if it had been whispered to her soule from God; <hi>Thou hast not</hi> wearied <hi>me with thy sacrifices; but thou hast</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>me with thy sins: Yet I, even I am he, that blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out thy transgressions, for mine owne Names sake</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This manifestation exceedingly melted her heart; and the more abased her soule before him: And shee said; <hi>Lord, What will thou have me to doe?</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59951:84"/>
It was answered, as that to <hi>Paul,</hi> [<hi>Act.</hi> 22. 10.] <hi>Arise and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee what thou shalt do: So</hi> (it was given her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that) <hi>shee must arise</hi> from that sinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>and goe,</hi> out of her selfe, <hi>to Christ, and he would tell her what shee must doe.</hi> And as he said to <hi>Paul,</hi> (Act. 26. 16.) <hi>Rise, and stand upon thy feet: For I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and a witnes, both of the things thou hast seen, and in which I will appeare unto thee.</hi> So God had bid her <hi>Arise,</hi> and he had raised her soul from the lowest hell; and now he perswaded her, that he will raise up <hi>her body also:</hi> that she might be a <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of the Grace of God, to <hi>minister</hi> to others, what he had <hi>administred</hi> unto her. And that as <hi>Paul should be a witnes, both of the sufferings of Christ for him, and of his own sufferings for the Name of Christ:</hi> So <hi>shee</hi> should be a witnes of both in like manner: and set to her <hi>seale,</hi> that <hi>God is true, in whatsoever he hath spoken, and cannot deny himselfe.</hi> And as <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was to live, and to suffer many things; He said, <hi>None of these things move me, neither count I my life deare unto my selfe, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the Ministery.</hi> (Act. 20. 24.) So she must not count <hi>her life</hi> dear to her self, no not her being with Christ, which is far better then this <hi>life</hi> being confident, that <hi>shee should finish her course with joy:</hi> and now shee must testifie and minister that Grace of God that shee had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unto others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59951:85"/>Other places of <hi>ministring to others</hi> were brought into her, besides that of <hi>Paul.</hi> Another was of <hi>Peters wives Mother,</hi> Mark. 1. 30. <hi>Anon they tell Iesus of her: and he came and took her by the hand, and lift her up: and immediately the feaver left her: and shee ministred unto them.</hi> Not to Christ onely, but to others. And so must shee. <hi>As Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe came, not to be ministred unto, but to minister.</hi> Mark. 10. 45.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> place was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 20. 25. where Christ said to the man that was sick of the Palsey; <hi>Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> There he first cured the soule; and then the body, saying, <hi>Arise, and take up thy Couch. And he arose, and went, and glorified God</hi>; declaring to others what God had done for him. And so must shee.</p>
            <p>Besides those three or foure places of <hi>ministring</hi> to others, there were <hi>six places</hi> more brought to her, of such as <hi>Iesus Christ raised up</hi> by his power: and they were set on with power on her soule. One was <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 14. Christ said to the Widows son, <hi>Young man, I say to thee, Arise: and he that was dead, sate up, and began to speak.</hi> Yet shee desired, if shee might have a place to her more particular. Then was given in that in <hi>Luk</hi> 8. end; where <hi>Christ</hi> said; <hi>Maid, arise.</hi> And after that a third place, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 49. It was said to the <hi>blind man</hi> by <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples; <hi>Be of good comfort; rise, He calleth thee.</hi> He called, that won'd make him whole eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit. (This was suitable to her whose <hi>eyes</hi> were so weak, and dim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59951:85"/>A <hi>fourth place,</hi> Act. 9. 34. <hi>Peter</hi> said to <hi>AEneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole,</hi> and he arose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fift place</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.6. In the<note n="*" place="margin">So <hi>Name</hi> is put for <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> there, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.7.10.</note> 
               <hi>Name of Iesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>arise and walk: and he arose immediately, and leaped, and praised God: So thou in the</hi>

               <hi>power, and efficacy of the power of Iesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>arise and walk; Iesus Christ maketh thee whole.</hi> Then had shee <hi>Faith</hi> given her, and <hi>Power</hi> instantly, that shee could arise: but her Mother being asleep in the bed with her, shee forbare, till her Mother did awake in the morning.</p>
            <p>Yet there came <hi>one place more,</hi> (more full, more particular, and more familiar,) <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. end, <hi>Tali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha cumi; Damsell, I say to thee, Arise; and straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way shee arose, and walked. And he commanded that somewhat should be given her to eate.</hi> Here was her <hi>Eating, Arising,</hi> &amp; <hi>Walking.</hi> And a full perswasion was given her therewith, that so it should be with her selfe. Thus shee lay, fully confirm'd therein; not sleeping that night at all, but enjoying sweet <hi>communion</hi> with God, till the morning. And <hi>Iune</hi> 11. when her Mother awoke, and was arising, shee spake to her, with teares in her eyes, being grieved that (through that foresaid pensivenes) shee had not spoken a word to her Mother, and thereby might offend her; entreating her pardon; which was sooner granted, then asked. Then shee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what sweet refreshings the Lord had given in,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59951:86"/>
that night, with power to her soule, in behalfe of her bodies restoring: and named the severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beforesaid, the <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>verse,</hi> as they were given in to her that night, so as they never had been given in to her in all her life before; desiring the <hi>Maid</hi> that tended her, to turne to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> one by one; which shee did; and read them, to the last: Shee declaring what <hi>power</hi> came with the words into her: the <hi>last place,</hi> being, <hi>Damsell, I say to thee Arise, — and he commanded that somewhat should be given to her to eate.</hi> So now shee desired, they would <hi>give her somewhat to EAT.</hi> It being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what? Shee would they should give her <hi>some broiled fish.</hi> Which was a strange expression to them, from her, that had not eat a crumme of bread, or other meat, in 76. dayes; nor so much as wet her lips for the last four or five dayes. But shee speaking with such <hi>power</hi> and evidence, they beleeved. Fish was got, and broild, and brought to her: and shee with joy in the Lord, did eat of it heartily before them. And said; <hi>Shee did eat it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Iesus Christ had sweetened it before: Therefore</hi> she said, <hi>shee found as much savour, and satisfaction, and delight in it, as if shee had all the dainties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the world in one:</hi> So was this unto her.</p>
            <p>Having eaten, and been refreshed, and blessed the Lord; (not finding the least distemper or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience at all thereby;) Then shee called for her <hi>cloaths,</hi> (who had not been able to <hi>arise,</hi> no nor to hold up her head any while in the bed,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59951:86"/>
since the sixt of <hi>Aprill</hi> to this 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> being 66. days:) Her <hi>cloaths</hi> being given her, shee put them on, and <hi>arose,</hi> and <hi>stood</hi> on her feet, and <hi>sate down</hi> in the Chamber, joyfull in the Lord, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hurt thereby. When shee cald for the <hi>Fish,</hi> (as shee said,) shee had this apprehension cast into her: <hi>Thou hast fasted long; thou shalt fast no longer; it was but to make my power known to the sons of men, what I have done, and what I can doe.</hi> (2 Cor. 12.9.)</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord gave a <hi>prolonging</hi> of her life, by <hi>Faith</hi> in the Name of <hi>Iesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth. Thus by <hi>faith</hi> shee did <hi>Eat,</hi> and <hi>Arise</hi>; and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved she should <hi>Walk</hi> also. The <hi>two</hi> former shee did that instant <hi>Iune</hi> 11. The <hi>third</hi> was reserv'd to try her and others, till the Lord should see fittest.</p>
            <p>[About the same time of <hi>Iune</hi> beforesaid, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator</hi> heard of one <hi>H.

And that both in that time, and before, <hi>the Lord had given in severall discoveries of things to come.</hi> Some particulars whereof were then related, (<hi>viz. Iun.</hi> 19.)

               <hi>Sarah Wight</hi> arose from bed, and sate up daily, from <hi>Iune</hi> 11. till the 25. being <hi>Midsommer quarter</hi> day. Yet shee remained weak. Her <hi>Mother</hi> and her selfe before <hi>Iun.</hi> 25, desired that such as had <hi>sought</hi> the Lord for her, might so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly <hi>Praise the Lord with her,</hi> for so answering prayer, for her soule and body. It was concluded to be <hi>Iun.</hi> 26. When, behold, the Lord gives in the <hi>third mercy</hi> before beleeved and hoped for, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day foregoing it; that their mouths might be the more fild with the High Praises of God,
<hi>for</hi>
this addition, <hi>viz.</hi> that by Faith shee was streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, (as before to <hi>eat,</hi> and to <hi>Arise:</hi> so) now to <hi>WALK.</hi>
And thus it was, (as her selfe related it the same day, <hi>viz. Iun.</hi> 25. 1647.) The night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, shee was very ill, till about two in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Then was it hinted into her spirit, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Lord had promised to her, that shee should <hi>Arise,</hi> and <hi>Walk</hi> and <hi>eat:</hi> And as he had performed two of them, in causing her to <hi>ARISE,</hi> and to <hi>EAT</hi>; so now he was to fulfill the Other, in causing her to <hi>WALK.</hi> Then severall <hi>Scriptures</hi> were brought in to her, with <hi>life and power:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, these; <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Peter</hi> said to the Criple, <hi>In the Name of Iesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>arise and walk: and immediately he received strength; and stood and walked, and praised God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was <hi>Iob.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Iesus said to the man at
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59951:88"/>
the Pool, Rise and walk: and immediately the man was made whole, and walked.</hi> Another was <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 17-19. <hi>When Daniel was weak, one from God touched him, and said, O man greatly beloved, feare not, Peace be unto thee; Be strong, yea be strong.</hi> He was weak in Spirit, and in body; and here it is twice said, <hi>Be strong:</hi> and now he was strengthened in body as well as in spirit; <hi>and he said, Let my Lord speak, for thou hast strengthened me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another place was, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>Rise up my love, my faire one, and come away. For the winter is past.</hi> (With this Paraphrase) The <hi>winter</hi> of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and temptations is past; and the <hi>summer</hi> of joy and consolation is come: and the Sunne of righteousnesse is risen, which makes it a <hi>summer</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>The last place hinted in, was <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>That he would grant, according to the riches of his Glory; to be strengthened with might by his Spirit, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man.</hi> This (said shee, in relating it in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,) was spoke to me; and I did beleeve it was so absolutely. And as <hi>Daniel</hi> was strengthened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; <hi>So was I strengthened immediately:</hi> and was vile, and would be more vile in mine own eyes, that the Lord alone may be exalted.</p>
            <p>Thus shee told her Mother, and another Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian friend: and said shee had received strength.</p>
            <p>Having declared this, with joy in the Lord, in the morning, <hi>Iun.</hi> 25, being <hi>Midsummer day,</hi> 1647. then shee her selfe opened her <hi>head</hi> and scombed it:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59951:88"/>
which shee durst not suffer to be done the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no nor for about twenty-four weeks before; because it was so exceeding weak and ill, through her so beating it in her former terror, that shee feared it would not hold well together, if it were opened: and of late shee had not bodily strength to do it, till that morning. And now, having dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, shee neither fainted, nor got cold thereby: but desiring her Mother, with the Maid, to <hi>call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised</hi>; shee got up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and <hi>stood</hi> on her feet, <hi>and WALKED, Praising the Lord.</hi> Shee not having walked, nor had so much bodily strength, in <hi>fourscore</hi> dayes before: namely, not since that <hi>sixt</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> beforesaid.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord the more fitted her for rendring <hi>Praise</hi> to his Name the day following: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gave in to her friends, greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the more occasion of <hi>High Praises</hi> to our God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iun.</hi> 26. the day appointed thereto being come, there met together M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Party walked</hi> down, from an upper, to a middle-roome, the place prepared for the dutie; shee being veiled; the Lord having made her the more low in her own eyes, and having the more

melted and humbled her soul, by the greatnes of his goodnes towards such an one: (which frame, the Lord continue to the end.)</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praises</hi> were then rendred to the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> which <hi>is exculted</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>On Saturday-night last, I was in a Dream, in great terror, and so quaked, that the bed did shake under me. I so wept, that my face was wet, when I awoke. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended my self violently hurried down a very steep hill; and being therewith terrified, it was darted into me presently, that it was the Hill where the swine that were possessed with</hi> Legion, <hi>ran down violently into the Sea, that was at bottome of that steep place. And as I was thus hurrying down the same, I saw as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59951:91"/>
I apprehended Horses, red and white, and black, and of some other colour, were running down before me. And being thus carried downe a great way, and through the depth of it and darkness that was, I could see no bottom of it; being overcome thereby, I cryed out to God,</hi> Lord help, I perish, I perish; I am not able I am not able to go down it. <hi>And wept. A voice presently answered me,</hi> I am able to carry thee upon Eagles wings.<note n="a" place="bottom">Ex. 19.4</note>) <hi>And instantly, one like the appearance of a man, (but the Glory of him was so great, I cannot express it; he) came, and took me in his armes; and carried me down to the bottom of the hill. And then he said to me concerning the the appearance of the</hi>

               <hi>And then he carried me in his armes up to the top of the hill: and then, and not till then, he told me the reason why he carried me, first down to the bottom of the hill, saying</hi>; I could have carried thee at first to the top, and not to the bottome: but thus I did, that thou maist prize the mercy the more, in delivering thee from the lowermost hell: and that thou maist prize Heaven the more. <hi>And he further said,</hi> I have gone before thee, and have made crooked places straight before thee, and have broken in pieces the gates of brasse, and have cut in sunder the barrs of iron: I have done it for thee. <hi>He that carried me, and spake thus to me,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59951:92"/>
was so glorious, that its beyond what I can expresse. Vpon this I awoke, my cheeks being wet with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And considering and musing about this; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately this was brought to mind:</hi> Wherein have I made thee accepted? Is it not in my beloved Son, in whom my soul delighteth? (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Glory</hi> of this was so great, she could not tell how to set it forth: and then was it brought to minde, that it is called in the Scripture, <hi>Riches of Glory,</hi> Ephes. 1. 18. <hi>Riches of his Glory,</hi> Eph. 3. 16. <hi>Glory of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1.6. <hi>Riches of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1. 7. <hi>Exceeding riches of his grace,</hi> Ephes. 2.7.

            <p>The <hi>Relation</hi> hereof was taken as is before-said, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1647. being the day of her going from <hi>London</hi> into the <hi>Countrey,</hi> (to High-gate,) to be the more retired, that here was daily tyred or wearied out, by many, especially afflicted ones in spirit, that daily resorted to her. (An honoured friend, that would not be named, affording her the courtesie of the Coach, for her better convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.)</p>
            <p>The LORD having thus far carried on his owne glorious work in an <hi>Earthen Vessel,</hi> and brought things to such a sweet period; wee may <hi>Conclude</hi> with joy in the Lord; having heard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of his so notable and marvellous a work: of one he hath <hi>brought from the jawes of hell, to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59951:92"/>
joyes of Heaven</hi>: from such Terrors (so occasioned) to such <hi>perfecting of praise, out of the mouth of a Babe</hi>: enabling such an one now, so to improve and make use of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi>; to despairing souls, and otherwaies. Raising up not onely her soul, but her body also so wonderfully, by FAITH in his Son.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Is this nothing to you, O ye that pass by,</hi> you that read, or that stand, or sit by? Is there nothing that the Lord hereby speaks to your heart? <hi>Mic. 6. 9.

And doth this <hi>Work of Gods wisdom and mercy speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thy soul?</hi> If thou wouldst desire to make the best <hi>use</hi> thereof, but seest, thou art <hi>not such a man or woman of Wisdom,</hi> as to <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> so fully as thou desirest what it may speak to thee; <hi>What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may drop to thee out of this Rock</hi>: And therefore thou desirest to be helped herein, <hi>What benefit may come to us from this consideration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Much every manner of way, if the Lord will please by his Spirit to put an edge to it, and to set it home to our hearts with a strong hand.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>I heard of a Maid in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whose <hi>Parents</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red she should grow too pure and precise: and on a <hi>Lords day</hi> evening, the <hi>Mother</hi> bid her do some work: which <hi>she</hi> judging unlawfull, (or at least doubting of,) <hi>entreated to be spared in it</hi>; but her <hi>Father</hi> threatning to beat her, <hi>she did it,</hi> and the next morning she kept her bed; and so did shee many weeks together upon it; being terrified in <hi>Conscience, for her preferring man before God:</hi> being unfit for work, it repented her Parents, and her

            <p>Also a <hi>young Gentleman,</hi> being a scholar, of whose deep despairing of ever being saved, and of his strong perswasion that he should be damned, Master <hi>Case,</hi> Master <hi>Whitakers,</hi> Master <hi>Chr.

His <hi>Father</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the Countrey, brought him up to <hi>London</hi> to procure some to speak to him, and to pray for him, having him present with them. This Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an duty was solemnly performed by those before-named, and by others, in several solemn <hi>daies of Fasting and Prayer.</hi> The beginning and chief <hi>first moving cause</hi> of those so sad perswasions was, <hi>because of the Oaths and Subscriptions imposed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in the Vniversity, which he submitted to</hi> (with the multitude that stuck not at them,) <hi>though he had his Conscience warning him; yet thus doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or against his Conscience, he yeilded to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of his Superiours. But his thus doing brought great sorrow on his own soul, and on his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends that sympathized with him.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, the <hi>Relator</hi> could more <hi>sympathize</hi> herein, then many others, in regard himselfe had been much afflicted in Spirit, for his <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity Oaths</hi> and <hi>Subscriptions: and yet had found though his sin abounded therein,</hi> (it being done with a staggering, (or worse, with a relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting) Conscience,) <hi>yet the</hi>

            <p>After all meanes used with this young <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> many severall daies, he returned home more wounded and terrified; because so <hi>many</hi> had taken so <hi>much</hi> pains with him, and he was <hi>no whit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; and therefore <hi>far the worse</hi> in his account; as he shew'd after his returne home, in many sad Letters, in black lines, to the <hi>Relator</hi>; and <hi>because he could write no other language, but the language of hell,</hi> (as he said) <hi>he therefore would cease to weary him with it.</hi> And so he ceased writing.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> and lastly, Let all such as read or heare these wonderfull dealings of the Lord herein; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how it is with their own soules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, If the Lord hath sealed thee by his Spirit to the day of Redemption: in the Spirit mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie God, and feed on him, and on his Sons love daily, in the Gospel promises and priviledges: And <hi>the more thou hast received, be the more humble</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>, <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy self</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou hast no experience of such kinde of speakings of the Spirit to thee, or of such maner or measure of Faith as here is mentioned; (both of which the <hi>Relator</hi> wanting, waits for;) 1. <hi>Do not decry, or cry down what thou knowest not.</hi> a. <hi>Envy not others.</hi> 3. <hi>Be not dejected, because more is given to others, then to thee: But blesse the Lord in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59951:96"/>
his various dispensations, that best knoweth what kinde and measure is meetest for all,</hi> (Mat. 25.15 Eph. 4.7—16.4.) <hi>Pray for more pourings out of his Spirit, upon his sons and daughters, as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to do in the last dayes,</hi> (Act. 2. 17. 33.38, 39 John. 7.38, 39.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If thou art of a sorrowfull spirit, by reason of sin; fearing, because it is so and so with thee, that there never was an effectuall work upon thy heart; finding such a power of sinne and corruption; such dulnes, coldnes, hardnes of heart, lazines fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, pride, self-ishnes, or the like basenesse: <hi>Doth not thou so much backward, in toiling to make out the former worke, and still questioning about it, and how bad thou hast been, and art since; as forward, at that abundant GRACE herein magnified and AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANCED to them that yet are a far off, without God, ungodly, enemies to him, to unfitted unprepared ones, to the CHIEFEST OF SINNERS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If thou hast desires after full enjoyment of Jesus Christ, and some hopes that he is thine; but no assurance of it; <hi>Blesse the Lord, and be thankful to him, that hath done so much for thee, that did more desire sin and vanity. But rest not in such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, but seek and presse hard for assurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> If thou hast long sought and waited for assurance that Christ is thine, and yet hast not attain'd it: 1. <hi>Beware of murmuring and quarrelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and by this Example; seeing how grieve to her son &amp; her murmuring hath been.</hi> 2. <hi>Despair not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59951:96"/>
because she obtain'd mercy, that was so deep in that sin.</hi> 3. <hi>Wait humbly and patiently on the Lord, that hides himself, that thou maist still seek, and the more prize his mercy, when at last he shal manifest it to thy soule.</hi> For therefore will the LORD wait, that hee may be gracious to you: and therefore will hee bee exalted, that hee may have mercy upon you: For the LORD is a God of judgement. <hi>BLESSED are all they that wait for him,</hi> Isa. 30.18. A power to wait, is also from him that bids you wait, and promiseth, that <hi>they that murmured, shall learn do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> (Isa. 29.24.) And to <hi>put his law in our heart,</hi> Heb. 8.10. Namely, to enable us, to what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us. <hi>THE GOD OF ALL GRACE, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the good work he hath begun in thee</hi>; (Phil. 1.6.) To him be all glory by Christ Jesus,<note n="*" place="margin">
