            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not here, neither the ordering of pollicies, &amp;c. Yea when they woulde
haue taken him vp to haue made him a King, as one that refused
that belonged not to him, hee conueyed him-selfe from amonge them.
If Imperiall iurisdiction belonged to him, why refused hee his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
If it did not, where had Paul or any other, anie authoritie to
meddle with that which hee refused? Seeing hee sayeth: As my
Father sent mee, so sende I you. In another place, Christ knowinge
the bondes of his calling, woulde not medle with externe pollicie, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Christ
expresly forbiddeth his Apostles to be rulers of Nacions. The Kinges
of the nations rule ouer their people, &amp;c. with you it shall not bee so.
In which wordes Christ doeth not traduce the power of Princes as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust,
but distinguisheth the calling of the Apostles from the manner
of regiment which God hath allowed the Magistrate. Christ saieth
not, Princes are tyrants, you shall deale more courteouslie, but he sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
Princes be Rulers by Gods ordinaunce, you shall not be so, &amp;c.</hi>
Then he proueth, that <hi>Katakyrieuein</hi> is not meant of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
but of <hi>Rule with authority,</hi> and shutteth vp his argument
in this sorte: <hi>Therefore the conclusion is ineuitable, That Princes
may lawfullie compell and punish their subiectes, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Shee doeth not reuile the Apostolike gouernement. Shee

Courts, to call men before them where their Courtes cannot

<hi>that matters of the Church goe very well.</hi> But if it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

               <p>Wherefore, seeing they that write for Reformation haue
cause or may pretend cause or colour of cause to beare hatred
to the Bishops, which can not any way be applied to hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,
it followeth that the hatred or malice (if you will haue

for the offences bring hatred and malice to the person, &amp;
men be maliced &amp; hated not for sinnes of ignorance or good
meaning, but of knowledge and wilfulnesse.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Seekers of Reformation can not haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Malicious intent</hi> in writing for the <hi>Discipline.</hi> They offer their
liues to proue the trueth, necessitie &amp; vtilitie thereof. Though
a papists cause be nought, yet his intent may be good. And
why should not we presume so much for a good christian as
for a popish traitour and impious idolater?</p>

number is often in common speach, and in penall lawes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

Yet King <hi>Edwardes</hi> Iudges pursuing the precise letter of the

               <p>This statute of 23. is a penall lawe, concerning the body &amp;

Therefore it is to be taken strictly of the Queene, against

puisne knoweth it is no treason to kill the Bb. though it

That is a most vntrewe assertion, and sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

it doeth not followe that the writers against
the Bb. were rebels, as this stat. doeth intende.
For the writers must write Aduisedlie and of

hauing no purpose and intent to worke rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
though rebellion should here of insue, yet
could not such a writer without great iniustice
