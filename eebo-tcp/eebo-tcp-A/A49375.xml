         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">From the Reflections of a Virulent Pamphlet called [A Letter from
a Gentleman of New-York, concerning the troubles which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Province, in the time of the late happy Revolution]
wherein the Libellous Author falslely scandalises those Loyal
Gentlemen, who couragiously threw off the absolute Slavery that
Province, then lay under: and Declar'd for His present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
the Protestant Religion, and the English Laws.</head>
            <p>ALthough to name but the Authors of this Pamphlet, to give
account of the time, manner, and design of its Publication,
would sufficiently confute it; and were it all Truth, take away
its Credit: Yet I shall first by plain proof of Fact and Reason,
disabuse whom it may have imposed on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then expose the Seducers
themselves whose corrupt minds gave birth to this <hi>Ignis fatuus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the Authors have triumph'd, that their Libel hath not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been answered; but they will have but little cause, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it required some time to recover the damp and stunn given to
honest minds, by the late corrupt Government of <hi>New-York</hi>
that publisht it: and some time will always be naturally taken up for
the exults of joy; that truth and honesty will now have their turn of
being protected by Authority.</p>
            <p>It was with great dread known, that the late King <hi>James</hi> was bound
in Conscience to indeavour to Damn the English Nation to Popery and
Slavery, and therefore no wonder (since he made such large steps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101159:3"/>
it in his Kingdom's) that he took a particular care of this Province,
of which he was Proprietor, &amp; at one jump leapt over all the bounds, &amp;
Laws of <hi>English</hi> Right and Government; and appointed a Governour
of this Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> who (although he was a person of large
indowments of mind yet) gave active Obedience to his Prince without
reserve; and accepted of a Commission now on record in the Secretarys
Office, giving him power with consent of any Seven of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is Council to make
Laws and to raise Taxes (as the <hi>French</hi> King doth) without consent
of the People, (for the Council are no body but whom he pleases to
name, and therefore could represent nothing but the Kings pleasure)
Hereby the will of the Prince became the Law; and the estates of the
Subjects became the Kings property. And this Governour and Council
were the too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to inslave their Country, who pursuant to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
did make Laws and Assessed Taxes accordingly, without any
Representatives of the People, as appears by the Records of the Council
book.</p>
            <p>This <hi>French</hi> Government being thus (by Commission) introduced,
it was natural that Papists should be employed in the highest Trusts; such
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Council, the Revenue, and the Military Forces; and since no
Law was left alive to make them unqualifyed, therefore this Obedient
Governour admitted major <hi>Brockholse</hi> and major <hi>Baxter</hi> into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
<hi>Matthew Plowman</hi> to be Collector of the Revenue, and said <hi>Baxter</hi>
and <hi>Russel</hi> to Command Military Forces; all professed Papists to assist in
making Arbitrary Placts, and forcing Obedience to them from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
free People.</p>
            <p>This was the condition of <hi>New-York,</hi> the Slavery and Popery that it
lay under, until the Hand of Heaven sent the glorious King <hi>WILLIAM</hi>
to break those chains, which would otherwise have fetter'd all <hi>Europe.</hi>
And these were the reasons that moved the Gentlemen concerned in
the Revolution of <hi>New York,</hi> to be early in shaking off their Tyrants,
and declaring for their Deliverer.</p>
            <p>These things premised do make way for the answer to the bold As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
of the Libeller, who had the Author Printed the Letter ten years
before, <hi>viz.</hi> the time of the Revolution, he would have come under
the penalty of spreading false News, which he in particular knows, in
<hi>Scotland</hi> is call'd <hi>Leesing,</hi> and deserves the death call'd the <hi>Maiden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Pag. 3.] In the third page which is the first of the Letter, he declares
that Jacob Leisler <hi>and his accomplices committed great disorders in the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101159:3"/>
And was ever Revolution made without them? What, must the
noxious humours of the body natural, be loosned and put a float, and
very often with pangs and gripes, before the Medicament can officiate
the discharge? &amp; must not the body politick suffer a Convulsion to pluck
up Spiritual and Temporal Tyranny that was taking root in it? But I
pray explain your self, was not the Revolution it self the greatest disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that could be given to you and the <hi>Jacobite</hi> party? and therefore
you need not admire nor wonder that all those that have a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Revolution, have so likewise of <hi>Jacob Leisler,</hi> and other
early Instruments of it in this Province: Nor is it a wonder that it
should be credited, that the persons, then in Commission in <hi>New-York</hi> were
<hi>Jacobites,</hi> and persons ill affected to the Revolution (which now the
Libeller dare not say otherwise than call happy) for their very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
from King <hi>James</hi> were expresly contrary to Law, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
unqualified to serve in any Capacity in any <hi>English</hi> Government,
and so that as <hi>Jacobites (i. e.</hi> obeyers of King <hi>James's</hi> Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and as Papists they must naturally be ill affected to the happy
Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> and implacable Enemies to the well wishers
thereof in <hi>New-York.</hi> The proof of this appears by the Printed account
of the State of the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> attested by the Records of
Sir. <hi>Edmund Andross,</hi> Coll <hi>Nicholson, Matthew Plowman,</hi> major <hi>Baxter</hi> and
<hi>Bartholomew Russel's</hi> Commissions; which are Evidence undeniable and
point blanck contrary to the Testimony of the Libeller, who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>a personal witness.</hi> But the Author was safe at the time of Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Letter, for it was when the Province lay under the calamity
(more then in any other age) of Licensing this Letter, which gives
Authority for the palliating of Vice with false glosses, and of criminating
the Actions of the most Just and Virtuous and pious persons, and when
Truth and Innocency were strip'd of all defence against the malice,
falshood and calumny of Col. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> and his complying Council.</p>
            <p>We are told the Lieutenant Governour and Council were <hi>Protestants,</hi>
and perhaps they were; and so were <hi>Friend, Perkins, Jefferys, Herbert,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> and <hi>Brian Haynes</hi> the player; therefore that is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Test that they were well affected to the Revolution, if they had
no other. <hi>But they resolved</hi> Thereupon <hi>to suspend all</hi> Roman Catholicks
<hi>from Command and places of trust in the Government.</hi> Well resolved,
though they did not perform it, as the Libeller afterwards owns. But
what means the word <hi>[Thereupon] i. e.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> was fled into <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101159:4"/>
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Arrived with considerable Forces in <hi>England,</hi>
and by consent and voice of the Nation declared their Deliverer and
King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and since King <hi>James</hi> could not stand by them, and the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Commissions he had given them, and <hi>Old England</hi> would be sure
to Command <hi>New York: Thereupon they</hi> &amp;c. No thanks to them for their
<hi>Thereupon.</hi> Besides if I am not mistaken, the execution of their Illegal
Commissions (which they held as long as they could) and their fear
of exasperations they had justly given to the People, by being Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
slaves to King <hi>James</hi> his Will, and Authorised to make all under
them to be likewise so: (as the Devils would have all men Damn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with
themselves.) For these reasons these faint resolves were made and ill
executed. But we do not find that <hi>Thereupon</hi> they declared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> or the Protestant Religion No, these Gentlemen had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
so intirely to such a blind Obedience to their Prince as (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their Profession) was never practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by any Christians,
but the Papists; and think to hide their nakedness by the fig leaf of
turning a single Papist out of the Council, just as their Master King
<hi>James</hi> did, when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was landing; the Nations hearts
alienated from him, and his standing Army likely to run over to the
Prince: <hi>Thereupon,</hi> he restored the Charters of Corporations, and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
Colledge of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and declared to call a free Parliament: Just
with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame good will as these New-York <hi>Thereupon-men. [Pag. 4.]</hi>
But it is notoriously false and known to be so by the Inhabitants of <hi>New-York,</hi>
that <hi>Thereupon</hi> these disbanded Papists forthwith left the Province:
For <hi>Baxter</hi> stayd here several Moneths, not knowing whether it was a
real Revolution or no; and <hi>Russel</hi> stay'd and dyed in <hi>New-York,</hi> but
<hi>Plowman</hi> continued fix'd in the greatest Trust of Collector of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
being intrusted by the Protestant Lieutenant Governour and
Council with the sinews of War in his management, who would be sure
as a strict <hi>Papist</hi> to employ it in the service of a <hi>Protestant</hi> Revolution,
from the same good affection with themselves.</p>
            <p>To proceed, this Libeller names three Dutch Gentlemen of their
Council, and tells you <hi>that but two of them were moct affectionate to the
Royal house of</hi> Orange, although Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> (I believe) had the same
affection with the rest: but the Libeller never tells you, that any of
them were pleased that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> had rescued from ruine
our English Laws, Liberties and Protestant Religion, and was become
a Royal English King: which was but a small reward to Him for the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101159:4"/>
Blessing it gave us: he only tells us, that as <hi>Dutchmen</hi> they loved the
Royal house of <hi>Orange:</hi> So, I presume the late King <hi>James</hi> doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tyed by blood thereto; although he wishes him far enough from
<hi>England.</hi> I suppose those <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentlemen will give the Libeller <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

have Commission, Office and Power to enslave the Subject. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the People did not think themselves safe in their hands, to be
managed by the major Vote of such a Convention.</p>
            <p>Neither was the first thing they ordered, <hi>viz. Fortifying the City of</hi>
New-York, and wise satisfactory; since it was most proper that those
persons who gave occasion for a Revolution, were most probable to
make themselves strong to oppose it. And therefore Coll. <hi>Bayard</hi>
made Coll. of the Militia by King <hi>James,</hi> was most liable to obey
and execute King <hi>James's</hi> order, and an unsure Security for the Fort;
Especially having so often declared in Words, and Letters, under his
own hand to Mr. <hi>West &amp;c. That those who were in Arms for the Prince of</hi>
Orange <hi>were Rebels.</hi> But it is absolutely false, that Coll. <hi>Bayards.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
fortifyed the Fort; for Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> opened the Well, which was
closed up; he it was ordered the Batteries, that were made about the
Town, he mended the Breast works of the Fort, as likewise the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,
and Powder Room; all which were in a miserable Condition:
and these great works took up near Twelve Moneths time, with
Vigorous application and industry of the Inhabitants, after <hi>Bayard</hi> was
out of the Power of betraying the Fort, which could never have been

for it, defence or security for their Ammunition. Besides when

               </gap>itia Forces were on guard in the Fort, the Lieutenant Governour
in Passion altered their Orders given by their Officers, and told them,
<hi>if they gave him any farther trouble he would set the City on fire.</hi> This
prooved by the Depositions of <hi>Albert Bosch</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry Coyler.</hi> [Pag. 5.]
And for their own sakes they appointed and continued the Revenue,
as being very useful for men of any design: which makes nothing for
their cause.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101159:5"/>
It matters not what Letters were sent home by the Lieutenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
for it is plain neither Governour nor Council would declare
for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> pretending they wanted Orders; No, they
wanted good wil; for without Orders this Libeller pretends they turned
out <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to go so far, and no farther. But no body but themselves know or care
whither they Wrote or no, for it signifyed nothing, except to excuse
themselves from declaring till an answer came, and they knew who
was uppermost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I suppose they had a mind to stay to see who got
the better in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before they would declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Pag. 6.]</hi> A lying building must have a lying foundation, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Libeller says, <hi>That Capt.</hi> Leisler <hi>unwilling to pay the Duty of his</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>stirred up the People to Rebellion.</hi> The case was thus, the Popish
Collector <hi>Plowman</hi> was then continued in Office, and Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> did,
even with him, make Entry in the Custom house for his Wines, and
ingaged to pay the Customs to such as should be legally qualified to
receive them; which the Papist <hi>Plowman</hi> was not.</p>
            <p>And now the People being exasperated by the delay of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Council to declare for the Prince, the greater body of the
Militia with their Officers, did Seize on the Fort, and did send and
demand the Keyes from the Lieutenant Governour; and since they had
taken the Government on them, they did Seize what Publick Moneys
they could find; and took the <hi>Seven hundred Seventy three Pounds</hi> from
Coll. <hi>Nicholson,</hi> which with great prudence they did Expend for the
safety and defence of the Revolution: nor <hi>were the People Drunk or
Mad:</hi> for no Man, Woman, or Child, was hurt by them even in the
very Convulsion of changing the Government; nay the very Papists
then in Office, and others who were justly suspected of designs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
the Country to King <hi>James's</hi> faithful Allie, the <hi>French</hi> King
had not a hair hurt, except by the fright their own guilt occasioned;
and these Revolutioners must either be very sober or loving in their
drink, or these <hi>Jacobites</hi> had never scap'd being <hi>Dewitted</hi> by a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
provoked People, who had the Power, but more grace than to
use it.</p>
            <p>False Assertions without proof are sufficiently answered by denying
them. This northern forehead answers himself: for the Libeller says,
<hi>the people cry'd out that they disowned all Government,</hi> and in the next line
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101159:5"/>
tells you, <hi>they proclaimed Capt.</hi> Leisler <hi>their Commander.</hi> But I suppose,
he gives this contradiction as a proof of the Peoples being drunk; to
be against all manner of Government, and choose a Governour in the
same breath. 'Tis likewise notoriously false, that no other Commission'd
Officer was amongst them: for most of the Officers of the Militia of
the City joyned therein: But had it been true, then Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> as the
only Commission Officer ought to Command them; and they were
just and sober in their choice, as well as prudent in their Trust of so
good and faithful a Person. But the fact of this was false, for Capt.
<hi>Leisler</hi> though instrumental in shaking off the Tyrannical Government,
did not believe he had a Title to govern longer than the Peoples
Resolutions were known; and therefore circular Letters were carryed
by Coll. <hi>Depeyster</hi> and Capt. <hi>De Brayn</hi> to the several Counties; whose
Freeholders chose their Representatives, who being met appointed
Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> Commander in Chief under their Hands and Seals, and
appointed several to be of his Council, under the name of a Committee
of Safety to preserve the Publick Peace of the Province: Who did it so
effectuall, that those divested of the Governing power had no
other harm done to their persons; and the late Lieutenant Governour
was permitted to withdraw himself whither he pleased. And here I
must remark that he fared much better than Sir. <hi>Edmund Andross</hi> at
<hi>Boston,</hi> who was made close Priosoner and sent home to <hi>England,</hi> and yet
no man was Executed or attainted there for that act of Loyal Violence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boston</hi> having proclaimed King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MART,</hi> and

the Loyalists did proclame them, but saith, <hi>it was very disorderly.</hi> I
observe what ever made for the Revolution, or against the late King
<hi>James,</hi> is very displeasing to the Scribler: For when the People took
the Government out of their Arbitrary betrayers hands, he saith, <hi>they
were drunk or mad;</hi> &amp; now the proclaiming of the King &amp; Queen, was
very <hi>disorderly,</hi> in neither of which he gives one instance: <hi>[Pag. 7.]</hi>
But thank God, they were proclaimed, &amp; their goodness will pardon small
disorders which were the effects of Loyal Zeal. Although the <hi>Jacobites</hi>
will never forgive them for it. Some of which Council and Magistrates
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101159:6"/>
went to Coll. <hi>Bayards</hi> house and drank and rejoyced that <hi>Leisler</hi> had
done what they never could have the heart to do, nor made one step
towards. And we may know what kidney these drinkers were of, by
whose Wine they drank: For Coll. <hi>Bayard</hi> having been a complying
tool all King <hi>James's</hi> Arbitrary Reign, you shall judge of the rest by
his opinion of the happy Revolution, in his letter to Mr. <hi>West</hi> of the
<hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1689, 90. Wherein he calls them <hi>Philistines,</hi> calls
<hi>Leisler</hi> and his Loyal party, <hi>the Arch Rebel and his hellish crew; wishes he
had a sufficient number to suppress the Rebels,</hi> calls them <hi>usurpers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and calls <hi>Sir. Edmund Andross, his Excellency,</hi> and calls his friends
<hi>Loyal;</hi> and the whole tenour of the Letter is to keep up King <hi>James's</hi>
title to admit his Commissions of Government to be of force, to brand
all that declared for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the black name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
by which he owned King <hi>James</hi> was still in his heart, and had
he power equal to his will, would have kept him still on the Throne,
and therefore we may judge of his and his Companies joy, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and whose Health they drank: which, eight years after, they

            <p>His Majesties Proclamation to confirm <hi>Sheriffs, Collectors,</hi> &amp;c. in their

had done none of these things and were angry at those who did) they
removed a Papist from his Office, about the middle of <hi>June,</hi> who was
permitted by them to act above two Moneths from the time that the
Lieutenant Governour and Council resolved to remove Papists from
Offices; which (as the Libeller in the first page of his Letter saith)
<hi>was the beginning of April:</hi> they kept him in as long as they could, and
now to mend the matter, they put others in his place of the same
principles as to King <hi>James,</hi> of which the famous <hi>Bayard</hi> aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
was the Ringleader. And the Libeller brags, <hi>that they were the
first in the Province that took the Oaths to Their Majesties, appointed by Act
of Parliament:</hi> It may be true; but it is as true, that they were the
last and backwardest to assist in the Revolution, or declare for the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> which they never did; but afterwards pursued to death
those that had done it. They were indeed most forward to take Oaths,
when they were to gain by them, and to have the fingring of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101159:6"/>
Revenue. For the carrying of the purse they will deny their old

            <p>These worthy Commissioners of the Revenue sate in the Custom-house,

been his protector, who was the only person capable of saving him
in that extremity, and favoured his escape, and let him live to have
afterwards a hand in the Murdering his deliverer: So that the Violence
of Armed men and naked Swords, beating the Commissioners from
the Custom-house, was very modestly done, for no man was hurt,
not so much as a skin broke of those who deserved the halter; but

mischief, which is the part of all good Governments to do, and was
most necessary in this Revolution.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Leisler</hi> with the Committee of safety (appointed by the
Representatives of the Freeholders of the several Counties of the
Province) having published their Declaration for the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> the Protestant Religion, and the <hi>English</hi> Laws and Liberties,
they thought it prudent to discriminate the Well affected from the
Enemy, and therefore Summoned all the Inhabitants of the City to
the Fort, to sign their names to such a Declaration as owned the
Authority of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> And the refusers must justly
by him and all mankind be deemed Enemies to the Revolution, to
His Majesty, and their Country. And is this a crime to know the
Sheep from the Goats, or to take all Reasonable methods for the
safety of the then Government: but the Libeller is angry at every pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
step was taken, nor is he satisfyed, although it is above Seven
years since he was gorg'd with their innocent blood which he had
a hand in shedding.</p>
            <p>It is notoriously false that Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> opposed the Collecting of
the Revenue; indeed he was not willing a Papist should run away
with our Protestant Kings Money, nor did he think it safe in
<hi>Bayards &amp;c</hi> hands. But the Committee of safety (and not Capt.
<hi>Leisler)</hi> appointed Mr. <hi>De Lanoy</hi> (in whom they durst confide) to
that trust, who received no Customs until <hi>December</hi> following, when
His Majesties orders arrived; till then he took only notes from the
Merchants to pay the Customs when demanded. And 'tis well known
that Mr. <hi>De Lanoy</hi> gave a fair and true Accompt of his Receipts and
payments of the Customs to Governour <hi>Slaughter:</hi> whereby it appears
he had expended five hundred Pounds of his own Money above the
Money of the Revenue, for the Kings Service and the support of the
Revolution; which Money is not repaid him to this day through the
iniquity of some <hi>Jacobites</hi> afore-mentioned, who crept into power,

Commands given to the contrary, and the Souldiers were compelled
to restore what could be made appear they had forcibly taken
from any man. Even so small a matter as a Hat taken out of the
house of Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> was restored to him.</p>
            <p>Coll. <hi>Cortland</hi> and others might leave their houses and families, but
they would have had no occasion for so doing had they peaceably and
quietly minded their own affairs and submitted to the Government;
for all such had no manner of disturbance given them, but were
protected.</p>

               <hi>[Pag. 11.]</hi> The Protestant Ministers the Libeller saith, <hi>could not

of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non Resistance,</hi> and to noise in our Ears with
their accursed breath, <hi>that we ought patiently to hold our Protestant Throats
to be cut by the Command of a Popish King:</hi> and when Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> with
his friends had taken hold of that wonderful Deliverance offered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God to Redeem His People from Slavery upon Earth,
and Popish Damnation in Hell; to have false Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> get up,
and use their wicked Eloquence, to make the People believe a lye,
even in the house of the God of Truth; and from the Pulpit, to
tell these Captains of our Temporal Salvation to their faces, that
being faithful to their God, their Country, and their Laws, in the
defence of the Holy Protestant Religion, and the Rights and Liberties
of <hi>English</hi> men, and their thankful declaring for the most glorious
Prince upon Earth their Deliverer: was the blackest of Treason and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101159:8"/>
Rebellion. Such Apostasy and base Treachery hath deserved, and often
met with severer rebukes than the friendly Verbal admonition given
by Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> to the blind Seer, and had nothing of the Malice and
Cruelty in it of the Libeller, who wrote so false a Pamphlet: and
so the other time-serving Priests (who were Protestant shooing horns
to draw on Popery) might have been more quiet, and left the result
of the Revolution to Divine Providence, and not pass such hard
Censures as to attaint blood and accuse of Rebellion, all that would
accept of Gods deliverance from the two greatest plagues of mankind,
Popery and Slavery. But I hope they have repented and will be sav'd,
otherwise whilst <hi>they Preach to others they themselves will be cast away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> sent to the Merchants of the Town to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Garrison with Provisions and other necessaries, and sent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction to all People who had Stores; otherwise the Garrison
might have perished: but he honestly gave them Credit in the Kings
Books, and they have since (for the greatest part) been satisfyed;
and Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> (as he ought) did order forceibly to break their
Ware-houses open, where they were refractory, and refused on so
great Emergency to afford support for the Government; but exact
Accompts were kept of all such goods, and Entries made in Books kept
for that purpose; so that it was not plunder, (as the Libeller falsely
calls it) but they were to be satisfyed, and paid for the same. And I
believe it was never known in the Memory of man, that ever a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
or change of Government, was more regular: or where Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
power would not force Victuals where it was denyed them, when
they wanted it: and therefore it was for the special Service of King
<hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> to keep alive those that were the
only persons in that Province, who declared early for Them, and
owned Their Authority. Nor can any proof upon Earth be brought
(except such as the Libeller) that one Farthings Value of goods was
ever converted to the private use of Capt. <hi>Leisler,</hi> or Transported by
him to the <hi>West Indies,</hi> but the imposture of the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>[Pag. 12.]</hi> The Accompt of <hi>Thirteen Thousand nine hundred fifty
nine</hi> Pounds of damages done the Province is made up by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101159:9"/>
but I believe the Libeller rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons that he and his <hi>

had so much damage by the Revolution, which they might Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily

               </gap> it had not

At this rate pray what damages had the Popish Clergy of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by King <hi>WILLIAMS</hi> hindering their being resto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to
<hi>Abbys, Monasterys</hi> and <hi>Peter Pence;</hi> but it is better that the <hi>Jacobites</hi>
should suffer damage of their Estates and Lives too, than an
<hi>English</hi> Protestant People should have the damage of loosing their
Laws and Religion, their Properties and their Souls. And as for
Coll. <hi>Willets</hi> losses, which the Libeller magnifies, he could not put
a particular Value on them, they were so small. Had they been
considerable, he would since have made a particular complaint, to
have reparation, which he never did, nor had occasion for; but
had he been ruined he would not have been pittyed by good men,
because he so far forgot that he was an <hi>English</hi> man and Protestant:
that he Execused an Illegal Commission, and raised Forces to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all those that declared for our Deliverer, that we might
return to our Vomit, which was a Dog trick in him.</p>
            <p>And thus the Libeller expatiates on Capt. <hi>Leislers</hi> Arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
over his Majesties Subjects Persons and Estates, against
the fundamental Laws of the Land; but he should have considered
that all the fundamental Laws of the Land were wholly subverted
and trampled upon by the Hellish, Popish, Arbitrary Government,
Established by King <hi>James's</hi> Commission; so that Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi>
found no fundamental Laws to transgress; and was forced in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his trust from the People, and by and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of those appointed by their Representatives, to use these violent
methods which Heaven gave him the power to make use of to
restore those fundamental Laws, which were abolished by tools of
the same temper with the Libeller.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Major</hi> Ingoldesby <hi>a Captain of a foot Company, arrives near two
years after, saith the Libeller,</hi> And with several Gentlemen of the Council,
sends to Capt. <hi>Leisler,</hi> that for the preservation of the Peace, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to Command in the Fort, until Coll. <hi>Slaughter's</hi> Arrival, and only
desired that major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> and the Kings Souldiers might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to quarter, and refresh themselves in the City: but instead of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101159:9"/>
complying, he in passion told Mr. <hi>Brooke,</hi> on his acquainting him, that Mr.
<hi>Phillips,</hi> Coll. <hi>Bayard,</hi> Coll. <hi>Cortland</hi> were of the Council, that they were
Papist Dogs, and if the King should send Three Thousand of them, he
would cut them off; and without cause Proclaimed open War; on which
said major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> perswaded several of the Inhabitants to joyn
with him meerly for self preservation. On which several great and small
Shot from the Fort killed and wounded several of His Majesties good
Subjects, who made no opposition.</p>
            <p>This whole Paragraph I shall shew to be the greatest complication
of Iniquity, and fit to be the production of a Monster begat by
an <hi>Incubus</hi> on a <hi>Scotch Witch,</hi> who had kindled his malice against
Truth from the flames he put to the holy Bible, thereby to
become the Adopted Son of the father of Lyes.</p>
            <p>For major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> having no Commission, nor Authority to
Command, on his Arrival, took on him the Title of Commander
in Chief, usurp'd a shew of Government, calling a Council, and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
peremptory orders, as appears by the Records of the Council
Book; nay quite contrary to the Romantick Account of the Libeller,
he sent a demand under his own hand, which I have seen, wherein
he acknowledges Capt. <hi>Leislers</hi> offer to him of his own Houses in
the City for the Accommodation of himself and Officers, and to
appoint fit Quarters for the Souldiers; which major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> under
his hand denyes to accept of, saying, <hi>he demanded the Fort from him,</hi>
which unless Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> would deliver up to him, he would esteem
him as an Enemy to King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY.</hi> I have
likewise seen Capt. <hi>Leislers</hi> Letter to major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> full of Civility,
and true Reason, wherein he acquaints him, that he held the Fort
and Commanded by Virtue of a trust reposed in him by the People,
and confirmed by His Majesty, and assuring him, that if he had
any Commission from His Majesty, or any Instruction, or Order
from Coll. <hi>Slaughter</hi> appointed Governour of the Province, on his
producing it, The Fort should be immediately delivered to him,
but desired to be excused from resigning his trust, till he found one
qualifyed and authorized to receive it from him. But this was not
satisfaction to major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> who was prevailed with to take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
on him in opposition to Capt. <hi>Leisler,</hi> and as Governour
in Chief (although never Impowred by King or People) he issues
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101159:10"/>
orders to the several Counties to be ready to attend and assist in
opposing <hi>Leisler,</hi> and his party with Arms; which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
open War; and pursuant thereto, he sends his Rounds in
the night, and ordered or permitted his Rounds at all hours to pass
the guards and centrys on the Walls of the Fort, and not to make
answer, but by reproachful Language, when challenged by them, in
order to provoke the drawing of blood, and ingaging the People in
a Civil War: and farther, major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> ordered all the men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Command to wear Marks on their Arms, to distinguish them
from those who joyned with Capt. <hi>Leisler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Revolution and Civil War, I am told not above two
persons were killed, which happiness attended the moderate temper
of Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> and the Committee of safety, who could not be
raised to punish the Insolence of the Tory party, suitable to what they
gave just occasion for.</p>
            <p>Soon after, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> about a Month or five Weeks after
major <hi>Ingoldesby's</hi> usurpation, Coll. <hi>Slaughter</hi> Arrived, who Summoned
the Fort late at night, and, contrary to the Libellers assertion, it was

               </gap> (according to Military Rules) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

and although a Reprieve was granted them by Coll. <hi>Slaughter,</hi> until
His Majesties pleasure should be known in the matter: yet the Violence

of the <hi>Jacobite</hi> party (of which sort were most of Capt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Judges and Officers of the Court) was such that they gave no rest
to Coll. <hi>Slaughter,</hi> until by their Importunity they prevailed with
him to sign the Dead Warrant. And they were Executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
So that the representation of the matter, with an account
of their Reprieve reached His Majesty at the same time with the
account of their Execution and Death. So fell Capt. <hi>Leisler,</hi> and

by a pretended course of Law, contrary to all Law condemned,
where their Judges were most of them violent Enemies of the
happy Revolution, and therefore resolved to revenge themselves on
these Gentlemen who were the most Early and Zealous Instruments
of it; and who had first expended great part of their Estates,
and then suffered Martyrdom for King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen
<hi>MARY,</hi> their Religion and Laws. The proofs and papers referred
to in this account remain in the hands of Mr. <hi>Jacob Leisler</hi> only

And in these Persons the Government was lodged, who proceeded
to support themselves by the most moderate methods could be devised.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governour hereupon withdraws out of the Province,
major <hi>Ingoldesby</hi> Arrives with Authority over none but his Foot
Company; and yet demands the Fort, which Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> durst

he Issues Orders and Warrants to the People to rise in Arms to

Arrives, demands the Fort, which was surrendred to him immediately;
the Persons of Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> are Seizd, and soon

(which could not by Law try them for Mal Administration in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
violently over ruled, and they Condemned as Mutes, for
High Treason and Murder; they were Reprieved until His Majesties
pleasure should be known; and notwithstanding the Reprieve, the
Warrant of Execution Signed, and they Executed.</p>
            <p>But the Enemies to King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> and consequently to these
Gentlemen, had not sufficiently gratified their malice, by these

for themselves, and a confirmation that the said unjust Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was according to Law; and when His Majesty was in <hi>Flanders</hi>
and several Ministers of State were in place and trust in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Trade, which His Majesty hath since thought fit to remove
from His Council and their Offices: a report was obtained from
the Committee of Trade affirming that these Loyalists were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and Executed according to Law. But however the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
represented their Sons as fit objects of Her Majesties mercy,
to be restored to their Fathers Estates; which Her Majesty was

far prevailed with the Assembly of <hi>New York</hi> to compliment and

although he was exalted to that Government from a poor mean

and to satisfy his Soul, his Idol Gain, he made a fast friendship with
the few <hi>Papists, Jacobites,</hi> and dissolute <hi>English</hi> of <hi>New-York,</hi> who
had opposed the Revolution and revenged themselves on Capt. <hi>Leisler;</hi>

great advantage to reward Coll. <hi>Fletcher's</hi> friendship by Presents from
themselves, and gifts from Pirates; and complyed with him, and
consented to all things proposed to them by him; to the squandring
of the Kings Revenue and (to the great dishonour of the King)
destroying all conveniences of a Succeeding Governour; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of all the Lands in the Province, that not one Inch is lest

giving to one man Seventy Miles in length; and to several
Fifty, Forty and Thirty Miles in length, and several Miles in
breadth; with many other unjust gross Mal Administrations.</p>
            <p>On this bottom Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> joyned in the mortal hatred to the
lovers of the Loyal <hi>Leisler;</hi> and when several condemned to dye
for their motions in that Revolution were order'd by Her gracious
Majesty of Sacred Memory to be discharged, Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> did it
as an act of grace of his <hi>own,</hi> and told them that although he
released them, yet he could call for them when he pleased, and
hang them. And some time after told them, That they dealt worse

Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> likewise paid that disregard to the Act of Parliament of

the flame it was designed to raise, and was carryed to the Press
by Mr. <hi>Brook</hi> (who although a Refugee from <hi>Ireland</hi> and preferred
by King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> to be Collector and Receiver General of the
Customes and Revenue of <hi>New York,</hi> and a new-comer thither, took
upon him to be one of the bloody Judges of this Royalist; but

of the Customs of <hi>England,</hi> but could not bear his treachery to that
Trust which he himself had been Instrumental to advance him to.
And Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> late Sheriff of <hi>New-York</hi> a hot headed despicable
fellow, who to serve the Tory party, contrary to his Oath, made
a most false Return of Assembly men to serve for the Counties of
<hi>New-York,</hi> and <hi>Orange</hi> in the last Assembly. For which palpable
breach of his Oath and Trust, His Excellency the Earl of <hi>Bellomont</hi>
with consent of the Council suspended him from being Sheriff of
<hi>New-York.</hi> But when this Libel was so midwived to the Press by
the Kings Collector (who was likewise one of the Council, and this
foresworn Sheriff. Then Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> calls the Council where 'tis

consented to this great piece of Service to His Majesty? Why
Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who is supposed to have given orders for its being
Written. Coll. <hi>Bayard</hi> of whom enough is said plainly and truly.
Mr. <hi>Brook</hi> who carryed it to the Press and was one of <hi>Leislers</hi>
Judges; Mr. <hi>Pinhorn,</hi> another of <hi>Leislers</hi> Judges (who is since removed

words of His most Sacred Majesty King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
and concealing in his house a Popish Priest) and some other
Enemies of the Revolution. So that (to omit the false sordid
flatteries given to Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> which are impertinently added by
the Libeller) it is apparent that there was a wicked conspiracy, by
this book to give distraction (by Printing it just before the Earl
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101159:14"/>

and so to disturb Affairs under his Government, that there
should be no time or opportunity of quickly inquiring into the
Corruptions of Coll. <hi>Fletchers</hi> managements.</p>
            <p>This was the time and design of its Publication, these the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the supposed Authors, and of the Persons who carryed it
to the Press, and after this manner (by Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> and the
afore mentioned of the Council) it was permitted to be Printed;
so that it is no wonder, that this book was a Mine Sprung from
Hell to blow up the Peace of this Province, when so many Sons
of Belial in Office and Authority joyned in its Contrivance and
Publication, who must keep to their nature and not stick at any
plain falsehood (although it fly in the face of the King, Lords
and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and Truth it self) that may Exasperate
and raise a flame, and if possible Murder over again those Martyrs
for their Loyalty, Capt. <hi>Leisler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Millourn,</hi> who were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously
Executed for bravely Asserting the Rights and Liberties of
<hi>English men</hi> against Popish and Arbitrary Government; and for their
