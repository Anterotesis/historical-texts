            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the days of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> when the
<hi>Loyal Pulpits</hi> sounded with Harrangues of
Obedience and Submission, and the poor Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was forced to creep by Owl-light into some
private House to Worship his God in Secret, when
loud Hems Echoed through the <hi>Churches,</hi> by way
of Approbation, to a <hi>Clinching Period</hi> against
the <hi>Cromwellians</hi> and new <hi>Anti-royallists,</hi> and
the <hi>Meeters</hi> drag'd through the Streets by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables
<hi>and</hi> Watchmen, when that bouncing <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
took place of all the other Vertues, and none
were to be Saved out of the Pale of the <hi>Church
of England:</hi> Who would have thought to have
seen such a change of Affairs? <hi>But above all,</hi>
to have seen a <hi>Conventicle</hi> (that word of odious
sound) composed of a few Discontented Persons,
who yet call themselves the <hi>Church of England
<pb facs="tcp:50958:3"/>
Protestants;</hi> surely <hi>Copernicus</hi> was not much
in the wrong, when he said the World went
round, and the Sun stood still; but <hi>Conscience,</hi>
they say, is a Sacred thing, and ought not to be
Violated; but at the same time, is it not a great
Riddle, that Man's Conscience should boggle at
a <hi>Lawful Oath,</hi> and yet be quiet enough under
an Vnlawful Debauch, pretend Loyalty to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and yet run counter to all its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>Fast</hi> and <hi>Revel</hi> on the days Appointed for
<hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> say they are of an Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Church, and yet meet in an Vnlawful <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle;</hi>
aver they Love their Countrey, and yet
wish well to the <hi>French Dragoons?</hi> If these are
not so many <hi>contradictions,</hi> let the World judg,
for they whose minds can swallow such Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties,
are fit to believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and
undoubtedly will prove as <hi>Errand Biggots</hi> to the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> should another <hi>Revolution
happen,</hi> as they are now (<hi>to what they falsly
call themselves the true Members of</hi>) <hi>The
Church of England.</hi>

Jacobite Conventicle.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>TEdious have been our hopes, and long
our Prayers,</l>
               <l>Within the compass of the <hi>three past
Years,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How oft in private have we met to Mourn,</l>
               <l>And whine and snivel for <hi>Our Lord</hi>'s Return?</l>
               <l>Our Wishes too, how strangely were they crost,</l>
               <l>When the <hi>French Fleet</hi> drew near the <hi>English Coast,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When we expected our <hi>Deliverance</hi> near,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Choaking Oaths</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> so <hi>Severe;</hi>
               </l>

A glimps of <hi>Heaven</hi> we having then in view,</l>
               <l>But ah! how soon that gawdy Scene withdrew,</l>
               <l>Leaving a dismal Prospect in its room,</l>
               <l>Of thousand Miseries are yet to come;</l>
               <l>Must still our thoughts endure the wracking pain,</l>
               <l>Always to hope, and wish, but yet in vain?</l>
               <l>Nay, Heaven it self, to add to our Dispairs,</l>
               <l>Seems to neglect and put by all our <hi>Prayers:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Is there no hopes that wretched, cheated we,</l>
               <l>Shall Once more taste of Luscious Liberty;</l>
               <l>Once more be thought the Favourites of the
Nation,</l>
               <l>And trample o're the Men of <hi>Abdication?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Those <hi>Rogues,</hi> who to increase their guilty score,</l>
               <l>Found out a word was never heard before.</l>
               <l>Yet there a time may come, (but when it will,</l>
               <l>Exceeds the reach of Learned <hi>Gadb'ry</hi>'s Skill)</l>
               <l>When <hi>Loyalty</hi> shall meet in due regard,</l>
               <l>And those that dare be honest, find reward.</l>
               <l>The time may come—when Right will have its
place,</l>
               <l>And lie no longer under Black Disgrace.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50958:4"/>
To Skill in Stars, tho I make no presence,</l>
               <l>Methinks I view it in the <hi>Present Sense;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Methinks I see th'Approaching smiling Years,</l>
               <l>Roul on a-pace to recompence our Tears.</l>
               <l>Fly fast, ye Weeks, ye Months, post quickly on,</l>
               <l>And settle <hi>J</hi>—once more upon his Throne.</l>
               <l>But hold—to what strange Notions am I brought</l>
               <l>By the too strong Impulses of my thought?</l>
               <l>To <hi>Church</hi> I'll go—that word, Good Heaven,
forgive,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Church</hi> shall be my <hi>Odium</hi> while I live:</l>
               <l>I hate the <hi>Priest,</hi> who has a Double Face,</l>
               <l>Religion's Scandal, and his Gown's Disgrace.</l>
               <l>Give me the Man with Conscience void of blame,</l>

               <l>Who hates Rebellion, nor can <hi>Treason</hi> bless,</l>
