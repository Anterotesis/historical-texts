            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have a Bill of extraordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance now before you, and there are many points of Law in it, which I will not preſume to ſpeak to. I ſhall leave them to the Learned Gentlemen of that Profeſſion, who have ſpent their time in that noble ſtudy. But becauſe all Laws either are, or ought to be grounded upon reaſon, and all Lawes are to give place to that ſupream Law of publique ſafety, I will make bold to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this Bill, though not to the Law, yet to the reaſonableneſs and neceſſity of it.</p>
            <p>I believe there is no man but is ſenſible of the mighty miſchiefs that the late diſpute of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia brought upon this Nation. For what was the fruit of that Diſpute, and what liberty did the Contenders purchaſe, but a liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves and ruine their Countrey? a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> worſe than the worſt ſort of ſervitude. If the Queſtion of the Militia had been rightly ſtated, if it had been declared to be wholly in the King, as without doubt in reaſon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47819:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 59 -->
and nature it was, and been ſettled in him with that latitude and thoſe powers as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for protecting himſelf and his people, for ought I know, the late war had been prevented and all the calamitous conſequences of it. I have ever been of opinion that they who are born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a juſt, legitimate, and hereditary Monarchy have the ſame obligations, and owe the ſame ſervice to their Prince, which the Antients who lived in Common-wealths did to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. It was an ordinary thing with them to preferr the publick good before their own, and to devote themſelves to death, that the place which gave them being might be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. That zeal which inflamed them with a love to their Countrey ought in my judgement to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in us for the ſervice of our Prince. For in a Monarchy, the Prince repreſents the Country; the Majeſty of the Countrey is in him, his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is the welfare of the Countrey, and of every particular perſon in it: It was a celebrated ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Artabanus</hi> Captain of the guard to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> when <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> fled out of <hi>Greece</hi> to the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Stranger, ſayes he, the Cuſtomes and manners of men are different, and that is laudable in one Nation which is not ſo in another. You Greeks affect liberty and equality, and to be one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47819:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 59 -->
as good as another. But we who are <hi>Perſians</hi> think nothing ſo great and ſo honourable as to ſerve and obey our King, who is the image of the living God. If to ſerve our King be to ſerve our Countrey, if the intereſt of the King be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the publique, if all our lives, ſafeties, and fortunes are bound up in his, certainly we can not make him too great, or be too concern'd for his preſervation.</p>
            <p>That which firſt brought men into Societies was the fear they had of one another, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſafety. This made them content to paſs away that right which by nature they had to all things, that they might be aſſured of ſomething: this made them transferr and give up the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themſelves to others. And hence it was that Government aroſe, from hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> it was, I mean from the diſpoſing of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>inion, that all Governments were denominated; for where the Dominion is placed in many, there it is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State, where it is in ſome of the better ſort, there it is Ariſtocracy; where it is in one alone, there it is Monarchy. Now all theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments may be convenient in their proper places. But certainly the moſt abſolute, the moſt noble, and to uſe the words of <hi>Plato,</hi> the moſt divine form of government is that of Monarchy.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47819:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 60 -->
Under this form of Government, Sir, it is our honour to be born; to this form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have the happineſs to be reſtored from one of the vileſt and miſerableſt Anarchies that ever any Nation was under. Nor is that all our happineſs; we are not onely reſtored from the worſt fort of Government to the beſt, but by the great mercy of God delivered from the worſt men that ever ruled in the worſt kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into the hands of one of the beſt of Princes. Now Sir, the Queſtion before you is, What power you will allow this Prince for his and your own preſervation.</p>
            <p>The power of the Militia is a thing ſo inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the King, and ſo inſeparable from his perſon, that without it he cannot perform the ends for which he is a King. He can neither protect us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>m the attempts of Enemies, nor from the violences of one another. So that of neceſſity the Militia muſt be in him, and in him alone: for to divide it betwixt him and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a contradiction in the very nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: ſince where there are two co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate powers in one State, where there are two pretending an equal power to the ſame thing, and no Superiour to appeal to, the queſtion can not be decided but by force, this force will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47819:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 60 -->
a war, which muſt end in the diſſolution of the Government.</p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is not ſo much where the right of the Militia is (for I find none expreſly deny it to be in his Majeſty) as how far the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of it ſhall extend, and what reſtraints and limitations ſhall be laid upon it. The King, it is confeſs'd hath power to Levy and Array men, but if he have not power to arm and appoint them as he pleaſe when he hath levied and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed them, to what purpoſe will they be levied and arrayed? or if he have power to levie, array, and arm them, and can not lead them out of one County into another, as occaſion ſhall require, and danger call them, to what purpoſe will they be armed? or if he have power to lead them where he pleaſe, and can not raiſe money to maintain them, to what end will he lead them any where? without pay there will be no Diſcipline, and Forces without Diſcipline will be worth nothing. It is as good have no Militia as an ineffectual one, as a Militia which will onely trouble the people and not ſecure them.</p>
            <p>It is a vulgar error Sir, that the power of the King is incompetible with the liberty of the people. The reſtraining of the King does not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47819:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 61 -->
make the people great, but makes the King and the people both little. It diſtracts and diſunites the Soveraign Power, whereas it is in the union of Power that all Empire conſiſts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is my opinion that this Bill as it is penn'd ſhould paſs. If I have ſaid any thing, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> contrary to the ſenſe of this Houſe, as ſoon as you declare your opinion I ſhall retract mine. In the mean time I ſubmit my opinion and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it to your more venerable judgement.</p>
