            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR HENRY MOVNTAGV, Knight, Baron of KIMBOLTON, Viſcount MAVNDEVILLE, Lord Preſident of his MAIESTIES <hi>moſt Honorable Priuie</hi> Counſaile.</head>

                  <hi>Right noble, and truly Christian</hi> LORD;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince I haue preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to appeare thus in publique, and to treate peculiarly of this ſubiect <hi>[Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Babylon]</hi> rather then of any other, and, finally, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe vnto your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable patronage; I ſtand therefore obliged to expreſſe my Motiues,
<pb facs="tcp:18730:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Reaſons, in the two former points, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſatisfaction of others; and, in the laſt, for the particular of your Honorable Selfe.</p>
            <p>As for the FIRST; I am not mooued, vpon any oblique reſpect, to take vp the Sword of my Pen, in this ſpirituall warfare: I am not vexed with the ambition of preferment, nor affectation of applauſe; for I deſire earneſtly of God, that the diuine ſentence of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may bee deeply grauen in my heart; <hi>The World is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither am I prouoked vnto this deſigne out of any ſpleene, or vindictiue humour againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any perſon therein: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I haue beene ſo farre from giuing them any ſpeciall diſtaſte, that I haue obſerued the tearmes of ciuill, and morall reſpect towards ſome of them, to my greater preiudice, then I will either bragge, or complaine of, vnto the World.</p>
            <p>But the true, and proper cauſes are theſe. <hi>First;</hi> I am bound, as a dutifull Sonne of my Mother-Church (from whoſe ſacred breaſts I drew the firſt nutriment of my faith) to ſuccour, and comfort her, in her diſtreſſed eſtate, while the <hi>little Foxes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> eate vp her Grapes, and the <hi>wild Boare</hi> thereof ſeeketh to enter into the Vineyard of God. And therefore, ſince euery man (indued with any facultie of writing) ſhould performe his ſeruice vnto the Church of God, eſpecially, when, and where, the contagion of Hereſie doth dilate it ſelfe (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth grauely aduiſe) I could not bee ſilent in ſo neceſſarie a time: for as
<pb facs="tcp:18730:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wee ſhall anſwere vnto God for our idle words, ſo wee ſhall anſwere vnto him for our dangerous ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> to make ſome ſatisfaction, thereby, vnto the Church of God; which, being vniuſtly wronged by my meanes, doth iuſtly challenge this remedie of my paines; that the hand, which hath hurt her, may ſomewhat helpe her; and that, as I haue made a wound, ſo I may make a cure againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> to procure the ſweete peace of my conſcience towards God, that I may heale the wound, which I haue formerly made vnto my owne ſoule; Chriſtian Wiſdome teaching me to powre ſome Oile into that, to ſupple it, which hath found ſo much Vineger to fret it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am reſolued to neglect all troubles without, that I may find this comfort within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to exempt, hereby, all ſcruple out of their hearts, who deſire to vnderſtand the ſtate, and diſpoſition of my conſcience in the matter of Religion. For as Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> being vehemently ſuſpected of the infection of <hi>Origens</hi> errours, did therefore diuert that ſuſpition, by cleere publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind in writing, <hi>That they, who would not beleeue his tongue, in his deniall, might yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his Pen, in his refutation thereof</hi> (as hee doth ingeniouſly write in this behalfe) ſo I find my ſelfe very deeply charged, in the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcretion, to giue ſufficient notice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the ſonnes of my Mother (touching my Faith, and Religion) by ſome Treatiſe, now to bee
<pb facs="tcp:18730:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
publiſhed vnto the World, and to remayne) I hope) after my deceaſe, as a Record, what I doe certainly beleeue, concerning the doctrine of faith profeſſed in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> and oppugned by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, therefore, I haue made ſpeciall election of this ſubiect (concerning <hi>Rome,</hi> and her <hi>ruine</hi>) as being of greateſt importance in it ſelf, and ſpecially in theſe dayes. For whereas the moſt vſuall ſubiects of diſputation, betwixt vs, and the Papiſts, are particular, and therefore haue a particular iſſue of veritie, or falſhood therein; this is of an higher nature, of a larger extent, and of a more generall effect; for that it doth concerne not onely a part of her doctrine, but the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it toucheth not a branch, or two, but the very root it ſelfe; it reacheth not onely vnto a piece of her building, but vnto the very foundation thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this diſputation (<hi>viz.</hi> Whether, and How the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the viſions of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> doth agree vnto <hi>Rome</hi>) is of ſingular conſequence; thereby to confront the audacious inſultations of her politike Agents; to giue an Antidote againſt the poyſon, which they ſeeke to inſtill into many vnſetled hearts: that ſo, they, who are fallen from the truth, may bee happily reduced vnto it; and they, who are falling, may be ſtrongly confirmed in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now THIRDLY, and laſtly, it remaineth (moſt worthy Lord) that I make true remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the cauſes, which haue bred this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb facs="tcp:18730:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in mee to offer vp this little Treatiſe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar of your Honourable fauour. I ſpeake not of your deſcent, and extraction out of a Noble Family, nor of your high degree of Honour, nor of your ſpeciall aduancement in the State (for which reſpects, many men apply themſelues vnto the ſeruice, and attendance of great perſons) but, aboue all things, I am comforted in your ſincere, and conſtant profeſſion of the Truth; which grace ſeemeth to be hereditarie in your Houſe, as being ſpectable in all the branches thereof.</p>
            <p>Since therefore <hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> haue mutuall coniunction in your Lordſhips perſon, I cannot ſuppoſe, that a Worke of this nature can want your acceptation, nor the Author thereof your protection. Whereof alſo I conceiue the greater hope, becauſe I haue knowne heretofore (by the double teſtimonie of mine eyes, and eares) the gracious inclination of your Honour towards mee; and that onely for the Truths ſake, and the Words ſake: as, indeed, I haue euer found them to be my moſt aſſured, and certaine friends, that haue affected mee in this regard.</p>
            <p>But if I ſhould need, or ſeeke any externall, or farther motiue, to induce your Honour to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe your patronage vnto mee, and vnto this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I would not goe out of your owne Family (though it muſt bee <hi>from the liuing to the dead</hi>) but I would intreate it by the deare, and precious memory of that religious, learned, &amp; moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Prelate, your famous Brother, IAMES (lately Lord Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi>) whoſe kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement
<pb facs="tcp:18730:5"/>
of mee in priuate, and fauourable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of mee in publike, were more ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of his loue, then of my deſert. For I may truely ſay, by the certaine experience of ſundrie occurrents in my life, that I haue taſted a little of Gods deſerued wrath, but a great deale more of his vndeſerued grace: whereof I account this no ſmall part, that hee hath giuen mee ſo much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the good opinion, and affection of ſundrie perſons of eminent qualitie, and particularly of your Honorable Selfe; whom I beſeech the Lord of all mercies to bleſſe in your owne Perſon, and in your noble Poſteritie, with the temporall bleſſings of this life, and the eternall of the life to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord; in whom I am, and will euer remaine</p>

            <p>Firſt; though ſundry Expoſitions are extant vpon this part of Scripture (as likewiſe vpon the whole Booke of the ſacred <hi>Reuelation</hi>) and certain Sermons haue beene preached vpon it, and then commended vnto the Preſſe, yet I confeſſe, that (opening my heart vnto God by prayer, to illuſtrate my vnderſtanding with a true, and ſufficient knowledge thereof) I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed chiefly ſuch generall notions touching the ſame, as were layd vp formerly in my mind; and willingly ſequeſtred from mee the helpe of other mens labours in this kind (excepting ſuch as I ſhall preſently name) <hi>leaſt I ſhould build vpon another mans

            <p>Secondly; whatſoeuer I may ſeeme to owe vnto any Author of our ſide, I confeſſe it to bee due, principally, vnto the learned, and indicious Pen of our gracious Souereigne Lord, King <hi>IAMES,</hi> in his <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> vpon this Booke, as thou wilt eaſily obſerue (gentle Reader) in certaine paſſages of my Diſcourſe.

            <p>Thirdly; if any acerbitie of ſtile appeare in this Diſcourſe, know that it is drawne from me, rather by the neceſsitie of the matter it ſelfe (which could not be well expreſſed otherwiſe) then that it came out of the diſpoſition of my mind; which, hating the errours of <hi>Babylon,</hi> doth yet pittie, and loue the perſons of all (and ſpecially of ſome) that are inſnared with the ſame; wiſhing, and deſiring, their ſaluation from my heart, in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18730:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly; I enter vpon this diſputation, not out of contention, but out of conſcience, with a ſecure, and certaine perſwaſion of truth, and ſoliditie therein; whereof becauſe I make ſome larger mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I will ſay the leſſe in this place.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; though this Booke, in all the pages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beareth the title of a <hi>firſt,</hi> and of a <hi>ſecond Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> yet vnderſtand, that, after I had preached two Sermons, at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to this purpoſe, and had recollected my meditations, I framed them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more copiouſly into the body of a <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> which therefore I preſent vnto thee, rather vnder this name; as exceeding the proportion, and, in ſome things, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering (perhaps) from the qualitie of <hi>Sermons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, and laſtly; if it ſhall pleaſe any of the <hi>Romane</hi> ſide, to ſtand againſt me, in the defence of his Mother-Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make anſwere vnto my Diſcourſe (vnto which buſineſſe, as I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no man, ſo I feare not the performance of any man in this kind) he muſt follow me in his anſwere, as I haue gone before him in this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> not flying vp, and downe without order, nor concealing my proofes, and reaſons; but, from point to point, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a cleere, and a ſubſtantiall refutation thereof. As for bitter words, and calumnious writing, though I can ſteepe my Pen in Vineger, and Worme-wood, as well as they, yet I reſolue not to follow any aduerſarie in this courſe: but, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in his diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt <hi>Hermogenes, Viderit Perſona; cum Doctrina mihi quaeſtio eſt;</hi> ſo I will leaue the perſon, and come vnto the matter it ſelfe.</p>

FIRST; The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proclaiming: an <hi>Angell [verſe</hi> 1.] euen <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> himſelfe; as ſome conceiue (amongſt whom I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18730:9"/>

            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY; The manner of his proclamation: <hi>He cried out mightily, with a loude voice [verſe</hi> 2.] with a voice, more then <hi>Stentorian;</hi> and no maruell: for it was <hi>Verbum à Verbo;</hi> a word from the Word: a word powerfully ſpoken by the Word ineffably begotten.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY; The matter it ſelfe; <hi>It is fallen, it is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Babylon:</hi> the place is conſiderable; for it is <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> by qualitie, and name; alſo <hi>a great Citie</hi> by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of place, and power. The ruine of it is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for it is <hi>a fall,</hi> extreme, and finall: and <hi>it is fallen;</hi> in the time paſt (though it be yet to come) by an <hi>enallage</hi> of the tenſe: and againe; <hi>it is fallen;</hi> by an <hi>anadiplôſis:</hi> the one, and the other, ſhewing an infallible certainty of euent. Thus now my Text is like <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> wombe; it hath twinnes in it, <hi>[Cecidit, cecidit]</hi> as if the ruine of Babylon were ſounded forth by the two ſiluer trumpets, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.2. It is a double voice of ruine; fall vpon fall: ſo that I may vſe the words of the Pſalme; <hi>God hath ſpoken it once or twice. Pſal.</hi> 62.11.</p>
            <p>And as my Text is double here, by the ingemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one word; ſo it is double by the repetition of the ſame ſentence elſewhere, <hi>viz. Apoc.</hi> 14.8.

            <p>I come to the words of my Text, wherein there is a fatall coniunction of two things: <hi>Culpa,</hi> and <hi>Poena:</hi> the <hi>Sinne</hi> of Rome, implyed in her name; <hi>Babylon:</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of Rome, annexed, or prefixed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>it is fallen, it is fallen.</hi> We may Logically there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make this partition of my Text: heere is the SVBIECT; <hi>Babylon:</hi> and heere is the PRAEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATE; <hi>it is fallen.</hi> In order of the words (as they ſtand herein my Text) <hi>Babylon</hi> is laſt, but, in order of ſenſe, it is firſt.

               <head>The <hi>FIRST</hi> Interpretation.</head>
               <p>THe firſt interpretation is framed by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whom many follow in this, and ſundry other points, rather for the reaſon of his authoritie, then for the authoritie of his reaſon, and therefore are carried into errour by the venerable eſtimation of his name. Hee confeſſeth, that <hi>Rome is another Babylon, de ciuit. Dei. l.</hi> 16. <hi>c.</hi> 17. and that ſhee is the <hi>daughter of Babylon, l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 22. but not in regard of her <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> (as it is now in my Text) which things that greatly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father neuer ſeemed to ſuſpect: and therefore teaching truly, that there are <hi>two Cities</hi> in this world (mixed together in outward things, but ſeuered in their inward qualities, and tending, conſequently, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to different ends) he aſſumeth falſly, that this <hi>Babylon</hi> (out of which wee muſt flye: <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.4.) is onely <hi>the generall Citie of the Deuill and his members;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other Citie is a <hi>Spirituall Ieruſalem, and the Citie of God.</hi> Read S. <hi>Auguſtine, de Ciuit. Dei, l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 18. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. <hi>enarrat.</hi> 2. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61. and though the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies vpon the <hi>Reuelation</hi> (paſſing vnder his name) are not his genuine Workes, yet they truely containe his opinion in this behalfe, <hi>Homil.</hi> 11. and 16.</p>
               <p>This ſiniſter, and miſconceiued interpretation, of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> doth ſometime qualifie the feare of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;</hi> who finding that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, neere the end of the world, <hi>by deduction</hi> (as hee affirmeth) out of the <hi>Reuelat. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Videtur</hi> (ſaith he) this may ſeeme ſo to bee; but hee recollecteth himſelfe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in this manner; <hi>Auguſtine, with many others, doth conceiue, that this Citie of Babylon is the generall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

of the wicked, and not the particular Citie of Rome. De Rom. Pont. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>It is no maruaile, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (like a man readie to be drowned) taketh hold of euery ſtraw for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. The maruaile is rather, that <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a man ſo learned, ſo ingenious, ſo iudicious, ſhould not cleerely diſcerne, by ſo many circumſtances in the Text, that this <hi>Babylon</hi> is a particular Citie, and not a generall Societie: and farther, that this particular Citie is <hi>Rome,</hi> and not any other place.</p>
               <p>But the glorious luſtre of the [then] preſent ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> (in the <hi>Empire,</hi> ſo potent, and in the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo religious) might, and certainly did breed an eclipſe of this euident truth vnto S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> eyes, looking more earneſtly vpon the condition of the time, then deepely into the coherence of the Text.</p>
               <p>I conclude, therfore, the firſt interpretation, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe men that conuerſe in the Monuments of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers (without which no man can be profound, and exact in the knowledge of Diuinitie) to draw their wine, and to leaue their dregges; and not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme that currant in them, which is not weighed in the ballance of holy Scripture. For the <hi>Sunne</hi> of this ſacred Booke hath natiue light of truth without any darkeneſſe of errour; whereas the borrowed light of the <hi>Moone</hi> [the beſt Fathers, and moſt commended Interpreters] doth ſhine with the ſpots of infirmitie, which attendeth the nature of mankind.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Interpretation is that, which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth follow; who ſaw a part of the truth, but not the whole: as the blind man, vpon the firſt, and imperfect recouerie of his ſight, ſaw men, but hee ſaw them <hi>walking like trees, Mark.</hi> 8.24. He confeſſeth then, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>Rome;</hi> that <hi>Babylon,</hi> at the leaſt, wherof Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth make mention (<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 13.) whoſe authoritie hee pretendeth to follow in this point; <hi>de Scriptor.

               <p>But, to vnderſtand yet more punctually the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in this caſe, let vs obſerue, that hee affirmeth <hi>Rome</hi> to haue beene <hi>Babylon</hi> in his owne time, when there was a true and a glorious Church of Chriſt in <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore, in the name of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine religious Ladies [<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 17.] he aduiſeth <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi> to flie out of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to repaire vnto <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> A paſſage verie rhetoricall, and full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation (rather then found, and ſubſtantiall) to breed in her tender heart an alienation from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being that <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereof wee now intreate; though elſewhere hee ſeemeth wholly to free, and diſcharge <hi>Rome</hi> from the ſcandalous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this title, as belonging to ETHNICALL

               <p>Thus as <hi>Agag,</hi> the King of <hi>Amalek,</hi> came pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before <hi>Samuel</hi> [1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32.] perſwading himſelfe, that <hi>the bitterneſſe of death was paſt;</hi> (which was yet to come, and was then at hand) ſo theſe miſerable Babylonians, by poore, and weake euaſions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues, that the ſcandall, and horrour of this name is paſt, and that condition of <hi>Rome</hi> is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſo <hi>Rome</hi> is ſafe: whereas the imputation cleaueth faſt vnto her, and her future ruine doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly attend her preſent ſtate; as we ſhall ſee anon, in the orderly purſuite of this point.

this hatefull name and direfull calamitie doth fall: whether vpon <hi>Rome</hi> in her eſtate paſt, preſent, or to come (which particular ſhall afterwards enſue, in the proceſſe of my Diſcourſe) but ſimply and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely; whether this <hi>Babylon</hi> bee the particular Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth conceiue; though he be variable, and inconſtant in the manner of his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or whether it bee the generall ſocietie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth, in an Allegoricall ſenſe, ſomewhat wittily, but very improbably, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</p>
               <p>That this <hi>Babylon,</hi> in my Text, is the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> it appeareth euidently by many, and cleere cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in this Scripture, but ſpecially two.

               <head>The <hi>THIRD</hi> Interpretation.</head>
               <p>THe third interpretation of the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this place is this; that <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſhe was <hi>Ethnicall</hi> (nay rather ſhe is <hi>Babylon</hi> here not as ſhe was <hi>Ethnicall,</hi> nor in her eſtate now already paſt) but in another ſtate, which was future, and yet to come, in the time of this prediction, and was then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18730:14"/>
to ſucceed, in enſuing Ages; after that Paganiſme was extinct; after that Heatheniſh Idolatry did decreaſe; after that Perſecution by the Emperours, did ceaſe; and after that peace was reſtored vnto the Church. This interpretation I will approue, by three Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, to be ſincere, proper, and true.</p>
               <p>FIRST; by the playne euidence, and coherence of this Scripture; by two perſpicuous demonſtrations out of the ſame. <hi>First;</hi> becauſe this <hi>Babylon</hi> is heere ſo called by title, and ſhe is ſo indeed: when? neere vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the period, and conſummation of the World; not that ſhe ſhall then begin to be this <hi>Babylon</hi> (for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of ſome Papiſts, pretending that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall bee <hi>Babylon</hi> within two or three yeeres of the end of the World, and not before, I ſhall refute in due place) but becauſe ſhe continueth ſo, in the decourſe of many yeeres, and Ages (after the time of her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate) neere vnto the determination of the World. The truth hereof doth cleerely appeare by the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of things, and connexion of euents in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth Chapters of this Booke. For the <hi>ſinne</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her <hi>ruine</hi> (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the cauſes, and Concomitancies thereof) being copiouſly expreſſed in the ſeuenteenth and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapters, we find that, immediately thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in the nineteenth Chapter) the Saints prayſe God for the notable iudgement executed vpon this Citie; and therefore our learned Souereigne doth well obſerue in the title, and argument of that Chapter, that <hi>the Saints prayſe God, becauſe the Pope is destroyed:</hi> for it is he, whoſe exceſſiue pride, and exorbitant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, draw this ſcandalous name, and dolefull va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18730:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vpon this vnhappy place. <hi>Secondly;</hi> becauſe we find [<hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 12.] that <hi>ten Kings</hi> (whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely <hi>ten,</hi> I doe not now enquire) aroſe, and aſſumed Royall power vnto themſelues, vpon the diſſolution of the <hi>Romane Empire;</hi> for as it fell into pieces, by the vaſt magnitude therof, and could not ſubſiſt vnder her owne greatneſſe, ſo, out of her parts, ſundry States, and Principalities did ariſe.</p>
               <p>It followeth <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. that <hi>theſe Kings gaue their power vnto the Beaſt:</hi> namely, the <hi>Second Beast,</hi> ariſing in the place, and after the decay of the firſt (as wee reade <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13.11, 12.) that is to ſay; they had no ſooner obtained their dignitie, and eſtate, vpon the diſſolution of the Empire, but they ſurrendred a great part of their glorie and authoritie vnto the <hi>Pope;</hi> who, by degrees; artificially, and cunningly inuaded the Imperiall Seate, and power; ſo that, in admiration of his excellencie, theſe <hi>Kings,</hi> as deuoted ſonnes (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seruants, or rather Slaues) of his SANCTITIE, ſubmitted a great part of their Royall Scepter vnto his triple Crowne. This prediction as wee reade in this diuine Booke, ſo, what the accompliſhment thereof hath beene, the Hiſtories of ſundry Nations, and the paſſages of ſucceeding Ages, doe ſufficiently declare. But let vs proceed againe. It followeth [<hi>verſe</hi> 16.] that after this ſubmiſſion of their Regall power vnto the Beaſt (with whom, or neere about that time, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe euen at <hi>one houre: verſe</hi> 12.) they ſhall <hi>hate the Whore, and burne her with fire</hi> (to wit, <hi>Rome,</hi> this <hi>Babylon</hi>) though formerly <hi>they gaue their Kingdomes vnto the Beaſt:</hi> but how long? <hi>vntill the Words of God be fulfilled;</hi> vntill the appointed time. And what ſhall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18730:15"/>
incline theſe Kings to withdraw their obedience from this <hi>Second Beast,</hi> and to aſſociate themſelues, in this fearefull expedition againſt him, and his Citie? God ſhall put this motion into their hearts, for her ſinnes againſt his Maieſtie: and Papall iniuries, done againſt the Crowne and Royall dignitie of theſe Kings, ſhall excite them vnto this warre; as hereafter it ſhall more euidently appeare. But now this is the point, vpon which I doe inſiſt; that this great, and fatall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Rome,</hi> being yet to come, and not yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, this name, and this eſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> is not alreadie paſt (as <hi>Victorius</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> and the moſt generall number of Papiſts do ſimply &amp; ignorantly pretend in this behalfe) but her <hi>ſin</hi> is preſent (for ſhe now is <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>) and her <hi>puniſhment</hi> is future; for ſhe ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <hi>fall;</hi> as I ſhall cleerely demonſtrate, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding paſſages of my ſpeech. Meane while let vs obſerue with ioy vnto our ſelues, and with gratitude vnto God, that the ſucceſſe and euent of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie doth alreadie beginne, for that many Kings <hi>doe hate this Whore,</hi> and haue diſcouered the qualitie of this <hi>ſecond Beast,</hi> and, as I hope, ſhall euer continue in that diſpoſition of minde, and rectitude of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till God ſhall induce other Princes to concurre with them, in the finall accompliſhment of this great and glorious worke. And ſo much concerning the firſt remonſtrance, to proue thereby, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in, and for her eſtate, which was not preſent but future, in the time of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that ſhe ſhall be deſtroyed in regard of her ſins, in that eſtate, when her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> condition is paſt, and neerer vnto the conſummation of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:18730:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>SECONDLY; I make remonſtrance of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by obſeruation of the nature, and propertie of God; and that in two reſpects. <hi>Firſt:</hi> by the TRVTH of God. For he hath promiſed vnto euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, <hi>turning from his former ſinnes, that hee ſhall ſurely liue, and not dye:</hi> yea, that <hi>all his former iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall not be mentioned, but he ſhall liue, in regard of the righteouſneſſe, which afterward he hath done. Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22. If this be true in a particular perſon, ſhall it not be true in a particular Citie? Is God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to one, and not vnto many? euen many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands? It is his owne iuſt plea for his ſingular mercy vnto <hi>Nineueh,</hi> vpon her repentance: <hi>Should I not ſpare</hi> Nineueh, <hi>that great Citie? Ionah</hi> 4.11. Now therefore, ſince <hi>Ethnicall</hi> Rome <hi>is paſt, and that ſtate is aboliſhed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Parſons</hi>) for which cauſe ſhe did beare the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> hath aſſured vs, that <hi>Rome, by her confeſsion of Christ, hath blotted out the blaſphemie, written in her forehead</hi> (which point the <hi>Babylonians</hi> doe greedily embrace, to their vnhappy excec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation) ſince <hi>Rome</hi> hath <hi>turned from her former ſinnes, and done righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſince ſhe hath had a glorious name by her renowmed Faith (after the time of Paganiſme, Idolatrie, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder her ancient Emperours) ſince, in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſhe was a glorious member of the Church (and, in their opinion ſhee is ſtill the <hi>Head, Queene,</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſſe</hi> thereof; embracing, and propounding the truely Catholike Faith) and, finally, ſince her enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repentance hath cleered the ſcore of her prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſins; how can it conſiſt with Gods <hi>Truth,</hi> that, in regard of her ſinnes, ſo long paſt, and ſo deepely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18730:16"/>
of, he ſhould lay a deſtruction vpon her in the time yet to come (for it is yet to be fulfilled) and that in ſo terrible and vnexemplifiable a manner? <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18. Her ruine, therefore, (and ſuch a ruine) which is yet to come, when her Ethnicall eſtate is ſo long paſt, doth ſufficiently proue, that later ſinnes, in a future age ſhould renue and reuiue her old name (if <hi>Babylon</hi> euer were the name of ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> according to the tenour of the Scriptures) and bring her vnto this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable end: it being one of the laſt Tragicall acts of Gods Iuſtice, vpon the great Theater of the world; as it appeareth in the hiſtoricall predictions of this Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I make farther remonſtrance of that poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the IVSTICE of God. For <hi>he will not puniſh the children for their fathers ſins; euery one ſhall die for his owne, Ezek.</hi> 18.4. Since therefore <hi>Rome</hi> is yet to be deſtroyed, this deſtruction doth not attend her anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſinnes (committed in her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> eſtate, and done away by her repentance in her <hi>Christian</hi> eſtate) but for latter ſinnes, in latter ages, wherein ſhe was to beare the ſcandall of this name, and to ſuffer ruine for the ſame. Innocent <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not periſh for nocent <hi>Rome:</hi> not the latter for the former: not the Papall for the Imperiall: not the Church for the State: there cannot bee iniuſtice in God. <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all the world doe right?</hi> Yet I confeſſe, that, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, God doth ſometimes remember the ſin of ages paſt; and ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Babylon, Apocal.</hi> 18.5. <hi>God hath remembred her iniquities:</hi> but, in this caſe, latter ages doe renew, imitate, and increaſe the ſinnes of the former. And ſo I grant, that, for her old ſinnes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18730:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Idolatrie, Perſecution, &amp;c.</hi> renewed afterward, <hi>Rome ſhall ſuffer this ruine;</hi> as <hi>Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Viegas,</hi> the Ieſuites doe confeſſe.</p>
               <p>Meane while, this is the point, which I commend here vnto your prudent obſeruation. If <hi>Rome</hi> were ſinfull <hi>Babylon</hi> (here ſpoken of) onely in her Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall eſtate (which is a plauſible deluſion) ſhe ſhould haue ſuffered her fatall puniſhment (here threatned) during that Ethnicall eſtate; and not in her Chriſtian condition: whereas the ſpeciall calamities of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſince the time of this prediction) enſued vpon <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Rome</hi> (not Ethnicall <hi>Rome</hi>) by the furious incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and impreſſions of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls;</hi> which were caſtigations of <hi>Chriſtian Rome,</hi> and not of <hi>Ethnicall,</hi> nor <hi>Antichristian Babylon:</hi> whoſe finall and vtter ſubuerſion, being yet to come (and neerer vnto the end of the world) therefore Gods <hi>Truth</hi> and his <hi>Iustice</hi> doe cleerely euince, that ſhee was to bee <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> againe (if ſhee were ſo once before) and to bee ſtamped with this hatefull name; after the time of her entertainment of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of her <hi>Ethnicall eſtate;</hi> this name ariſing out of a latter condition of ſinnes, for which ſhee ſhould fall, and in latter times, in which ſhee ſhould periſh, by the iuſt indignation of God, and Man. And ſo much for the ſecond remonſtrance.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY; I make remonſtrance of my poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the ingenious, and faire confeſſion of two learned <hi>Babylonians</hi> themſelues (they alſo being <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> of eminent qualitie, publike Readers in their Schooles) who, by diligent inquiſition into the very Text of this Scripture, and carefull obſeruation of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18730:17"/>
circumſtances thereof, oppoſe themſelues againſt the common errour of their owne ſide, and cleerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of the coherence of many circumſtances in this Scripture, that this BABYLON doth ſignifie <hi>Rome,</hi> not in her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> eſtate onely (as the Papiſts doe more ordinarily conceiue) but neere the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the world: that then ſhee ſhall, by her great ſinnes, deſerue this name, and therefore come to ruine. Neither doe I make vſe of their confeſſion, becauſe it commeth from aduerſaries, but becauſe they make it out of the conſcience of truth, grounded vpon the cleere euidence of the Scripture. For I ſhould thinke meanely of my cauſe, if the truth and certaintie of my aſſertion ſtood vpon the falſhood and errour of their confeſſion, and had no better ſtrength to ſupport it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Babylonian,</hi> is <hi>Ribera,</hi> a man of no vulgar note, as being a Doctor of Diuinitie, and profeſſour thereof in <hi>Salmantica,</hi> a famous Academy of <hi>Spaine.</hi> This man wrote a Commentary vpon the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> where, treating vpon theſe words, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Babylon, that great Citie, is fallen,</hi> hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by ſundry infallible circumſtances of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture [<hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.] that this <hi>Babylon</hi> is not <hi>the generall ſocietie of wicked men,</hi> but <hi>a particular Citie;</hi> and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the Citie of Rome;</hi> and therefore he concludeth his diſputation (as I noted before) vpon that point, in theſe words; <hi>Omnia profectò, niſi in Romam, non conueniunt;</hi> certainely all the circumſtances in the Text cannot agree vnto any other place, but vnto <hi>Rome</hi> alone; <hi>in cap.</hi> 14. <hi>num.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>Then he commeth [<hi>num.</hi> 32.] to explicate the ſtate,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18730:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and condition of <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard whereof this name <hi>[Babylon]</hi> and this ruine <hi>[ſhee is fallen]</hi> belong vnto her in this ſacred <hi>Reuelation.</hi> And here, ſuſpecting the ſcandall, and offence of his owne brethren, he entreth vpon this diſcourſe, with a preoccupation, in this ſad, and graue manner; <q>
                     <hi>Offenſionem pio Lectori amoueri volo,</hi> I will that no pious Reader [a Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that is to ſay, <hi>a Babylonian</hi>] ſhould take offence at my expoſition, as if it were aduantagious vnto the Heretickes <hi>[the Proteſtants]</hi> who aſſume vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues an occaſion, vpon this name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> aſcribed here vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> to lay an imputation vpon the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and our holy Father the <hi>Pope.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore [<hi>num.</hi> 34.] hee ſaith, that this name of <hi>Babylon</hi> agreed vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhee was in her Ethnicall State, an Idolatrous, perſecuting Citie; but now, ſaith hee, the caſe is altered, for ſhee is, and long hath beene, the Miſtreſſe of Faith, and the Mother of Chriſtians. Then hee addeth immediately; <hi>Si quando haec eadem fecerit, quae Iohannis tempore faciebat, iterum Babylon vocabitur;</hi> if <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall commit the ſame things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, which ſhee committed in the time of <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſhee ſhall bee called <hi>Babylon</hi> againe [marke this well good hearers, for now the Ieſuite draweth neere vnto the point] as it was in the caſe of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which, of a <hi>faithful Citie</hi> once, became afterwards a <hi>Whore.</hi> So he.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But let vs heare the man tell out his tale; hee hath yet more to ſay, to acquit his Mother Church, and Father-Pope; and therefore [<hi>num.</hi> 38.] hee affirmeth, That <hi>this name of Babylon is neuer applyed vnto the</hi> CHVRCH <hi>of Rome, but onely vnto the</hi> CITIE; <hi>howbeit, not as the Citie long hath beene vnder the Pope,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18730:18"/>
and now is vnder him, nor indeed ſhall haue this name, while the Pope is Lord, and Gouernour thereof: but, as ſhee was Babylon in her Ethnicall ſtate, ſo ſhe ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after againe, vpon her defection from the Pope, and from Chriſtianitie, neere the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe <hi>Ribera</hi> feared another cenſure here, hee maketh another preoccupation [<hi>num.</hi> 40.] in this manner; <hi>diuinare me dicet quiſpiam;</hi> Some man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will ſay, that I take vpon me to be a Prophet, and to foretell things to come; <hi>but</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate that man to lay aſide his preiudice, to examine the whole matter with mature iudgement, and to beleeue me no farther, then reaſon, and truth ſhall perſwade him in this caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then hee addeth [<hi>num.</hi> 42.] That, <hi>for as much as Rome, in her Ethnicall ſtate was ſo idolatrous, ſo wicked, and ſo cruell againſt the Chriſtians (for that all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, throughout the Romane Empire, were put to death by the authoritie of Rome, and by the power of Romane Magistrates) therefore it is iust, and meet that ſhe her ſelfe ſhould once ſuffer for her impious courſes; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet done</hi> [according to the purport of this Scripture] <hi>ſhall be done hereafter, when ſhe ſhall be no leſſe wicked, then ſhe was in former times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then [<hi>num.</hi> 43.] he proceedeth in a faire, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious manner of Theologicall diſcourſe; ſaying: <hi>Whereas this extreame deſolation ſhall fall vpon Rome, neere the end of the world; it is very iuſt, and equall, in good congruitie of reaſon.</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe the Citie is ſtill the ſame; which, being once ſo defiled with ſin, muſt one day be purged with fire. Beſides</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are many Citizens in Rome at this day, who by their name,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18730:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſtock, boaſt of their deſcent from the ancient Romans, who alwayes increaſed there in great number.</hi> Then hee addeth further; that, <hi>as a Citie, built out of the ruines of a former, is reputed to be one, and the ſame Citie with it; ſo here, in this caſe, the latter Citizens of</hi> Rome [when ſhe ſhall be deſtroyed] <hi>may be accounted the ſame Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens with the former (though they be not of their bloud, and kindred) becauſe they ioyne themſelues vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and become as it were, one body, and one common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth with them; but ſpecially by their imitation of the facts, and ſins of their Predeceſſors. This</hi> (ſaith he; <hi>Num.</hi> 44.) <hi>is the cauſe, therefore, why the latter Romanes, neere the end of the World, following the impieties of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſhall be puniſhed, and the more grieuouſly alſo in that regard. So that</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>though her old ſinnes,</hi> [committed in her Ethnicall ſtate] <hi>were forgotten by God, in regard of her Chriſtian profeſsion, which ſhee entertayned afterward: yet now, vpon her new, and like Impieties, neere the end of the World, the old are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred againe, and therefore ſhe ſhall be burned for them both together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Excellently, and diuinely ſpoken; according to the true tenour of the Scriptures elſewhere, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> it ſelfe; and therefore <hi>Ribera</hi> began to grow warme in the concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; proteſting in this manner; <hi>We know this truth ſo perſpicuouſly, by the words of this Reuelation,</hi> VT NE STVLTISSIMVS QVIDEM NEGARE POSSIT; <hi>ſo that the verieſt foole in the world cannot deny the ſame.</hi> Then hee addeth; <hi>Since</hi> Babylon <hi>ſhall be the ſhop of all</hi> IDOLATRIE, <hi>and of all impieties; therefore it cannot be doubted, but that this ſhall be the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18730:19"/>
condition of</hi> Rome <hi>hereafter.</hi> And thus hauing made his explication of the Text, he propoundeth a very fit queſtion, in the end of his diſcourſe [<hi>Num.</hi> 51.] name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>By what meanes the Citie of</hi> Rome, <hi>neere the end of the Vorld, ſhould attaine vnto ſo great a power, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of riches?</hi> He anſwereth firſt; <hi>that no man can certainly know the reaſon thereof;</hi> and ſecondly, that <hi>this may come to paſſe,</hi> partly, <hi>by reaſon of the tenne Kings, who ſhall make a conqueſt of the whole World, and diuide it amongſt them; and partly in regard of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, who ſhall bee aduanced in this time; by meanes whereof</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall ſhortly returne vnto her ancient power, and ſhall haue theſe tenne Kings vnder her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, who a little after ſhall reigne in the whole World:</hi> but, finally, theſe Kings ſhall deſtroy <hi>Rome; Apoc.</hi> 17.17.</p>
               <p>Here the coniecture of <hi>Ribera</hi> (founded vpon the vaine ſpeculations of ſome ancient Fathers, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the nature of this myſterie, nor the ſenſe of the Scriptures in this behalfe) failed him very much; as not knowing, that <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Rome <hi>is this</hi> Babylon, and that <hi>the Pope is the ſecond Beaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> (by which meanes, truly, <hi>Rome</hi> hath beene eleuated in a new, and ſecond greatneſſe in the World, in ſome ſort excelling the former, in her Ethnicall eſtate) as, by due remonſtrance it ſhall hereafter appeare. Meane while (good hearers) excuſe my tedious declaration (taken out of the Commentarie of this learned <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi>) as contayning much varietie of matter of very markeable obſeruation for my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>My ſecond <hi>Babylonian</hi> Authour is <hi>Viegas;</hi> a Ieſuite alſo, and a Doctor of Diuinitie, and Profeſſor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18730:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt at <hi>Conimbrica,</hi> then at <hi>Ebora</hi> (two Vniuerſities of <hi>Portugall</hi>) who framed a more copious, and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Commentarie, vpon this ſacred Booke of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation;</hi> inſiſting very often in the ſteppes of <hi>Ribera,</hi> and eſpecially in this point, whereof we now intreat. Therefore, though it bee materiall to expreſſe the iudgement of <hi>Viegas</hi> alſo vpon the ſame; yet I may contract his long Diſcourſe into a few words.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Viegas,</hi> then [<hi>in Apocal.</hi> 17. §. 2.] confeſſeth that <hi>the destruction of this</hi> Babylon [<hi>foretold cap.</hi> 18.] <hi>ſhall be in the laſt times, before the end of the World.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards [§. 3.] he ſaith, <hi>that this</hi> Babylon <hi>is the Citie of</hi> Rome; howbeit, <hi>not as ſhe is now, vnder the Pope, but as ſhe was heretofore in her Ethnicall condition, and as ſhe ſhall be hereafter in the time of Antichriſt, vpon her defection from the Pope, and from her Christian Faith;</hi> and then he ſheweth, in many words, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of her ſinnes, and manner of her ruine (confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably with the iudgement of <hi>Ribera</hi>) and that, <hi>for old ſinnes, ioyned with the latter, God ſhall execute his wrath vpon her, by theſe ten Kings;</hi> as hee doth more largely deduce alſo, <hi>in cap.</hi> 18. §. 6.</p>
               <p>Thus you haue heard the conſonant expoſition of theſe two learned perſons, the ſecond treading in the ſteps of the firſt; and both (for the maine point, now in queſtion) in the ſteps of the holy Scripture. Now, therefore, I ſhould proceed to collect, out of them both, ſuch obſeruations, as are ſutable to our purpoſe, but that I am a little ſtayed, and hindred, by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Commentarie of <hi>Ludouicus ab Alcaſar</hi> (a Ieſuite of great eſteeme in <hi>Spaine</hi>) which hee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, vpon the yeare 1612. [many yeeres after that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18730:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the two other Commentaries, vpon the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> neere extant; for the latter, of <hi>Viegas,</hi> was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Preſſe, vpon the yeere 1599. and the former, of <hi>Ribera,</hi> certaine yeeres before that; for <hi>Ribera</hi> died vpon the yeere 1591.] in which Commentarie a man would, therefore, reaſonably ſuppoſe, that ſome more excellent matters ſhould now come to light, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, after the diligent, and painfull diſcuſſion of ſo many points, by his learned Brethren, preceding him in this kind. But marke the euent, in this our preſent iſſue; how this learned ignorant man, this wiſe fooliſh man, this iudicious abſurd man, this acute ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe man, this Expounder of the Reuelation, or rather this compounder of Fables, doth heerein comport himſelfe. Two things then in this paſſage, deſerue your carefull attention [ſhall I ſmile at his folly, or laugh at his miſery, while I propoſe the ſame?] The firſt is this; that <hi>this</hi> Babylon <hi>is</hi> Rome <hi>indeed, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſhe was in her Ethnicall ſtate, and not in any ſtate enſuing hereafter.</hi> The ſecond is this; that <hi>the fall of this</hi> Babylon <hi>was mysticall, and ſpirituall;</hi> namely, <hi>from Ethnicall Idolatry to Christian Religion</hi> [an happy fall] <hi>from the ſuperstition of Pagans vnto the profeſsion of Chriſt;</hi> which fall being paſt, he ſaith, that this was <hi>myſtica vltio</hi> [O myſticall, or rather, O miſerable <hi>Foole</hi>] a certaine myſticall reuenge of God againſt the old Idolatrous <hi>Babylon; which vltion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; for the Citie of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall neuer returne vnto the vomit of</hi> IDOLATRY <hi>againe.</hi> Theſe particulars, as they are worthy to be noted, ſo they are vnworthy to be confuted, in this profound <hi>Mercurialist;</hi> who can extract ſuch ſenſes, out of the Scripture, againſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18730:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſenſe of common reaſon; and therefore I leaue him vnto the cenſure of <hi>Ribera;</hi> who, prouing the contrary aſſertions, by the cleere euidence of the text, giueth his verdict againſt this <hi>Ludouicus</hi> (and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates of his ſimple opinion) that <hi>hee is worſe then a very Foole:</hi> (as you heard before) and therefore let him accompany <hi>Spalatenſis;</hi> who (vpon his returne <hi>to Babylon</hi>) is ſaid, for all his ambitious expectations of a Cardinals Hat to get nothing but <hi>a Fooles Cappe,</hi> but (I doubt) with <hi>a Knaues heart;</hi> as any man may well ſuppoſe that this <hi>Ludouicus</hi> doth beare in his breſt; ſeeking to obſcure, and to draw into queſtion, the true, cleere, inexpugnable confeſſion [according to the point, whereof I now intreat] which his more iudicious, or more conſcionable, fellowes had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, leauing this graue, and tedious Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, with his profuſe, and <hi>fooliſh</hi> Booke, I reflect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch obſeruations, as, out of <hi>Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Viegas,</hi> are markable in the iſſue, vpon which I now proceed. For though they are not ſo Regular, as that I dare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in all things; yet I will firſt take ſuch things, as they grant, vpon the euidence of the Text, and then proue ſuch things, as they denie, in their miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame. The points, which I will collect out of them, are ſixe:</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt;</hi> They confeſſe, that <hi>Rome</hi> is (or ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
bee) <hi>Babylon</hi> after her Ethnicall eſtate, in a later condition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond;</hi> They confeſſe, that IDOLATRY,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and impietie ſhall abound in <hi>Rome,</hi> in this her later condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:18730:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>third;</hi> They confeſſe, that <hi>Rome,</hi> in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhall perſecute, and oppreſſe the faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of Gods Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The <hi>fourth;</hi> They confeſſe, that <hi>Rome,</hi> in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhall haue great power, authoritie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The <hi>fift;</hi> They confeſſe, that, in this condition, and latter eſtate of her IDOLATRY, Antichriſt ſhall poſſeſſe this Citie, and ſo it ſhall bee a ſpirituall <hi>Babylon;</hi> a ſinke of ſinne, and ſhoppe of <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> which ſhall bee deriued vnto the World, vnder the gouernment of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the latter dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The <hi>ſixt;</hi> They confeſſe, that <hi>Rome,</hi> in this condition, ſhall bee deſtroyed, burnt with fire, made deſolate by tenne KINGS; and ſo ſhall come vnto her extreame ruine, by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, for her former, and for her latter ſinnes.</p>
               <p>All theſe points (being inforced out of the plaine teſtimonie of the Scripture) wee admit as true; and ſuch, as either <hi>the verieſt Foole</hi> cannot denie, or, at leaſt, the wiſeſt can neuer impeach.</p>
               <p>Now though <hi>Ribera, Viegas</hi> (and others that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their interpretation) lay this ſcandall vpon the <hi>Citie</hi> only (and not vpon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) and vpon the Citie alſo when ſhee falleth from her obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and not before; yet I will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that this goodly Song is not tuneable to the Text, but that it is a poore euaſion, vpon a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſitie, which ſhall bee no <hi>Citie of refuge</hi> for the protection of their CHVRCH; howſoeuer being weather-beaten by the ſtorme of the Text (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18730:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their hearts) they are driuen vnto this Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of their inuention; wherein the Conſcience findeth ſmall comfort, and reaſon it ſelfe (obſeruing the euents of things, and the occurrencies of times) doth force them immediatly out of this ſilly creeke, into a troubleſome Sea.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, I come now vnto the fourth, the laſt, and the ſubſtantiall interpretation of my Text, which layeth this name of BABYLON directly, and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the CHVRCH of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhee long hath beene, and now is, and (though declining in her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) as ſhe ſhall continue vnto the fearefull time of her vnhappy fall; and the whole Riuer of <hi>Tyber</hi> (though it were all made <hi>Holy water</hi> by Popiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation) ſhall neuer waſh away this ſcandall of her name, which now truly doth, and long hath done, and ſhall for euer cleaue faſt vnto her; as the Leproſie vnto <hi>Gehezi,</hi> and vnto his ſeed for euer.</p>

               <head>The <hi>FOVRTH</hi> Interpretation.</head>
               <p>FOurthly then, and laſtly (for now wee are come vnto the mayne and principall iſſue) I confidently proclaime, and will cleerely proue, that, as this <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is, <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> after her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> eſtate; ſo it is <hi>Rome</hi> in regard of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not onely of the <hi>Citie,</hi> as both are vnder the Pope, and this I will eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deduce by fiue Reaſons.</p>
               <p>FIRST therfore, I proue my aſſertion in regard of the very edifices in <hi>Rome;</hi> the Churches, the Chappels, the Monaſteries, the Palaces of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the houſes of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18730:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſundry Eccleſiaſticall places, which take vp a ſpeciall part of <hi>Rome;</hi> being now a <hi>Papall Rome,</hi> the ſeate of the <hi>Spirituall Monarch;</hi> the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> (as you ſhal heare anon) inuading the Imperiall Seat, and dignitie of the <hi>firſt</hi> therein: ſo that all motion in <hi>Rome</hi> is to the Centre of the <hi>Church</hi> there, whoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference (by dominion, and power) is ſo largely extended in the World: all reference there is vnto Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire (in whoſe perſon they ſuppoſe that the <hi>actuall</hi> Souereigntie, now exerciſed by the Pope, did <hi>habitually</hi> dwell) there the ſplendour of the Church darkeneth all the glorie of the <hi>Citie,</hi> which alſo, now, by a Popiſh Metaphor, is tranſlated into the <hi>Church;</hi> for that the Citie, and the Church, are now coupled in vnion together, both being in ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to one head: in regard whereof, it is <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> Rome, rather then <hi>Ciuill;</hi> the Citie being ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of the Church, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> fat Kine were deuoured by the leane. The name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then, agreeing to <hi>Rome</hi> (as wee ſhall more cleerely perceiue anon) falleth eminently vpon the <hi>Church</hi> there (rather then vpon the <hi>Citie</hi>) hauing all the properties of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which the Reuelation doth aſſigne; as in the ſequell of my Sermon, you ſhall very ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, therefore I prooue my aſſertion, by the reuiew of that <hi>Merchandtze</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> which is ſpirituall, and of the <hi>Church</hi> there; not temporall, and of the <hi>Citie;</hi> as ſome doe poorely conceiue, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prooue.

                  </gap> Merchants of this <hi>Babylon</hi> are <hi>ſoule-merchants,</hi> dealing in ſpirituall affaires, vnder the great, and terrible Monarch of the Church therein, ſitting as God, in the Temple of God. This is not mine inuention, but the very teſtimonie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe; <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18.13. For the Spirit of God, making a large enumeration of the <hi>Wares, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize</hi> of this <hi>Babylon</hi> (a Spirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſpirituall <hi>Wares,</hi> vnder a ſpirituall <hi>Prince</hi>) concludeth it with <hi>the</hi> SOVLES <hi>of men;</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and pretended ſubiect of their negotiations; though, vnder, and by the pretenſe of ſpirituall things, this Papall Monarch doth exerciſe a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and an earthly domination; as the principall ſcope of his ſubtile practiſes, and operations in the World. And becauſe this point is exellently deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the learned pen of our gracious Souereigne, I will expreſſe it in his owne words. <hi>Babylon ſhall haue many that ſhall bee Merchants vnto her of the ſoules of men, by ſelling, for Money,</hi> PARDONS, <hi>giuen by that Monarch</hi> [the ſecond Beaſt] <hi>which ſhall bee thought to haue power to ſaue, redeeme, and free mens ſoules;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>Purgatorie.</hi> Wherefore it was truly affirmed in a Booke, compoſed by the Clergie of <hi>England,</hi> in the Reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, (vnto the which all the principall members of the Clergie did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; as by name, <hi>Gardiner,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Winton;</hi> and <hi>Boner,</hi> then Archdeacon of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> &amp;c.) that it was <hi>neceſſary, that ſuch abuſes bee cleerely put away, which vnder the name of Purgatorie, haue beene aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; as to make men beleeue, that, through the pardons of

               </p>
               <p>But ſince I ſhall haue occaſion anone to touch this <hi>ware,</hi> and other <hi>merchandizes</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> more neerely to the quick, let vs obſerue here by the way, what the learned paire of <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doth conceiue of this <hi>traffick;</hi> whether it may be taken in a Litteral, or in a Spirituall ſenſe; whether it may appertaine vnto the <hi>Church,</hi> or vnto the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>RIBERA commeth firſt in order; who, treating of theſe <hi>Merchants (in Apoc.</hi> 18.3.) ſpeaketh of <hi>their repaire vnto</hi> Babylon, <hi>to fill her with all varietie of things;</hi> and afterwards (<hi>in v.</hi> 11.) hee ſaith, that <hi>the Merchants ſhall weepe, and lament for the destruction of</hi> Rome, <hi>where they had ſo great negotiation, becauſe they can haue no more traffick in that great and opulent Citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIEGAS followeth, &amp; ſpeaketh more copiouſly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point; <hi>in Apoc.</hi> 18.3.

               <p>O <hi>fooles,</hi> and ſlow of heart, to beleeue that, which is ſo cleerely reuealed in the Scriptures; if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their prediction with the euent of things! For <hi>firſt,</hi> theſe Merchants are called the Merchants of <hi>Soules;</hi> as I noted before, vpon the point of <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeake more anone. With which <hi>ſpirituall</hi> merchandiſe we may ioyne many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their traffique; by <hi>diſpenſations, abſolutions, appellations, faculties, inuestitures,</hi> and many pretended intereſts of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> in a word, by their courts Legantine, by the diſcurſations of Legates, and Apoſtolicall officers, in Temporall, and Eccleſiaſticall eſtates; to the ſingular aduantage of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the negotiators of that Apoſtaticall See.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> it is extreamely improbable, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould become ſuch a <hi>Tyrus</hi> [ſuch <hi>a Mart of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Eſay</hi> 23.3.] as theſe men pretend; a place of ſuch traffique, and negotiation; it being, by ſituation, and want of conueniences, incapable of ſo great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as neither ſhee enioyed in the higheſt pride of her Paganicall eſtate, nor any Citie (if the Text be are purely a litterall ſenſe, in ſo many verſes;

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> it is morally impoſſible, that <hi>Rome</hi> in this future, imagined eſtate, ſhould increaſe to ſuch an immoderate, and vaſt power, as is deſcribed in this place; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.3. ALL NATIONS <hi>haue drunke of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; and</hi> THE KINGS OF THE EARTH [euen they that, <hi>chap.</hi> 17.3. gaue their power, and authoritie vnto the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beaſt] haue committed fornication with her; and</hi> THE MERCHANTS OF THE EARTH <hi>are waxen rich with the abundance of her pleaſures.</hi> This rare, and portentuous euent in <hi>Rome</hi> [after her Ethni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call eſtate; after her entertainment of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; as the Ieſuites confeſſe] doth require no ſmall <hi>extent of time,</hi> and <hi>opportunitie of meanes;</hi> ſuch <hi>time,</hi> and ſuch <hi>meanes,</hi> as cannot be found in this ſuppoſed pedling, merchandizing <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt; if you conſider the <hi>extent of time</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common iudgement, and generall conceit of theſe <hi>Babylonians,</hi> themſelues) you may palpably diſcouer the vanitie of their ſurmiſe. Vnderſtand therefore, and well obſerue; that, in their opinion (taken by them out of many Ancients; and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them out of ſome paſſages of the Scripture) the reigne of <hi>Antichrist</hi> is confined vnto the ſpace of three yeeres, and an halfe. Againe, conſider that, in their opinion, Antichriſt, and his adherents, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that, vntill the defection of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Pope, vpon this very time, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18730:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pope ſhall retaine this Citie, as the place of his <hi>Papall Seate;</hi> as being affixed vnto the ſame. See <hi>Bellarm. de Pont. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, ſince <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be <hi>Babylon</hi> againe, communicating her Idolatry <hi>to all Kings, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and ſhall haue <hi>a large Empire in the world,</hi> and there ſhall be the exerciſe of great traffique, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, by <hi>the Merchants of the earth,</hi> and ſhee ſhall attaine vnto an <hi>immenſitie of riches;</hi> may we not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that this new, and extraordinary condition of <hi>Rome</hi> doth require a good ſufficiencie of time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and effectuate ſuch an admirable euent? And yet, forſooth, <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not fall from the Pope, till vpon this very time; ſo that, after his departure (vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, or rather neceſſarily out of <hi>Rome;</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as they ſay, to become a <hi>Babylon</hi> againe) all theſe wonderfull effects muſt enſue in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the world; and yet all this muſt be done within a very little time (as you ſee) againſt all probabilitie of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all poſſibilitie of things; as you may eaſily diſcerne, by comparing one part of their ſuggeſtions with another; which are <hi>arena ſine calce,</hi> ſand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lime (as <hi>Caligula</hi> ſpake of the writings of <hi>Seneca</hi>) ſuppoſed points, without any coherence of ſemblable truth. But, in our apprehenſion of this Scripture, all points haue a faire, ſubſtantiall, and orderly connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for as much as <hi>Rome,</hi> being <hi>Babylon,</hi> vnder the Pope [who is her <hi>Second Beaſt;</hi> as the euents, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cleerely with the prediction, doe ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vnto our knowledge] hath therefore had not onely a ſpatious <hi>time,</hi> but a proper <hi>meanes</hi> alſo, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue, and performe ſuch ſtrange deſignes; <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18730:25"/>
IDOLATRY <hi>to the world,</hi> and <hi>to obtaine an Empire in the world,</hi> and <hi>to attaine great riches, and ſtate;</hi> and finally, to haue commerce with the world by her <hi>ſpirituall wares;</hi> wherewith ſhe doth intangle, and inſnare the world, by her artificiall deluſions; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the glorious veyle of APOSTOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CALL termes.</p>
               <p>Therefore, ſecondly; whereas an <hi>opportunitie of meanes</hi> is required in ſuch a rare ſucceſſe of things, the Babylonians themſelues are puzzeled to inuent ſome colourable deuice in this behalfe. Whence it is (as I noted before) that <hi>Ribera [in Apocal.</hi> 14. <hi>num.</hi> 51.] pondering deepely vpon this point, ſaith; <hi>I thinke that no mortall man can certainly know, by what meanes, Rome</hi> [in the end of the world] <hi>ſhould come vnto ſuch an incredible power, &amp;c. Notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>a man may, in ſome ſort, coniecture out of the words of the Apoſtle; Apocal.</hi> 17. <hi>where wee reade, that the purpled Whore ſitteth vpon a Beaſt, hauing ten hornes, in which are vnderſtood ten Kings, who ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, and diuide the whole world betwixt them. In their time ſhall Antichriſt reigne; whence I doe ſuſpect, that</hi> Rome, <hi>hauing caſt out the Pope, ſhal, in a ſhort time, reuert vnto her ancient power, ſo that ſhee ſhall haue thoſe tenne Kings vnder her gouernement,</hi> who, <hi>a little after, ſhall reigne in the whole earth.</hi> And yet theſe (forſooth) are alſo the ten Kings, that muſt finally deſtroy her with fire, and ſword. What probabilitie is in this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meanes, to produce ſuch prodigious effects, and that within ſo little time, let any man, endued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable capacity, with ingenuity, and with conſcience, conſider aduiſedly with himſelfe; &amp; he may perceiue,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18730:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that, as the Iewes, being conuinced out of the Old Teſtament, concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> haue certaine diuerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and poore euaſions, to eſcape the force of truth: ſo here this Ieſuite, being conuinced out of the New, touching <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the condition of <hi>Rome</hi> (masked in that name) will not ſee his owne <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is truely the <hi>Second Beaſt;</hi> to whom theſe ten Kings, long agoe, ſurrendered a great part of their Royall power (whereby <hi>Rome</hi> aſpired vnto ſuch dignitie in the world) and thence it is, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſuch a new Imperiall State, vnder the Papall Crowne, and by <hi>ſpirituall wares</hi> (belonging to the <hi>ſhop</hi> of a ſpirituall Monarch) hath traded ſo generally with many parts of the Chriſtian world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> wee may diſcerne the vaine conceit of their pretended Literall ſenſe, concerning this Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian Merchandize, becauſe they now change the coppie, and tenour of the very Text; which being Myſticall (as I noted before) and a Myſticall <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> vnderſtood therein, they run ſuddenly from the Myſterie to the Letter, from the Tree to the Barke; taking all now in an open, outward, obuious ſenſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the generall purport of this Booke, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of this place. And yet I deny not, but that <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſome vſe of Merchants, and merchandiſe in a Litterall ſenſe; to furniſh her Idolatrous Temples, her masking Maſſes, and thereby to commend her ſpectable vanities vnto men of popular iudgement, and of carnall hearts.</p>
               <p>And thus much, heere by the way, to diſſolue the knot, wherewith the Ieſuites would tye our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings vnto an apprehenſion of much <hi>temporall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18730:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
merchandize,</hi> which ſhall abound in <hi>Rome,</hi> for a few yeeres (or dayes rather) before her finall end; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the very end of the world.</p>
               <p>Now, therefore, I returne againe vnto a reueiw of the ſpirituall merchandize in <hi>Rome,;</hi> and particularly of INDVLGENCES; which are diſpenſed from this Apoſtolicall Seate alone; as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith <hi>in praefat. lib. de Pont. Rom. Vnde habemus Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum communicationem niſi ab hac ſede?</hi> Whence haue wee the communication of Indulgences, but from this Seate alone? What are theſe Indulgences? A relaxation of temporall paines, inflicted vpon ſoules in Purgatorie. Oh the falſhood of this execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble merchandize. Did the ancient Church of God ſo beleeue, and teach? No; not for a thouſand yeeres; Indulgences were then a relaxation only of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cenſures, inflicted vpon penitents, by the Church: and therefore <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> (the ſtudious collector of the whole ſumme of Religion; who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed vpon the yeere 1172.) made no mention of this great myſterie of Papall Indulgences; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little after, by the ſophiſtications of darke, and ſubtill Schoolemen; <hi>Roffenſis</hi> himſelfe confeſſing, that the vſe, and practiſe of them was lately receiued in the Church. And therefore you may obſerue, that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> (treating laſt of all, concerning <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which gaue occaſion of the publike, and iuſt diſceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) proceedeth not in this diſputation (as in the reſt) by that faire, and ingenious method; <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,</hi> by <hi>Fathers,</hi> by <hi>Reaſons</hi> framed out of the grounds of Scripture, and Religion) but, in a new, obſcure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18730:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
courſe; of <hi>Poſitions, Suppoſitions, Concluſions,</hi> vaine <hi>Opinions</hi> of darke, and obſcure Schoolemen, &amp;c. which made the learned Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> ſay, <hi>that, till hee ſaw this Treatiſe of Indulgences, hee tooke</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>to be a man of ſome conſcience, and that hee wrote out of his perſwaſion; but now hee conceiued of him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</hi> But I proceed, and haſten vnto a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this point. This Babylonian ware of <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> is that traffique of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby ſhee keepeth her intimate correſpondencie, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation with all her members, tying thereby their conſciences, by a ſecret, and ſtrong obligation, vnto the Pontificiall Seate; it being alſo of ſingular vſe in the manner of her proceedings. For, as this Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize is the daughter of many falſe doctrines [<hi>Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations: Merits,</hi> euen the hatefull, and dangerous merit of <hi>Condignitie:</hi> of an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall treaſure,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the merits of Chriſt, and alſo of the Saints; the ſame being more, then they were bound vnto, and therefore, being not rewarded vnto them in heauen, may bee communicated to the poore ſoules in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie; and the diſpenſation of this myſticall treaſure is committed vnto the Pope, by vertue of his keyes, &amp;c.] ſo it is the mother of many wicked practiſes, for the aduantage of their Church; as being the very bellowes, which blow the fire of treaſon againſt the Perſons, and States of Princes. This is the <hi>ware,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Babylon</hi> bewitcheth not onely priuate men, but great Kings; for her <hi>Merchants are the great men of the earth; Apocal.</hi> 18.3. Therefore infinite ſtore of this Babylonian trumperie was tranſported vnto the poore <hi>Indians,</hi> for the pretended benefit of their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18730:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſoules, but for the intended benefit of a Princes worldly eſtate. This is the <hi>ware,</hi> which <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth ſo freely, and bountifully diſpenſed for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſoules out of the <hi>Purgatorian</hi> fire (which keepeth warme the kitchin of his Holy-ſhip) in the compaſſion of his charitable heart, and fulneſſe of his Papall power. Said I <hi>freely?</hi> Forgiue mee this wrong: it was for the commoditie, and reliefe of his ſiſter <hi>Magdalen</hi> (as <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> a Popiſh Hiſtorian, doth relate; <hi>lib.</hi> 13.) who had her Factors to diſtract, and vent this Babyloniſh <hi>ware;</hi> whence <hi>Magdalen,</hi> the ſiſter, had the gaine, but <hi>Leo,</hi> the brother, had the loſſe; for, vpon this occaſion (no leſſe iuſt before God, then acceptable to the Chriſtian world) <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> began that courſe, which hath ſucceeded ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to the further diſcouery of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſcandall of her <hi>wares;</hi> for, ſince that time, her brocage hath ſuffered a great decay. Finally; this is that <hi>ware,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this merchandizing <hi>Babylon</hi> doth principally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in honour, authoritie, riches, and applauſe of the world; inebriated with ſuch incantations of her <hi>whoriſh cup,</hi> and deluded with the vaine hope of theſe miſerable helpes.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of the Pedlery of <hi>Meddalls, Beades, Graines, Holy Water, Images, certayne peculiar Churches, Chappels,</hi> and other places of blind deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? vnto which ſundry Pardons are appendant, as being the meanes, and inſtuments of Papall benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thereby to diſpenſe, and communicate Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnto poore, ſeduced ſoules; euen as certaine Fryers, receiuing temporall reliefe from their deuoted followers, pretend to communicate the merits of all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18730:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Saints</hi> of their owne order, vnto them for their helpe; and ſome, Lay-men, by wearing a <hi>Franciſcans</hi> Girdle, and vſing certaine Ceremonies (according to the Rites of the Papall Church) are made partakers of the merits of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and of all the brethren of that religious Order. All which, and many more <hi>Wares</hi> come, originally, out of the <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude then: vnto theſe Indulgences (ſome of them being for an hundred thouſand yeeres; ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall is the holy Father) I may adde other ſpirituall ware of <hi>Babylon;</hi> as of <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> (which is a ware of ſpeciall vertue, and force) but chiefly of <hi>Diſpenſations;</hi> which are ſometimes the diſſipations of diuine, and humane right; of naturall, and morall bands: as full of great preſumption againſt the Lawes of God, and Nature (to tye ſome Princes in vnlawfull Mariages, and to vntye many ſubiects from lawfull obedience) as of ſingular art, thereby to intangle Souereignes, and ſubiects, in the obedience of that predominant See, and to keepe them vnder the captiuitie of the Triple Crowne. Therefore the Pope doth greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his owne felicitie, when Princes (inſnared with the loue, or terrified with the greatneſſe, or oppreſſed by the power of this Apoſtaticall Seat) will humbly ſue vnto him for Diſpenſations, or accept ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fauours kindly at his hands; whereby hee gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ground vpon them ſtill, to keepe them more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely within the obedience of the Church; which they ſhall not dare to offend, without the perill of their liues, and ſtates.</p>
               <p>And now ſince this <hi>Romiſh</hi> ware is <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18730:28"/>
                  <hi>of the Church,</hi> and <hi>for ſoules</hi> (not temporall, not of the <hi>Citie,</hi> and for this life) I conclude the ſecond proofe of my aſſertion; namely, that this <hi>Babylon,</hi> in my Text, is the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Papall Rome,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiasticall Rome,</hi> wherein the greateſt Monarch doth reigne (next vnder the King of Heauen) aboue all the Kings of the Earth; as we know by their owne pretenſes, challenges, doctrines, and vſurpations in this behalfe. And ſo I proceed vnto a new, and the third proofe of my ſaid aſſertion.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, therefore, I proue my aſſertion, to be true, becauſe the whole World (as the Ieſuites ſay; perhaps they meane the <hi>Romane World,</hi> according to the phraſe of Scripture; <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.1. and the ſenſe of the ancient Fathers: or ſome great part thereof, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Europe</hi>) ſhall bee vnder the gouernment of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo ſhe ſhall make a generall communication of her <hi>Idolatry</hi> vnto the ſame. Now, in this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie of the World vpon <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall reference of Nations vnto her, how can this be verified of the <hi>Citie?</hi> How ſhould the Citie arriue vnto ſuch a large Dominion in the World, and, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in ſo little a time, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe? You haue heard the difficultie propoſed late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Ribera</hi> himſelfe; and how hee reſolueth it, by a poore coniecture. But the truth is cleere, and eaſily ſeene, where God doth open the eye; namely, that <hi>Rome</hi> had this generall Dominion once, in, and by her <hi>Imperiall</hi> State; not onely vnder the Emperours (ſucceeding <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi>) but while the <hi>dignitie</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> remayned in the Senate, and the <hi>authoritie</hi> in the people. During this Imperiall State, <hi>Rome recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18730:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Idolatry from all Nations;</hi> as <hi>Leo</hi> (ſometimes Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) doth ſpeake; <hi>Serm.</hi> 1. <hi>in Natal. Petri &amp; Pauli:</hi> and the ciuill Stories of <hi>Liuie, Plutarch,</hi> and others doe ſufficiently declare, how ambitious, rather then zealous, or how ſenſeleſſe, rather then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, the old Ethnicall <hi>Rome</hi> was, in bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Gods, and extraneous Idolatrie into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, for the publike honour, and ſafetie of that blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Citie. Therefore <hi>Rome</hi> had once her <hi>Pantheon;</hi> a Temple of all the Gods; conuerted ſince into a Church of <hi>all the Saints.</hi> This former Dominion was loſt, this imperiall State was diſſolued; but behold a <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> (of whome I haue ſpoken much before, but you ſhall heare more fully of him anon) entring, by little and little, into, and vpon the place of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with a pretenſe of greater authoritie, carried with a new forme, and vnder another colour; and, in this <hi>Papall State, Rome</hi> hath ſent, and communicated her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries vnto the World: <hi>hauing a cup of gold in her hands, full of abomination, and filthineſſe of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation [Apoc.</hi> 18.4.] which ſhe doth not now receiue from others (as in her Ethnicall condition) but others receiue it from her, by her Papall incantations, and by the venditation of her ſacred power.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that <hi>Babylon</hi> hath ſuch dominion in the World; <hi>extenſiuè;</hi> by ſuch a large dilatation; and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiué,</hi> by ſo ſtrong an operation thereof. Therefore <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13.11. the ſecond beaſt appeared like <hi>a Lambe;</hi> as the Pope entred vpon this dominion, with a faire pretenſe of a Catholike Paſtor, a Succeſſour of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> a Vicar of Chriſt, &amp;c. and hee had <hi>two hornes;</hi> which word <hi>[horne]</hi> ſignifieth <hi>power,</hi> very frequently
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18730:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Scripture: ſo that his <hi>two hornes</hi> are indeed <hi>two powers,</hi> which this ſecond Beaſt [with his humble ſtile of <hi>Seruus ſeruorum Dei</hi>] doth pretend; whence <hi>Babylon</hi> hath gained ſo great authoritie, and venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> power, which he did originally pretend, was onely <hi>Spirituall;</hi> the power of the KEYES: and therefore the Pope doth arrogate all this power, in the whole Church, vnto himſelfe; and ſaith, that, from him, it is deriued vnto the inferiour Paſtors there of; as the power of <hi>Order,</hi> and the power of <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> which all Biſhops, and others in the Cleargie, hold immediately, or mediately, from his Apoſtolicall feate, as the true, proper, and onely fountaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. From hence all Diſpenſations doe flow: to it all Appellations doe tend: ſhe hath all fulneſſe of power from Chriſt; others haue a part of it from her: nay, (if we may beleeue her principall Doctors) her <hi>Peter</hi> gaue their Paſtorall authoritie vnto the other Apoſtles (elſe <hi>Rome</hi> could not be the <hi>Mother-church,</hi> in <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> iudgement; <hi>de Rom. Pont. l.</hi> 1. c. 23.) and therefore as all Eccleſiaſticall power was deduced onely from S. <hi>Peter</hi> at the firſt, ſo now it is deduced onely from his perſonall Succeſſours, in this Apoſtolicall ſeate.</p>
               <p>Now, vnto this <hi>Spirituall power</hi> in the Church, they ſubiect all temporall power in the State (as I will preſently declare) as being of greater excellencie, and vertue. And it is true indeed, that the ſpirituall power of the Church excelleth the temporall in the State: but how? <hi>ratione finis;</hi> becauſe the end of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches power, is eternall life; and <hi>ratione medij;</hi> becauſe the courſes, whereby ſhee worketh, are ſpirituall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18730:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meanes; namely, ſuch as are contained in the Word of God, conducing vnto this end. But yet this her ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power excelleth not the temporall power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in dominion, command, ſublimitie, and glorie; which are properly appendant to their Crownes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond power, which <hi>Babylon</hi> doth challenge by her ſecond Beaſt, is <hi>Temporall;</hi> which her Popes haue affected with many inſinuations, and ſometimes with open vendication thereof: and her neereſt friends aduance it with the beſt art, which wit, and learning can miniſter in this behalfe. And certainly this is the opinion, which daily increaſeth in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and which they will indeuour to ſupport with might, and mayne; though ſome, more moderate, <hi>Babylonians</hi> doe not yet giue way vnto this higheſt Antichriſtian courſe. For I finde three ſeuerall Opinions in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon this point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>first</hi> giueth all temporall dominion direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the Pope, as the principall Souereigne of the World; from whom all Princes dependently hold their Crownes. Theſe are true <hi>Babylonians</hi> indeed; but all ſuch are <hi>actuall</hi> Traytors, againſt the dignitie, and ſupreame honour of the Crownes of Princes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they liue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> giueth all ſpirituall power (not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall) to the Pope; but yet <hi>indirectly</hi> drawing on a temporall power ouer Princes; <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia, in ordine ad Deum, &amp;c. viz.</hi> that the Pope may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an hereticall, or an irregular Prince, from his Crowne, as hauing authoritie ouer him, in this caſe, to depriue him of his eſtate. All ſuch <hi>Babylonians</hi> are <hi>habituall</hi> Traytors; diſpoſed, and alwayes reſolued; in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18730:30"/>
preparation of heart, to execute any Papall ſentence of depoſition, as far as they can, againſt their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Lords, and Souereigne Princes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> opinion (denying the ſecond of theſe, as the ſecond denieth the firſt) giueth a meere ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall authoritie vnto the Pope, to excommunicate a Prince, for his correction, and ſaluation, and to bring him to a penitent ſubmiſſion vnto God, and his Church; but without any ſuch temporall effect, as the ſecond opinion doth inforce. And hence it is, that <hi>the Oath of Alleageance</hi> in this Kingdome, ſo wiſely deuiſed, and neceſſarily enacted, though it ſubuert, and contradict the firſt, and ſecond Opinions, yet it leaueth this laſt, and third Opinion vntouched, neither affirming, nor denying it, becauſe all moderate Papiſts, that treate of the Popes power (as namely Doctor <hi>Barkley,</hi> and the more milde <hi>Babylonians</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) denying it in the firſt, and ſecond degree, doe yet conſtantly affirme it in the third. But theſe men find leaſt grace in <hi>Babylon</hi> (which is more delighted with the ſecond Opinion, and chiefly with the firſt) and therefore we ſee that, as the firſt groweth daily more ſtrong in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo the ſecond hath lately gotten more aduantage in <hi>France</hi> (in the minoritie of the King) by the ſubtile Oration of <hi>Cardinall Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi> which our moſt excellent Souereigne hath cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted by his diuine, and learned Pen.</p>
               <p>To conclude, now, the third proofe of my aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you may perceiue that the large Dominion of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which the Ieſuits truly find in <hi>Rome;</hi> but falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceiue it to be there within a very little time one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before her ruine) doth appertaine vnto the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18730:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
CHVRCH, and not vnto the <hi>Citie;</hi> but ſo far forth, as it is the place, wherein the Pope doth reigne; ſo that, in it, his Succeſſors muſt continue (euen vntill the time of Antichriſt; when they ſhall be expelled out of the confines thereof) and there they ſhall exerciſe their domination, not onely with Saint <hi>Peters Keyes,</hi> but alſo with his two <hi>Swords.</hi> This is the power of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which the <hi>Reuelation</hi> doth truly foretell, and which theſe Ieſuites could not diſcerne therein. But as humane reaſon diſapproueth their idle conceits, and naked coniectures, ſo certaine experience, ioyned with diuine prediction, doth confirme our aſſertion in this point. And ſo I come vnto a fourth, and a more important, proofe thereof.</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY, therefore, I proue it, out of the conformitie betwixt the prediction of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Reuelation of Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> both contayning one ſenſe of matter, vnder different forme of words; the point it ſelfe being one, as proceeding from one Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, it is the prediction of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that Antichriſt ſhall be <hi>reuealed,</hi> and deſtroyed, before the great Day of the generall Iudgement (2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.) which ſeemeth to enſue not long after the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that glorious worke. In like manner, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Reuelation, paſſeth from the deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> (vnder the name of <hi>Babylon: cap.</hi> 18.) vnto a deſcription of the new <hi>Ieruſalem (cap.</hi> 21.) following the ruine of the new, and ſecond <hi>Babylon</hi> (nothing being interuenient betwixt theſe two, but the gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Saints, for the fall of <hi>Rome, cap.</hi> 19. and a briefe recapitulation, made of things paſt; <hi>cap.</hi> 20.)

and ſo hee proceedeth immediately vnto the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this preſent world, <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth farther aſſure vs (2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.) that Antichriſt ſhall be <hi>diſcloſed,</hi> before hee be deſtroyed; which ſheweth, that hee had an exiſtencie before his diſcouerie; and that hee ſhould grow, by <hi>a myſterie</hi> [2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7.] vnto his greatneſſe, before hee bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Therefore Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> according with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> telleth vs [<hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.5.] that <hi>Babylon</hi> had a name written in her forehead, and it was a <hi>Myſterie.</hi> A great <hi>myſterie,</hi> indeed, that the <hi>ſucceſſour of a Fiſherman</hi> (as <hi>Hierome</hi> calleth him, writing vnto <hi>Damaſus</hi>) ſhould aſpire, by little, and by little, vnto ſuch an immenſitie of power, that Kings are his vaſſalls, and that, his owne Lord being finally depriued of his Imperiall Seate, this <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould enter vpon it, and exerciſe the old power vnder a new name.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> goeth forward, and informeth vs, that Antichriſt cannot be diſcloſed, nor aduance himſelfe vnto that eminencie, wherein hee ſhall excell all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the earth, vntill the ſupreame power of the <hi>Romane Emperours</hi> were taken away. For that power was then the chiefeſt, and therefore it kept downe the Papall Dominion, and reſtrayned the growth of the Pope; for Antichriſt could not be lifted vp, till the Emperour was caſt downe. This is the cleere, and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent purpoſe of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe words; HEE, <hi>which now withholdeth, ſhall firſt bee taken out of the way: and then that wicked man</hi> [Antichriſt] <hi>ſhall bee reuealed;</hi> for two ſuch powers could not conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at one time, in the Imperiall Seate. That this <hi>withholder</hi> was the <hi>Romane Emperour,</hi> the very tenour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18730:136"/>
of the Text it ſelfe doth beare it; and the ſucceſſe of things doth giue witneſſe thereunto; and this was the common expoſition of the ancient Doctors; as namely, of Saint <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> vpon the very place; of Saint <hi>Hierome; Epiſt.</hi> 151. <hi>quaest.</hi> 11. and, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, of <hi>Tertullian; de Reſurrect. cap.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>Thus the Chriſtians had a preſcience touching the period, and expiration of the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> which the Pagans conceiued to be <hi>Eternall;</hi> and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deliuered this dangerous point in ſecret, and obſcure termes, leaſt the publike notice thereof ſhould miniſter cauſe of perſecution againſt the Church; as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth collect.</p>
               <p>But let vs obſerue the words of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> for they containe a point of ſpeciall note. <hi>Quis</hi> (ſaith he) who is this that doth <hi>withhold?</hi> Hee anſwereth; <hi>Romanus ſtatus;</hi> the Romane, and Imperiall State. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as by the word HEE [<hi>He,</hi> that withholdeth] S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not vnderſtand an <hi>indiuiduall perſon,</hi> not <hi>Nero</hi> (who was then liuing) but a <hi>ciuill State,</hi> which had a ſucceſſion of Emperours therein,; ſo, by this word, THE <hi>man of ſinne;</hi> THE <hi>aduerſary, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not vnderſtand ſome <hi>one particular perſon,</hi> but <hi>a State</hi> (and a State <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> as wee ſhall ſee anon) hauing a ſucceſſion of Potentates (<hi>viz. Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſucceeding in the Imperiall Seate (when the Emperour was taken away) and exerciſing ſupreame dominion therein. Thus farre Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted vs in the interpretation of <hi>this Babylon;</hi> that, by his prediction, wee might certainely vnderſtand, that this name agreeth vnto the Papall, and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call eſtate, ſucceeding vnto the Imperiall, in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:18730:137"/>For <hi>he, which withheld, being taken away, Antichriſt will appeare;</hi> and before, hee cannot (for two ſuch great powers cannot ſtand at once) and afterward, he ſhall immediately ariſe; for ſo, in the decourſe of all ages in the world, as one ſupreame power (in the foure Monarchies) did decay, ſo another did preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt it ſelfe. Now, ſince <hi>Hee, that withheld, is taken away</hi> (to wit, the Romane Emperour, or <hi>Romanus ſtatus,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh: for that, which now remaineth, is titular, rather then reall; ſcarce a member of the ancient bodie: and alſo the Pope ſitteth aboue this Romane Empire; as tranſlated into <hi>Germany</hi> by his meanes; and as a creature of his ordination; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, being by the Pope, and true Papalls, reputed, and ſtiled no other, then <hi>Electus,</hi> or an incomplete probationer, till conſecrated, and inaugurated, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by him: and ſo a vaſſall, and a ſubiect vnto the Papall power) therefore, <hi>by the doctrine of S. Paul,</hi> that high, great, and glorious State, which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeded vnto the diſſolued Empire, is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian;</hi> he, that holdeth it, is Antichriſt; and that <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he ſitteth, is conſequently <hi>Babylon;</hi> and therefore, finally, this <hi>Babylon</hi> in my Text is not the <hi>Citie</hi> alone, but the <hi>Church</hi> alſo, or Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the Pope is aduanced (after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) as the higheſt Potentate in the earth.</p>
               <p>And if the Pope be not the <hi>man</hi> (to wit, <hi>the man of ſinne;</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) or rather the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (as you ſhall heare by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) that entred vpon the Imperiall Seate, and Dignitie; who is that <hi>Man,</hi> or who is that <hi>Beast?</hi> For ſome one, or other wee muſt find, ſince <hi>hee, that withheld, is taken out of the way,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:18730:137"/>
ſo long before our time. If any man ſuppoſe, that the TVRK is that <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which appeared vpon the decadencie of the Romane Empire, I anſwere; no: hee is not the <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of whom wee now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe Antichriſt, ſucceeding in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, was to ſit <hi>in the Temple of God;</hi> ſo did not the Turk; but ſo doth the Pope, namely, <hi>in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> or rather <hi>ſupra Eccleſiam.</hi> Secondly, becauſe Antichriſt ſhould poſſeſſe <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Seat, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Empire; ſo doth not the Turk; but ſo doth the Pope; not by a donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> but by his inſinuation into that glorious Citie. Thirdly; becauſe Antichriſt ought to extoll himſelfe, if not in all, yet in the moſt principall, and eſſentiall parts of the Romane Empire; ſo doth not the Turk: but ſo doth the Pope; in <hi>Italy, Spaine, France, Germany, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</hi> ſo he did in <hi>England;</hi> but ſo he ſhall doe no more: ſo is my prayer, and ſo is my hope. Fourthly, and laſtly; the moſt generall, and approued opinion of the learned Doctors, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empteth the Turke from the ſcandall, and infamous name of that <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which is here intended by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And therefore, whereas <hi>Feuardentius</hi> (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the erroneous conceits of ſome leſſe iudicious Romaniſts) inclined ſtrongly vnto their fancie, that impute this crime vnto the <hi>Turke,</hi> hee was cenſured amongſt his owne Catholike brethren, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull manner; <hi>the opinion of</hi> Feuardentius <hi>is not onely falſe, but dangerous; and the authors, whom hee alledgeth, neuer thought, nor wrote any ſuch matter. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uard. annot. in Irenaeum. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>Since therefore the Pope is truely that man of ſin,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18730:138"/>
who appeared, in his ſuperlatiue power, vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Romane Emperour (for thence wee inforce, by the verſe words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is come; euen as the Chriſtians proue, againſt the Iewes, that Chriſt came long agoe, becauſe the <hi>Scepter departed from Iudah;</hi> and then the Meſſiah was to be borne, according to the prophecie of <hi>Iacob</hi>) wee may conclude, that the <hi>Babylon,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee ſitteth, is <hi>Rome;</hi> not the <hi>Citie</hi> alone, but the <hi>Church,</hi> which ſeemeth to be entayled vnto that fatall place, in the iudgement of her chiefeſt Doctors. Thus farre out of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and now we come vnto Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly then, this prediction of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is a fitting key to open the viſions of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; <hi>in cap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. For, in his thirteenth Chapter, hee had a viſion of <hi>two diſtinct beaſts;</hi> the very ſame, which wee haue alreadie ſeene in the prophecie of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Behold therefore the deſcription of theſe Beaſts; and yet firſt vnderſtand (I pray you) what the name of BEAST doth generally purport, as well in this Reuelation of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> as in the prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> (whereof alſo I am now to take ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notice) namely <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Foure great Beaſts</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>came vp from the Sea.</hi> Euery word hath weight, as I will ſhew you in the retrograded order of the Text. They came from the great SEA; ſignifying, that the conuerſions of publike States ſhould bring great troubles, and perturbations in the world. They <hi>came vp;</hi> or aſcended: for the great Monarchies had ſmall beginnings, and were aduanced vnto a very high eſtate. They are <hi>Beaſts;</hi> for theſe Monarchies did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18730:138"/>
with furie and violence, enter, increaſe, and gouerne in the earth. Laſtly; they are <hi>foure;</hi> whereof the laſt is the <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchy, thus characterized, and marked by <hi>Daniel; v.</hi> 7. <hi>The fourth Beaſt was fearefull, and terrible, and very ſtrong, &amp;c. and it had ten hornes;</hi> which, in the twentie fourth verſe, are interpreted <hi>ten Kings;</hi> for the Romane Monarchie had a various, and difforme gouernment; of different nature, from all precedent Monarchies; till the <hi>Caeſars</hi> (who are here called the <hi>little horne</hi>) roſe vp; who, ſubduing a great part of their ſtrength, drew the principalitie vnto themſelues, and erected the Monarchie in their owne perſons: and this is the true, genuine, and proper interpretation of that text. Now I returne vnto Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The FIRST <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did ſee; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal.</hi> 13.11. &amp;c. is the ſame Romane Monarchie; and expreſſed in this manner; <hi>A Beaſt aroſe out of the Sea, hauing ſeuen heads, and ten hornes, &amp;c.</hi> and then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the perſecution, raiſed by this Beaſt, againſt the Church of God. This Beaſt was certainely the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire; which, in the <hi>publike</hi> gouernment (by the Senate, and by the people) and in the <hi>priuate</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward (by one perſon) was ſtill <hi>one,</hi> and the ſame Beaſt (hauing indeed <hi>ten hornes</hi> at the firſt; till, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>one little horne</hi> carried the ſway, when it grew vnto great power) that reuelled in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineered in the world; by whoſe Edicts, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the Chriſtians, ſo generally for many yeeres, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered cruell deaths, and horrible tortures, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When this Tragedie was ended, and that this firſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18730:34"/>
                  <hi>Beast</hi> (though now growne more milde, and tamed by the knowledge of the true Faith) beganne after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards daily to decline from his greatneſſe (and, at the laſt, to bee <hi>taken out of the way;</hi> according to the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) then began a SECOND <hi>Beaſt, to come vp out of the earth; Apocal.</hi> 13.11. that is to ſay, ſome other great, and principall Potentate (for ſo the word <hi>Beaſt</hi> importeth here, as it doth in <hi>Daniel</hi> before) began to reare vp himſelfe; and therefore is here ſaid to <hi>come vp;</hi> as hauing an inchoation, and then an augmentation of his power; and it is, not without cauſe, ſaid here, that he came out of the <hi>earth</hi> (whereas the former Beaſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. came out of the <hi>Sea;</hi> as the other three Beaſts alſo did; <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.4.) becauſe, as hee is contrary to Chriſt (who came from heauen) ſo hee hath a different entrance into the world, from the former Beaſt (with Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw) and from the other three (which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw) becauſe thoſe foure <hi>Beasts</hi> had a tumultuous, violent, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome beginning of their Empires; which came, as it were, out of a raging <hi>Sea;</hi> but this <hi>Second Beast</hi> (here in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) hath a quiet, ſecret, peaceable aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as it were out of the <hi>earth</hi>) comming vp with the milde aſpect of a <hi>Lamb;</hi> not ſuddenly aduancing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (like the other Beaſts) with terror, but <hi>cunningly inſinuating himſelfe into the hearts, and affections of men</hi> (as <hi>Ribera</hi> doth well expound this place) and is therefore well ſaid, to come vp out <hi>of the earth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being little, &amp; meane at the firſt (in compariſon of his future glorie) hee doth afterward attaine vnto a ſpeciall, and extraordinary power in the world euen, <hi>to doe all, which the firſt Beast could doe before him,</hi> v. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18730:34"/>Marke now this paſſage well. It doth appeare, that the <hi>First Beast (viz.</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſtate) <hi>was now taken out of the way.</hi> How doth that appeare? Becauſe this <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> did all, which <hi>the former could doe before him;</hi> therefore the former was gone; that is to ſay, the great Imperiall power of <hi>Rome</hi> was now decayed, and another aroſe vp after it, in as great dignitie, and power, as the other did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Theſe two Potentates [the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Beaſt] ſtood not together in their greatneſſe: two Sunnes ſhine not in one firmament: and the Pope did well eſpy this, when he compared the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire to the Moone, and the <hi>Romane</hi> Papacy to the Sunne; as being of greater excellencie; ſo that the Empire had her light from it, and loſt her light before it; as being not able to ſhine in the glorious preſence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this is true indeed: for, O thou poore Empire of <hi>Germany;</hi> what art thou before the conſpect, and ſhining light of the mightie Papacie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which leaueth thee an emptie Title, and poſſeſſeth the full power thereof? But I proceed.</p>
               <p>It doth now alſo appeare farther; that this <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> (who could not aſpire vnto the proportion of his greatneſſe, during the conſiſtencie of the former) is mounted vp into the Imperiall Dignitie, and Seate, (but after the expiration of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire; for that <hi>Beast</hi> is gone; that ſupreame power is aboliſhed) as he hath inuaded his Dominion, <hi>to doe all, that the other could doe before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you aske how this came to paſſe? I anſwere; not by Sword, not by Conqueſt, not by forcible meanes; (for this Beaſt came out of <hi>the earth;</hi> in a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18730:35"/>
more meeke, and meane faſhion; and like a Lambe) but by a faire pretenſe of his <hi>Euangelicall Keyes;</hi> which afterwards became no leſſe powerfull then <hi>Swords,</hi> and <hi>two Swords [ſpirituall</hi> power; which was the firſt horne that grew; and then <hi>temporall</hi> power; which was the ſecond horne, annexed vnto the former: both which Powers they vnderſtand in the <hi>two Swords, Luc.</hi> 22.38.] and then the Beaſt, that appeared with the hornes of a Lambe before, <hi>ſpake like a Dragon</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) with the voice of blaſphemie; being now growne vp vnto high eſtimation, reuerently, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſly intertayned in the World. All this falleth cleerely, and irrefutably vpon the Pope, and vpon the Pope alone; as beeing the next great, and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Potentate, ariſing vpon the decay of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall State.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the moſt excellent Maieſtie of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King <hi>Iames</hi> doth prudently, and truly obſerue, concerning this SECOND BEAST; that <hi>it is the falſe, and hypocriticall Church, which doth exerciſe all the power of the former Beaſt: it teacheth the Kings of this Monarchie, and of this Seate, by what meanes they ſhall allure, and compell the people to obey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, &amp;c. It ſhall perſwade them, that this hereticall Monarchie ought for conſcience ſake to be obeyed, by all perſons, in whatſoeuer it commandeth, as if it could not erre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> doe import, really, but one thing: for the dignitie of this Church ariſeth from the Pope: and therefore hee is called alſo <hi>the Church;</hi> as wee ſhall ſee hereafter. Meane while wee obſerue, that this ſecond, or <hi>Papall</hi> Beaſt in <hi>Rome</hi> hath
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18730:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the authoritie of the former (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Imperiall</hi>) but vnder another title, in another kind, and carried with another courſe. Wherefore this <hi>Babylon,</hi> in my Text, being the ſeate, wherein this <hi>ſecond Beaſt (the ſpirituall Monarch)</hi> doth reigne, as the moſt puiſſant, and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lord in all the earth, I conclude now the third proofe of my aſſertion, as well by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> heere, as by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before; that the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> doth not extend meerely vnto the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites doe pretend) but vnto <hi>Eccleſiasticall Rome;</hi> as it is gouerned, and ſwayed by the POPE; vſurping the place, dignitie, and ſuperioritie of the <hi>former Beaſt</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>Now I come, in a word, or two, vnto the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> where wee reade of <hi>a Beaſt,</hi> vnto whom the ten Kings (ariſing neere vpon the time of his aduancement) gaue their power, but afterward God inclineth them to worke the finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein this <hi>Beaſt</hi> doth reigne. This Beaſt is certainly the great Antichriſt, as the Text doth inforce, and the Ieſuites doe confeſſe: the queſtion therefore is; whether this Beaſt be the ſame, heere, with the SECOND BEAST before; for if he be not the ſame, then that ſecond Beaſt is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; and, conſequently, the <hi>Pope</hi> (whom we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be that ſecond Beaſt) is not Antichriſt; as we conceiue him to be.</p>
               <p>I anſwere therefore, that this <hi>Beaſt (Cap.</hi> 17. 12, 13.) is the very ſame with the ſecond Beaſt; <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. 11. whoſe exaltation, and qualitie is deſcribed heere in more preciſe, and ample tearmes, then before. For heere wee ſee his gradation, how hee came to ſo great
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18730:36"/>
power; it was by the meanes of the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> who ſubmitted a part of their dignitie vnto him; but, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Babylon</hi> (wherein the Beaſt doth reigne) ſhall come vnto her ruine by theſe <hi>ten Kings;</hi> the ſame, not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>Now it is apparant, that the <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (ſucceeding the Emperour) beeing the ſecond Beaſt, in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> (as I declared before) muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the Beaſt in this ſeuenteeenth Chapter; who is the Antichriſt, reigning in <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Kings; ſo that theſe <hi>three</hi> are all <hi>one</hi> indeed. For the Beaſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. beeing Antichriſt, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> man of ſinne; <hi>reuealed,</hi> when the Emperour was <hi>taken out of the way:</hi> and this I haue proued to be the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Emperour, then, being the <hi>firſt Beaſt (Apocal.</hi> 13.1.) it followeth neceſſarily, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beast Verſe</hi> 11. And ſo, laſtly, it enſueth by cleere, and euident deduction, that the ſecond Beaſt (<hi>Cap.</hi> 13. 11.) is the ſame with this Beaſt (<hi>Cap.</hi> 17. 12.) the <hi>Pope</hi> (or Papall Empire) being ſignified, and intended in both; ſo that ſtill, this <hi>Babylon,</hi> in my Text, is <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall Rome;</hi> the ſeate of that SECOND BEAST.</p>
               <p>If any man ſay (and it is the onely cauill, which they can pretend) that the <hi>firſt Beaſt (Apoc.</hi> 13.1.) is the ſame with this Beaſt (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.3.) becauſe that firſt beaſt is deſcribed with <hi>ſeuen heads, and ten hornes (Apoc.</hi> 13.1.) and ſo is this Beaſt alſo; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.3. I anſwere; that the <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> (which is certainly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall <hi>Rome</hi> in her Ciuill ſtate) hath great conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in power, and dominion, with this Beaſt, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18730:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo is the very ſame with the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> before) and therefore this Beaſt heere (<hi>Cap.</hi> 17. 3.) is deſcribed much according to the ſame faſhion, with the ſaid firſt Beaſt; becauſe of the reſemblance, and ſimilitude, which this doth carrie of that; hauing a like ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, a like ſouereigntie, <hi>doing all, that the ſaid firſt beaſt could do</hi> (as it is ſaid preciſely of the <hi>ſecond Beaſt; Apoc.</hi> 13.12. being the ſame with this) and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſincere profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion, as the firſt alſo did perſecute the Chriſtian Martyrs: and as the firſt Beaſt had ten hornes (euen as <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo did foretell in the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire) ſo this Beaſt (which is Antichriſt) hath ten Kings, by whoſe ſubiection he doth ſupport his dominion; and, by their ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, doth reigne powerfull, and ſhall continue in great honour, till theſe Kings (withdrawing their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from the <hi>Beaſt</hi>) ſhall alſo conſume his ſeate; which is the true, naturally, vnforced, and certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this Scripture. So that the ſimilitude of their ſeuen heads, and tenne hornes, doth no more prooue the ſaid <hi>first Beaſt (Apoc.</hi> 13.1.) to be the ſame with this Beaſt (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.3.) then that the firſt Beaſt is the ſame with the <hi>Dragon;</hi> who is alſo ſaid to haue <hi>ſeuen heads, and ten hornes;</hi> as it is <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.3. Finally obſerue; that if the ſaid <hi>first Beaſt (Apoc.</hi> 13.1.) bee <hi>Antichrist</hi> (and ſo be the ſame with the Beaſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.) then it followeth, that after <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (whom yet the Papiſts hold to bee the laſt Potentate in the earth; and to reigne but three yeeres, and an halfe) another <hi>Beast,</hi> or another Potentate, muſt ariſe; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as great authoritie, and power as the firſt; for ſo it is ſaid; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.11, 12. <hi>I ſaw another Beaſt:</hi> and this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18730:37"/>
ſecond Beaſt did all, that the firſt could doe; which conſequence ſtandeth not (as you ſee) with their poſition.</p>
               <p>It remayneth therefore ſtill (and ſo ſhall it euer be) moſt cleere, moſt conformable to all reaſon, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as a point moſt fairely deduced, without any difficultie, or abſurditie) that ſince the Pope reigneth thus in <hi>Babylon</hi> (vpon the excluſion of the Emperour, and decay of the Empire) therefore this <hi>Babylon</hi> is not the <hi>Citie</hi> alone, but Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is the ſeate of the Pope; aduanced, and bearing rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; according to the Prediction of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Viſion of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> both concurring (as you may euidently perceiue) in one, and the ſame iſſue; which being of ſpeciall importance, I haue therefore inſiſted very long vpon it; and ſo I haſten vnto the fift proofe of my aſſertion, wherewith I will ſpeedily conclude this whole point, and, with it, the firſt part of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>FIFTLY then, and laſtly, I proue my aſſertion to be true, in regard of the markeable corruptions, and abominations in <hi>Rome;</hi> for which ſhee ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the iuſt, and ſeuere iudgement of God; as <hi>Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Viegas,</hi> doe both confeſſe, vpon the certaine, and indubious euidence of the ſacred Text. Since therefore all the iniquities, and impieties, for which <hi>Rome</hi> deſerueth the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this Scripture, are pregnantly, and notoriouſly found in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> or <hi>Papall Rome</hi> (as I will demonſtrate in the next, and ſecond part of this Sermon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhall behold the ſimilitude betwixt the two <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons;</hi> the Mother in Eaſt, and the Daughter in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18730:37"/>
Weſt; the <hi>literall,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirituall</hi>) and ſince the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God will puniſh <hi>Babylonian Rome,</hi> in her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and latter condition (after her Ethnicall eſtate is paſt) becauſe, in this latter condition, ſhe will imitate the wickedneſſe of <hi>Rome</hi> in her former, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Babylon</hi> againe (as theſe Ieſuites inferre out of the Text) and indeed ſhe is now, and long hath beene, ſuch a <hi>Babylon</hi> in regard of theſe iniquities (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall preſently intreat) therefore <hi>Eccleſiasticall,</hi> or <hi>Papall Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon;</hi> truely to bee ſtiled with that name, and iuſtly to be deſtroyed for that cauſe.</p>
               <p>The impieties, to be found in <hi>Babylon,</hi> are found in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Rome:</hi> how can ſhe, then, auoid her ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; but that ſhee is <hi>Babylon?</hi> or how can ſhee eſcape her ruine; but that ſhe ſhall <hi>fall?</hi> as the Angell doth heere proclaime; <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen,</hi> Babylon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus now, at the length, I haue finiſhed the fourth, and laſt interpretation of this name <hi>[Babylon]</hi> being the <hi>ſubiect</hi> of my Text, and contayning the <hi>ſinne</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as <hi>Salomon</hi> aſcended, by ſeuerall ſteps, vnto his Royall Throne, ſo, by certaine gradations, we haue paſſed, from one point vnto another, till we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued vnto the true, certaine, and indiſputable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this myſticall name; which, in many Ages, hath ſo much exerciſed the wit of many learned men.</p>
               <p>FIRST; ſome conceiued, that this name was impoſed vpon the generall ſocietie of the wicked: but we haue prooued that it doth belong vnto a particular place.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; ſome conceiued that this particular place is <hi>Rome</hi> indeed; howbeit in her Ethnicall eſtate onely, which is paſt long ſince: but we haue prooued that it is <hi>Rome</hi> in another eſtate alſo, ſucceeding after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18730:38"/>
the Ethnicall, by the teſtimonie of learned Ieſuits, founded vpon the plaine, and certaine ſenſe of this holy Writ.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY; whereas they lay the ſcandall of this name, and crime thereof, vpon the <hi>Citie</hi> alone (but not vpon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) and vpon the Citie alſo, after her defection from the Pope (but not before) therefore we haue prooued, that this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call name belongeth truly, and properly vnto <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall,</hi> or <hi>Papall Rome,</hi> according to the preſent condition, wherein ſhe continueth, after many Ages, and ſhall ſo remayne, vntill her dolefull ruine. In a word then: this BABYLON is <hi>Rome,</hi> and no other place: it is <hi>Rome</hi> in her <hi>preſent</hi> condition alſo, and not onely <hi>paſt:</hi> it is <hi>Rome,</hi> not onely in regard of the <hi>Citie,</hi> fallen from the Pope, but as it is the <hi>Papall Seat,</hi> and flouriſhing vnder the <hi>Pope;</hi> whoſe power ſhall one day fall with her glorie; the <hi>Whore</hi> being burnt with fire, and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> being deſtroyed by the vnited forces of the ten Kings; who haue loued the <hi>Whore,</hi> and honoured her Beaſt, but ſhall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, yea immortally, hate them both.</p>
               <p>And now, in this explication of <hi>Babylon</hi> I doe ſo ſecurely, and confidently reappoſe, that I doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it <hi>probable</hi> onely, and in ſuch a meaſure, that no <hi>Babylonian</hi> can lay the like probabilitie vpon any other PERSON, except the Pope, to be the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> foretold by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> [2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.] and to bee the <hi>ſecond Beast,</hi> foreſeene by Saint <hi>Iohn [Apoc.</hi> 13.11.] nor vpon any other PLACE, except <hi>Rome</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, to be this <hi>Babylon</hi> in my Text; but I eſteeme it to be ſo certaine, ſo cleere, ſo eaſie, and ſo fairely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18730:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deduced vnto the vnderſtanding of euery ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Auditour, that no <hi>Babylonian,</hi> though he barke at it, ſhall bite it in ſunder, nor euer be able, with Art, Learning, Iudgement, and Conſcience, ſufficiently to refute the ſame.</p>
               <p>Here then is place of admiration, as well as of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, to behold ſo many blind <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that doe not, or rather will not ſee the truth, but run on with preiudice againſt it, and neuer reflect, with an indifferent mind, towards it: abuſing their wit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their learning to ignorance, their ſtudie to vanitie, their talent to loſſe, and their time to vnprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this diſpute. Shall I then inueigh againſt their courſes in this behalfe? No; I will pray for them, with the earneſt zeale, and tender affection of my heart. <hi>O Lord, open thy truth vnto the knowledge of their hearts, and frame their hearts vnto the obedience of thy truth; that, ſearching for</hi> Babylon, <hi>they may finde it; finding it, may hate it; hating it, may flye it; flying it, may giue notice of it vnto others; that they, who are fallen, may come out of it; and they, who are falling, may not come into it; but liue in thy feare, and dye in thy fauour, to their vnſpeakable comfort, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>Wherefore, though the Ieſuites, finding <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Babylon</hi> in two eſtates (the one <hi>Ethnicall,</hi> and paſt; the other <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and to come, as they ſuppoſe) do here compare <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe: <hi>Rome,</hi> in the latter condition, with <hi>Rome</hi> in the former; and ſo ſeeke out the correſpondencie of <hi>Antichriſtian Rome</hi> with <hi>Ethnicall Rome;</hi> yet I will now diſclaime that manner of proceeding, and rather follow the purport of the Scripture, then the practiſe of the Ieſuites in this kind. <hi>First;</hi> becauſe I doe not yet ſufficiently conceiue the ſaid twofold eſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> in this Chapter (as they pretend) to be vayled vnder this name of <hi>Babylon;</hi> as if <hi>Rome</hi> neere twice here intitled with that name; but that ſhe is certainly called heere by this name, after the extinction of Ethnicall Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and after her reception of the Chriſtian Faith; and after the decay of the Romane Empire; and as ſhe was to be vnder Antichriſt; which eſtate, we ſay, is alreadie come, and the Papiſts expect it, as yet to come, neere vpon the end of the world. <hi>Secondly;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in this Chapter (according to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, offered vnto him) doth only compare <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Babylon</hi> (that famous Citie of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> the laſt Seate of the firſt Monarchy) and compareth it with <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> not onely in the <hi>very wordes of the Prophet Eſay</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:18730:144"/>
[21.9.] here repeated in my Text, and reinforced, to the ſame purpoſe, by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> [51.8.] but by <hi>many other ſentences,</hi> and paſſages, exemplified (as it were) out of thoſe Prophets, and tranſlated into this place.</p>
               <p>I proceed, therefore, now (according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne) to ſhew you the reſemblances (not all, but ſome) betwixt that <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and this in <hi>Europe</hi> (the firſt being ſo, in a litterall name; the ſecond, in a myſticall ſenſe) whereby we ſhall eaſily perceiue, that <hi>Rome</hi> doth truly communicate with her, in the ſimilitude of her name, becauſe ſhe doth aptly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her, in the qualitie of her ſins; according to that excellent rule of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in this behalfe; <hi>Scriptura diuina vtitur tranſlatione nominum, ex comparatione criminum;</hi> The Scripture doth vſe a ſimilitude of names, from the compariſon of crimes. So it is, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.10. The Princes of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> are called <hi>the Princes of Sodome.</hi> So it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3. where the Father of the Iewes is called an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and their Mother an <hi>Hittite.</hi> Then he addeth; <hi>Sic &amp; Babylon, &amp;c. and ſo</hi> Babylon <hi>in the viſions of S.</hi> Iohn <hi>carrieth the figure, of the Romane Citie; being therefore great, proud in her Empire, and a perſecutor of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the compariſon (in three points, as you heare) which <hi>Tertullian</hi> framed betwixt <hi>Babylon in Chaldaea,</hi> and the <hi>Citie of Rome.</hi> But either <hi>Rome,</hi> in that Ethnicall ſtate, was not this <hi>Babylon</hi> (of which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſpeake) or, at the leaſt, it being <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> afterward in another eſtate (as the Ieſuites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) we muſt now enquire, what are the crimes of <hi>Rome</hi> (as ſhe is <hi>Babylon</hi> in latter times) and how the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18730:40"/>

               <p>And now, becauſe wee liue in the time of the euent of things, and ſee that, by experience, in <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> could not foreſee in his iudgement (nothing being leſſe to be ſuſpected in his dayes, then that the Pope ſhould inuade the Imperiall Seate, and that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Rome</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſpirituall Babylon</hi>) and therefore, looking barely into the prophecie, could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the effects of the time (as we may do; this being the true, and proper meanes to expound all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure prophecies; as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth well obſerue; <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 43.) therefore I will proceed a little beyond the <hi>two crimes</hi> of <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>crueltie</hi> (which <hi>Tertullian</hi> found in the Ethnicall State of <hi>Rome</hi>) and make an addition of ſome other offences, which went before in litterall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and now follow after in <hi>Papall Rome.</hi> The points, then of compariſon, betwixt theſe two, being many (for now plentie it ſelfe hath made mee poore) I will ſelect <hi>fiue,</hi> at this time; which alſo I ſhall rather briefly note, then copiouſly diſcuſſe.</p>

               <p>THe firſt point, wherein this compariſon doth ſtand, is IDOLATRIE; it being a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of <hi>Babylon</hi> (as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth relate; <hi>in Rom.</hi> 1.23. (and thence deriued vnto other Nations of the world. This ſinne of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a regnant ſinne

in Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Rome;</hi> which is thence commended, and commanded vnto the whole Church of God; and this Idolatrie I note ſpecially in foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>The FIRST particular inſtance of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, is in their Sacramentall adoration; where a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is worſhipped in ſtead of the Creatour; bread in the place of the body of Chriſt (for the worſhip of Chriſts humane Nature floweth from the vnion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with his diuine Perſon: and the ſame worſhip, which is due vnto Chriſt, as he is the Sonne of God, the Papiſts, therefore, giue vnto bread, as being tranſubſtantiated into his bodie; which, by concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie, is knit vnto his Diuinitie) and all this Idolatrie is founded vpon their falſe interpretation of theſe words; <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> that is, ſay they, The bread is now become his body, by a ſubſtantiall conuerſion: which is contrary to the nature of a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> where there is a corporall abſence of the thing it ſelfe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſacrament, but yet it is ioyned, by ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall vnion, with the ſigne thereof; as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth truly affirme; <hi>It is not now common bread, but the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, conſiſting of two things; an earthly, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 34. Where are thoſe <hi>two things</hi> (in the Popiſh Euchariſt) thoſe two <hi>Res?</hi> For to ſay, there are the accidents of bread [colour, figure, taſt, &amp;c.] and the ſubſtance of Chriſts body, it doth not ſatisfie this definition of <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> and it is repugnant to the plaine reſolution of an ancient Biſhop of <hi>Rome (Gelaſius</hi> by name) who ſaith expreſly, That <hi>the ſubſtance, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of bread, and wine doe remaine in the Sacraments:</hi> vnto whom the learned Father, <hi>Theodoret,</hi> doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18730:41"/>
ſubſcribe; ſaying, That <hi>the mysticall Symbolls</hi> [of bread, and wine] <hi>goe not out of their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but doe remaine, in their former ſubſtance, after their ſanctification.</hi> Whence it is, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> firſt, and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> after him, ſpeake both in one ſentence; <hi>viz. Sacraments beare the names of the things, whereof they are Sacraments;</hi> there is the name of the thing, by Sacramentall appellation, and there is the thing by Sacramentall vnion: but there is not the thing it ſelfe, by ſubſtantiall mutation of the former element; for what abſurdities, and blaſphemies muſt then ſucceed? <hi>viz. Wormes breed out of the bodie of Chriſt; Dogs, and Cats eate the bodie of Chriſt;</hi> which things ſometimes doe, or may come to paſſe, vpon their reſeruation of this Sacrament, if their opinion thereof were true.</p>
               <p>But now, ſince, in the cleere purpoſe of Chriſt (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the iudgement of the ancient Church) there is, in the Sacrament of his bodie, true, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall bread (yet remaining after Conſecration) and the ſame is not, by any ſupernaturall operation, conuerted into the ſubſtance of his bodie (which yet the Papiſts pretend to bee the onely ſubſtance there, and vayled vnder the accidents of bread) what is, or can be, or euer hath beene, palpable <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> if this be not, to giue diuine worſhip (due vnto Chriſt, firſt, as he is God, and then to the Man-hood, as it is ioyned by perſonall vnion with the God-head) vnto a piece of bread (for ſo I am forced to ſpeake, in regard of the true ſubſtance thereof; though it be now no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread, but Sacramentall, and, in a manner, diuine) vnto the worke of our hands, euen vnto that, which, being maſticated in the mouth, digeſted in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18730:41"/>
is finally eiected into the draught? Whoſe heart may not tremble in the apprehenſion of ſuch blaſphemous, and vnlearned follies?</p>
               <p>If any man ſay (as King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Eighth once ſpake to this effect) That, <hi>ſince I conceiue there is now no bread in the Sacrament, but onely the body of Chriſt; and doe found this my conceit vpon the words of Christ</hi> (ſaying; <hi>This is my body) and thereupon, out of this perſwaſion of my heart, doe giue diuine worſhip vnto the Body of Chriſt, which I ſuppoſe to bee vayled in the figure of bread, this is now no Idolatrie in mee, if indeed the bread it ſelfe doe ſtill remaine; for, in the act of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, I worſhip not any bread, but the body of Chriſt alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere; thy falſe opinion doth not excuſe thine Idolatrous act. For if a miſguided opinion could ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply defend thee in this caſe, then the Pagans were no Idolaters, when ſome, in rude ignorance, worſhipped ſtockes, and ſtones, ſuppoſing the Idoll to bee a very God; or, at the leaſt, they, who were more acute, and learned, did conceiue that the Deitie did dwell, and inhabite therein (as <hi>Olympius,</hi> a Philoſopher, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people; <hi>Sozom. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 15.) and, therefore, according to their perſwaſion, they alſo committed not Idolatry, in the proſtitution of their bodies vnto Statues, and Images, which haue a powerfull force to inchant the mind.</p>
               <p>Againe; whereas ſome may perhaps imagine, that, if this bee an act of Idolatry in the Papiſts, yet it is a <hi>materiall</hi> Idolatry, rather then a <hi>formall,</hi> becauſe there is ſuch a Chriſt, and there is ſuch a bodie, to which diuine worſhip is due, though this bodie be not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18730:42"/>
thus ſubſtantially in the Sacrament, where they adore it; I anſwere; that, in the iudgement of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> the Iſraelites did thus adore the golden calfe; not taking it to bee God, but that God was preſent in it; yet their action was Idolatry; and ſo is this in the Papiſts, euen <hi>formall</hi> Idolatry, becauſe, though there were a <hi>Deitie,</hi> to be worſhipped, yet it was not to bee worſhipped in this matter, nor manner: and ſo, though there bee a bodie of Chriſt, which is to bee worſhipped, yet it is not in this place, not vnder theſe accidents; vnder which, and with which, there is bread ſtill, and therefore no bodie of Chriſt, and therefore not to bee worſhipped there; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, this Popiſh worſhip, though it bee intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally done to Chriſts body, yet it is really done to the very bread; ſince bread is there, and the body is not there.</p>
               <p>If any man reply, and ſay; When Chriſt himſelfe conuerſed herevpon the earth (and might then true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue diuine adoration, in his humane nature) ſuppoſe, that a ſtranger had worſhipped Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in ſtead of Chriſt; was this Idolatry, when onely the partie was miſtaken (<hi>Iohn,</hi> for Chriſt) and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was onely in the application of the worſhip vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular ſubiect, there being then a Chriſt to be worſhipped thus; though <hi>Iohn</hi> was not that Chriſt? This was not Idolatry; or, if it were any, it was <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall;</hi> it was not <hi>formall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere; that this Idolatrie is indeed purely <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,</hi> in regard of the miſtaken ſubiect (ſince Chriſt was then vpon the earth, and was capable of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip in his humane nature, wherein hee then
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18730:42"/>
liued heere, and wherein afterward he did ſuffer, and die heere) and this is not <hi>formall;</hi> ſince there was ſuch a Chriſt, and was then ſo to bee worſhipped, in the carnall preſence of his reall body. But this ſuppoſed caſe differeth very much from the Popiſh adoration: becauſe Chriſts body is neuer really preſent in the Sacrament (according to their fained conuerſion of the bread into it) there is no ſuch preſence taught by him, there was none ſuch beleeued by the ancient Church: but he is corporally in Heauen, he reigneth there, he remayneth there, and, by locall motion, hee ſhall from thence deſcend, viſibly, at the laſt day. Therefore; ſince there is no ſuch corporall preſence of Chriſt (as the Papiſts conceiue) in the Sacrament, but this is fiction of their owne, a falſe opinion of their owne, without the warrant of Chriſts word (nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the warrant of the ſame) I conclude, that their adoration of Chriſts body there (which is not there) is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> cleere, and groſſe Idolatry; <hi>materially</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſts body is not there, but bread alone) and <hi>formally;</hi> becauſe they haue not his word for their warrant (that there is euer any ſuch preſence at all) but they haue falſly, fooliſhly, blaſphemouſly deuiſed this preſence, out of their owne braines, and ſo adore the worke of their owne inuention; which conceit, being totally erroneous (in <hi>matter;</hi> which is not there preſent: and in <hi>forme;</hi> which was neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto them, for any ſuch preſence) it leaueth them to be totally Idolatrous, both <hi>materially,</hi> and <hi>formally;</hi> pure IDOLATERS, without all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of defence. Where are now the reconcilers of light, and darkneſſe, that can reconcile a Proteſtant
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18730:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with a Papiſt in this high, and important Myſterie? wherein, if Papiſts erre, they erre as intolerable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, worſhipping a breaden God: if Proteſtants erre, they are blaſphemers, hereticks, and vnſufferable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to traduce the ordinance of Chriſt, &amp; the practiſe of his Church. One of theſe two inferences muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily enſue; and, which is trueſt, I need not ſay, where the conſcience of euery auditour can eaſe mee of that paines. Wherefore I proceed vnto the other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I will handle more ſuccinctly, for that this is a capitall point; vnto which therefore I haue aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt place in this diſpute.</p>
               <p>The SECOND inſtance, then, concerneth their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of <hi>Images</hi> (as they call them; but <hi>Idols,</hi> as they vſe them) vnto which they aſcribe the very ſame worſhip, which is due vnto the thing it ſelfe; of <hi>dulia</hi> vnto the Image of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> of <hi>hyperdulia</hi> vnto the Image of the bleſſed Virgin; of <hi>Latria</hi> vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt, or any repreſentation of God. So many, and ſuch adorations, as they giue vnto the very things (exhibited, and remonſtrated vnto them, reſpectiuely, in euery Image) the very ſame (no leſſer, nor other) they giue vnto the Images thereof; with the ſame reuerence of minde, with the ſame geſture of bodie, eleuation of eyes, extenſion of hands, contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the breaſt, with genuflexion, proſtration, and whatſoeuer act is due, in their conceit, diſtinctly vnto <hi>Peter, Mary,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe; and their reaſon is, becauſe, with one act of vnderſtanding, they aſſume the Image, and the thing it ſelfe, into their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there vniting them in one notice, and in one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18730:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>O ſubtilitie! which as the poore ignorant people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach vnto (ſeldome, or neuer practiſing according to this rule) ſo the more ancient Papiſts did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, in former ages; when Images were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>hiſtoricall reſemblances,</hi> and <hi>Lay-mens Bookes,</hi> and then <hi>motiua obiecta;</hi> obiects, whoſe ſight did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and ſtirre vp the minde, vnto a contemplation of the things, repreſented in the ſame. But now theſe obſeruations, and courſes cannot content them; for, by a <hi>relatiue</hi> worſhip of the Image, <hi>terminated</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) in the thing it ſelfe, they are aſcended vnto ſuch a ſpeculation, by their wittie foolerie, that <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Image</hi> haue one, and the ſame worſhip, from a Papiſt, in his ſoule, and body. Why then did <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> deface an Image, for feare of Idolatry, if this bee none? Why did <hi>Serenus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Maſsilia</hi> breake the Images, if this be not Idolatry? Yea <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> himſelfe, diſapprouing the fact of <hi>Serenus,</hi> doth yet reprehend the popular adoration of Images in that time; which certainly did not exceed (if it did equall) the Papiſticall in our dayes. And though Doctor <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> (who ſeemed not therein to vnderſtand the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, or not himſelfe) pretendeth gloriouſly in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Kings moſt excellent Maieſty, that the point of <hi>Images,</hi> and the <hi>worſhip</hi> thereof, is a ſmall matter, of none offence, &amp;c. yet my eyes, my heart, do teach me otherwiſe; and therefore, notwithſtanding all their ſophiſticall diſtinctions, I muſt reſolue with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus; It is more eaſie to take Images out of the Church, then to define, by what reaſons they may ſtand therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally; their doctrine, in this point, is ſo falſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18730:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(contrary to Gods Word, to the iudgement of the ancient Fathers, to the opinion of many former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts alſo) and their practiſe ſo wicked, that, in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and execrable <hi>Idolatry,</hi> you may ſee the old <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> reuiued in the new; which, varying from the Scripture, from the Church (yea from her ſelfe) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more neerely vnto the patterne of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe name ſhe beareth, and (as you may eaſily ſee) ſhee beareth it not in vaine; but the daughter, daily going forward in the courſes of her <hi>Idolatry,</hi> wil, at the laſt, excell her Mother; notwithſtanding all her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions: to which ſhe may adde this; <hi>viz.</hi> There is a double Idolatry; <hi>Ethnicall,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antichriſtian:</hi> as wee ſhall yet more euidently diſcerne.</p>
               <p>The THIRD inſtance concerneth their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and irregular adoration of the <hi>Pope.</hi> For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they delay the heate of the matter with the coole water of a moyſt, and emptie diſtinction (as the oppreſſed Emperour <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> ſpake vnder the feet of the inſulting Pope; <hi>non tibi, ſed Petro;</hi> not to thee, but vnto <hi>Peter</hi> I ſubmit my ſelfe, euen to this baſe conculcation: to whom the Pope anſwered againe; <hi>Et mihi, &amp; Petro;</hi> it is vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> and alſo vnto me: or elſe by ſome other euaſion of <hi>ciuill, religious,</hi> and <hi>diuine worſhip,</hi> or the like) yet, if wee conſider, with what opinion of his excellency (which they attribute vnto this <hi>Babylonian</hi> Idoll) they adore the Pope; what Diuinitie, in regard of his pretenſed <hi>office,</hi> they aſcribe vnto his inſolent <hi>perſon;</hi> and laſtly, with what power, and authoritie they inueſt him we may well perceiue, that this is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not of the meaneſt degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:18730:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hence it is, that, immediately vpon his election, ſo ſoone as euer he is now <hi>Sanctiſsimus,</hi> the moſt holy Lord (howſoeuer wicked before) the Cardinalls come to their ſeruice of <hi>adoration</hi> (for ſo is the very terme, impoſed vpon this ſolemne action) and, with moſt kiſſes of his ſacred <hi>feet</hi> (for he is greater then Kings, who vouchſafe vs the kiſſes of their hands) euery Cardinall doth performe his homage, in ſigne of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection vnto the new aſpiring Potentate of the earth. And becauſe this action ſhould better expreſſe their Idolatry in this point, his new <hi>Holyſhip</hi> is aduanced vpon an <hi>Altar</hi> (the place of the <hi>God</hi> of their Maſſe; the Idoll of bread) and (as I haue vnderſtood by the relation of others) he is there, or thence <hi>adored,</hi> as the <hi>God</hi> of the Church, the <hi>God</hi> of the World of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Titles I ſhal ſpeak more in a more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place of my diſcourſe. And the truth is, though this adoration may ſeeme too much, yet it is the leſſe to be admired in them, if we conſider, that, in the opinion of his <hi>Babylonian</hi> vaſſals, he is a pardoner of ſin, and a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer from paine; that, can, by his Pontificial authority, draw ſoules out of Purgatorie; that can depoſe Kings; that can diſpoſe Kingdomes; that can abſolue ſubiects from the ſtrong obligations of <hi>Oath,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> that can abſolue Princes from the bond of a iuſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Oath, made vnto their Subiects (as in the caſe of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, whence enſued the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like calamitie of this Kingdome) that can diſpenſe againſt the Scriptures; that can define matters of faith, as infallibly as the Scriptures; yea, ſaith <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> (a Ieſuite; for who, but a Ieſuite, were a fit Author for ſo ſtrange a ſpeech?) that cannot erre,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18730:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that muſt bee beleeued in his Pontificiall definitions, <hi>Whether he vſe diligence, or not, in vnderstanding, and determining the point; for wee beleeue that, if hee will pastorally define any thing, with purpoſe to bind the Church vnto his definition, he ſhall not, hee cannot erre therein.</hi> So writeth the Ieſuite in his <hi>Analyſis fidei.</hi> O ſure anchor of their Religion; the rocke (their <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>) vpon which Chriſt buildeth his Church, and they their faith. Doe you maruell, then, at the outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious title, aſcribed vnto him, by a <hi>Canoniſt</hi> (the ſame being printed, and re-printed, and neuer corrected) that this ſecond Beaſt in <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould beare the the ſtile of <hi>Dominus noſter, Deus Papa?</hi> Our Lord God the Pope? And doe you maruell, that, whom they ſo extoll in dignitie, more then all Kings, they ſhould ſo <hi>adore</hi> with worſhip, no leſſe then a God? If this be not Idolatry, what is Idolatry, and what doth deſerue that name? The child humbleth himſelfe vnto his Father; the ſubiect vnto his Prince; and this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due. If you will call it <hi>adoration</hi> (though the word be not receiued publiquely into ſuch vſe) I will admit it, becauſe it is a <hi>ciuill</hi> action, founded vpon the Word of God, and warranted by the examples of his Saints; in regard of a certaine diuine authoritie, which, by Gods holy ordinance, doth ſhine in their perſons. But ſince the Pope aſſumeth this honour (of an higher, and different nature alſo) without the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Gods Word, and againſt the rule of Gods Word, with immoderate exaltation (as <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpake of Popes in his time; <hi>volunt adorari, vt Dij;</hi> they will be adored as Gods; yea by <hi>Kings</hi> alſo, who are <hi>the Gods of this earth;</hi> by Gods owne approbation; for ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18730:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hee ſpeaketh alſo of inferiour Magiſtrates; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1.) vnto which as he hath no proper right (by any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God) ſo no mortall man (the greateſt Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne that is, or euer was; were he the onely Lord of all the World; as the Pope doth gladly beleeue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and there are ſundry <hi>Babylonian</hi> Paraſites, that applaud his inſolencie in this kind) can haue right by Gods Word, vnto the like; I conclude, therefore, that this <hi>adoration</hi> of the Pope (the God of <hi>Babylon</hi>) is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and ſuch as is not to bee found any where, but in <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pope <hi>ſitteth in the Temple of God, lifting vp himſelfe aboue all, that is called God.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not, that, which Is God (to wit in nature; for ſo the Pope pretendeth a ſubiection vnto Chriſt) but that, which is <hi>called</hi> God (to wit in title, and office; as <hi>Kings</hi> are moſt properly) for, aboue all ſuch Gods, <hi>this man of ſinne</hi> doth exalt himſelfe (as you haue heard a little now, but ſhall heare more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) howbeit alſo it is true, that he exalteth himſelfe aboue the God of Heauen, and earth; while he maketh the ſtate of Religion to depend vpon the oracle of his mouth, corrupteth the Sacraments, mutilateth them, depriueth the people of Gods allowance vnto them in the holy Cup, peruerteth the condition of the Church, maketh himſelfe a Monarch therein, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth vpon the Crownes of Kings, diſpenſeth againſt Gods Word, maketh that lawfull, which God made vnlawfull (in ſubiects to riſe againſt their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignes) maketh that vnlawfull, which God made lawfull (in the Cleargie to haue their wiues) and ſo, in theſe, and other courſes, ſetteth himſelfe againſt God, and <hi>aboue God,</hi> as ſome doe vnderſtand that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18730:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.4. Both theſe expoſitions are true, and, according to both, the <hi>Papall</hi> Monarch doth ſo aduance himſelfe, that hee is <hi>adored</hi> with <hi>diuine</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, rather then <hi>ciuill,</hi> and humane.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth,</hi> and laſt, inſtance concerneth their inuocation of Saints; which hath ſundry ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of Idolatry, of which it is compounded; as you may obſerue by foure particular points.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> point is, by taking away that right which is incommunicably proper vnto God alone, as the tribute of Mankind, payable onely vnto him, in the two duties of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Thankeſgiuing:</hi> ſo that this very terme [of <hi>Inuocation</hi>] without iniurie vnto the diuine Maieſtie, cannot bee impropriated vnto Saints; as the Papiſts doe commonly vſe the ſame; <hi>de ſanctorum Inuocatione,</hi> beeing the title of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſpute: <hi>Li.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sanct. c.</hi> 15.

And, <hi>quemodo inuocabunt, &amp;c.</hi> how ſhall they call vpon him, in whom they haue not beleeued? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. For this cauſe the Scripture directeth vs euer vnto God in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament; and thus, according to the tenour of the <hi>New,</hi> all our petitions are framed in the name, and mediation of Ieſus Chriſt, our Lord: neither is there any one ſyllable in all the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching (by precept, or by example) any other courſe of Prayer, vnto, or by any other Mediator (of <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Interceſsion:</hi> there being but one of both) then onely by Ieſus Chriſt. As for the <hi>Old,</hi> though ſome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18730:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inconſiderate, and more dull <hi>Babylonians,</hi> did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produce ſundry paſſages out of it, to prooue their inuocation of Saints, yet the latter, and more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, haue vtterly forſaken that courſe, as implying a contradiction; becauſe the ſoules of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being then <hi>in limbo,</hi> and ſecluded from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God (which <hi>viſion of God</hi> is the ground of their petitions vnto Saints, as therefore hauing a knowledge, in him, of our requeſts vnto them, &amp;c.) they were then incapable of our requeſts. So then, neither in the Old Teſtament (as they confeſſe) nor in the New (as I dare confidently auouch) is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant one precept, one example, one proofe directly, or indirectly, by any plaine aſſertion, or cleere deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that any ſuch prayer is to bee made by vs vnto Saints, or that any ſuch was euer made vnto them, by any Apoſtle, Euangeliſt, Paſtour, Doctour, or any faithfull Chriſtian whatſoeuer: till, at length, either vncertaine tradition was pretended without the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, or humane perſwaſion (guided by carnall affection, and a peruerſe, but pleaſing, imitation of the Gentiles) gaue an entrance vnto this errour at the beginning; which, ſtanding rather by example of men, then by the Law of God, gained a daily increaſe; and finally, from a leſſer, to a greater <hi>degree,</hi> is come vnto ſuch an exorbitancie, that the <hi>Mother</hi> of Chriſt hath ten petitions made vnto her, in ſtead of two, that are made vnto her <hi>Sonne;</hi> beſides innumerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, tendered vnto inferiour Saints.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> point is, that Papiſts take, hereby, Gods authoritie from him, and conferre it vpon the Saints; which is to make them Idolls, by aduancing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18730:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them in the place, and office of God: and this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in all kinds of things, which wee can deſire of God. In things <hi>Spirituall;</hi> as, increaſe of grace, faith, defence from the Deuill, &amp;c. which they intreate of Saints, not onely as ſuitors for them, but as collators of theſe benefits. Wherefore they pray thus vnto the bleſſed Virgin; <hi>Tu nos ab hoſte protege, Et horâ mortis ſuſcipe: Da nobis virtutem contra hoſtes tuos:</hi> Defend vs from the enemy; receiue vs in the houre of death; giue vs ſtrength againſt thine enemies. So that, in, and vpon the point of death, the mouthes of the ſicke (if able to ſpeake) ſound ſtill; <hi>Ieſus, Maria;</hi> (ioyning them both together; and it is well, that they giue the precedencie vnto the Sonne, ſince they often call vpon her, with theſe blaſphemous words; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra te eſſe Matrem; Iure Matris impera:</hi> Shew thy ſelfe a Mother; command him, by the right of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.) or others, ſtanding by, ſound it in their eares with their loudeſt voyce, and ſtrongeſt ſides; which I haue ſometimes heard, and doe now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with vnſpeakeable griefe.</p>
               <p>In things <hi>Eternall;</hi> for they pray vnto Saints, that they would <hi>open heauen vnto them,</hi> and receiue them into their ioyes; and particularly vnto the bleſſed Virgin; to whom all the petitioners doe eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort (euen with the plaine neglect of Chriſt) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of fabulous ſtories, and fond viſions.</p>
               <p>In things <hi>Corporall;</hi> for as particular Saints (in the ſimple dotage of theſe blind <hi>Babylonians</hi>) haue a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care of certaine creatures, and a gift of cure for their maladies (ſo S. <hi>Anthony</hi> is for Hogs; S. <hi>Roch</hi> for Dogges; S. <hi>Low</hi> for Horſes; whereof I haue ſeene
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18730:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a faire company, tyed about his Chappell, in the time of Maſſe, celebrated therein, that came for helpe vnto that Hoſpitall) ſo they haue a facultie, or power, to heale particular diſeaſes in men: for here, againe, S. <hi>Anthony</hi> is a ſpeciall Saint for the <hi>fire,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beareth his name; but (not to be tedious alſo, in ſo ridiculous a point) S. <hi>Mumlyn</hi> is the onely Saint for teeth, neere the Citie of S. <hi>Omer:</hi> thither the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Infants (vexed with breeding their young teeth) are carried in their mothers armes, and commended, by them, vnto the pittie of that obſcure Saint, from whom (vpon my certaine knowledge) one Infant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obtained remedie, but dyed, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, or reliefe, from any Saint; eyther hee, or ſhee.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> point is, that, hereby, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> take Gods priuiledge from him, and beſtow it vpon others, by granting vnto Saints the knowledge of our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; hearts, which are the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> into which God alone, and no man (liuing in earth, or in heauen) can enter. But, ſay they, the Saints haue a fruition of God, and ſo, in him, a viſion of our hearts, and of other things; of which ſilly pretence, and wittie deluſion, I will ſpeake more in the fourth point; which doth preſently enſue. Meane while; if this fruition of God bee the cauſe, that they doe ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inuocate the <hi>Saints</hi> in heauen; then may the Father make a petition vnto his Child-Saint, who, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing after baptiſme (wherein originall ſinne is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen) before the commiſſion of an actuall ſinne, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth certainely to heauen, and hath there the fruition of God; and, by viſion in him, may be a petitioner
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18730:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for his Father, who is a petitioner vnto him. What is the impediment, or defect? what impeachment is there of this practiſe? vnleſſe they ſay; either that the Father is not certaine of the <hi>intention</hi> of him (or her) that baptized his child; and ſo the want of due inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maketh a nullitie in the Sacrament, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leaueth his child in the ſtate of damnation [ô pitifull doctrine; yet ſuch is theirs] or elſe, that ſo young a Saint deſerued not the grace to bee a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, to receiue petitions from vs in earth, nor to preſent them, with effect, vnto God in heauen. I haue ſpoken for the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> what I can, in this caſe; if they can ſay more for themſelues, they ſhall haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> point is, that, hereby, they aſcribe ſuch an omniſciencie, or knowledge of all things (and that in an inſtant) vnto the Saints, whereof no creature (though beatified) is, or may be capable, by the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture, or conſequence of reaſon. Let vs then put the caſe, as a thing poſſible (which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable alſo) that, in one indiuiſible point of time, a million (yea many millions) of ſuitors make their petitions vnto the bleſſed Virgin, by prayers conceiued in the heart, or vttered with the mouth (for that is all one, in effect, ſince the Saints know our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>in God</hi>) which need an immediate ſucceſſe; the ſame prayers alſo, being often diuers (and ſometimes contrary) in regard of the matters, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. Now conſider the abſurditie of the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in this behalfe; that the bleſſed Virgin inſtantly heareth (or rather ſeeth) all their prayer; inſtantly preſenteth them vnto God; inſtantly ſendeth ſuch a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18730:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
varietie of helpes vnto her diſtreſſed ſuitors. This is not to beatifie a ſoule, but to deifie a creature; to make it a God, at the ſecond hand; to giue that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things</hi> vnto a Saint, which, being in God, cannot, without communication of the God-head, bee deriued vnto any Creature. Therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sonne of God, and the Holy Ghoſt, haue a knowledge of <hi>all things</hi> with the Father, becauſe the perſon of the Sonne is from the Father; and the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt is from them both; with the communication of Deitie to the Sonne in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and to the Holy Ghoſt in his proceſſion. But ſince euery bleſſed ſoule remaineth in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a creature, in ſubſtance (though glorious) in knowledge (though increaſed) therefore it hath a finite knowledge; for as the ſtate of beatitude requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a great addition of knowledge, ſo the ſtate of a creature requireth a determination of knowledge; whereas the <hi>Babylonians</hi> extend it infinitely, by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, in whom theſe ſoules ſee <hi>all</hi> things, as they ſuppoſe</p>
               <p>This generall errour is ancient, and the ſpeciall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it is venerable; S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great: but not ſo great, that, without any Scripture to iuſtifie this point, we ſhould ſubſcribe vnto his aſſertion. Yea, but it is his faire concluſion, inferred out of a true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. How? <hi>Vident videntem omnia:</hi> the Saints ſee him, that ſeeth all things. What then? <hi>Ergo vident omnia:</hi> therefore they ſee all things. It ſeemeth to bee an ingenious, but it is no ſubſtantiall inference. Let vs examine the poſition, and then the concluſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:18730:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>As concerning the poſition; it is true: The ſoules in heauen ſee God, not ſenſibly, with any corporeall eyes, nor imaginarily, in any fancie; but intellectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by immediate intuition (without any vayle, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes) into the diuine Eſſence. But how farre forth? Not by <hi>totall comprehenſion</hi> of the Deitie, which they behold (for ſo the Sonne ſeeth the Father; and the Holy Ghoſt ſeeth them both) but by ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of God, as a creature can receiue, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vnto the bleſſedneſſe therof; which conſiſteth in the fruition, and in the viſion of God.</p>
               <p>The concluſion, therefore, of <hi>Gregory</hi> (out of the ſaid poſition) is lame, and cannot ſtand by the ſtrength thereof; ſince hee onely ſeeth <hi>all things</hi> in God, who ſeeth God <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi> by comprehenſion of the Deitie; as Chriſt ſeeth his Father: but ſo, and in ſuch a plenitude of viſion, no creature can ſee the Creator. As for the ſoule of Chriſt, that is of an higher knowledge, becauſe the humane nature hath the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, by vnion with God, in the perſon of the Sonne.</p>
               <p>So then, the poore <hi>Babylonians</hi> are ſtill in the caſe of Idolatry; for they, by this falſly conceiued omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in the Saints, tranſlate them, or (to ſpeake in their owne language) tranſubſtantiate them into God. Neither doth their deuice of <hi>Speculum</hi> (that God is the <hi>looking glaſſe</hi> of the Saints, in whom they ſee things, as you heard before) relieue them from the crime of Idolatrie: for this conceit iſſueth from the former, and is all one with it in effect; and both are poore euaſions. For though God be <hi>a looking glaſſe</hi> vnto the Saints, yet he is <hi>voluntarium,</hi> a voluntary
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18730:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one, to repreſent, what he will (in the freeneſſe of his pleaſure) not <hi>neceſſarium,</hi> a neceſſary one, to repreſent vnto the Saints all that, which is in the compaſſe of his excellencie, and knowledge: for then, why ſhould they not as well foreſee (or rather ſee) all future things, as well as all preſent things, in him? Finally; if they ſee all our prayers, and ſo all other things in him, by the very nature of their beatificall viſion (as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> doe fondly collect) why then doe ſome of the ancients teach, that the ſoules, in heauen, are informed by Angells (executing a miniſteriall office here in the earth) of ſundry occurrences, that paſſe here in the militant Church? Which opinion, ſtanding with good congruitie of reaſon (according to the paſſages of Scripture, and principles in diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) doth therefore neceſſarily conclude, againſt the ſuppoſed omniſciencie of the ſoules (knowing all things in God by the viſion of his diuine Eſſence) that they haue ſuch a latitude of knowledge, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> doe conceiue; but (as you ſee) without any ſufficient teſtimony of Scripture, or pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, well deduced out of certaine, and approoued grounds.</p>
               <p>Now, as you haue heard their Idolatry, in ſending vp emptie, and vnfruitfull prayers vnto the Saints (for they muſt conuert them into the nature, and dignitie of God, to make them vnderſtand the thoughts of our hearts, and the multitude of occurrences in this world) ſo behold their Idolatry alſo in murmuring out their <hi>Pater noſter</hi> vnto Saints (yea, before the Images of Saints) to whom they direct that excellent, and incomparable prayer; which though Chriſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18730:50"/>
taught vs to poure out vnto his Father, yet many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them preſent vnto the Saints. Which practiſe of ſimple people, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot ſay how farre the learned do maintaine (I haue not read, nor did I euer aske their opinion in this behalfe) but I find, that, vpon this deepe point, an egregious diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was held in <hi>Scotland</hi> (&amp; it is related immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the martyrdome of <hi>Adam Wallace,</hi> in the Acts, and Monuments of the Church, publiſhed by Maſter <hi>Foxe</hi>) where ſome profound Doctors of <hi>Babylon</hi> did ſubſtantially reſolue, that <hi>primariò, formaliter, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter, vltimatè, &amp; capiendo ſtrictè,</hi> this prayer may be ſaid onely vnto God; but <hi>ſecundariò, materialiter, minùs principaliter, non vltimatè, &amp; capiendo largè,</hi> it may be ſaid vnto Saints. What is ſo abſurd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, which, by diſtinctions, may not be defended in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And why may not that prayer be directed by them vnto the Saints, ſince, <hi>Dominus</hi> being changed into <hi>Domina</hi> (our <hi>Lord</hi> into our <hi>Lady</hi>) the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> whereby hee comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Lord his God, are turned by the Papiſts, into an inuocation of our Ladie? And why may not both bee done by them, who find ſuch an exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, betwixt our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and their S. <hi>Francis,</hi> that hee may alſo bee truely ſtiled; <hi>Ieſus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum;</hi> Ieſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> King of the Iewes?</p>
               <p>But ſince there is no end, in the proſecution of their blaſphemous abſurdities in this kind, I will conclude this laſt point of Romiſh <hi>Idolatry</hi> (in their inuocation of Saints) and, finally, obſerue, that it is an idolatrie alſo in them, thus to transferre the peculiar, ſufficient,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18730:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and glorious Office of Chriſt his <hi>Mediatourſhip</hi> vnto any Saint; he, or ſhe; though his owne Mother, (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom though he bare a filiall reſpect, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to humane nature, yet you ſhall neuer finde in his acts, or words, any one paſſage, or inclination, which might ſeeme to intitle her vnto ſuch exorbitant honour, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> aſſigne vnto her; by a boundleſſe, and groundleſſe ſuperſtition) and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince, as neceſſitie did not compell them, ſo no good reaſon could perſwade them, vnto this ſeruice. Why? becauſe all, and more is to be found in Chriſt, then in any, or in all the Saints, in this behalfe. For what doe wee, or can wee, deſire in any interceſſor? <hi>Power</hi> with him, of whom hee doth intreate any thing: <hi>Affection</hi> to them, for whom hee doth intreate: and a ſufficient <hi>Capacitie</hi> of hearing, and receiuing their requeſts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then for <hi>Power</hi> with God: haue all the Saints ſo much, as he, with the Father? who teſtifieth of him; <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Matth.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly; for <hi>Affection</hi> vnto vs; is any Saint more kind, more louing, more facill, and gracious? No: none is like vnto him. Why? Firſt; becauſe he tooke our whole nature (not the perſon of one man) and eſpouſed it to his owne perſon: it being truly indued with all naturall affections, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with grace, without any meaſure of the Spirit. Therefore, in this regard, he is as neere vnto mee as any man; nay neerer then all men. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe, in this nature, hee ſuffered for me, with paſſions of bodie, and ſoule; hee died for me; he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18730:51"/>
Gods wrath for me; and ſo bought mee for his owne: therefore, in this regard, I am more deare vnto him, then vnto his bleſſed Mother, or vnto all the Saints, that reigne with him in glorie. Hence it is, that He ſendeth vs not vnto them, but calleth vs vnto himſelfe; <hi>Come vnto me, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; as for his <hi>Capacitie</hi> of hearing vs; who can denie it to be infinite in him, who, being, God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in euery thing? And as for his humane nature, who can ſufficiently iudge of the capacitie of it alſo, in this behalf, which, by the grace of perſonal vnion with God (and ſo by the glorie of extraordinarie viſion in him) hath ſuch a Sea of knowledge, as we are not able to comprehend in the litle ſhels of our vnderſtanding?</p>
               <p>Therefore, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid; <hi>to whom ſhall wee goe, &amp;c.</hi> ſo I ſay; to whom ſhall we rather goe, then to him, in whom all theſe things ſo happily concurre? Why ſhall I giue his honour away vnto another, and thereby take away my comfort from my ſelfe? So ſhal I be an iniurious <hi>Idolater</hi> againſt his excellencie, and my owne ſaluation; as they are generally in the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> Church; where the moſt ſweet inuitations, and comfortable aſſurances of Chriſt vnto vs, are applied vnto his Mother: as; <hi>Come you all vnto mee:</hi> and; <hi>ſuffer little children to come vnto me;</hi> with other of like nature: which diuine ſentences I haue ſeene (for my euidence is from mine owne vnhappie eies) appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, in papers, vpon Tapiſtrie, or vpon the walls of their Chappels, and aſcribed vnto her (vpon a Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day, ſolemnely dedicated vnto her ſeruice) with this Motto; <hi>Intrate per me,</hi> enter in by mee [words peculiar, and meerely proper vnto Chriſt himſelfe]
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18730:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fairely written, in capitall Letters, and placed ouer the doore; to inſtruct all men thereby, that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chappell, that they muſt enter into the Church, by the inuocation of her name, and into Heauen, by the mediation of her Praier. Let them now diſtinguiſh, againe, with <hi>ſtrictè,</hi> and <hi>largè, primariò,</hi> and <hi>ſecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riò, &amp;c.</hi> yet their conſciences cannot eſcape the crime of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in this courſe, which they eſteeme to be verie deuout, but we know it to be verie prophane.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the firſt generall point of compariſon [which is in the matter of <hi>Idolatrie</hi>] betwixt the old, and the new <hi>Babylon.</hi> I proceed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnto the ſecond.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="comparison">
               <head>The <hi>SECOND</hi> Compariſon betwixt <hi>Literall Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Papall Rome.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe ſecond point, wherein this compariſon doth ſtand, is PRIDE; a ſinne of ſpeciall note in the firſt <hi>Babylon; the Ladie of Kingdomes [Eſay</hi> 47.5.] but what is her end?

State, and toward the whole Church, is ſuch, as may argue him to be the ſucceſſor of <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> (in whom the Regall authoritie of ancient <hi>Rome</hi> did expire) rather then of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe ſucceſſion, and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> power he doth pretend; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conformitie to his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> doctrine in theſe things; who teacheth all men to bee ſubiect vnto the King, <gap reason="foreign">

For what is more contrarie to an Apoſtolicall ſpirit, then pride, exaltation, aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelues, with the contempt of others?

               <p>Now let vs obſerue the <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſtomacke (for what is not <hi>Apostolicall</hi> in that ſeat? a glorious name to inſnare poore ſeduced ſoules) of the holy Father in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and whether ſuch courſes, examples, rules, and ordinances of monſtrous <hi>Pride,</hi> were euer knowne, or doe remaine vpon the Records of Antiquitie, euen from the beginning of the World, vnto this preſent day, in any other Monarchie, Kingdome, or State, of whatſoeuer qualitie, or degree?

               <p>FIRST; the pride of the holy Father appeareth in the particular facts of certaine Popes, vpon the preſumed Souereigntie of their Apoſtolicall ſeate. He was a Pope, that crowned, and decrowned <hi>Henrie</hi> the Sixth (the <hi>Germane</hi> Emperour) with his foot; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that, as the Imperiall Crowne was vnder the Papall, and ſubiect vnto his Dominion (euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his foot) ſo it is in the Popes great power, vpon his holy pleaſure, to giue Kingdomes, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Kingdomes; to erect Kings, and to ſuppreſſe them againe; as if they were the Tennis balls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his Holineſſe doth play. He was a Pope, who, in diſdaine of the Imperiall dignitie, made <hi>Henrie</hi> the Fourth attend, barelegged, and barefoot, with his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and their ſonne, by way of penance, in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18730:53"/>
Winter ſeaſon, at his Apoſtolicall gates. Hee was a Pope, that, treading vpon the necke of <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa,</hi> the Emperour, with his Apoſtolicall foot, inſulted gloriouſly vpon the poore deiected Prince, and profanely abuſed the ſacred Scripture to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall purpoſe; <hi>Thou ſhalt walke vpon the Lyon, and Aſpe: the young Lyon, and the Dragon ſhalt thou tread vnder thy feet; Pſal.</hi> 91.13. It is no maruell then, that our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second did humble himſelfe ſo farre, as to kiſſe the knee of his Legate, whoſe foote to haue kiſſed, is a matter of ſpeciall grace; according to the Conſtitutions of the Papall Church; as you ſhall immediately perceiue: for now wee inſiſt onely vpon the matters of fact, whereof I haue made a little remonſtrance in a few examples; referring you vnto the Hiſtories, which yeeld copious teſtimonies in this kind.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, then, this pride appeareth in their owne Ceremoniall Ordinances, formally preſcribing the courſes of humilitie vnto Chriſtian Princes, in their attendance of the Apoſtolicall Father. There the Emperour holdeth his bridle, when the Pope ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Apoſtolicall pompe; there Kings, and Princes (being marſhalled according to the new Herauldry of <hi>Babylon</hi>) march before him in their rankes. Sometimes the Pope beeing aduanced vpon mens ſhoulders, in a goodly Chaire of Apoſtolicall ſtate, the Emperour, and Kings precede, in their due order, as ſo many Vſhers of his Holineſſe, who throweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his Apoſtolicall benedictions vpon the people, with his ſacred fingers. This pride may yet ſeeme to be humilitie in compariſon of his glorious exaltation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18730:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (for vnder his name paſſeth all this exorbitancie) where Monarchs, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelues vpon the ground, meekly kiſſe his Apoſtolicall feet, and then are afterwards admitted vnto ſo great a fauour, as to kiſſe his cheeke. All which was performed in the perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, the <hi>French</hi> King, vnto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, as <hi>Guicciar dine</hi> relateth in his firſt Booke; with humble ſeruice, in ſo great a Prince, deſerueth the note of baſe deiection vnto the Triple-crowned Beaſt. But thus the purpled Whore can either inchant with her cup, or ſubdue with her Sword, the greateſt, and moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Princes of the World. Where is the <hi>exemplum dedi,</hi> from Chriſt Ieſus in this caſe? The Vicar, and the Maſter ſtand in Diametricall oppoſition almoſt in euery point, as well as in this; the Maſter kiſſed the feet of his poore Diſciples; but heere the Vicar requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the greateſt Monarchs vnto the kiſſes of his feet; he proudly challengeth this ſubmiſſion from them: and they baſely performe it vnto him; that ſo hee might appeare to bee, what hee is; euen Antichriſt, <hi>Lifting vp himſelfe aboue all, that is called God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIRDLY, this pride appeareth by his vſurpation ouer the Crownes of Princes; and that in different manner. Sometimes, by a particular intereſt; as hee pretended in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to diuert thence the militarie forces of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. Sometimes by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or ſurrender; as he pretended in <hi>England,</hi> by the ſubmiſſion of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and therefore called his Sonne, <hi>Henrie</hi> the Third, by the ignoble ſtile of his <hi>Vaſſall:</hi> and, ſo, by artificiall inſinuations, and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18730:54"/>
Titles, he intrudeth vpon ſeuerall Dominions; to make ſome ſpeciall challenge thereunto.</p>
               <p>If no ſuch oblique, and ſiniſter courſe may ſerue his turne, yet he hath two other wayes, to come vnto his deſigned ends: and that is; either INDIRECTLY, (and as hee is Paſtour of the Church) to take King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes from their owners, for their offences, and to collate them vpon other Princes (as, for example, the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtirred vp <hi>Charles,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Angeow</hi> againſt <hi>Manfredus,</hi> the King of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> the true Lord, and poſſeſſour thereof by the gift of his Father, <hi>Frederi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the Second; and alſo the Pope ſtirred vp the ſaid <hi>Charle,</hi> againſt <hi>Cunradinus,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Conradus,</hi> and Grand-child of the ſaid <hi>Fredericus,</hi> to depriue him of his life, and to diſſeize him of his lawfull inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples:</hi> both which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes he bountifully beſtowed vpon the ſaid <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:</hi> in like manner the Pope dealt with <hi>Iohn d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret,</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and with our late renowned Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of bleſſed memory, and glorious name; though not with like euent) or elſe DIRECT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, and as he is Lord of the World (from whom all Princes haue their dependent power) to beſtow them at his pleaſure, as iuſt occaſion ſhall mooue, and good diſcretion ſhall direct his Holyſhip in this caſe; which laſt opinion hath a daily growth in <hi>Babylon,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Paraſites of the <hi>Court.</hi> For you muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, with <hi>Gerſon,</hi> betwixt <hi>Aula,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſia;</hi> the Court, and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pride, in the head of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth vnto the members. For as the Cardinalls
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18730:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(who are the great regotiatours in the publike affaires of the world) are the <hi>coſins</hi> of mightie Kings (who ſalute them by that affable, and gracious name; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, and ambitious of the affection of theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Fathers in the Apoſtolicall Court) ſo the whole bodie of the ſhaued Clergy pretendeth an exemption from the lawfull iuriſdiction of their naturall Lords; as being ſubiects, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or meaſure; and a body rather collected, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder the Pope, then vnder their owne Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignes; in whoſe Lands they receiued their firſt breath, and vnder whoſe protection, they enioy their liuelyhood, with the preſeruation of their liues.</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY, this pride appeareth in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ouer the whole Church: as firſt; that all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power (of order, and iuriſdiction) is deriued from his Apoſtolicall Seate; that hee can depriue, ſuſpend, excommunicate ſuch, as withſtand his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; that appellations may be made, and, in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, muſt be made vnto him, from the ſentences, and cenſures of Biſhops, in all places of the world; that he may demand, and receiue a ſupply of monyes, and neceſſaries, for the vſe, and benefit of his Apoſtolicall greatneſſe; that hee is anſwerable to no power in the Church, or State; that hee may, by reſeruations, and prouiſions, beſtow Eccleſiaſticall benefices vpon whom hee will, in any part of the Chriſtian world; that he is greater then all the Church, and is, in truth, and effect, the very Church: which being <hi>eſſentially,</hi> in the whole ſocietie of Chriſtians, is <hi>repreſentatiuely</hi> in a lawfull Councell, and <hi>virtually</hi> in the Pope; ſo that, finally, the Church, their Mother, is the Pope,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18730:55"/>
their Father; who is the Lord, the Head, the Guide, the Paſtour, the Vniuerſall Biſhop of the Church. Which inſolencies, and oppreſſions, in the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made <hi>Gerſon</hi> bitterly to complaine; That <hi>the Head of the Church was growen too heauy for the whole bodie thereof;</hi> and our learned Countrey-man, Biſhop <hi>Grosthead,</hi> to pronounce, That <hi>the Church would neuer be freed from the yoake of her Aegyptian bondage, but by the dint, and edge of a bloudie ſword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FIFTHLY, and laſtly, his pride appeareth in his great, and glorious titles; taken vp partly by himſelfe, and partly aſcribed vnto him by others, with gratefull appobation of the Apoſtolicall Seate. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; hee is a Vice-God (as in that inſcription; <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Quinto Vice-deo:</hi> where the numerall letters, V. L. V. I. V. C. D. make vp the fatall number of 666. containing the myſterie of Antichriſt his name, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal.</hi> 13.18.) but this is too little; therefore hee is plainly <hi>a God;</hi> nay that is too little alſo; he is <hi>our Lord God;</hi> as I ſhewed you once before; and yet ſometimes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nec Deus es, nec homo, ſed neuter es inter vtrumque;</hi> Thou, ô Souereigne of the World, art neither God, nor man (therefore Antichriſt; for Chriſt is both) but art, betwixt both, neither the one, nor the other. Hee is <hi>Dominus dominorum, quoad poteſtatem;</hi> the Lord of Lords, in regard of his power; though <hi>Seruus ſeruorum quoad humilitatem</hi> (ſaith bald <hi>Baldus</hi>) the Seruant of Seruants (and be it ſo; but in the ſenſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> in his malediction of <hi>Canaan; Geneſ.</hi> 9.25.) in regard of his meekeneſſe. O meeke, and humble Saint; whoſe ordinarie title hath beene his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> his <hi>Bleſſedneſſe;</hi> more compatible with his Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18730:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
office, then his <hi>Maieſtie;</hi> which is, indeed, the pleaſing, and acceptable ſtile, vnto which their proud, and tyrannicall vſurpations doe aſpire. And therefore this was well attibuted vnto <hi>Paulus</hi> the fifth, by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douicus ab Alcaſar,</hi> the Ieſuite, in his dedicatorie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, prefixed before his miſerable expoſition of this myſticall booke. Yet thou waſt more wiſe, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, ô noble, and victorious <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> that diddeſt refuſe the title of a <hi>King:</hi> and thou waſt more modeſt, ô Princely <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that diddeſt reiect the title of a <hi>Lord.</hi> But behold, here is a greater then both; which accepteth all, alloweth all; as, indeed, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a great deale more. Let him then take one title more, to furniſh vp his glorious ſtile; hee is <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his pride, ambition, and inſultation ouer all States, <hi>Ciuill,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> as the pretended Lord of both.</p>

               <p>Witneſſe <hi>England</hi> againe in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; who, by a Papall proceſſe of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, was depriued of his Kingdome, and his ſubiects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, by force, and armes, to eiect him out of the confines therof: the ſucceſſe whereof was, for a time, troubleſome to the King, but, in the end, inglorious to the Pope: the tenour of whoſe roaring Bull, and <hi>Capitoline</hi> thunderbolt, deſerueth your ſpeciall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for that hee exciteth the ſubiects of <hi>England,</hi> againſt their King, by a moſt impudent, and ignorant application of the Scripture; <hi>Wee, being placed</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in the Seate of Iuſtice, according to the prediction of the Prophet [Ierem.</hi> 1.10.] <hi>ſaying; Behold, I haue ſet thee ouer the Nations, and ouer the Kingdomes to plucke vp, and to roote out, and to deſtroy, and throw downe, &amp;c.</hi> This is a Text, which ſounded to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and therefore <hi>Carerius (de poteſt.

muſt weare the <hi>Babylonian</hi> yoake, to their ſhame, or caſt it off, to their danger; ſtanding vpon the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tearmes of <hi>depoſition, murther,</hi> and other diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous calamities, when, one Prince being depoſed by Papall furie, another Prince (rather out of deſire of his Kingdome, then out of obedience to the Pope) is readie to inuade his Dominions; ſo that one of them is made the executioner of another, and all of them inſtruments of the Papall Tyranny; till, by this meanes, the Papal iuriſdiction, ouer them all, groweth ſtrong by preſcription [<hi>Nos ſanctorum, &amp;c.</hi> being a better plea, for the Popes, in latter Ages, then it was in the time of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> the Pope, who pretended the example of his predeceſſors, for the depoſition of Princes] and ſo, in proceſſe of time, all Princes (as the Popes doe cunningly affect) ſhall hold their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as <hi>donatiues</hi> of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Seate.</p>
               <p>I am wearied (and ſo perhaps are you) in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this vnhappie argument; wherefore I will gather vp my ſayles, and conclude this tedious Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with two remarkeable obſeruations.</p>
               <p>The firſt concerneth the Papall intruſion vpon the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, the centre of that Empire, whoſe circumference was ſo largely extended in the World; the proper, and peculiar ſeate of the <hi>Firſt Beaſt (Apocal.</hi> 13.1.) till the <hi>Second Beast (Apocal.</hi> 13.11.) by his artificiall proiects, and the popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the Citizens, diueſted, and diſſeized the true Lord of his ancient right. For <hi>Leo,</hi> the lawfull Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> reſiding in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (as many of his Predeceſſours before him) was excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Second (bearing the name, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18730:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not hauing the diſpoſition of the firſt) his ſubiects were releaſed (by Apoſtolicall diſpenſation) from their Oath of Alleageance; and, vpon theſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, the <hi>Romanes</hi> (like wicked Traytours) ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Citie vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> (a more wicked Traytour then they) as vnto their Souereigne Lord; if that bee true, which the Ieſuite <hi>Azorius</hi> doth affirme; <hi>Inſtit. Moral. part.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 20. Thus, the old Lord beeing vniuſtly depriued, a new Lord entred vniuſtly into his place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concerneth the <hi>Papall</hi> intruſion vpon Infidels (for hee muſt goe out of the World, that will goe out of his reach) vpon whoſe eſtates alſo, and Kingdomes, this <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch ſtretcheth out the line of his Apoſtolicall power. Witneſſe <hi>America</hi> (poore, diſtreſſed <hi>America</hi>) in the liberall donation of large, and ample Territories therein, vnto the Kings of <hi>Spaine.</hi> For he was a Pope (but a <hi>Catiline,</hi> a <hi>Iudas;</hi> the <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> or rather of <hi>all ſinnes</hi>) euen that execrable villaine, <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, who, <hi>out of his meere motion, and liberalitie</hi> (as the <hi>Beaſt</hi> roareth in his Bull, to that purpoſe) did beſtow all the great, and mightie Kingdomes, in theſe parts, <hi>vpon Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, King of Arragon, and Elizabeth Queene of Caſtile, and vpon their heires for euer.</hi> Therefore <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Lopez,</hi> in his generall Hiſtorie of the Weſterne <hi>Indies, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. expreſſing the title, and intereſt of the ſaid Princes in theſe rich, and ſpacious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſetteth downe the Bull of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt (who, out of his Papall authoritie, and particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his Countrey, freely, and powerfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them vpon the ſaid Princes, and their heires)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18730:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to this end, and purpoſe, <hi>That all men may vnderſtand</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that the conqueſt, and conuerſion of theſe Countreyes, which the</hi> Spaniards <hi>doe make, is by the authoritie, and donation of the great Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Is this, then, the title, and right, which <hi>Spaine</hi> pretendeth to haue in this new, and other World? Is this the colour, and pretenſe for the cruell, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite effuſion of bloud (humane, though not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) in theſe miſerable Countreyes (whereof <hi>Benzo,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomaeus à Caſa,</hi> himſelfe a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> doe ſo pittifully complaint) conuerted now (as you may perceiue) vnto Chriſtian Religion, ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by the Sword? Wherefore I may truly ſay, that euery drop of <hi>Indian</hi> bloud, ſhed in this diſcouery, and conqueſt, ſhall be required of <hi>Babylon;</hi> as truly guiltie of the ſame; according to the prediction of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell; <hi>In her was found the bloud of all them, that were ſlaine vpon the earth;</hi> namely, in the Dominions of Infidels, as, well as <hi>of the Prophets, and of the Saints,</hi> in the Chriſtian World it ſelfe. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18.24.</p>
               <p>And now, becauſe the diligent obſeruation of this particular prepareth vs vnto a fourth Compariſon, betwixt the <hi>Literall Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Papall Rome,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you to caſt your eyes backe, a little, vpon this paſſage of the Scripture, that ſo you may looke forward, the better, vnto the ſequele of my ſpeech. Well ſaith the Angell, that <hi>the bloud of</hi> ALL MEN, <hi>ſlaine vpon the earth, was found in Babylon:</hi> for, in her is the bloud of theſe <hi>Indians;</hi> in her is the bloud of her owne <hi>Pſeudo-Catholikes,</hi> ſhed in <hi>England,</hi> by the Sword of Iuſtice; in her is the bloud of all them, that periſh in, for, or by her deſignes: in her is the bloud
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18730:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of many Chriſtians, ſhed for the truth of Gods Word, in ſo many Countreyes; in her is the bloud of many thouſand perſons, ſhed vpon the contentions of her Popes; in her is the bloud of ſo many people, taking armes, vpon her incantations, againſt their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lords; in her is the bloud of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chriſtians, in their vnlawfull warres againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, vpon her prouocations; in her is the bloud of many poore ſubiects, againſt whom ſhe hath incited their owne Princes. Thus <hi>Rome</hi> began in the bloud of two brethren; it increaſed in the bloud of many neighbours; it was inlarged by the bloud of many Prouinces; it ſtood in the bloud of many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; it continued in the bloud of many people; firſt by Emperours; laſtly, by Popes: and it ſhall end in the bloud of her ſelfe, and her followers, as you ſhall ſee more cleerely hereafter, when wee come vnto the ſecond part of my Text. Meane while, I proceed vnto a new compariſon, which fitly taketh its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the end of this diſcourſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="comparison">
               <head>The <hi>FOVRTH</hi> Compariſon betwixt <hi>Literall Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Papall</hi> Rome.</head>
               <p>THe fourth point, then, wherein this compariſon doth ſtand, is CRVELTIE, bloudie crueltie, very ſpectable in that ancient Monarchie (the figure of the Papall) as the Scriptures themſelues (in the two Prophets; <hi>Eſay,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi>) beſides ciuill Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, doe ſufficiently deduce vnto our knowledge; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, for breuitie ſake, I muſt now remit you; as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18730:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men expert, and skilfull, in the ſacred Sriptures: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great part of your happineſſe, that you haue Gods Word in your owne tongue (which many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, though bearing the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, doe not enioy) to read it, and obſerue it, for your inſtruction, and vnſpeakable comfort. Well then; let vs leaue the firſt, and come vnto the ſecond <hi>Babylon;</hi> which, in this point of barbarous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane crueltie, exceedeth all example of Ages paſt, and preuenteth the example of all that are to come, vnleſſe it be in the perſecutions, which ſhe, perhaps, may yet raiſe againſt the Church of God: <hi>for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of crueltie are in their habitations:</hi> which <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſpake of his bloudie ſonnes; and I may ſpeake it of our more bloudie mother.</p>
               <p>Her voice is the voice of bloud; <hi>Surge Petre [Paule quinte] Occide, &amp;c.</hi> Ariſe, O <hi>Paul</hi> the fift in name [but <hi>Peter</hi> in Office: ſo is euery Pope; and therefore none taketh that name vpon him; when, in their entrance vpon the Papacie, they leaue their former <hi>Chriſtian</hi> names, as comming vnto an <hi>Antichristian</hi> place] a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and kill the <hi>Venetians</hi> (ſaith that flattering, falſe, cruell <hi>Baronius,</hi> their learned Cardinall) kill them with thy thunderbolts [which rarely kill any, but men of ſofter metall] deſpoile them of their Dominion, expoſe them vnto ruine, becauſe they dare ſo inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt thy great, and mightie power.</p>
               <p>Heere was a killing Text in deed; eſpecially, by vertue of SAINT PETERS name, who knew well how to handle a Sword; and becauſe hee cut off a ſeruants eare, why may not his ſucceſſours cut off a Princes head? For what Text, if it touch Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

               <p>Yet wonder not at the former Text (for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may beare ſome ſhew of bloud) but wonder at this; that, <hi>Paſce oues meas [Feede my Sheepe;</hi> ſaith Chriſt vnto <hi>Peter; Iohn</hi> 21.16.] ſhould approue theſe killing courſes in the Pope, theſe violent depoſitions of Princes, theſe rebellious inſurrections of people.

Who thence inferreth a certaine, and neceſſary power in the Pope, to depoſe two ſorts of Princes; the one, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, whom he compareth vnto cruell <hi>Wolues;</hi> the other, irregular, whom hee compareth vnto vnruly <hi>Rammes;</hi> and therefore (ſaith hee) ſince the Pope, is Paſtour of the vniuerſall Church, and hath an Office to feed the SHEEPE (that is to ſay, all faithfull Chriſtians) hee muſt haue a power to reſtraine, and reſiſt ſuch WOLVES, and RAMMES, as trouble, and infeſt the flocke. So that, in concluſion, <hi>Paſce</hi> in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Occide</hi> in <hi>Baronius</hi> (according to the new Grammer, and Diuinitie of <hi>Babylon</hi>) meet both in one centre of ſignification, and in one iſſue of ſenſe. O skilfull <hi>Mercurialiſts,</hi> to draw bloud out of the veines of the holy Scripture. Yet theſe are the men, that opprobriouſly, and ſcornfully, obiect this textu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all folly vnto the Diuines of the Reformed Church, in miſapplying the Scriptures vnto their miſguided
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18730:63"/>
fancies. But now I proceed to make a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of bloudie crueltie in their myſticall <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> by foure ſeuerall, and inuincible demonſtrations thereof.</p>
               <p>FIRST, then, the crueltie of <hi>Babylon</hi> appeareth, in rayſing vp ſubiects againſt their naturall Lords, to the inualuable expenſe of Chriſtian bloud. <hi>England</hi> can ſay ſome thing in this behalfe, not onely in the more ancient times (as of King <hi>Iohn;</hi> who, with his people, ſuffered much by the inſtinct, and operation of <hi>Rome</hi>) but in theſe latter times, both of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the Eighth (againſt whom ſome noble Perſons conſpired, and ſome meaner Subiects rebelled, by the procuration of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the loſſe of their bloud, which ſhall be found in her) and in the <hi>Halcyonian</hi> dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (by inſurrections in the North: by clancular, and ſecret Treaſons of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parricides: by hoſtile inuaſions, reſolued againſt <hi>England,</hi> and in part effected in <hi>Ireland;</hi> all depending vpon <hi>Babylon,</hi> and iſſuing from her deſignes; which inſtructed her <hi>Prieſts</hi> to ſeduce the people heere from their iuſt obedience; whence enſued the iuſt execution of both, by the neceſſary prouiſion of the Lawes) and in the happy Reigne of our moſt gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lord, King <hi>Iames;</hi> who therefore enacted a ſpeciall, and prudent Law (by conſent of the <hi>Peeres,</hi> and People of this Kingdome) to try, thereby, the alleageance, and fidelitie of his ſubiects: which Oath finding ſo much oppoſition, and impugnation, from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch, did miniſter an ineuitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie vnto this State, to draw ſome bloud from ſuch Prieſts, as rather obſerued, and reſpected the Papall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18730:64"/>
Seate of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then the Royall Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> And this bloud, ſo iuſtly ſhed, will bee found, not in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>France</hi> may ſpeake much more, in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and bloudie Maſſacre vnder <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, procured by <hi>Babylonian</hi> operations; and therefore, when the report thereof came vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhee like a bloudie <hi>Whore</hi> (ſo the Scripture calleth her) applauded that <hi>Thracian,</hi> or rather <hi>Scythian</hi> crueltie of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſang her <hi>Te Deum,</hi> in publique gratulation of that horrible fact, diſburſed her <hi>Indulgences,</hi> out of her ſpirituall Treaſures, for the benefit of the cruell Murtherers; and ſo ſent her <hi>gifts</hi> abroad, as reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in their ruine. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 10.11. <hi>&amp;c. France</hi> can yet ſpeake more, which, in the end of the Reigne of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the Third, and beginning of the Reigne of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Fourth, opened the veines of her bodie, and let forth ſtreames of her owne bloud, by the prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Babylon,</hi> till it was ſtanched by the vnhappie ſubmiſſion of that great King vnto the Triple-crowne. Yet then alſo hee could not bee ſecure; for ſome principall <hi>Babylonians,</hi> ſuppoſing that the King confeſſed that with his mouth, which hee denied in his heart, <hi>Iohn Chaſtell</hi> (a young Diſciple of old Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites) was ſuborned to offer violence vpon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Maieſtie of the Kings perſon; but could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that Tragicall act, which <hi>Rauilliac</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards effectuate with his moſt wicked hand. But I proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Germany</hi> can ſpeake more, then any other Nation; whoſe terrible warres (ſtirred, continued, and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the meanes of <hi>Babylon</hi>) for many yeeres, in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18730:64"/>
the reigne of ſundry Emperours, embrued the earth with copious effuſion of Chriſtian bloud; making it a true <hi>Adamah</hi> (an <hi>earth red</hi> with bloud) and giuing it her originall name againe. As for <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhee cannot be ſilent in this caſe, if ſhe remember the bloudy facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> with ſundry warres, raiſed vp by <hi>Papall</hi> furie, and ſometimes managed by their owne perſons; forgetting, that <hi>they, who take the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword, Matth.</hi> 26.52.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> it ſelfe, which in tedious, and expenſiue warres (procured, enterpriſed by Papall motions; and what the Pope could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, with his owne temporall meanes to aſſiſt this warre, hee performed by the <hi>Spirituall Exchequer;</hi> diſpenſing his <hi>Indulgences</hi> thence, to further, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the ſame) conſumed much treaſure of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and more of their bloud? But you will ſay; it was an heroicall, and glorious act. I anſwer; looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Popes deſignes, and intentions therin, with the iſſue of that glory. You will ſay; it was a pious, and a religious act. I anſwer; the pretence is more ſpecious, then the enterpriſe is alwayes iuſt, in ſuch a caſe. For it may be diſputed; Whether, or how farre forth, it is lawfull for Chriſtian Princes, vpon the pure, and ſole title of Religion, to make ſuch warres vpon the <hi>Turke;</hi> who, by the power of the ſword, and by ſubmiſſion of the people, and by long poſſeſſion, hath ſuch an intereſt into thoſe lands; the matter of faith, and religion, neither giuing vnto any Prince, nor taking from any, the proprietie of his temporall, and worldly ſtate. Such is the doctrine of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture; ſuch was the practiſe of the ancient Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:18730:65"/>SECONDLY, The crueltie of <hi>Babylon</hi> appeareth, in ſtirring vp perſecution againſt the profeſſours of Gods eternall, and inuincible truth; which no policie of man, no furie of diuells, can poſſibly extinguiſh; becauſe it is founded vpon the <hi>true rock,</hi> Chriſt Ieſus; and not vpon the pretenſed rocke (or rather ſtocke) of the Apoſtaticall Seate in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now if I ſhould here make a particular account of her crueltie in this kind, againſt the perſons of many Martyrs, it would exceed the proportion of one, or many Sermons. Or, if I would make it yet more generall, by a ſuruey of perſecutions in many Countries, by ſword, and by fire (which burning zeale yet lodgeth in their <hi>Scythian</hi> hearts) the relation would bee as tedious, as it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, ſince the hiſtories of ſundry Nations are extant in this behalfe, and a great part of them is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently collected by the induſtrious pen of Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>But why doe I repaire vnto more ancient times, for proofe of their <hi>crueltie?</hi> The ſound whereof hath ſo lately paſſed the Seas from miſerable <hi>France,</hi> vnto happy <hi>England;</hi> the ſecure, and comfortable harbour of many diſtreſſed ſoules. O <hi>France,</hi> ſtill cruell vnto thy ſelfe: the bloud is yet warme in thy fields, which the <hi>Cadmaean</hi> brethren (thy vnfortunate children) haue lately ſpilt in mutuall, and inteſtine conflicts. But by what incantation? Of <hi>Babylon;</hi> whoſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full operation in the malignant, and actiue ſpirits of the <hi>Ignatian</hi> ſect, hath ſo bewitched thee, to ſacrifice thy bloud vnto her Altars; for, in her, God ſhall find it, when the iuſtice of heauen ſhall heare the cry of the earth. Haſt thou not yet ſeene, by ſundry ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18730:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(ô miſerably ſeduced <hi>France</hi>) the iniuſtice of thy proceedings, in the infelicitie of thy ſucceſſe? Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeuerall drop of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> bloud hath had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection into ſo many new ſeuerall <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which haue ſprung, and riſen out of the ſame. So truely is the bloud of Martyrs the ſeed of the Church. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy S. <hi>Bartholomew;</hi> thy <hi>Sicilian veſpers,</hi> in that great, and dreadfull maſſacre; when, in the verie inſtant, and moment of the hotteſt perſecution, God gaue thee a preſent, and prodigious ſigne of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſtrange euent. For many are yet aliue in <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſaw, to their admiration, that, beyond the courſe of nature, and aboue the iudgement of reaſon, a white thorne tree, in a certaine Churchyard of that populous Citie, was ſuddenly cloathed with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of white bloſſomes, as in the moneth of <hi>May.</hi> Sundry were the coniectures vpon this ſigne, acccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeuerall inclinations; ſome ſuppoſing, that God gaue thereby a ſufficient notice vnto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Catholikes, of the new glorie, and flouriſhing eſtate of their Church; others conceiuing, that God did thereby miniſter a comfortable hope, or rather a certaine aſſurance, vnto the Proteſtants, that, when, in humane iudgement, they might ſeeme to bee vtterly deſtroied, and brought to finall ruine, yet God, againſt, and aboue the opinion of mortall men, would reſtore them vnto a more happy condition, then euer they did enioy before; with an vnexpectable augmentation, and rare increaſe. Now (ſaith <hi>Thuanus;</hi> a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Papiſt;</hi> but yet no <hi>Hugonot</hi>) if wee caſt our eyes vpon the iſſue of this bloudie fact, the ſucceſſe may eaſily ſhew, which interpretation was more true,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18730:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and proper in this behalfe. Thus you haue heard the generall crueltie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in ſundrie Nations; but particularly in <hi>France;</hi> the publike Theater of Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in this kind.</p>
               <p>And now, my natiue Countrie of <hi>England;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy bloud, which <hi>Babylon</hi> hath ſhed; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe is not yet ſatisfied; that horſe-leech hath not yet her fill. The heate, which is in the ſtomackes of ſome <hi>Babylonians,</hi> breaketh out in the fire of their mouthes, when they dare vomit vp the malice of their hearts, and ſpeake of <hi>fire and faggot,</hi> while their owne neckes (by power of the Lawes, ſtanding in force) lye vnder the danger of the ſword. <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot put off her cruell nature; ſuch Mother, ſuch Children; a <hi>Panther</hi> is not more cruell to a man, then a true <hi>Babylonian</hi> vnto a ſincere Chriſtian. O Lord; if ſinners may bee ſuitors for grace, and fauour at thy mercifull hands, deliuer not thy poore children into the power of <hi>Babylon</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, the crueltie of <hi>Babylon</hi> appeareth in the deſtruction of her owne children; when, one Pope riſing vp againſt another, and a third againſt them both, euery <hi>Peter</hi> betooke himſelfe vnto his ſword; one excommunicating, and depoſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſuch a generall diſtraction of <hi>Europe,</hi> that (as our Country-man, <hi>Tho. Walſingham,</hi> doth relate) two hundred thouſand perſons loſt their liues in theſe bloudie contentions of the Antipopes; ſo that the Church may more iuſtly ſay vnto the Pope; <hi>Thou art a bloudy Father vnto mee,</hi> then <hi>Zipporah</hi> could ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto <hi>Moſes; Thou art a bloudy husband vnto mee:</hi> for ſhee cut off onely the fore-skin of her child, to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18730:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaue the life of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but the Church loſt many of her childrens liues, to ſaue the glorie of the Pope; whoſe bloud ſhed for, and by <hi>Babylon,</hi> muſt alſo bee found in her.</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY, the crueltie of <hi>Babylon</hi> appeareth in her approbation of the moſt execrable treaſons; as namely, in <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth (the Emperour) againſt his owne Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; which prodigious fact, as <hi>Babylon</hi> did incenſe him vnto, ſo ſhe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him, for an act of ſingular pietie, and deuotion vnto the Church, as preferring his ſpirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his naturall Father. But by whoſe pen doth this incredible villany appeare? euen of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> himſelfe; a <hi>Babylonian</hi> flatterer, a ſycophant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling that fact with praiſe vnto the heauens, which the heauens bluſhed to ſee, and the earth trembleth to remember.</p>
               <p>But what teſtimony can <hi>France</hi> affoord vnto vs in this kind? I ſpake before of <hi>Babylons</hi> exultation, and ioy vpon the newes of that bloudie maſſacre. Well <hi>Babylon; thou haſt thirſted after bloud</hi> (as <hi>Tomyris</hi> ſaid to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when ſhee threw his head into a veſſell, filled with bloud) <hi>drinke thy fill of bloud,</hi> by thy barbarous crueltie; thou ſhalt, one day, drinke thy fill of bloud by the diuine vltion of the greateſt Iudge; now thou drinkeſt other mens; then thou ſhalt drinke thine owne.</p>
               <p>But I let paſſe this example (though neuer to bee forgotten) and I come to one (in ſtead of all) which requireth your beſt attention, and due ponderation; and that is, the murther committed by <hi>Iames</hi> (falſly ſirnamed <hi>Clement;</hi> as <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> ſaith, that many
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18730:67"/>
Popes alſo beare their names vntruly; <hi>Pius,</hi> yet wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; <hi>Clemens,</hi> yet cruell, &amp;c. as, in Greeke, the ſame word ſignifieth a <hi>bow,</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> whereupon <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ſaid well; <hi>A bow hath the name of life, but the worke of death;</hi> ſo had this <hi>Clement;</hi> ſo haue many Popes) vpon the perſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the French King, of vnhappy condition, and name alſo; euen as that of <hi>Caius</hi> was in the family of the <hi>Caeſars;</hi> few of them came vnto a mature, and peaceable end.</p>
               <p>Now, though I cannot certainely ſay, that <hi>Babylon,</hi> or ſome ſpeciall agent for her, did particularly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate this <hi>Clement</hi> vnto that bloudie fact, yet I may more truly ſay of him, that hee was <hi>plenus Babylone,</hi> full of <hi>Babylon</hi> in his heart (and ſo, for her ſake, was incited vnto that odious treaſon) then <hi>Campian</hi> (more rhetoricall in his flaſhes, then ſubſtantiall in his proofes) ſaith of <hi>Pultrot,</hi> who killed the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> with a ſhot, that he was <hi>plenus Beza;</hi> full of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, drawne from the breaſt of <hi>Beza;</hi> who neuer gaue counſell before, nor approbation afterward, vnto that act of <hi>Pultrot,</hi> as <hi>Mariana</hi> the Ieſuite hath approoued that execrable fact of <hi>Clement:</hi> yea, <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> himſelfe gaue extraordinary applauſe thereunto, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt arriuall of that newes in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Marke it well, as a matter of ſpeciall importance, for ſundry cauſes. For whereas the Kings moſt excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in his learned, and accurate writings, publiſhed by himſelfe, to iuſtifie <hi>the Oath of Alleagance</hi> (impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Babylon</hi>) did worthily obiect vnto the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> the approbation of this horrible treaſon by <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> in his Oration, pronounced vnto the Cardinalls, in his Conſiſtorie, to this purpoſe; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18730:67"/>
confidently anſwere, that this Oration was neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the Pope; that hee, liuing in <hi>Rome,</hi> heard no mention of it; that the Cardinalls, conuerſing then in the Court, proteſted, that they neuer had any knowledge of the ſame; and ſo the point is vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and muſt bee reputed for a deuice of ſuch, as were the enemies of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O bloudie Citie; it is all full of lyes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nahum</hi> the Prophet, of <hi>Nineuch,</hi> and I may now ſo ſpeake of <hi>Rome:</hi> for here is lying added vnto murthering; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie vnto crueltie: what veritie then, what equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what conſcience can you expect from her?</p>
               <p>Note therefore, that amongſt ſome Romiſh Prieſts, that tooke, and defended the <hi>Oath of Alleageance</hi> (though, for this cauſe, they haue beene cenſured, publikely in the Sermons of ſome Ieſuites, by the name of <hi>Wolues;</hi> ſuch as had no commiſſion to teach, to abſolue, to miniſter the Sacraments, &amp;c. as hauing loſt their whole authoritie, by taking this <hi>Oath,</hi> and perſwading others to doe the like, to the high preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and impugnation of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Seate, from whence it was deriued) there was one <hi>William Warmington,</hi> Chaplaine vnto Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> vpon the very time, that this <hi>panegyricall</hi> Oration proceeded from that vaine-glorious Pope; who, by his Pontificiall excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, depoſed our late gracious Queene, and now, in a ſolemne ſpeech, commended the murther (by way of admiration) which <hi>Clement</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated vpon the ſacred perſon of that vnhappy Prince.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Warmington</hi> therefore, in a booke, publiſhed for the defence of the ſaid <hi>Oath,</hi> doth freely, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18730:68"/>
confeſſe, that, this Oration being vttered, in the Conſiſtorie, by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> the Pope; his Lord, and Maſter (being then, and there preſent) was earneſtly requeſted, by ſome of the Cardinalls, to recollect the ſpeech of his Holineſſe, and to commit the ſame to writing; which he (being a man of ſingular memorie) did accordingly performe, with the commendations, and thankes of the ſaid Cardinalls; affirming, that, to their beſt remembrance, this coppie, preſented vnto them by Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> did truely containe, word for word, the verie Oration, pronounced vnto them by his Holineſſe; ſo that this was the originall, and Mother-coppie, whence ſo many tranſcripts were made, and iſſued forth into the publike view. And he ſaith further, that his ſpeciall friend, Maſter <hi>William Rainolds</hi> [author of <hi>Caluino-Turciſmus</hi>] remaining then in the Low Countries, and receiuing a tranſcript of the ſaid coppie from him, conceiued the ſaid ſpeech to bee a certaine approbation of that fact; as, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the forme, and matter thereof doe ſufficiently euince.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> where is thy conſcience of the truth? O <hi>Sixtus;</hi> where is thy tender reſpect of Chriſtian bloud? yea more, of Princes? and yet more, of the firſt borne, and eldeſt ſonne of thy Church? O <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> where is thy ſhame, that dareſt thus admire, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, extoll (without one word, or ſyllable of diſlike; that ingenuitie is not in thy <hi>whoriſh</hi> breaſt) ſuch a murther, ſo wickedly executed, and vpon ſo great a Prince?</p>
               <p>FIFTHLY, and laſtly, the crueltie of <hi>Babylon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, by her doctrines tending to the effuſion of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18730:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bloud. She can depoſe Kings from their States: ſhee can abſolue Subiects from their Alleageance; ſhe can beſtow Kingdomes at her pleaſure: ſhee can ſtirre vp hoſtile inuaſions: ſhee can authorize ſecret murthers of Princes, by Daggers, Poyſons, or any other dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable meanes; as you ſhall heare in my ſecond Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from <hi>Mariana,</hi> a Ieſuite; as farre from the true nature of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as neere vnto his ſacred name.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that many Emperours, and Princes, in ancient times, fearefully obſeruing the powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that their liues, with their eſtates, ſtood (by vertue thereof) in perpetuall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (for he may eaſily take away the life of another, that contemneth his owne; as many inchanted <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> doe) were therefore compelled, by humane feare, to entertaine that vnitie, and correſpondencie with her, in outward tearmes, which they hated, and contemned in their inward thoughts. For as <hi>Porſenna,</hi> the ancient King of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> was induced to ſpare the life, and farther torment of <hi>Mutius</hi> (a confident, and glorious <hi>Romane;</hi> who offered priuate violence vnto his Royall perſon) when hee heard <hi>Mutius</hi> ſolemnely proteſting; that the death of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenna</hi> was certainly concluded vpon, by a number of <hi>Romanes,</hi> no leſſe reſolute vnto that action, then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and no leſſe reſolued to ſuffer any torment, then to aduenture vpon any perill, for that end, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and thereupon <hi>Porſenna,</hi> deſiſting from his warres, made a peace with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> out of feare, and not of loue: ſo there haue beene ſundry Princes, in former Ages, that perceiuing this vehement, and formidable inclination in the <hi>Romanists,</hi> to act any
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18730:69"/>
villanie, and to ſuffer any penaltie, ſo that they might attaine vnto their deſired end [to ſubuert Kingdomes, to depoſe Kings, to lay violent hands vpon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c.] were thereby inforced to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch; rather chooſing to liue vnder his tyrannie, then to die by his deſignes. Thus alſo euery man, that ſtandeth in ſpeciall oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition vnto <hi>Babylon</hi> (the Mother of Murthers) may truly ſay with <hi>Dauid; There is but a ſtep betweene me, and death.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.3. Howbeit, that ſhould bee the reſolution of euery Chriſtian Prince, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Gods truth, which was the reckoning of vertuous <hi>Hester,</hi> in the behalfe of her people; <hi>If I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, I periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet feare not, O Religious Princes; it is Gods cauſe, which you maintaine; therefore hee will alſo maintaine you: he will defend the defenders of his Faith: hee hath a better guard of holy Angels about your Royall perſons. The diffidence of his preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in any ariſeth from the imbecillitie of faith, not reſting vpon his word, and promiſe. If the noble aſpect of <hi>Scipio</hi> bred ſuch an awfull reuerence in the hearts of theeues, and murtherers, that they did therefore rather admire his vertue, then ſeeke his life, when they came into his preſence; doubt yee not, but that God will worke ſuch an impreſſion of feare in the hearts of <hi>Babylonian</hi> Traytors, that they ſhall not dare attempt, or (at the leaſt) not effectuate any courſe of violence, and iniquitie, againſt your ſacred Perſons.</p>
               <p>Finally, to conclude this point of <hi>Romiſh</hi> crueltie; let no faithfull, and ſincerely affected <hi>Nazianzen</hi> an

Be couragious, then, in the behalfe of Gods eternall truth: feare not the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of <hi>Babylon;</hi> death is the debt of Nature, by the deſert of ſinne: to die for Gods cauſe, it is an act of glorie in this World, and it hath a reward in Heauen. Let thy tongue, therefore, ſpeake; and thy pen write; and thy heart pray; let not our feare of <hi>Babylons</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie increaſe their hope of our ruine.

               <p>THe fift, and laſt point (which I now reſolue to touch) in this compariſon, is, IMPIETIE of life.

ſuch Heads, and wondering that ſuch an impure, and wicked wretch ſhould aſſume ſo gracious a name, as that is both by ſignification, and by the perſons, that did ſometimes beare the ſame. Wherevpon hee ſaith, that, in his opinion, the Pope did thereby intend to deceiue the World, which might ſuppoſe, that <hi>there was a man, ſent from God, whoſe name was Iohn.</hi> So writeth he of that Boy-<hi>Pope;</hi> that egregious Varlet, who, by the meanes of a Whore, ſate in <hi>the Whore of</hi> Babylon; as a fit Incumbent of that Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call See.</p>
               <p>Now if I would proſecute the Hiſtorie of thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> alone, who did vntruly weare the garment of this name (which might ſeeme to couer the turpitude of their liues) it were more eaſie to finde a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then an end of my diſcourſe: for <hi>Babylon</hi> had many <hi>Iohns</hi> (beſides a <hi>Ioane</hi>) but few of them good; and the laſt of that name (<hi>Iohn</hi> 21. or 23. for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> diſagree vpon the number of theſe <hi>Popes</hi>) had ſuch accuſations produced, and verified by Oath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for matters of doctrine, and of life, in the great Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> vpon the yeare 1414. that, as the name of <hi>Tarquin</hi> was hatefull in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo the name of <hi>Iohn</hi> became execrable in the Church; and no <hi>Pope</hi> delighted to take it vpon him, ſince the time of that Councell.</p>

the other, to peruert our iudgement. <hi>In prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. lib. de Summo Pont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt, being to treate of the impieties of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers (ſuch, ſo prodigious, ſo innumerable, as perhaps no State of <hi>Pagans</hi> can parallel, much leſſe of <hi>Christians;</hi> be they Princes, or bee they Prelates) marke how cunningly hee ſeeketh to bring his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a ſuſpition of all Hiſtories; which he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accuſe of falſhood, then wee ſhould accuſe his <hi>Popes</hi> of impious, and wicked life. Thus therefore writeth the learned Cardinall; <hi>Quidam parùm probi Pontifices: &amp;c.</hi> Some <hi>Popes,</hi> being of little honeſtie, did ſometimes poſſeſſe, and gouerne the Apoſtolicall Seate. <hi>Parùm probi?</hi> Away with that tearme of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution: <hi>improbiſsimi, impijſsimi, diaboliſsimi, &amp;c.</hi> were fitter words for ſuch monſters, whoſe villanies no tongue can ſpeake with modeſtie, nor pen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. But let vs proceed. Who were thoſe <hi>parùm probi?</hi> He telleth you: <hi>Stephanus</hi> the ſixt, <hi>Leo</hi> the fift, <hi>Chriſtophorus</hi> the firſt, <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the twelfth, <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt. Then he addeth; <hi>alijque non pauci.</hi> Speake more plainly, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> mince not the matter; ſay not, <hi>non pauci</hi> [not a few others] but a great multitude of <hi>Popes;</hi> for ſo there was, if their owne Hiſtorians may deſerue our beliefe. But heere the <hi>Cardinall</hi> caſteth in his doubt; <hi>Si vera ſunt, que de eorum vita, &amp; rebus geſtis, apud hiſtoricos eorum temporum ſcripta leguntur:</hi> If (ſaith he) thoſe things be true, which the Hiſtories of thoſe times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord concerning the liues, and actions of theſe <hi>Popes. If they be true?</hi> His deſire was to denie all the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18730:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but, hauing not abilitie to diſprooue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he draweth the Hiſtories into queſtion, and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a ſecret dubitation in the minde of his Reader. This is the firſt paſſage in <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and he is more ingenuous, and modeſt in this caſe, then <hi>Baronius</hi> is often in the like; not only drawing an obſcuritie, or ſome doubt vpon ſuch Hiſtories, as diſtaſte his palate, and are againſt his purpoſe, but ſometimes diſclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them, correcting them at his pleaſure, forging others, without any apparant euidence; with many ſuch indirect, and prepoſterous courſes; which the <hi>Venetian</hi> Authours (while the controuerſie depended betwixt their State, and <hi>Paul</hi> the fift) doe carefully note in that diſhoneſt Authour; whom the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ſundrie <hi>Romane</hi> Catholickes, vpon ſeuerall occaſions (all tending to one crime of <hi>iniurious falſitie</hi>) doe brand moſt deeply in this behalfe. And thus hauing ſpoken ſome thing of theſe two <hi>Cardinall</hi> Brethren [the <hi>Castor,</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church] I will end with him, with whom I did firſt begin.</p>
               <p>His ſecond paſſage, therefore, is of more excellent note. Hee would diſcredit the Hiſtories, as falſe: hee could not: behold now a greater aduantage vnto his Church, if they be true. How can that bee? Is hee ſo skilfull a Workeman, that hee can make a <hi>Mercurie</hi> out of euery blocke; be it neuer ſo crooked, and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? He is: for marke his <hi>dilemma.</hi> If thoſe Hiſtories be falſe, then they make nothing againſt vs. If they bee true, yet they make very much for vs. How can this be? Becauſe the wickedneſſe of the <hi>Perſons</hi> doth prooue the ſanctitie, and perpetuitie of their <hi>Seate:</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:18730:72"/>
ſo that the iſſue of my labour (in ſhewing their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties) would be the preiudice of my cauſe.</p>
               <p>Heare therefore the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſpeaking in his owne words; <hi>Nihil est quòd haeretici, &amp;c. It is to no purpoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the heretickes to take ſo much paines, in ſearching out the vices of certaine Popes.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>For we confeſſe that they were not few.</hi> A good confeſſion: though before we heard him ſpeake in another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; <hi>Si vera ſunt;</hi> if thoſe things were true. Well: now they are true: now he confeſſeth the accuſation: but why? For hee hath inuented a new defence of the Seat by the old offences of the perſons. Heare him, therefore, againe in his owne words; <hi>Tantum abest, &amp;c. This is ſo farre</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from obſcuring, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the glorie of this Seate, that thereby it is rather exceedingly amplified, and increaſed; for that thereby we may perceiue, that it conſiſteth by the ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</hi> So he.</p>
               <p>But I perceiue no ſuch matter; howbeit I perceiue that nothing was ſo abſurd, which ſome Philoſopher would not maintaine: and nothing is ſo true, and forcible, which theſe <hi>Babylonians</hi> will not either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, or elude. And farther I perceiue, that <hi>recitaſſe, confutaſſe est;</hi> to recite their opinions, is to refute their follies.</p>
               <p>And laſtly I perceiue, that as it is Gods ſingular pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſuffer theſe Monarchs of <hi>Babylon</hi> a while, ſo there is a time of wrath to come (and it cannot bee farre off) when the <hi>Whore</hi> muſt periſh by fire, and her <hi>Beaſt</hi> muſt yeeld vnto the Sword. For as in this Sermon, you haue heard of a <hi>Babylon</hi> [the ſinne of <hi>Rome</hi>] in the ſubiect of my Text, ſo, in the next, you

               <p>FIRST, then, as the Church of God doth ſtand ſpecially indebted vnto him for this diuine Booke of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> wherein wee may plainely diſcouer the preſcience of God, in things to come, and the care of God in the adminiſtration of his Church, ſo, it being more darke vnto the ancient Fathers <hi>[ſo many ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſo many mysteries therein]</hi> and breeding more admiration, then bringing vtilitie vnto them, by the great obſcuritie thereof (ſo that the Pen-man of this ſacred Booke might truly ſay, <hi>Scripſi, &amp; non ſcripſi;</hi> I haue written, and not written, I haue reuealed, and yet concealed, the future condition of the Church) therefore, now wee ſtand bound vnto God in a new, and farther obligation, for that wee, in the ſucceſſe of time, and euent of things, haue attained, in ſundrie particulars of greateſt conſequence (and namely, in this myſterie of <hi>Babylon</hi>) vnto ſuch a perſpicuous, and infallible vnderſtanding of this <hi>Booke;</hi> which is the <hi>Beniamin</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt (the principall Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) the Sonne of his right hand; the laſt borne, in the whole Iſſue of the Scripture, which hee begate vnto his Church; the concluſion of that Oracle, whence we deriue our Faith.</p>
               <p>This Booke is, therefore, vnto vs, the apparant Seale of Gods prouidence, a ſtrong bulwarke of our Faith, an incurable wound of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, a certaine expugnation of the Antichriſtian Church. For though the learned Ieſuite <hi>Ludouicus ab Alcaſar,</hi> in his copious expoſition of this Booke, doth

               <p>The truth is this (good Chriſtian hearers) that though <hi>Ribera</hi> firſt, and <hi>Viegas</hi> after him, doe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deny, that <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon</hi> now, or that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> euer ſhall ſo bee, or that the <hi>Citie</hi> it ſelfe, while ſhee remaineth in ſubiection to the Pope, ſhall deſerue that name, yet, by making ſuch a plaine, and faire confeſſion (which the very euidence of the Text, with the due coherence of all circumſtances therein, did neceſſarily extort from their pens) that <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon</hi> alſo in another, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This conſequence <hi>Ludonicus ab Alcaſar,</hi> either well perceiuing, or vehemently ſuſpecting it to enſue vpon the ſaid confeſſion of his brethren, hath therefore caſt a new myſt vpon the matter, drawne a vayle before our eyes, contradicted their expoſition, wreſted the ſacred Text vnto his <hi>fooliſh,</hi> and ridiculous fancie (as if the <hi>ſtate</hi> of this <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her <hi>fall,</hi> were paſt) that ſo wee might not diſcerne the true <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is now preſent, nor her certaine <hi>fall,</hi> which is yet to come. But let mee here ſpeake a word, or two (for I am to paſſe vnto other matters) touching this learned <hi>grando; Ludouicus ab Alcaſar.</hi> If this <hi>Babylon</hi> be <hi>Rome,</hi> onely in her <hi>Ethnicall eſtate;</hi> and if <hi>Rome</hi> haue not any other <hi>fall,</hi> but only a <hi>mysticall</hi> fall; <hi>viz.</hi> by falling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> from that eſtate (which eſtate hath now beene extinct, neere vpon the ſpace of one thouſand &amp; three hundred yeres) and yet it appeareth, in the frame and tenour of the ſacred Booke of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> that no ſpeciall and notable matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall prediction therein, doth interuene, or come betwixt the ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which is deſcribed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically, Chapter 18. there being a <hi>prolepſis</hi> only, or briefe anticipation thereof, Chapter 14.8.) and the conſummation of the world (for, after the fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>

Chapter 18. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> proceedeth, Chapter 19. to an applauſe of the Saints, for her deſtruction: then, Chapter 20. to a recapitulation of things paſt, with a declaration of the generall Iudgement, being then ſhortly to come: then, finally, Chapter 21. and 22. to a deſcription of the heauenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition of the Saints therein, &amp;c.) it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that this voluminous Ieſuite of <hi>Alcaſar</hi> (this man of the Land of <hi>Nod</hi>) in the <hi>tohu,</hi> and <hi>bohu</hi> [the vanitie, and inanitie] of his large, and copious Commentarie vpon this diuine Booke, hath left open ſo wide a gap of one thouſand &amp; three hundred yeres (or neere vpon that ſpace) alreadie paſt, beſides that time, which is yet to come in the ſtate of the Church, and of the world, without any ſufficient matter, of Hiſtoricall prediction, to fill vp the ſame. And yet who doth not perceiue, by the beginning, and the ending of this Booke, that it doth, in the paſſages thereof, generally containe a perpetuall, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Hiſtorie of the Church, in her whole decourſe; euen, from the time of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> vnto the end of the world?</p>
               <p>Farewell, then, gentle <hi>Ludouicus ab Alcaſar,</hi> with your little wit, and leſſe honeſtie: and ſo I returne (my benigne, and courteous Auditors) vnto you againe.</p>
               <p>Reioyce you, therefore, in this ineſtimable Booke; embrace it with gratitude; conuerſe in it with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; admire what you vnderſtand, and, what you vnderſtand not, admire it the more; ſearch it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie; enter into it with praier; deſpiſe not the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others; preſume not vpon your owne; let not

the obſcuritie of ſome things, yet vnknowne, make you neglect the vtilitie of ſo many things (and, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, this myſterie of <hi>Babylon</hi>) alreadie knowne therein. Read it, reuerence it; repute it (as it is) the ſacred Oracle of God, committed vnto his Church, to ſuſtaine her patience, and to confirme her faith.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; wee haue great cauſe to commend Gods goodneſſe, and to applaud our owne happineſſe in the certaine, and cleere diſcouerie of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this diuine, and myſticall Booke. For as the <hi>Starre</hi> did lead the Wiſe-men to find out <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where Chriſt was borne, ſo this Scripture doth guide, and conduct vs vnto the knowledge of <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein Antichriſt doth reigne. <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate vs with her glorious title of <hi>the Mother-Church;</hi> for now wee know her to bee <hi>the Mother of Fornications:</hi> ſhee ſhall not inſult with the faire priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Apoſtolicall Seate;</hi> for now wee know her to be an Apoſtaticall Synagogue: ſhee ſhall not beare vs downe with the ſupremacie of a <hi>Papall Head-ſhip;</hi> for now wee know, who is the <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> intruding vpon the Seate, and Dominion of the former, with a larger challenge of power; <hi>extenſiuè,</hi> in place, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiuè,</hi> in degree: now we know, who hee is, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth himſelfe ouer Kings, and Emperours; ouer States, and Crownes; ouer Church, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by his falſe Keyes, and pretenſed Swords.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY; whereas this <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> cryeth out vpon our ſeparation from her Societie, wee are warranted, nay wee are commanded thereunto, by the voyce of God himſelfe; <hi>Goe out of her my people;</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:18730:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the reaſon is not there taken only from her ſinnes, in that ſhee is <hi>Babylon,</hi> but from her puniſhment alſo, in that ſhee ſhall <hi>fall;</hi> for ſo it followeth; <hi>that you bee not partakers in her ſinnes, and that you receiue not of her plagues;</hi> of which I am to treate, when I come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the predicate of my Text.</p>
               <p>Meane while you may obſerue, that this <hi>Exodus,</hi> this departure out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is <hi>Corporall</hi> (and not ſpirituall onely) unto ſch, as haue <hi>Locall</hi> communion with her, and dwell within her walls: but it is <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> onely, and not corporall, vnto ſuch, as, dwelling in <hi>England, France,</hi> &amp;c. haue <hi>doctrinall</hi> communion with her; and are members, depending vpon her head: ſo that this word <hi>her</hi> [goe out of her] im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth not onely her ſite, and place, but her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and errours. Goe then ſpecially out of theſe, ô you his people, whether within, or without her walls; whether you bee in <hi>Rome</hi> (where God hath ſome people, euen by the teſtimony of the Text) or whether in any other part of the world. And ſince ſhee caſteth you out of her ſocietie, deſire it not; for it is vnto your owne danger; ſhee doth that for you, which God requireth you to doe for your ſelues.</p>
               <p>And now let mee, in a few words, addreſſe my ſpeech vnto rhetoricall <hi>Campian,</hi> inſulting vpon the Proteſtants, with his termes of deriſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; <hi>Audito nomine Eccleſiae hoſtis expalluit,</hi> ſaith hee: our aduerſarie waxed pale, when hee heard the very name of the Church; as if the Proteſtant could produce no <hi>Catalogue of names,</hi> for any viſible

exiſtencie, and lawfull ſucceſſion of his Church; which <hi>Rome</hi> onely hath, and the Proteſtant hath not. How ſhallow, weake, malicious, and vnlearned a pretence this is (either againſt vs, or for themſelues) it is now no conuenient <hi>time,</hi> nor proper <hi>occaſion</hi> to diſpute: I will attend both, as it ſhall pleaſe God, in his prouidence, to direct mee in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>But vnto <hi>Campian</hi> I returne my anſwere, truely, fairely, and pertinently, by the verdict of my Text. <hi>Audito nomine</hi> Babylonis <hi>hoſtis expalluit;</hi> our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie waxed pale, vpon the very name of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> it troubled his wit; it vexed his heart; it is a terrour vnto his ſoule: for hee liueth in that, from which hee ought to flye, if hee haue any part in <hi>Gods people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as the cauſe of our ſeparation from <hi>Rome</hi> is neceſſarie, in many reſpects, and is grounded here, vpon ſuch a principle, as cannot bee denied, ſo wee need not depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> but becauſe ſhe is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and as ſhe is <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſhe is departed from God, and from his truth (ſtanding vpon his Word) and as ſhe is departed from her ſelfe, as ſhe was in the more pure, and ancient times, in which no <hi>Catalogue of names</hi> can bee produced, to iuſtifie any ſucceſſion in thoſe doctrines, wherein wee iuſtly diſſent from them, and they vniuſtly from the Primitiue Church. O how gladly would we returne vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> if ſhee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto her ſelfe? Shee will not doe the one; therefore wee cannot doe the other.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point; ſince the iniudicious auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of one errour draweth vs into the danger of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18730:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(<hi>Arrius</hi> was in oppoſition vnto <hi>Sabellius;</hi> and <hi>Eutyches</hi> vnto <hi>Nestorius;</hi> but all in errour) let men be well, and ſoundly aduiſed in their departure from this <hi>Babylon,</hi> leſt they erect a new <hi>Babylon,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of their owne fancies, by Anabaptiſticall furie, and Anarchicall paritie, through a miſpriſion of things, vpon falſe, vnlearned, and dangerous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; namely, that <hi>the way, to come neereſt to the truth, is to goe fartheſt from the Pope:</hi> that <hi>the Church of Chriſt muſt ſtand in an vniuerſall contrarietie vnto Rome:</hi> that <hi>the meanes, to bring things vnto a medietie, and proper ſtate, is to runne into an oppoſite, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe;</hi> as, to bring a crooked ſticke vnto ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you muſt wreathe, and force it the other, and the contrary way. Which inſtance being made to this purpoſe, by a learned man (ſtanding in the tearmes of inconformitie to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> (that Oracle of Theologie) made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto him very well; that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was alreadie come to her medietie, and ſetled eſtate; but, by this inſtance, it ſeemeth that the ſaid learned man, with ſome others (running a way of extreame oppoſition) were yet to come vnto ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medietie, and condition, after they had thus bowed things vnto a contrarie courſe. And, to ſay the truth (vpon certaine experience) to auoyde the <hi>Scylla</hi> of one ſhipwracke, ſome men runne indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of another; being ſo tranſported with intemperate Zeale, that, without Learning, Wiſdome, or Conſcience, they impute the name of <hi>Poperie</hi> vnto any thing, that they ignorantly diſtaſt,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18730:78"/>
and caſt the aſperſion of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> vpon any perſon, that they maliciouſly diſaffect. Such ciuill warres in the Church haue their end without triumph; of which point I ſhall ſpeake more anon.</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY; great is the happineſſe of our <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> being deliuered from the yoake, and tyrannie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which held them both in ſeruitude, and captiuitie, for many yeeres. For if any Land may iuſtly complaine, that <hi>cruell Lords haue had the dominion ouer them;</hi> ENGLAND might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of this indignitie, and did often complaine of it, with many, and bitter teares; and particularly in the Reigne of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Third, whom (as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> doth relate) the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch ſtiled his <hi>Vaſſall,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> his <hi>Iade;</hi> for ſhee did beare his burthens of oppreſſion, in ſundry expilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deepe exhauſtions of her Treaſure. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the reigne of his Sonne (King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt) hee ſent forth peremptory interdictions vnto all the Cleargie of this Land, requiring them vpon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their obedience vnto the Apoſtolicall Seat, not to contribute their Subſidies, and iuſt reliefe, vnto their Souereigne Lord, the King; directly, and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the preſcription of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vnto all Chriſtian ſubiects (though vnder vnbeleeuing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) inſtructing them to <hi>giue tribute, vnto whom they owe tribute, Rom.</hi> 13. O the rare Diuinitie of <hi>Babylon!</hi> The Cleargie of <hi>England</hi> muſt giue monies vnto the Pope, if hee require them; but not vnto the King, if he forbid them.</p>
               <p>Vpon this occaſion enſued a rebellious oppoſition
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18730:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie [Peckham</hi> by name] againſt his lawfull Souereigne; that victorious, and puiſſant King (as, indeed, the Pope ſeldome wanted a Prelate in that See, to concurre with him againſt the King) to the iuſt prouocation of his Royall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and no ſmall inconuenience of the whole Cleargie in this Land.</p>
               <p>But leauing temporall things (wherein this Iland ſuffered great calamitie, and vexation by the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Monarchs; drawing monies out of mens purſes, and withdrawing their obedience from their naturall Lords, and Kings) I come vnto ſpirituall things, wherein your deliuerance, from <hi>Babylon,</hi> pertaineth vnto the ſoule, and miniſtreth vnto you matter of higher contemplation; as namely, that you are freed from dangerous errous of falſe doctrines; from the oppreſſion of conſcience, wherein the Pope did reigne, and tyrannize; from the vncomfortable, and ridiculous ſeruice of God in an vnknowne tongue; from proſtitution of the bodie, and ſoule vnto ſtocks, and ſtones; from Idolatrous adoration of a breaden God; from the vexing feare of fained Purgatorie; from the vaine hope of <hi>Babylonian</hi> Pardons; and finally (in a word) from the vanitie of vncertaine traditions, with a number of ſuperſtitions, and fopperies, whoſe obſeruation was with great difficultie and little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; yea rather with ſingular detriment, vnto the glorie of God, and perfection of his Church. Which things being iuſtly caſt out of this Church (as Chriſt expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abuſes out of the Temple; <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15.) you haue a peaceable ſtate of conſcience toward God, in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18730:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſweet libertie of his truth, vnder a gracious, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souereigne; a ſincere Profeſſour, and a conſtant Protectour of the ſame.</p>
               <p>FIFTLY; they beare a ſpeciall obligation to God for his ſingular mercie, whom hee hath drawne out of the ſocietie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and from the contagion of her cup; which, with <hi>Circaean</hi> intantations, metamorphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth men into beaſts, intoxicating them with her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous dregges; till God, of his meere grace, ſeeking them, who had loſt themſelues, take away the veile of errour from their eyes, and make them vnderſtand, <hi>from whence [Apoc.</hi> 2.5.] and <hi>to what,</hi> they are fallen. Though they wanted his preuenient grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fell, yet they had his excitant grace, and therefore roſe againe: and if they haue aſſiſtant grace, none are more humble in their minds, none are more carefull of their wayes, none are more gratefull vnto God, none are more ſeruiceable vnto the Church. Let not the elder brother repine at the reuerſion and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the younger: why ſhould man ſhew his enuie, where God doth ſhew his pittie? Acknowledge thy owne infirmitie in thy brothers fall: commend Gods grace in his reſtitution to his eſtate; the neerer he was to Hell, the neerer he may be to Heauen.</p>
               <p>SIXTLY; whereas many, out of the inſufficiencie of knowledge, or weakneſſe of iudgement, or neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Religion (ſetting vp the ſaile of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vnto the wind of time) incline ſtrongly vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> or proſtitute themſelues wholy vnto her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; let them conſider, that it is BABYLON (hated of God, and ordained to deſtruction) which

they embrace: and though they liue corporally in <hi>England, France, &amp;c.</hi> that yet they liue ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in her; that they are members of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that therefore they muſt weare the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her name; they are BABYLONIANS, in their true, and proper title. Let them, then, reiect the name of a PAPIST (the inuention, they ſay of LVTHER, but well accommodated, for many cauſes, vnto the vaſſals of the POPE) let them contemne the impoſition of it (though they cannot auoid it) but yet they ſhall neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline this title, which the ſacred Scripture it ſelfe, ſo anciently, ſo notably, ſo ineuitably doth faſten vpon them, to their outward ſhame, and inward griefe. Let them glorie in <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declareth to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> if it be any glorie to triumph in her, that, from <hi>exaltation</hi> (as the name of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſignifie in the holy tongue) ſhall come to <hi>confuſion;</hi> as the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> doth import: the name is changed (<hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Babylon</hi>) the ſtate is changed; glorie into ſhame. Know then, O vnhappie children of the <hi>Romane</hi> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, that you are <hi>Babylonians,</hi> carrying the name of your <hi>Mother,</hi> according to the verdict of Scripture, as well as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> carrying the name of your <hi>Father,</hi> according to the proofe of reaſon. So then we will ſpeake with the Scripture, and not with <hi>Luther;</hi> you are <hi>Babylonians;</hi> this is your name; anſwere vnto it; for by it, you ſtand indic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Barre of the diuine iudgement.</p>
               <p>SEVENTHLY; if <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18730:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
muſt goe out of it,</hi> why doe ſome men perſwade you to goe vnto her, or, at the leaſt, to meete her? As if the differences in Religion, betwixt you, and her, were not ſo <hi>materiall,</hi> but that you may relinquiſh your opinions; or elſe not ſo <hi>reall,</hi> but that you, and ſhee, by the aduiſe of ſome Modificators, and temperate men, might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled together.</p>
               <p>But I will diſcouer the impoſſibilitie of their deuiſe, by foure euident, and perſpicuous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> there are many points, which admit no reconciliation; eſpecially ſuch, as concerne the <hi>Subiect;</hi> namely, whether the thing, vpon which we diſpute, ſimply bee, or bee not at all. As for example; the Papiſts diſpute amongſt themſelues, whether <hi>Purgatorie</hi> bee in <hi>Hell;</hi> whether it haue a <hi>corporall fire;</hi> whether <hi>Deuills be the Tormentors;</hi> whether a ſoule bee in it for <hi>ten, or one hundred yeares, &amp;c.</hi> but they diſpute not, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (by way of doubt) whether there bee a <hi>Purgatorie</hi> or not; for they differ onely about the <hi>Praedicata,</hi> or attributes, thereof, whereas they all agree concerning the <hi>Subiect;</hi> that there is an eſtate of ſoules in temporall paine. Now wee denie the <hi>Subiect</hi> it ſelfe; and therefore the queſtion, propoſed betwixt vs, and them is; <hi>Whether there be any</hi> PVRGATORIE <hi>or not?</hi> Which either is, or it is not; and ſo there is no reconciliation in the differences of this nature, betwixt vs, and them: for, betwixt <hi>eſt,</hi> and <hi>non eſt</hi> [it is; and it is not] there is no middle thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18730:80"/>But if the queſtion be <hi>de Praedicato,</hi> how this, or that agreeth vnto the ſubiect (as namely, <hi>what reall preſence of Chriſts bodie</hi> is in the Sacrament) heere, perhaps, ſome reconciliation might haue beene deuiſed in this behalfe, had not they, in this (and ſo in many other points) excluded all meanes of reconciliation alſo, by their definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſolutions, and modifications of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,</hi> in ſuch a manner, as cannot conſiſt with the truth of Gods Word, and euident princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon. As namely, they haue defined the <hi>reall preſence</hi> to be by <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> of the Elements into the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, hauing an inuiſible exiſtencie vnder the formes of Bread and Wine. This modification, beeing thus concluded by them, and now reputed an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Article of Faith, there is no meanes of reconciliation in this caſe alſo; nor in many other points, of like qualitie, and condition vnto this; for <hi>what communion hath light with darkneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> therefore, they haue, by certaine Councels (the infallible, and irreuocable Oracles of their Religion) ſo defined, and ſo reſolued theſe, and many other things, that, if wee cannot come to them, in their points (in regard of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine falſhood, or of vncertaine truth in them) they cannot come to vs, in our points, in regard of their owne principles, from which, if they once depart, they renuerſe, and ouerthrow the very foundation of all their faith, ſtanding who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18730:81"/>
vpon their late Councels, and Popes.</p>
               <p>Whence it is, that they giue vs no leaue to ſpeake dogmatically, and problematically of the meaneſt point in their Religion (as of <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Indulgences, &amp;c.</hi>) in ſuch a manner, as that the point may haue a ſuppoſed truth, or that it may haue a poſſible falſhood; but they bind vs to receiue it indiſputably, as to be beleeued by neceſſitie, and vpon the certaine perill of ſaluation; and the reaſon is, becauſe (as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> teacheth; <hi>De Laicis cap.</hi> 19. §. <hi>Quintò) There is one, and but one rule of faith, whereby wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all, and euery point of faith;</hi> namely, <hi>the Word of God, expounded by the Church;</hi> meaning their late <hi>Romane</hi> Church. Therefore it is all one danger, to deny all their Articles, or to deny but any one Article [<hi>Indulgences,</hi> or the like] reſolued by a Councell, and ſo propounded by their Church; which, if ſhee had a certaintie of errour in one point, ſhould haue an vncertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of truth in all. Where then is the meanes of reconciliation, or what reconciliation can you make, while they inſiſt in this courſe? You muſt come wholy to them, for they will not come, in any one part, or parcell, vnto you; and that were not a reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> but a ſubmiſſion vnto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> the <hi>Babylonians</hi> haue aſſumed vnto themſelues the onely power of calling <hi>Councells</hi> (the moſt proper meanes to determine all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, by the verdict of Gods Word,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18730:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and teſtimony of his Church) the onely ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to define; the onely authoritie of doing, and proceeding after their owne pleaſure; and, finally, an vnqueſtionable infallibilitie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige vs vnto that, which they canonically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, and conclude. Where then is the meanes of reconciliation? If they could retrograde, and goe backe from any point, alreadie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by them, or from this courſe of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, it would bee as great a miracle vnto vs, as the retroceſſion, or going backe of the Sun, in the dyall of <hi>Ahaz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> themſelues defie this buſineſſe of reconciliation; they ſcorne it as ridiculous; they deteſt it as odious; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it as impoſſible. Therefore when <hi>Caſſander</hi> (as being a moderate Pontifician) entred vpon this deſigne, the rigid, and more ſeuere <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (as namely <hi>Iohannes à Louanio</hi>) wrote vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, and ſharply againſt this attempt; whom <hi>Bellarmine [de Laicis cap.</hi> 19.] doth follow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the ſame ſteps. Whence it is, that Maſter <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> the Ieſuite, writeth, in his <hi>Treatiſe of Mitigation,</hi> preciſely in this manner; <hi>Wee agree with the Proteſtants in this, that there can bee no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betwixt vs, and them, in Religion. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I may well approoue the aduiſed, and iudicious anſwere of <hi>Beza</hi> vnto the late, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy French King, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth; That hee would endeauour to reconcile the <hi>perſons</hi> [Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18730:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Papiſts] but not their <hi>Religions;</hi> the firſt being a charitable office; the ſecond an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible worke.</p>
               <p>To conclude this obſeruation, then; be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the pretenders of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> who would intangle your mindes with this vnlearned, fooliſh, and erroneous proiect; as <hi>Vlphila,</hi> a Biſhop of the <hi>Goths,</hi> did ſometimes inſnare the credulous, and ignorant people; aſſuring them, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, betwixt the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> and the <hi>Arrians,</hi> did conſiſt rather in the forme of words, then in the ſubſtance of matter; as <hi>Theodorit</hi> doth report; <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Reconcilers</hi> of the two Religions doe iuſtly deſerue your cenſure, ſo the ſecret <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> that hold outward conformitie with <hi>England,</hi> and inward correſpondencie with <hi>Rome,</hi> are to bee lamented, as well as deteſted; being no leſſe dangerouſly affected in the ſtate of their owne ſoules, then againſt the ſtate of this Church. Theſe are men, that ſtand like a needle in a dyall; North, and South: perſonally in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> affectionately in <hi>Rome:</hi> heterogeneous members of both, and neither Church: <hi>amphibia,</hi> creatures liuing in the two Elements of <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> they ſpeake both languages, of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> they comport themſelues ſo wiſely, that the preſent times may beare them, and the future receiue them: men more ſubtile for themſelues, then ſincere to any. It were to bee wiſhed, that, as men belieue (if ſuch men
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18730:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe belieue any thing) ſo they would confeſſe: For <hi>with the heart wee belieue to righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth wee confeſſe to ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EIGHTHLY; ſince <hi>Papall,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Rome,</hi> is that <hi>Babylon,</hi> which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth here propoſe, and exhibite in liuely colours vnto our view, I cannot, without indignation, or rather compaſſion, obſerue, that this truth (being of ſuch cleere euidence, and of ſo great conſequence for the conſolation of Gods Church, afflicted by her, and confuſion of <hi>Babylon,</hi> triumphing in her pride, malice, and crueltie vpon vs: as alſo prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the diuine Maieſtie, by her monſtrous Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by her falſe doctrines, by her baſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by her taking from the people the key of knowledge in the holy Scriptures, with many more abſurd, and impious courſes) ſhould bee ſo little regarded by ſome (vngratefull therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for this ſacred <hi>Reuelation,</hi> made vnto his Church) or ſo much queſtioned by others: who either, out of negligence, ſearch not into this truth; or, out of a puzzeled vnderſtanding, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it; or, out of a preiudice, will not diſcerne it; but, like men in a ſecure, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Lethargie, with heauie and drowſie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, raiſe not vp their thoughts vnto a more acute penetration of ſo excellent, and ſo neceſſarie a point; for the prediction whereof, ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee owe much vnto the <hi>prouidence</hi> of God, and for the diſcouery of it, now ſo long after, in theſe our dayes, wee owe much vnto his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

And I doe more earneſtly preſſe all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines in this Church, vnto a ſerious, and diligent contemplation of this myſterie (now ſo reuealed vnto vs, which was concealed from our fathers) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall thereby inable themſelues, with more ſufficiencie of meanes, to confirme many in the truth; and to recall many from their errours; when they ſhall, by good diſcourſe of reaſon (foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the circumſtances of this Scripture; comparing it with other Scriptures, and with the euents of time; the ſucceſſe of things, in later Ages, concurring with the prediction in former) cleerely, and fairely perceiue that <hi>Rome</hi> (as now ſhee is, and long hath beene, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernment of the <hi>Pope</hi>) is the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Mother of Whoredomes,</hi> the Seate of the <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> the verie Synagogue, wherein Antichriſt doth reigne.

               <p>Since therefore, I doe ſo well apprehend the force, and efficacie of this truth (for which I giue moſt humble thankes vnto my benigne, and gracious Lord, and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt) I doe more willingly excite, and ſtirre vp my learned Brethren, to ſettle their iudgements vpon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and exact knowledge thereof; being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18730:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and readie, by ſpeciall demonſtration, and ſtrength of diſcourſe, to explicate the ſame in particular manner, and forme, <hi>omni poſcenti,</hi> to euerie one, that ſhall aske a reaſon of their aſſertion, and beliefe in this point; wherein now the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> themſelues <hi>(Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas)</hi> haue carryed vs ſecurely, and firmely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſpeculation of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſome others (conceiuing this <hi>Babylon</hi> to bee the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſocietie of the wicked, and no particular place) and beyond the deciſion of <hi>Hierome;</hi> ſuppoſing it to bee <hi>Ethnicall Rome,</hi> and ſo to bee alreadie paſt; at which wee doe not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, ſince <hi>Hierome</hi> by experience, ſaw that State paſt, but could not, by diuination, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee this to come; namely, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould bee the <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> and that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould bee <hi>Babylon</hi> vnder him; a matter not imaginable in thoſe more happie times.</p>
               <p>Therefore, though the ſaid Ieſuites, going beyond <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> confeſſe this <hi>Babylon</hi> to bee <hi>Rome,</hi> and, going beyond <hi>Hierome</hi> (yea beyond the moſt generall conceit of other <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi>) confeſſe it to bee <hi>Rome,</hi> in a new, ſecond, and latter eſtate (after the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtian Religion therein) but deny it to bee ſo, in regard of the <hi>Church</hi> at all, or of the <hi>Citie,</hi> as it now is, and while ſhee ſhall ſo remaine vnder the <hi>Pope;</hi> yet wee ſee them ſo wrapped vp in ſundrie inextricable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to maintaine this their determination of the

               <p>Hee therefore, that now ſeeth not this truth, hath a ſhallow head; and hee, that, ſeeing it, will yet diſſemble it, hath an hollow heart.

               <p>NINTHLY; ſince <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnitie, and peace, and concord ſhould reigne in the Church of God (which ſhee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to vndermine with her policie, and to ruinate with her power) that all may conſpire in a ſacred expedition, to performe the word, and worke of God, againſt <hi>Babylon;</hi> the denne of that accurſed <hi>Beaſt.</hi> For, if the diuerſitie of tongues hindred the ſetting of <hi>Literall Babylon</hi> vp, the diuerſitie of hearts will hinder the pulling of <hi>Spirituall Babylon</hi> downe. <hi>Let vs pray,</hi> then, <hi>for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18730:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the peace of Ieruſalem; let them proſper that loue it:</hi> let euery man endeauour to cure domeſticke wounds, and make none; that euery honeſt heart may beare witneſſe vnto it ſelfe, and ſay with the wiſe woman of <hi>Abel,</hi> in her Apologie for her Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; <hi>I am one of them that are peaceable, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Iſrael,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.19.</p>
               <p>TENTHLY; and laſtly, I conclude with a Morall obſeruation vpon this point. Since <hi>Rome</hi> is degenerate from her ancient ſtate, in purer times (when ſhee was a profeſſour of the truth, and a protectour of them, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred vnto her for defence thereof) hauing loſt her Excellencie, and forfeited her Name (by a ſorrowfull change of Glorious <hi>Rome,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Impure <hi>Babylon</hi>) wee may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Grace of GOD is not tyed to any place, not fixed to any Citie, not bound vnto any Kingdome; but as hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it freely, by his fauour, ſo hee taketh it away iuſtly for our ſinnes. Hence it is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtruction of this point, by <hi>Ribera,</hi> the Ieſuite) that this <hi>Rome</hi> (now faithfull, in his opinion) may become, and ſhall become <hi>Babylon</hi> heereafter, in her <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, Dominion, Power, Riches, &amp;c.</hi> (though indeed ſhee is now ſo, in all theſe things; neyther can it bee preſumed, by any reaſon, that ſhee ſhould become ſo within a little time, euen the ſpace of two or three yeeres, as they ridiculouſly conceiue, but neceſſarily ſuppoſe,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18730:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for their owne diſcharge) and that ſhee ſhall be <hi>a Cage of vncleane Birds,</hi> and that ſhe ſhall truly deſerue this name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the confluence of all Impieties, that ſhall then reigne therein. Which future (as he pretendeth, but preſent, as we ſee) eſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and change of her name, in the change of her condition, hee approoueth by the inſtance of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (as I noted before) once <hi>a faithfull Citie,</hi> the place of Gods ſpeciall delight, &amp;c. yet afterwards <hi>a rebellious Citie, a Where,</hi> in her Idolatries, and ſinnes: wherewith, afterward, ſhe prouoked him vnto his fierce, and vindictiue wrath.</p>
               <p>And indeed, well might this calamitie fall vpon <hi>Rome,</hi> if it fell vpon <hi>Ieruſalem [How is the faithfull Citie become an harlot? thy ſiluer is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come droſſe, thy wine is mixt with water: Eſay</hi> 1. 21.] ſince <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was priuiledged with more Immunities, by Gods owne conceſſion, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, then euer was that fatall Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> howbeit, vnder the <hi>Emperours,</hi> ſhee boaſted of her eternitie, and, vnder the <hi>Popes,</hi> ſhee braggeth of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, as beeing faſtened vnmoueably vnto her ſides; for ſo doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conceiue, and earneſtly preſſe this point (<hi>de Rom. Pont. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>as a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion, and piouſly to bee beleeued. And though ſhee may bee burned in the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> (ſaith hee) yet that ſhall not bee <hi>till the end of the World:</hi> yea, by their computation of Antichriſts reigne, perhaps within a yeare,

ſaid, to bee <hi>alreadie fallen;</hi> as if that were then paſt, which is not yet come?</p>
               <p>I frame my anſwere out of the learned diſputation of <hi>Epiphanius, haereſ.</hi> 79. where he doth well obſerue, that <hi>Eſay</hi> (the <hi>Euangelicall</hi> Prophet) foreſaw ſome things, which were then to come, as if they had beene alreadie paſt; and that they are expreſſed rather in the manner of a Narration, then of a Prediction; and this was chiefly for two cauſes. Firſt; to helpe the weakeneſſe of the Prophets faith; and, ſecondly, to declare, thereby, the firmeneſſe of Gods promiſe; in whoſe preuiſion, counſell, and purpoſe, the things were alreadie paſt vnto, and before him, though they were yet to bee fulfilled, in their act, and execution, vnto, and before men.</p>
               <p>Theſe two reaſons hold due proportion, &amp; iuſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency in, &amp; with our preſent caſe: where S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (the <hi>Euangelical</hi> Prophet of the new Teſtament) doth vnderſtand, by reuelation of the Angel (or rather of Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe; as it is <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.1.) that the proud and tyrannical <hi>Babylon is fallen;</hi> that God hath execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his fierce wrath vpon that vſurping Citie.</p>
               <p>FIRST, then, God did, by this forme of ſpeech, confirme the faith of his ſeruant then, and of vs now, that the length of time might not ſhake the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his, and our faith, in expectation of this euent, but that, with patience, we might attend the certaine pleaſure of God, though to bee fulfilled in an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time. So in the Prophet <hi>Eſay: chap.</hi> 53. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.5. &amp;c. <hi>Hee was deſpiſed: hee carried our ſorrowes: he was wounded for our tranſgreſsions: hee was afflicted, &amp;c.</hi> thus <hi>Eſay</hi> wrote of the ſacred Paſſion of our Lord
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18730:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ieſus Chriſt, which enſued neere vpon the ſpace of eight hundred yeeres, after the time of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction (or Narration rather: for ſo it is in the tenour of the words; which doe rather Hiſtorically relate, then Prophetically foretell) and thus the Prophet (and, with him, the faithfull Iewes) doth comfort himſelfe, in the ſecure expectation of ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in the ſolid ſtabilitie of this faith: in which, or rather by which, hee ſaw that with the eye of his ſoule, which he neuer ſaw with the eye of his bodie. The thing was infallible; but the time was not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto him (at leaſt, hee neuer reuealed it vnto vs) as vnto <hi>Daniel,</hi> that excellent and glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. This example alone might ſuffice in this behalfe; but that we haue another, more anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to our preſent purpoſe, as being the very type, and true figure thereof; <hi>Eſay</hi> 21.9. Where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by viſion, doth vnderſtand the ruine of <hi>Literall Babylon,</hi> expreſſed, and ſet downe in the very like forme of words; <hi>Babel is fallen: all the Images of her Gods hath hee broken vnto the ground.</hi> There God doth ſupport the faith of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and of his children; to whom hee doth ſo cleerely reueale (as if the act were abſolutely paſt) the deſtruction of that potent, rich, and ſtately Citie; which was Gods <hi>Scourge</hi> to afflict his people, and his <hi>Hammer</hi> to ruinate the Citie of Gods delight, and Temple of his preſence. In like manner, God doth, here in my Text, giue great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation vnto S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> his ſeruant, and vnto vs, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the ſeene (rather then foreſeene) ruine of <hi>myſticall Babylon;</hi> which, in her <hi>Imperiall</hi> ſtate, did, for certaine ages, with Heatheniſh crueltie perſecute,

ſpoile, murther Gods Saints, with copious effuſion of their bloud, which was the Seed of his Church: and in her <hi>Papall</hi> ſtate, hath for many Ages, with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian furie, afflicted, tormented, killed many a member of Ieſus Chriſt; which, for loue of his truth, and feare of his Name, could not, and would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in the Cup of her incantations, wherewith ſhee bewitcheth many Kings and Kingdomes in the World.</p>
               <p>The point, then, which I here obſerue, is this: that our faith maketh vs happie, and ſecure: our faith lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs vp, aboue ſenſe and reaſon: our faith is <hi>Iacobs ſtaffe,</hi> whereby we paſſe ouer, and through the <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> of this World: our faith is <hi>Manna,</hi> which fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs in the Wilderneſſe of this World, and neuer ceaſeth, till wee come into the <hi>Canaan</hi> of Heauen: then, and not before, her Commiſſion doth expire. For as <hi>Barzillai</hi> conducted <hi>Dauid</hi> ouer <hi>Iorden,</hi> but went not with him to <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo faith carrieth vs out of this miſerable World, but goeth not with vs into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Kingdome, where the fruition of God, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his eſſence, exclude the nature of beliefe.</p>
               <p>Two things therefore (here by the way) are fit for our inſtruction, to know them, and for our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to contemplate, and ruminate thereupon. FIRST; the excellencie of <hi>Faith</hi> in it ſelfe: it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs ſecure in things to come, as if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie paſt; or, at the leaſt, it maketh them preſent vnto vs, by bringing, and preſenting them inwardly vnto our mindes. Wherein <hi>Faith</hi> differeth from <hi>Hope:</hi> for as Faith exceedeth Hope in the extent of the obiect (Hope looketh onely vpon things deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18730:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and good; Faith vpon all things, generally, that are reuealed by God) ſo where they meet in one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect (the ſame thing being belieued by Faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by Hope; as <hi>life eternall &amp;c.</hi>) they haue a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent relation thereunto: for that is preſent vnto Faith, which is future vnto Hope: Hope carrieth vs vnto the things; Faith bringeth the things vnto vs. For as <hi>Dauids</hi> Worthies brake through the Hoſt of their Enemies, and brought water out of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> vnto him, for which hee longed: ſo Faith aſcendeth into all places bee they neuer ſo high; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth into them, be they neuer ſo deepe; flieth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, be they neuer ſo remote; pierceth into them, bee they neuer ſo cloſe, and bringeth vs the thing, which wee long for, by an effectuall, liuely and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtration thereof vnto the ſoule. Hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth comfortably attend; Faith doth infallibly aſſure: Hope ſuſtayneth vs in the expectation; Faith putteth vs in the poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; the benefit of Faith vnto vs: it is the eye of a Chriſtian ſoule, and (as <hi>Luther</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued) the reaſon of a Chriſtian man; <hi>Credo, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:</hi> I beleeue, O Lord; <hi>Marke</hi> 9.24. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe well ſpeaketh one of the Ancients; <hi>Fides credat, intelligentia non requirat:</hi> Let Faith beleeue, let not the Vnderſtanding ſeeke: Nay, <hi>Credendo intelligimus, non intelligendo credimus:</hi> wee beleeue not, by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but we vnderſtand by beleeuing. By this is <hi>Abraham</hi> iuſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. for <hi>aboue Hope</hi> (the hope of humane reaſon) <hi>he beleeued vnder Hope;</hi> the Hope of diuine Faith.</p>
               <p>By this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth liue; <hi>I liue by Faith in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18730:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sonne of God: Gal.</hi> 2.20. By this Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all worldly things; <hi>this is the victorie, that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the World; euen our Faith.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, therefore, according to the ſubiect of my ſpeech: Let <hi>Babylon</hi> extoll her ſelfe, and oppreſſe others; let her aduance her ſelfe, and deiect others: let her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in her Crueltie, Idolatry, and Pride, &amp;c. <hi>Yet for all theſe things, God ſhall bring her to iudgement.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it; I am certaine of it; for hee aſſureth mee that ſhe is alreadie fallen. Faint not then (O Religious, and Chriſtian hearts) vnder her tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie; but comfort your ſelues in her aſſured, and infallible ruine; which God doth certifie, and Faith doth apprehend, and time ſhall manifeſt, at the laſt: but <hi>beleeue</hi> this; for, <hi>if you beleeue not, you ſhall not be eſtabliſhed: Eſay</hi> 7.9. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay vnto all my brethren, as <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> vnto his ſubiects; <hi>Put your trust in the Lord your God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his Prophets, and you ſhall proſper.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20.</p>
               <p>Now, therefore, ſince <hi>Faith</hi> is of this excellencie in it ſelfe, and bringeth this benefit vnto vs (as that, by it, wee enioy things yet to come: by it wee behold things farre diſtant: by it wee are riſen againe, before we be dead: by it we are aſcended into Heauen, while wee are yet in the Earth: by it wee are happie, though we be yet in the vale of miſerie) let vs make three v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this incomparable gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> to prayſe God for this grace, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this ſubiect, whereof I now intreat: that as hee hath reuealed vnto vs the ruine of our capitall enemie [BABYLON] in his holy word, and by his owne ſonne, ſo hee hath giuen vs an aſſurance of Faith to beleeue it confidently, and ſo ſtrengthened our faith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18730:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the certaintie of the prediction, as if we had ſeene it alreadie fulfilled with our eyes. Therefore, againſt her power, and glorie, and dominion, and reputation, and all outward ſplendour, and, finally, the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie of her friends, or ſlaues, to ſupport her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby ſhe may ſeeme to ſubſiſt by a ſolid, and inconcuſſible foundation of her eſtate (the ſame being ſtrengthened by the depth of policie, and adorned with all varietie of Learning; as Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did foreſee, that the Miniſters of Antichriſt were the <hi>Locuſts, Apocal.</hi> 9.7, 10. hauing <hi>Crownes on their heads,</hi> ſignifying literature, and knowledge: hauing alſo <hi>ſtings in their tayles,</hi> ſignifying power, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie) I ſtill oppoſe Gods purpoſe, reuealed in his Word, that cannot be fruſtrate, and my Faith, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his Word, which cannot be erroneous. For as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth ingeniouſly, and grauely col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>the reſurrection of the dead</hi> (ſo cleerely foretold by him) <hi>ſhall certainly be effectuated in due time, becauſe other things, in that Prophet</hi> (ſo long before ſet downe in his Propheſie) <hi>haue had their reall, and actuall accompliſhment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his prediction</hi> (which being true in the reſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile in this) ſo my Faith is eſtabliſhed firmely here in this point, by diligent obſeruation of all othet paſſages in this Booke (once very obſcure, but now daily more, and more cleere) becauſe other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo notably diſcouered in their euent, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of this myſticall Scripture being made ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant in the ſucceſſe of time; I may not, I will not, I cannot doubt of the adimpletion of this particular, but that <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> ſhall finally come vnto her
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18730:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fatall ruine, as ſhee is <hi>alreadie fallen</hi> in Gods certaine Preuiſion, eternall Counſell, and immutable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> we ought to nouriſh this faith by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes; eſpecially, by reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conferring one place thereof with another, which is a ſingular key to open vnto vs their ſenſe, and meaning; according to the preſcription of the two learned Fathers, Saint <hi>Hierome contra Pelag. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and <hi>Auguſt. de doctr. Chriſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 26. So this particular; the collation, and compariſon of the Scriptures (one part of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the predictions of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> with the Viſions of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) together with the obſeruation of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold occurrences in the Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, from time to time, ſince the declination of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and corruption of the Church (as the Hiſtories of each may ſufficiently deduce vnto our knowledge) doth notably diſcouer this <hi>Babylonian</hi> Myſterie vnto vs, with the beginning, progreſſe and decadencie of her eſtate.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY; ſince Faith is the ſpeciall gift of God, who ſanctifieth vnto vs the outward meanes to increaſe, and confirme the ſame, wee muſt humbly ſue vnto God by deuout, and earneſt Prayer, with the Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid; Pſal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open mine eyes, O Lord, that I may ſee the wonderfull things in thy Law.</hi> Otherwiſe, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> reade the old Teſtament, and yet cannot find Chriſt therein; ſo men may may reade the new, and cannot ſee ſee Antichriſt therein. Why? becauſe their hearts are hardned, their vnderſtandings are foreſtalled with preiudice, the veile is ouer their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18730:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eyes, they walke in darkneſſe, and will not ſee the light. For ſuch I will pray that God would open their hearts, that they may entertaine his ſauing Truth. But for my ſelfe, and others, who haue bin in the like condition with mee, (whoſe eyes were blinded with the glorie of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for as <hi>Zebul</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Gaal, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</hi> 9.36. <hi>the ſhadow of the Mountaynes ſeeme men vnto thee;</hi> ſo the ſhadow of many things ſeemed a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of verity vnto vs) I will thanke God, for that he hath opened our eyes to ſee this myſterie, and miſery of <hi>Babylon;</hi> that ſhe <hi>is fallen,</hi> that ſhe is gone into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that God hath deſtroyed her for euer. <hi>Credo Domine:</hi> O Lord, I beleeue thy Word, not my owne reaſon; which I captiuate into the obedience of faith; and therefore I pray with thine Apoſtles; <hi>O Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith; (Luke</hi> 17.5.) that we may beleeue thy Word.</p>
               <p>And thus much bee ſpoken concerning the firſt cauſe, why the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is yet to come, is expreſſed by a time alreadie paſt.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; by this forme, and tenour of ſpeech, God doth euidently declare vnto his Church the truth, and certaintie of his promiſe in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Babylon;</hi> that we may repoſe ſecurely in this expectation of her ruine: his <hi>dixit</hi> is a <hi>fecit:</hi> it is ſpoken, and it is done, in regard of his infallible Word, and conſtant promiſe.</p>
               <p>And that wee may more cleerely vnderſtand this point, we muſt obſerue a double kinde of Propheſie in the holy Scriptures. The FIRST is a Propheſie of <hi>Commination:</hi> as God did threaten the fall of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niueh</hi> within fortie dayes; but hee threatned her fall,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18730:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſhe might not fall: for the effect of ſuch a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie dependeth vpon our comportment, and carriage thereupon toward God by Repentance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath a condition (implyed here, though not expreſſed; as ſometimes it is, <hi>Ieremie</hi> 18.7, 8.) vpon which the execution doth ſtay, or go forth, according as we performe, or neglect the ſame. So that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is <hi>conditionall,</hi> and not <hi>abſolute:</hi> it contayneth Gods <hi>ſentence,</hi> and not his <hi>Decree:</hi> and therefore it is expreſſed in the future tenſe; <hi>Nineueh ſhall fall.</hi> In this caſe the Propheſie is changeable, if we be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and therefore God calleth vs to Repentance, that we may eſcape his iudgements. And though this kind of Propheſie be not now particularly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt thy Countrey, nor thy perſon (as, in the holy Scriptures, it is often ſo directed againſt ſuch a Nation, ſuch a Citie, and ſuch a man) yet as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall comminations of God againſt ſinners doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude vs, and will take hold vpon vs, if wee returne not vnto God with the teares of true repentance; ſo the particular examples of his comminations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and executed againſt ſome Cities, and ſome perſons, doe, by equall reaſon, and a like cauſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto vs; according to the rule, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of our bleſſed Sauiour; <hi>Except you amend your liues, you ſhall likewiſe periſh. Luk.</hi> 13.3, 5. When <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh</hi> is threatned by <hi>Ionah, England</hi> is threatned: when her ruine is declared by <hi>Nahum,</hi> how can <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be ſecure? <hi>Pares culpâ, cur impares poena?</hi> why is ſhe vnlike to <hi>Nineueh</hi> in puniſhment, who is ſo like to her in ſinne? wee feare the deſtruction, and not the ſinne: the effect, and not the cauſe. But <hi>it is the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18730:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lords Mercies that wee are not conſumed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The SECOND is a Propheſie of <hi>Predestination</hi> (as I may call it) depending indeed vpon our ſinne, but yet reſolued by God, as well as declared; in which reſpect it is abſolute, and not conditionall, once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and neuer reuoked: concluded in Gods immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table counſell; foreſeene in his infallible preſcience; and it is rather pronounced, then denounced by him. Therefore it is expreſſed, either in the <hi>time paſt</hi> (as heere in my Text, and <hi>Eſay</hi> 21.9.) or in the <hi>time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> though the effect doe not yet appeare. For wee may obſerue, that, in the Propheſie of <hi>Ionah,</hi> (there being a <hi>commination</hi> againſt her, at that time) it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the future tenſe; <hi>Nineueh ſhall fall:</hi> but, in the Propheſie of <hi>Nahum</hi> (there being now a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, declared concerning her ſubuerſion) it is deliuered in the preſent tenſe: <hi>the Horſeman lifteth vp the bright Sword: a multitude is ſlaine: they ſtumble vpon their corpſes. Chap.</hi> 3.3. and then, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth <hi>Verſe;</hi> Nineueh <hi>is destroyed.</hi> So that, (in this kind of Propheſie) theſe two tenſes, to wit, the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> and the <hi>preterperfect,</hi> haue a coincident ſenſe, and purpoſe, concerning an infallibilitie of the euent. Whence it is, that the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ioyneth them both together in the Paſſion of Chriſt, and Myſterie of our Redemption; ſaying of him, that <hi>he is deſpiſed; he is a man full of ſorrowes; he is brought, as a ſheepe vnto the ſlaughter; Eſay</hi> 53.3.7. as well as, <hi>hee was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; he was afflicted, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee, by the conference of Scriptures, that the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> here, certified vnto vs in the time paſt <hi>[it is fallen]</hi> doth truly import an ineuitable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18730:96"/>
euent; a ſentence neuer to bee recalled; proceeding from a decree, neuer to bee changed; becauſe God hereby doth inſinuate vnto our knowledge, that ſhee would not bee renewed by repentance, and that hee would not conferre that grace vpon her, but leaue her to periſh in the courſe of her owne ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And this truth is farther aſſured, and amplified, by al the circumſtances, <hi>preceding</hi> her ruine; <hi>accompanying</hi> her ruine; <hi>following</hi> her ruine, in three ſeueral chapters; 17.18.19. in ſuch large and ample termes, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Image of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in all theſe things, is effectually and liuely exhibited, thereby, vnto our eyes; as a matter of preſent action, rather then future accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; rather to be ſeene, then to be beleeued.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the promiſe of God being thus veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto vs, in this forme, and manner of ſpeech, let vs (by the way) make a little reflection vpon this point, for our vſe and obſeruation; as being of ſo great conſequence, for the benefit of Gods children, and aduancement of his truth. <hi>Firſt,</hi> then, the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gods promiſe herein doth exclude, and confute their errour, who ſuppoſe that this is a prophecie of <hi>Commination</hi> onely, and not of <hi>Reſolution</hi> againſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh <hi>Babylon;</hi> as though ſhee might turne from her ſinnes, and conſequently, God might turne from his wrath. In which opinion S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelfe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volued, as it appeareth, in his darke, vncertaine, and perplexed diſcourſe, touching <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her ruine, in the concluſion of his ſecond book againſt <hi>Iovinian;</hi> whoſe errors did then begin to poſſeſſe many in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to intangle them in his ſnare, compoſed artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of ſundry paſſages of the Scripture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18730:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> maketh a patheticall <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> vnto <hi>Rome</hi> in this manner; <hi>I will ſpeake vnto thee, O</hi> Rome, <hi>which by the confeſsion of Chriſt, haſt blotted out of thy forehead, the blaſphemy written therein.</hi> There, the name <hi>Babylon</hi> is laid vpon <hi>Ethnicall Rome,</hi> as if <hi>Rome</hi> were afterward to bee diſcharged for euer of this ſcandall; which miſpriſion, and errour I haue refuted in my former Sermon. But let vs proceed with S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> who addeth immediately, by way of acclamation; <hi>O potent Citie; O Lady-citie of the world; O Citie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the voyce of the Apostle; interpret thine owne name: according to the Greekes, it is a name of</hi> FORTITVDE: <hi>according to the Hebrewes, it is a name of</hi> SVBLIMITIE; <hi>Keepe that, then, which thou art called: let vertue make thee high, let not pleaſure make thee baſe.</hi> All this pertaineth to her honour, and exaltation; but then hee giueth his aduice vnto her preſently, in the very next words; <hi>Thou mayeſt, by thy repentance, eſcape the malediction, which our Sauiour hath threatned vnto thee in his Reuelation.</hi> No, not ſo, S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> by your leaue: ſhee ſhall not eſcape: this is not a ſimple Commination againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> which may bee preuented, but a reſolution, which muſt be fulfilled. And now to conclude this obſeruation; I here diſcouer ſome perplexitie (as I ſaid before) and vncertaintie, yea, perhaps, contradiction in this Rhetoricall paſſage of this learned Father. For ſince he doth confeſſe, that, howſoeuer Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> had wiped away the infamie of her Ethnicall eſtate, and doth, notwithſtanding, immediately affirme, that the <hi>Commination</hi> of Chriſt (ſpecified here in my Text, and more largely diſcourſed in the reſidue of this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18730:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chapter) is yet in force againſt her, and that it is yet to be executed vpon her, if ſhe, by repentance, ſhall not diuert and euacuate the ſame; one of theſe two things muſt neceſſarily here enſue: namely, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee will bee <hi>Babylon</hi> againe, in ſucceeding ages, and iuſtly deſerue this ruine (and ſo S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> by the former words, doth not diſcharge <hi>Rome</hi> from the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for the time to come, but onely in that her preſent ſtate) or elſe that God ſhall puniſh her in the time to come, for her ſinnes alreadie paſt; which I doubt how it may ſtand with the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> of God, as I haue more largely deduced in my former Sermon. And ſo leauing it vnto your iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cenſure, what you will determine of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in this caſe (ſince this iudgement is laid vpon <hi>Rome,</hi> in the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and for her <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſinnes) I end this obſeruation with the confeſſion of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ieſuites, as well as of ſome ancient Fathers, that <hi>Rome</hi> being <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall be certainly deſtroyed; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, not by Antichriſts power, as they conceiue, but for Antichriſts pride, as we haue partly ſeene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſhall ſee more hereafter.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> vſe, to be made of this point, is, for the conſolation of Gods children: ſhee curſeth them, ſhee excommunicateth them, ſhee depoſeth Kings, ſhee diſpoſeth Kingdomes, ſhee expoſeth both to ruine, ſhee abſolueth ſubiects from obedience, ſhee ſtirreth forraine powers againſt them, ſhee burneth, ſhee drowneth, ſhee ſpareth no meanes to extirpate them out of the world. Comfort now your ſelues in Gods promiſe; <hi>ſhee is fallen,</hi> with him: ſhee ſhall fall before vs: for Gods Word ſhall not fall. Againe, ſhee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18730:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vpon her to foretell our ruine, and deſtruction. <hi>Pererius,</hi> a learned Ieſuite (but a blind <hi>Babylonian</hi>) in his expoſition of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 15.16. complaineth bitterly of the perſecution of Catholikes in <hi>England,</hi> which (ſaith he, meaning <hi>England</hi>) though ſhe remaine in the courſe of her ſins, yet ſhe enioyeth great felicitie; but he recollecteth himſelfe with that ſpeech of God vnto <hi>Abraham; the ſinnes of the Amorites are not yet full;</hi> ENGLAND (ſaith hee) <hi>though full of ſinne, hath not yet fulfilled the number of her ſinnes: but, when they are come to their height, ſhee ſhall certainely periſh: and, if any man thinke, that this time is not farre off, hee, in my opinion, is not farre from the truth.</hi> Now though wee are to learne ſomething of our enemies (but more by the examples in ſacred Scripture) that we may repent and change our liues, that ſo God may ſhew his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and compaſſion towards vs, yet two things I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue here; the one for their reproofe; the other for our comfort. The firſt is for their reproofe; for (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth truely note) the Deuill, to gaine the reputation of Preſcience, and Deitie, foretelleth ſuch things, as hee is reſolued to effect, and bring to paſſe, by his owne power, and meanes; if God giue permiſſion vnto his deſire: ſo the Ianizaries of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the progenie of <hi>Loiola (Frogges</hi> in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> 16.13. as ſome haue ingeniouſly conceiued, for that a Ieſuite is, ordinarily a politicke, and actiue <hi>Polyprag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> and ſo an <hi>Amphibion,</hi> that conuerſeth in two ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ciuill, and Eccleſiaſticall affaires; of the Church, and of the ſtate) may ſeeme to bee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in foretelling the ruine of my deare, and natiue Countrey, whereas they foretell that, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18730:98"/>
themſelues do proiect, and labour to atchieue; and it had been effectuated long before this time, but that he hath had mercy vpon <hi>England,</hi> who will ſhew none to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and hath not left this <hi>other</hi> better <hi>world</hi> of <hi>Brittaine</hi> vnto their pernicious deſignes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is for our comfort; they haue prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our deſtruction; but written in their owne wicked, and treacherous hearts; and therefore I may ſay vnto ſuch a Prophet, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> vnto <hi>Sanballat; Neh.</hi> 6.8. <hi>It is not done</hi> [ſaith hee; <hi>it ſhall not bee done,</hi> ſay I] <hi>according to theſe words, that thou ſayest; for thou faineſt them of thine owne heart:</hi> Thy prophecies are vagabond lies, flying vp and downe in wandring papers of no weight, or value; but this our prophecie (or rather S. <hi>Iohns,</hi> or rather <hi>Christs</hi> by him) is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the ſacred Scripture of infallible truth. So that wee may ſay ſecurely (concerning the ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi>) with our (not their) S. <hi>Peter:</hi> 2.5.19. <hi>Wee haue a moſt ſure word of a Prophet, to the which wee doe well, that wee take heed:</hi> for <hi>Babylon ſhall fall</hi> (ſince Gods Word cannot fall) the ſentence is paſt, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is at hand.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the firſt point, to bee obſerued here in the ſecond part of my Text; namely, the TIME of <hi>Romes</hi> puniſhment; which, being then, and yet to come, is expreſſed by the Angels proclamation, in the time alreadie paſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S our bleſſed Sauiour ſent forth his Diſciples, <hi>two, and two; Luc.</hi> 10.1. ſo he ſetteth forth the notice of <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine, by a doubled voyce: And as the Law of the Decalogue was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten twice by the finger of God; ſo the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is proclaimed twice by the mouth of Chriſt. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereof, with ſuch circumſtances, as deſerue due ponderation in this caſe, I will examine with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous breuitie, and ſo proceed to the maine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my Text.</p>
               <p>The FIRST reaſon is that, which S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon the <hi>Reuelations</hi> (or the Author of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, which is graced with his name) doth aſſigne in this manner; <hi>Babylon is ſaid</hi> twice <hi>to fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a great multitude fell from her communion, and entertained the Christian Faith; and becauſe ſhee ſhall bee puniſhed, in the laſt day, with eternall death.</hi> So he reſolueth, that <hi>Babylon</hi> falleth twice, but he neuer came once neere vnto the truth of the point; for he ſeemeth either to ſpeake of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as it is the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Citie of ſinne, and not as the particular Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> or elſe he meaneth, that this <hi>fall</hi> doth ſignifie the fall of <hi>Rome</hi> from Paganiſme vnto Chriſt; which, being a fall of ſingular felicitie, and ioy differeth much from the fall intended in this place; which is a fall of great miſerie, ſorrow, and feare; as you ſhall perceiue anon, when I come vnto the third part of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18730:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my Sermon; where I am to treate directly of this point.</p>
               <p>Therefore I come now vnto a SECOND expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſeemeth to be ingenious, but is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall: namely, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath a double fall: the one in reſpect of Gods truth and grace, wherein ſhee ſometimes ſtood, and from whence ſhee is long ſince fallen. But though ſhee bee ſo fallen, yet this fall is included in the <hi>ſubiect</hi> of my Text [BABYLON; which implyeth the condition of <hi>Rome</hi> in her ſin] and not in the <hi>praedicate;</hi> IT IS FALLEN: which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth her eſtate in her puniſhment, ſo that the ſecond fall of <hi>Rome</hi> is her extreme ruine, by the vindictiue Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God. And indeed this the fall, here to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; for that (as I ſaid before) the Angel ſpeaketh here of the puniſhment, &amp; not of the ſin of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo this ſecond fall enſueth vpon the firſt: for, becauſe ſhee is <hi>Babylon</hi> (fallen from Gods truth) ſhee ſhall therefore haue another fall (expreſſed here by repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and periſh by Gods iudgement.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, then, this <hi>Fall</hi> is heere repeated, to ſhew the certaintie of the euent, as written in the Booke of Gods immutable Decree: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had two Dreames, which differed in forme, and reſemblance, but agreed (and were one) in the ſenſe thereof, and purpoſe of God; <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. &amp;c. The ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> is here expreſſed by one word, twice vttered, but with the ſame meaning, and the ſame intention; that as <hi>the Dreame was doubled vnto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>becauſe the thing was eſtabliſhed by God,</hi> ſo the ſubuerſion of <hi>Rome</hi> is inculcated here in my Text vnto vs, becauſe this thing is eſtabliſhed by God, and ſhall bee performed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18730:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
infallibly in the due and appointed time. Therefore, as before, her fall was notified in the preterperfect tenſe <hi>[ſhe is fallen]</hi> ſo here it is ratified in the duplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame word; <hi>it is fallen; it is fallen.</hi> For who could reaſonably, and probably conceiue, according to the euidence, and appearance of things, in that time (or long after) that <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo glorious in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſo venerable in the Church, ſo potent in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſo rich in eſtate, ſo renowmed in fame, ſhould come to this deſpicable, and deplorable end?</p>
               <p>Thankes, therefore, be vnto our God, who, as hee can, and will humble her Pride, abaſe her Glorie, breake her Power, diſſolue her Strength, and defeat her Policies, to her confuſion, and the honour of his Name; ſo hee hath now ſo cleerely reuealed, and ſo certainly aſſured this Truth, and the certaintie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vnto vs, for our comfort; that now we enuie not her greatneſſe, becauſe wee know her fall: wee feare not her malice, becauſe wee ſee her miſerie: wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the inſolent venditation of her ſuppoſed <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,</hi> becauſe wee perceiue the dolefull expiration of her eſtate.</p>
               <p>But here, by the way, wee may obſerue, to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; that many <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhould not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and feare this extreame vaſtation, ſo certainly to fall vpon that miſerable Citie; ſo conſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, ſo vehemently reiterated by the Angell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> and that, being ſimply gulled with the falſe opinion of her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> eſtate (alreadie paſt) they ſhould bee ſo blind, and obdurate, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and acknowledgement of ſo cleere, and ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:18730:100"/>Notwithſtanding, when I reflect vpon the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, inflicted vpon other people, I ſee, that, before their fatall deſtruction, they haue ſuffered an extraordinarie defect in humane policie, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wiſdome, (the iuſtice of God concurring with the merit of their ſinnes) ſo that they could not carefully preuent an eminent, and imminent danger, nor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſee the ſame. So the Lord himſelfe doth giue his owne teſtimonie of the excecation of the <hi>Edomites</hi> (otherwiſe an ingenious, and circumſpect Nation) in this manner: <hi>Is wiſdome no more in</hi> Teman? <hi>Is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell periſhed from their children? Is their wiſdome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed? Ieremie</hi> 49.7. And that this their excecation proceedeth from God, hee himſelfe doth declare by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah; Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Shall not I, in that day, euen destroy the Wiſemen out of</hi> Edom, <hi>and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Mount of</hi> Eſau? Whence it is, that they could not diſcerne a falſe friend from a true enemy; who vnder the pretenſed termes of loue, and vnitie, did ſupplant, and vndermine their State. Therefore it is ſaid in the <hi>Verſe,</hi> immediately going before: <hi>the men, that were at peace with thee, haue deceiued thee:</hi> whereupon the Lord paſſeth his Diuine cenſure vpon <hi>Edom</hi> in theſe words; <hi>there is none vnderſtanding in him.</hi> For as the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> put out <hi>Samſons</hi> eyes, and then made him grind for their vſe, ſo GOD per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the ſecret, and malicious enemies of ſome Nation, to put out the eyes of their wiſedome, by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred deluſions, and then make them to ſerue vnder the burthens, which they impoſe vpon them.</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY, and laſtly; this duplication of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons fall,</hi> is to ſhew the conformitie betwixt the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18730:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Old Teſtament, and the New, in this behalfe; and that one Spirit, in ſundry Ages, did, in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner direct, and aſſiſt the Church. For thus wee reade (as I noted once before) in the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Babell is fallen, it is fallen.</hi> Thus the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype of new <hi>Babylon</hi> anſwereth to the type of the old; the Spirit to the Letter: the thing to the figure. For as the <hi>Seraphims</hi> cried one to another in the ſame words, <hi>holy, holy, &amp;c. Eſay</hi> 6.3. ſo the two Teſtaments haue mutuall conſonancie of words in this point; to ſignifie thereby vnto vs, that, this being ſpoken once (nay rather twice) of <hi>Literall Babylon,</hi> and being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in her; it, beeing now ſpoken againe the ſecond time of the <hi>Mysticall Babylon,</hi> ſhall be completed in her likewiſe; ſince, by the Hiſtoricall euidence of things, that are alreadie paſt, wee may ſecurely repoſe in the Prophetical prediction of things, that are yet to come. It is ſtill the ſame God that pronounceth it; the ſame Spirit that reuealeth it: the ſame Prouidence, that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things to their certain, and determined euent.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore we may deduce, for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that the preſidents of the Old Teſtament ſhould direct, and informe vs vnder the New, to truſt in God, whoſe Truth is ſtill the ſame; to loue God, whoſe Goodneſſe is ſtill the ſame; to feare God, whoſe Iuſtice is ſtill the ſame; who, by the examples of his ſeueritie in the Old Teſtament, frameth vs vnto the reuerence of his Name, and obedience of his Will, in the New; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe doth grauely, and diuinely teach vs; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Theſe are enſamples to vs;</hi> and againe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. <hi>All theſe things came vnto them for enſamples, and were written
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18730:101"/>
to admoniſh vs.</hi> If, therefore, <hi>Babylon</hi> heare of a ruine, denounced by <hi>Eſay,</hi> Let <hi>Rome</hi> feare her ruine reuealed by Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> And let vs alſo conceiue (for it is a truth, and worthy by all meanes to be receiued) that as a generall deſtruction of my people in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, is an admonition to any Kingdome or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the New, ſo a particular deſtruction of any perſon there, is an example, and premonition vnto me, and to thee, and to euery one in his degree, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and place, to auoid the like ſinne, by which the former periſhed, and fell, through the exemplarie iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; eſteeming his caſe to be a prediction of ours; as if our very names, and perſons, were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that Scripture, and in that example; as indeed it is, really, though not verbally; not in ſuch apparant, and identicall tearmes, as the ruine of Myſticall <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> heere is diſcouered in the ruine of Literall <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> there.</p>
               <p>And ſo much of the ſecond point, which I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before in the diſtribution of my Text, and haue now explained in the orderly purſuit thereof.</p>

               <head>The <hi>THIRD</hi> point, concerning the nature, and qualitie of this ruine; what this <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> doth heere import.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I am come vnto the ſubſtance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for the former points (concerning the <hi>time paſt,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Duplication</hi> of the fal) are accidents, &amp; circumſtances of the <hi>Fal,</hi> whereof I now intreat, but yet ſuch, ſo proper, and ſo effectuall, as that they bring
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18730:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an eſpeciall light thereunto; and therefore I haue handled them before, as being acceſſorie helpes for vs, to vnderſtand the principall point it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>As for the word <hi>[Fall]</hi> it is plaine, and eaſie, but very ſignificant, and Emphaticall in this place; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fall of ſpeciall, and extraordinary note; as wee ſhall perceiue, in the third ſenſe, and acception of the ſame.</p>
               <p>FIRST, therefore; according to the primarie, and ſimple meaning of the Letter; it doth import a locall motion, whereby ſome thing of an higher place, or of a firme conſiſtencie before, is lapſed into a lower (properly vpon the Earth) or ſo diſſolued into pieces, that it doth not cohere, and ſtand in the former qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and manner: as the houſe <hi>fell</hi> vpon <hi>Iobs</hi> children [<hi>Iob</hi> 1.19.] though by a violent meanes; and the walls of <hi>Iericho fell downe</hi> [as it <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 6.20.] though by a miraculous meanes; ſignifying in a ſenſe allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, the fall of Impietie at the ſound of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall haue a <hi>fall,</hi> of a more mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature (as anon you ſhall heare) yet this fall doth likewiſe appertaine vnto her, in her glorious Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in her ſumptuous Monaſteries, in other magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall Palaces of his Holineſſe, and his Cardinals (whom <hi>hee maketh Princes in all Lands;</hi> as ſome haue blaſphemouſly applyed that Text: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.16.) in the ſtately houſes of the Citizens, and finally in her walls; the carkaſſe of that proud, and inſolent Citie.</p>
               <p>O that ſpatious, ancient, and venerable Church of Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> it was ſometimes a Sanctuarie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the miſerable, diſtreſſed Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:18730:102"/>
(as <hi>Sozom.</hi> doth relate, <hi>lib,</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 9. and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> himſelfe doth inſinuate; <hi>De Ciuit. Dei, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.) when the furious, and barbarous <hi>Gothes</hi> ſpoyled, and ranſacked, the Citie, and made a cruell maſſacre of the people. But now it is defiled with <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize:) and, when the Day of this vengeance doth come, it ſhall <hi>fall;</hi> it ſhall bee caſt downe to the ground; it ſhall haue no Sanctuarie for its owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. That ſhall be verified in her, which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the deſolation of the Temple; <hi>One ſtone ſhall not be left vpon another.</hi> And this is the firſt <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; this Word doth ſometimes note the act of death; whence the name of a <hi>carkaſſe</hi> (in the <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>) is deriued in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall originals; for that, by death, wee <hi>fall</hi> and cannot now ſtand) and wee fall into the <hi>earth;</hi> as the Centre of grauitie, to which all heauie things doe tend, and where they haue their reſt.</p>
               <p>Now death is either naturall, or violent. NATV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALL; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.7. <hi>You Princes ſhall fall like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> that is; you ſhall <hi>dye</hi> (as it is in the words, next going before) and as you had one <hi>Geneſis</hi> by birth, ſo you ſhall haue one <hi>Exodus</hi> by death, with the pooreſt, and meaneſt of the people. Heere is ſomething for our <hi>Humiliation;</hi> the ſtrong, the rich, the mightie man ſhall <hi>fall,</hi> and fall into the earth; the mother, out of whoſe ſubſtance he is framed, and into which he ſhall be diſſolued againe. What is my condition? I am a piece of clay, moulded into humane ſhape, what is my end? I muſt fall into the matter, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of my beginning, O that I could euer thinke of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18730:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this fall into the earth, by my death; that I might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fall from Heauen by my ſinnes.</p>
               <p>This fall is no ſpeciall iudgement vnto the Citizens of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is a generall neceſſitie of all men in the World. But let vs obſerue ſomething for our <hi>Conſolation,</hi> and then wee ſhall ſee more. For our <hi>fall</hi> by death is not without hope of a Reſurrection, and that alſo vnto eternall glorie (for <hi>the reſurrection of the dead is the confidence of Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) but the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> (by the Sword, by fire, by extreame deſolation) hath no hope of a ciuill reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to <hi>ariſe,</hi> after her <hi>fall,</hi> vnto any ſplendour, or dignitie againe: and therefore I may ſay of her, as <hi>Iacob</hi> of his eldeſt ſonne, the firſt-borne of his ſtrength; <hi>thy dignitie is gone, Gen.</hi> 49.4.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of fall by death, is VIOLENT; and now we come neerer vnto the point. This kinde of <hi>fall</hi> is often remembred in the ſacred Scriptures; but, out of many places, I will ſelect a few, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.28. <hi>There fell of the people about three thouſand men;</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> handled the peoples cauſe, with God, by Prayer; but Gods cauſe, with the people, by Swords. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.12. <hi>They are fallen, that worke iniquitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>fall</hi> may well be applied vnto <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe her ruine is not onely <hi>locall</hi> (for houſes and walls) but <hi>perſonall,</hi> for the Inhabitants themſelues (Clericall, and Laicall (who, dwelling within her precincts, ſhall <hi>fall</hi> by the extreame furie of the Sword, which ſhall deuoure their fleſh, in the Day of the LORDS ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>Tremble, therefore, O yee vnhappie Citizens,

at the voice of the fatall ruine of that vnfortunate place; your knees may ſmite, the one againſt the other (as <hi>Balſhazzars, Dan.</hi> 5.6.) with the extremitie of your iuſt feare, for that diſaſtrous calamitie, which ſhall fall vpon you, or vpon your poſteritie, and ſucceſſion. Therefore <hi>depart out of her;</hi> it is Gods owne premonition vnto you; and they, that are <hi>his people,</hi> will depart out of her, either <hi>corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to ſaue their liues, or <hi>ſpiritually</hi> to ſaue their ſoules. And, as for you, that are yet immaculate, and not defiled with her contagion, heare not her inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be not intangled with her voice. She cryeth; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;</hi> come vnto me, the mother of the faithfull: but Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Exite,</hi> goe out of her, my people, <hi>that you bee not partakers of her plague;</hi> for ſhe is <hi>the Mother of Fornications.</hi> And ſo much of the ſecond <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which hath now prepared vs vnto the third.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, then, this word doth ſignifie ſuch a ruine, as is without recouery, with extreame vaſtitie, horrible miſerie, vnſpeakable deſolation; which <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> ſhall more ſenſibly feele, then we can truly declare; <hi>res ſuperat fidem;</hi> the matter exceedeth beliefe: <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> beliefe, that ſtandeth vpon reaſon, but not <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,</hi> which is grounded vpon reuelation; as I ſhall haue ſpeciall occaſion to declare more fully, in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Meanewhile, to iuſtifie this laſt acception, and ſenſe of this Word, according to the tenour of the holy Scriptures, I produce vnto you certaine inſtances, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to our purpoſe. For if wee ſpeake of the perſons, inhabiting in <hi>Babylon,</hi> then <hi>Dauid</hi> writeth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18730:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aptly of ſuch <hi>falling; Pſal.</hi> 36.12. <hi>They</hi> [mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies] <hi>are cast downe</hi> [they are <hi>fallen;</hi> in the words immediatly before] <hi>and ſhall not be able to riſe.</hi> But, if we ſpeake of the place it ſelfe; <hi>Iericho</hi> is an example in this caſe <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 6. <hi>The walls fell downe; man, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, young, and old, with all the cattle, were deſtroyed therein.</hi> And to fill vp the meaſure of the calamitie thereof, ſhee was to lie buried in the Tombe of her owne ruines; and a curſe laid by <hi>Ioſhua</hi> vpon the man, that ſhould repaire, and reedifie the ſame. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; the pitifull (but vnpitied) vaſtation of this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Citie, her dolefull <hi>fall</hi> (to follow the preſcript euidence of my Text) is reſembled in the iuſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which fell vpon the Citizens, and Citie of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> which <hi>Abimelech</hi> deſtroyed, and ſowed the place thereof with Salt; <hi>Iudic.</hi> 9.45.</p>
               <p>Such ſhall bee (if any patterne can exemplifie her caſe) the <hi>fall;</hi> the fatall end, the wofull period of this great, and glorious Citie. It is <hi>finall;</hi> for I reade of none after it; it is <hi>ſingular;</hi> for I reade of none ſuch before it.</p>
               <p>For, to paſſe by the conflagration of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gaules</hi> (when ſhe was yet in the time of her minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and youth) and to come to the ſtate of her decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in the time of <hi>Honorius,</hi> the Emperour, vpon the yeare of Chriſt 414. we find in the Ciuill and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hiſtories, that <hi>Alarichus,</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> tooke the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> (rather by Famine, then by the Sword, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth relate) burned ſome part thereof, ſlue the Citizens, deſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them of an infinite abundance of riches; but (as I noted before) gaue them their liues, that could take Sanctuarie in the great and magnificent Church of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18730:105"/>
Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> After his deceaſe (which happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort time after this expilation of <hi>Rome</hi>) his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Ataulphus</hi> returned vnto <hi>Rome</hi> with a mightie power, reſoluing to put all the Citizens to the ſword; to raze the Citie vnto the very foundations; to erect another in ſome commodious place, and to impoſe the name of <hi>Gothia</hi> vpon it: from which reſolution he was diuerted by the humble ſupplications, and gentle perſwaſions of his deerely beloued wife <hi>Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> ſiſter vnto <hi>Honorius:</hi> and ſo <hi>Rome</hi> did then eſcape that ruine, vnto which ſhe is yet reſerued, and which ſhe ſhall certainly feele in the due appointed time.</p>
               <p>Afterward, vpon the yeere 450. <hi>Genſericus,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> ſo ſacked, and ranſacked the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> that, for ſome time, it remained without any inhabitant to dwell therein. But much more grieuous, and fearefull was her deſolation by <hi>Totilas,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> vpon the yeere 547. a great part of the walls being caſt downe, the houſes burned, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens killed; ſo that neither man, nor woman remained therein; as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe (out of <hi>Blondus</hi>) doth briefly recite <hi>C. de Pont. Rom. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7.) but to a very poore, and ſimple purpoſe; as you ſhall heare anon in the paſſage of my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Meane while, deſcending neerer vnto our times, I ſmile at the fearefull apprehenſions of Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the ſixth (vpon the yeere 1494.) when hee was troubled, and all <hi>Rome</hi> with him, at the militarie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Charles</hi> the eight of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore vpon a treatie of peace, hee accepted the Articles, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon him by the victorious Prince, for the time (but with a perfidious heart, as the ſequell of things
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18730:105"/>
did diſcouer) who thereupon was receiued into <hi>Rome</hi> with tender demonſtration of ſingular reſpect, and loue; otherwiſe, hee had certainly imitated the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the conquering <hi>Gaules</hi> ancient times, and burnt <hi>the whore with fire;</hi> which worke did rather appertaine vnto his ſucceſſours in the Crowne of <hi>France;</hi> as time, <hi>the mother of truth,</hi> ſhall one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale to fulfill that, which Truth, <hi>the Sonne of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> (Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe) doth here foretell.</p>
               <p>But, leauing <hi>Rome</hi> in that paſſion of feare, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her in the paſſion of ſenſe, vpon the yeere 1524. when the Imperiall Armie of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vnder the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> who was fatally ſlaine before the walls of <hi>Babylon</hi>) firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the Suburbes, and then inuaded the Citie it ſelfe; <hi>in whom it is doubtfull</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine, lib.</hi> 18. which Hiſtorie well deſerueth your reuiew) <hi>whether bare more rule; the humour of crueltie to kill, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of lust to deflower, or the rage of auarice to ſpoile.</hi> What honour, and reuerence did theſe Catholike Souldiers performe then vnto the holy Father, and his worthy Prelates? As for him, hee was made a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in his owne Caſtle, and redeemed himſelfe from farther dangers at a great proportion of monyes, and remained in cuſtodie, vntill it pleaſed the Emperour, out of his ſpeciall grace, to releaſe him againe. As for them; many of them were ſet vpon Aſſes, and leane Moyles, with great dignitie, and contempt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their faces reuerſed to the crowpe of the beaſts; and ſo, being apparrelled with the habites, and markes of their dignitie, were made a ſpectacle of deriſion in the publike view; while ſome other Cardinalls being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18730:106"/>
naked, and ſoled along with buffets and baſtinadoes, redeemed their liues with deepe exhauſtion of their plate, and treaſure.</p>
               <p>Now, if in theſe calamities of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are the <hi>praeludia,</hi> and, as it were, the figures of her future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, wee ſee ſuch furious actions of hoſtilitie againſt her, not onely by barbarous enemies, but by them, who carrie the names, and titles of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and of <hi>Catholike,</hi> by particular ſtile, what incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable crueltie will ſo many ſeuerall Nations exerciſe againſt her, with implacable hatred vnder the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of ſo many ſeuerall Princes, enraged againſt her, for her violation of their Crownes, &amp; ſtirred vp by the ſpeciall iudgement of God? O vnexemplifyable <hi>fall;</hi> I want termes to expreſſe it. And therefore as the Painter, being to repreſent, by a liuely Image, the behauiour of the father of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> (lamenting, and bewayling her pitifull death) drew a veile before his face; that being a more proper ſignification of his griefe, which could not be expreſſed in any ſhape, or colour, ſo I will in ſilence admire, (and I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole it alſo, but that I find <hi>the Saints reioyce thereat: Cap.</hi> 19. 1. 2, 3.) this <hi>fall,</hi> (I ſay) of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thus by ſilence, as wanting all words, I ſhall ſpeake more, that if I could deliuer the nature of it in many.</p>
               <p>Thus now, at the laſt, I haue made an interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>fall;</hi> comparing it with other falls, which were ſome ſhadowes of it; <hi>Rome</hi> being her owne type herein. Howbeit as the Prophet [<hi>Eſay</hi> 9.1.] calleth it a <hi>light affliction</hi> of ſome Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by <hi>Tiglah Pieſar,</hi> in compariſon of the greater captiuitie after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, vnder <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> ſo the former fals of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:18730:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were light in compariſon of this <hi>fall;</hi> nay rather they were concuſſions, and ſhakes, this onely is the <hi>fall,</hi> and ruine thereof.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore the very words of the Text, wherewith I will finiſh this part of my Diſcourſe; <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>It is become an habitation of Deuils; reward her, as ſhe hath rewarded you; fill her the Cup double: her plagues ſhall come in one day; death, ſorrow, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; ſhee ſhall be burnt with fire: no man buyeth her ware any more: her Merchants ſhall howle and cry, &amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Chapter</hi> 19.3. <hi>her ſmoake roſe vp for euermore.</hi> And ſo much of the <hi>fall;</hi> namely, for the manner and qualitie of the ſame. Whereby you may perceiue the ſimple ſubtiltie of ſome learned Papiſts, who ſuppoſe this <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee meerely <hi>ſpirituall</hi> (in falling from Ethnicall Idolatry vnto Chriſtian Religion) and not a <hi>materiall</hi> fall, by outward ruine; as <hi>Ludouicus ab Alcaſar</hi> doth vainly dreame; ſtanding in a fooliſh oppoſition heerein vnto the iudicious reſolution of <hi>Viegas,</hi> and <hi>Ribera;</hi> his more ingenious, and exact compeeres.</p>
               <p>Now, for concluſion of this whole matter, I muſt take notice of <hi>foure Queſtions,</hi> which are appendant, and belonging vnto this <hi>fall;</hi> by faire diſcuſſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ſhall exempt, and take out of your minds, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Doubts, which may ariſe (and perhaps are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie riſen) in your apprehenſion of this <hi>fall.</hi>

                  <hi>First;</hi> there is obſerued their beginning, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.12. <hi>The tenne hornes,</hi> [to wit, of the <hi>Beaſt: Verſe</hi> 3. which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Beaſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſucceeding in the place of the firſt: <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.11.] <hi>are ten Kings, which yet haue not receiued a Kingdome</hi> to wit, in the time of Saint <hi>Iohn] but ſhall receiue power, as Kings, at one houre with the Beast.</hi> For, as the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Dominions of the Kings, and States in <hi>Europe,</hi> were members of the great and mightie bodie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, which was diſſolued afterward into theſe parts, of which it was formerly compounded, and made; ſo theſe Kings, and States, aroſe neere vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame time, which is here called <hi>one houre;</hi> not in an exact meaſure of time, but in a conuenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquitie, and neerneſſe of time, according to the phraſe of holy Writ; wherein the word <hi>houre</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſenſe; as 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wee were kept from you, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>for an houre:</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.2.18. <hi>Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> it <hi>is</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the last houre, &amp;c.</hi> It followeth;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18730:107"/>
that they receiued this power at one houre <hi>with the Beaſt;</hi> beauſe as the Imperiall dignitie, and glory did decay, by fraction, &amp; partition of the potent Empire, ſo the ſecond Beaſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> [the <hi>Papall</hi> State] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to aduance it ſelfe, and to ſucceed, by a pretenſe of Eccleſiaſticall Supremacie, in the place of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Beaſt [the State Imperial] as he began to decreaſe; according to the prediction of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> which I haue touched before in the precedent Sermon, vnto which, I muſt therefore, remit you for the more cleere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this point. But now you may ſee, what theſe Kings are; whence, when, with whome, and from whom, they tooke their Royall dignitie, and power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is obſerued the ſubiection, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their power vnto this <hi>ſecond Beaſt,</hi> whoſe Eccleſiaſticall glorie, and eſtimation, did inſnare the ciuill Dominion of theſe Kings: for ſo it followeth, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. <hi>They ſhall giue their power; and authoritie vnto the Beaſt;</hi> vpon which he cunningly intruded, by faire pretenſes of his ſucceſſion vnto the Prince of the Apoſtles, and of his immediate function vnder Ieſus Chriſt; whoſe name hee abuſed to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuppreſſion of his Euangelicall Truth. Thus theſe Kings became his inſtruments alſo, to ſerue his turne, in the oppugnation of Chriſts Doctrine, and in the perſecution of his members, as the prediction, in the fourteenth <hi>Verſe,</hi> doth truly beare, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of things doth notably declare. And now they were made <hi>the hornes</hi> of this ſecond Beaſt, that is to ſay, his ſtrength and corroboration (as this word <hi>horne</hi> doth often ſignifie, in the Scriptures; but more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18730:108"/>
ſpecially in the Booke of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Daniel</hi>) whereby hee ſhould ſubſiſt in power, honour, and command: for all theſe things ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in the Beaſt, when theſe Kings ſhall withdraw their obedience from him, and reſume their owne power; which as they did fondly ſubmit vnto him, ſo hee doth proudly vendicate vnto himſelfe; for ſo hee was foretold by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>lift vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all, that is called God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> there enſueth their action of hoſtilitie, and enterprize of warre againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein this Beaſt doth reigne; for ſo it is written; <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. <hi>The ten hornes, which thou ſaweſt vpon the Beaſt, are they, that ſhall hate the Whore</hi> [what? are they like <hi>Amnon,</hi> whoſe loue to <hi>Tamar</hi> turned into hatred?] <hi>and ſhall make her deſolate, and naked, and ſhall eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire;</hi> the old puniſhment, which in the Law of Nature, was inflicted vpon Whores, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> 38.24. Here is a ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis;</hi> Friends changed into Enemies; ſetters vp into pullers downe, Defenders into Expugnators; <hi>Babylons</hi> louers into her haters; the ſtrength of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> into his ruine. <hi>This is the Lords doing</hi> (as you ſhall heare anon) <hi>and it is meruailous in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meanewhile, I cannot paſſe forward, vnto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of other points, without a ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this; namely, that theſe <hi>Kings,</hi> thus ſubmitting their Royall power vnto the <hi>Beast</hi> (partly to take a Crowne by his donation; partly to hold it ratified by his confirmation: partly to hold it) vpon tearmes of fealtie to him; partly to acknowledge all their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be deriued from his plenitude of power; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18730:108"/>
to ſuffer him to execute forreigne iuriſdiction in their Realmes; partly to ſtand in awe of his ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall depoſition; partly to ſuffer an expilation of the goods, and reuenues of their ſubiects, iſſuing forth of their Kingdomes, to the ſupportation of <hi>Babylon;</hi> partly to permit their <hi>Clericall</hi> ſubiects to be exempted from their Regall authoritie; and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes, whereby the proud vſurping Beaſt doth either cloſely, like a Fox, inſinuate into their Crownes, or violently like a Lion, inſult vpon the ſame; by their owne folly, tenderneſſe, and ignorance in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <hi>that ſo Gods Word might be fulfilled herein</hi>) I ſay, I cannot neglect the obſeruation of this point; that now theſe Kings (not the ſame in perſon, but in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) ſhould beginne <hi>to bee wiſe,</hi> to vnderſtand his tyrannie, to ſee their owne miſerie, and to reuenge theſe wrongs with fire, and with ſword, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and without remorſe. <hi>Leo;</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in more happy times (yet one, that, in ſome things prepared a way for the aduancement of this <hi>ſecond Beaſt;</hi> which, from a <hi>Pygmie</hi> became an <hi>Hercules,</hi> and by ſeuerall augmentations, grew vp more, and more, from ſmall beginnings, vnto the full proportion of his greatneſſe, wherein he ſtood long, but now beginneth to <hi>fall</hi>) thou, O <hi>bleſſed Leo,</hi> by the venerable authoritie of thy graue, and gracious perſon, by thy perſwaſiue Eloquence, and gentle intreates, diddeſt once diuert the hoſtile inuaſion of <hi>Attila</hi> (King of the <hi>Hunnes</hi>) from <hi>Rome</hi> (not then <hi>Babylon</hi>) and thou waſt a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour</hi> vnto her (as many of the Iudges in ancient <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were called) not by a Sword, but by thy word, full of power, and efficacie in thy religious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18730:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mouth. But now this Spirit, this excellencie ſhall not bee in thy ſucceſſours, when the fatall houre of her laſt deſolation, and <hi>fall,</hi> is come; for the wrath of theſe Kings ſhall bee ſpecially incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Beaſt; a <hi>Lyon</hi> indeed, not in heroicall forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Chriſtian magnanimitie, but in crueltie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, inſultation; ſtirring vp theſe Kings vnto this furie, which no perſwaſion, no eloquence, no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie can appeaſe.</p>
               <p>And now, to conclude this point; I find two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, that attend this laſt paſſage of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The FIRST concerneth a <hi>dogmaticall errour,</hi> and falſe opinion, preuailing very much in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of <hi>Rome;</hi> to wit, that <hi>Antichriſt ſhall deſtroy Rome:</hi> which falſe opinion by miſinterpretation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe out of the true doctrine of S. <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> That Antichriſt ſhall not be diſcloſed, vntill the Romane Emperor were <hi>taken out of the way;</hi> which then <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,</hi> and ſo kept downe all other power, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt could not exalt himſelfe. Hence the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as namely S. <hi>Hierome; epiſt.</hi> 151. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 11. and, long before him, <hi>Tertull. in apologetic. cap.</hi> 32. whoſe iudgement alſo S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth follow, <hi>de Ciuit. Dei, l.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 23. but vpon another ground, taken, and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>) doe very truly deduce, and inferre, that <hi>the Romane Empire ſhall not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, vntill the comming of Antichriſt;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeemed reaſonably to ſuppoſe alſo, that <hi>it ſhall bee deſtroyed by him;</hi> and ſo, conſequently, that <hi>Rome it ſelfe ſhall ſuffer her finall ruine by his power, and by his meanes.</hi> Which erroneous deduction ſeemeth to haue had a generall applauſe in the ancient times of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18730:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Church; as wee may ſee by the teſtimonie of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who liued in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, vpon the yeere 320. Thus therefore hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; <hi>Inſtitut. diuin. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 25. That <hi>the end of the world will not come, till the destruction of Rome:</hi> and that <hi>the abominable Tyrant</hi> [Antichriſt] <hi>ſhall performe that worke.</hi> But as <hi>Lactantius,</hi> with many other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was infected with ſundry falſe appehenſions (as, in this very Chapter, That <hi>the world ſhould ſtand but two hundred yeres after their time;</hi> and elſe where; <hi>That Chriſt ſhould reigne a thouſand yeeres on the earth, &amp;c.</hi>) ſo, in this particular conceit, he, and others, digreſſed apparantly from the truth, as wanting the cleere eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of times, and the ſucceſſe of things, to helpe them in the right interpretation of the Scriptures, in this propheticall kind.</p>
               <p>It is then a very certaine, and pregnant truth, which <hi>Tertullian, Auguſtine, Hierome, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others did conceiue, that the <hi>Romane Empire ſhould ſtand, till the reuelation of Antichriſt</hi> (according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>) And againe, it is true, in a great part, <hi>that Antichriſt hath deſtroyed it;</hi> for the Popes were a ſpeciall meanes to exclude the Emperour out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> (which they haue inuaded) and, erecting a new Empire in the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and after in <hi>Germanie,</hi> they finally made this <hi>Nominall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> a <hi>Reall ſlaue</hi> of <hi>Babylon;</hi> though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with great reluctation, and oppoſition of the Emperours, as he was able to reſiſt; whom therefore the Popes did gladly ſuffer to bee depriued of their rights in <hi>Italy;</hi> the ſame being a Countrie, ſpecially accommodated for the aduantage, and ſecuritie of his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18730:110"/>
greatneſſe, becauſe there are ſundry formes of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many particular ſtates therein: In regard whereof, as one hath a diligent eye to obſerue, and hinder the increaſe, and inlargement of another, ſo, if any of them oppoſe his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> hee is readie, with his thunderbolts, to ſhake that State in pieces, and to raiſe vp other Princes there, to make an execution of his ſentence. And becauſe he doth pretend ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt in the goodly, and rich Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> he therefore inſtalled the Kings thereof, with this caution and reſeruation, That <hi>they ſhould neuer take the Empire vpon them;</hi> fearing, thereupon, the potencie of ſo neere a neighbour, as being preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto his triple Crowne. This was a matter of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall exception, taken againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection vnto the Imperiall State; though not purſued, becauſe there was no remedie againſt ſo mightie a Prince; who, as hee ſeemed to accept the Empire, againſt the ancient prouiſion of the Popes, ſo he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnmannerly to reſigne the ſame vnto <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his brother, and to eſtabliſh him therein, without the notice, and approbation of the holy Father. Thus farre, then, we agree with the iudgement of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, touching the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour, and Antichriſt, becauſe it agreeth very well with the prediction of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> But the predictions of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently refute the laſt opinion (which ſeemeth to be inferred out of the former, by an emptie, and barren ſpeculation) to wit, that <hi>the Citie of Rome ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Antichrist,</hi> and his aſſociats; as <hi>Lactantius lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 16. doth erroniouſly conceiue. For the <hi>Second Beast</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Antichrist</hi> himſelfe, to whom the ten
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18730:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kings gaue their power; and <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not <hi>by this Second Beaſt,</hi> but <hi>for this Second Beaſt;</hi> the ten Kings not being now his helpers, and aſſiſtants in this ſubuerſion of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but his enemies, &amp; aſſailants, to ruinate <hi>Babylon,</hi> (wherin he reigneth) becauſe of his abominable comportment therein; as the context of the Scripture it ſelfe doth infallibly demonſtrate, and conclude. And therefore, as in many other points, concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were much deceiued; ſo particularly in this, namely, to imagine, that he ſhould deſtroy <hi>Rome,</hi> who is the Man (or rather the <hi>Beast</hi>) that beareth rule therein, as in the very Seate, and Center of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
               <p>The SECOND obſeruation, which from thence I frame, and tender vnto your religious hearts, is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall truth;</hi> namely, that God doth often puniſh our ſinnes, by ſuch meanes, and inſtruments, as were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable vnto vs therein, to the accompliſhment of our deſires. So wee read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.37.39. &amp;c. that whereas the Iewes committed ſpirituall fornication with the Idols of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and reappoſed more in the helpe of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſometimes, then in the protection of God; therefore he threatneth to giue them into their hands; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruments of their ſinnes againſt him, ſhould bee alſo inſtruments of his iudgements againſt them. Sundry are the examples in this kind, which I cannot now produce: but leauing the ponderation of this point vnto your owne hearts, I aduiſe you, in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feare of God, ſo to pleaſe him in all your wayes, that not onely all men, but all his creatures may bee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18730:111"/>
diſpoſed, and inclined by him to our incolunitie, and preſeruation. So ſaith the Wiſeman: <hi>When the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, hee will alſo make his enemies at peace with him, Prou.</hi> 16.7. To this purpoſe ſpake <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The ſtones of the field ſhall bee in league with thee, and the beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee;</hi> But if wee ſinne impenitently againſt him, euery creature in heauen and earth, is readie preſt by his inſtinct, and motion, to reuenge the iniurie done vnto him, who is the Creator of heauen and earth. And ſo much concerning the firſt queſtion; I come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto the ſecond.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="question">
               <head>The <hi>SECOND</hi> Queſtion.</head>
               <p>SECONDLY; if you require of me, what are the cauſes, for which theſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> ſhall take vp their Armes againſt <hi>Babylon;</hi> I anſwere (partly out of the euidence of the Scripture, and partly out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of reaſon) that three principall cauſes concurre in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>The FIRST is a meritorious cauſe, by congruitie, and condignitie (as they vſe to ſpeake of the merit of their workes) in regard of her ſinnes (which I haue touched heretofore, in the compariſons betwixt the <hi>Miſticall,</hi> and the <hi>Literall Babylon</hi>) which, being a burthen vnto the earth, cry for vengeance vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And now here is a collection of her ſinnes; the old, and the new come into one reckoning, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They were paſt in act, but remained in guilt; wherefore it is ſaid, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Her ſins are come vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18730:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heauen, and God hath remembred her iniquities;</hi> for though hee alwayes <hi>remembred</hi> them in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and knowledge, yet now hee declareth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance by the execution of his Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Thus we perceiue, that God hath a time, to permit ſinnes, and a time to puniſh ſinnes (the former, and the latter ſinnes together) of any ſtate, or of any perſon, when our repentance bindeth not vp the hands of his iuſtice, but our continuance, addition, and renouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, draw the ſword out of the ſcabbard, and compell him vnto the manifeſtation of his wrath; as it is here in the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon;</hi> whoſe ſins are bound vp together, in this great, and fearefull iudgement.</p>
               <p>But ſince ſhe will make no benefit of this inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as being obdurate in the courſe of her ſinnes, and prepared for deſtruction) let vs obſerue it (brethren) for our owne vſe, ſince wee know the iuſt ſeueritie of God, which leadeth vs vnto ſpeedie repentance; leaſt he arraigne vs at the barre of his Iuſtice, for our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; for our latter ſins. This obſeruation pertaineth, firſt, vnto a Kingdome, and State; hee doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger her ſins, though he remember them not preſently in iudgement. After many hundred yeeres, he called <hi>Amalek</hi> vnto an account; <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaith he vnto <hi>Saul) what Amalek did vnto Iſrael; how they laid wait for them in the way, as they came vp out of Egypt;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent <hi>Saul</hi> vpon an expedition againſt the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi> to deſtroy them from the face of the earth. O that my natiue Countrey would take notice of this at the heart, and not adde ſin vnto ſin, new vnto the old; prouoking God vnto great indignation againſt her. But two things comfort me here: the one; that God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18730:112"/>
will ſpare the Land, becauſe hee hath many faithfull ſeruants therein, that <hi>mourne for the ſins</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and that (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaketh in <hi>Iob</hi> 22.30.) <hi>the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhall deliuer the Iland.</hi> For it is not the Sea, that can defend vs from inuaſion; it is not any Caſtle, that can ſaue vs from the enemy (and ſin within the Land, is of greater force to deſtroy it, then any foe without) but ſome <hi>righteous men</hi> are in the <hi>Iland,</hi> and God doth ſpare it <hi>for their ſake.</hi> The other is, that (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Dauids</hi> option, and choyce) wee ſhall rather fall into the hands of the Lord, then of men, for the puniſhment and caſtigation of this Land.</p>
               <p>This obſeruation pertaineth, ſecondly, vnto the <hi>Church;</hi> which, falling in her inward puritie, cannot ſtand long (as <hi>Gregorie</hi> noted) in her outward glory, If wee haue not a place in the conſcience of men (by our effectuall doctrine, and our exemplarie life) that wee haue a manſion in their very hearts, then the Law, our Gouernment, our Temporalties, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prouiſion for the Miniſters of the Church, ſhall make them but a weake conſiſtencie, and a feeble ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world. Let not our ſins preuaile againſt vs, to prouoke God, and we ſhall not feare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotments of any mortall man, <hi>whoſe breath is in his nostrills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This obſeruation pertaineth, thirdly, vnto euery particular perſon, of whatſoeuer qualitie, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; rich, or poore, high, or low. For, for if thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the ſins of thy age, vnto the ſins of thy youth, (for which <hi>Dauid</hi> intreateth pardon of God; <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 25.7.) and makeſt an accumulation of thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of latter vnto former, without remorſe of thy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18730:112"/>
conſcience, and feare of Gods diſpleaſure, ſaying; <hi>I ſhall haue peace, although I walke according to the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneneſſe of mine owne heart, thus adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt;</hi> know then, that <hi>the Lord will not be mercifull vnto thee, but then the wrath of the Lord, and his iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſhall ſmoake againſt thee, and euery curſe, that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his booke, ſhall light vpon thee, and the Lord ſhall put out thy name from vnder heauen. Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. yea <hi>out of heauen</hi> alſo: that is; hee ſhall <hi>declare,</hi> that thy name was neuer written there; according to that in the Pſalme; <hi>Let them be put out of the booke of life. Pſa.</hi> 69.28. And ſo much concerning the firſt cauſe, why theſe ten Kings aſſemble againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> to worke her <hi>fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The SECOND is an efficient cauſe; and that is, God by his iuſtice; his iuſtice being prouoked by her ſins; according to that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.24. <hi>Who gaue Iacob to the ſpoile, and Iſrael to the robbers? Did not the Lord, becauſe wee haue ſinned againſt him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we haue a connexion of the firſt, and ſecond cauſe, in this one ſentence, which meete in <hi>Babylons</hi> caſe. For firſt, wee heare of the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of her fall, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.2. <hi>The Kings of the earth haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with her, and the Inhabitants of the earth are drunken with the wine of her fornication;</hi> to wit, in her Eccleſiaſticall State. Then, ſecondly, we heare of the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of her fall: <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>God hath put in the hearts of the ten Kings to fulfill his will, and to doe with one conſent, for to giue their Kingdome vnto the Beast:</hi> How long? <hi>Vntill the words of God bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> What then? <hi>They ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate, and naked, and burne her with fire.</hi> Vpon what motion? <hi>From God;</hi> as the Text doth plainly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18730:113"/>
beare. And therefore our moſt learned, and prudent Souereigne doth truly and aptly obſerue in this place; <hi>The hearts of the greateſt Kings, as well, as of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſubiects, are in the hands of the Lord, to make them his inſtruments, and to turne them, as it ſhall pleaſe him to employ them.</hi> Here then I note three things.</p>
               <p>FIRST: though Kings may bee carried by their proper motion of malice, or auarice, or of ſome other affection, in their warres againſt ſome people, and in bringing them to ruine; yet therein we may obſerue, and muſt confeſſe, that it is <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> Gods finger, or rather Gods <hi>hand</hi> in this worke. So <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> himſelfe (a cruell, proud, inſolent Prince) in his warres, did ſo performe the will, and purpoſe of God therein, that God himſelfe giueth him the title of his <hi>ſeruant,</hi> and commendeth his <hi>ſeruice</hi> done vnto him, not only againſt his enemies (a people that knew not his Lawes) as it is <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 29.18. but alſo againſt his owne people; <hi>Ieremy</hi> 25.9. And ſo in his ſacred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> theſe Kings are Gods <hi>ſeruants;</hi> they doe their worke from him; and hee doth his worke by them. Therefore Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (or whoſoeuer is the Author of that Commentarie vpon the <hi>Reuelation</hi>) doth ingeniouſly deliuer his iudgement vpon the words of my Text [<hi>Babylon is fallen:</hi> it being here the voyce of God to declare it; &amp; the hand of God to effect it] that, in this caſe, <hi>dixiſſe Dei, feciſſe est: dixit enim cecidiſſe Babylonem, quia ipſe fecit, vt caderet.</hi> The ſpeech of God is the worke of God: for hee ſaid, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, becauſe he brought it to paſſe, that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould fall.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; we may heere conſider, that, as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18730:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is mercie in God to receiue vs vnto grace, ſo there is Iuſtice in him to puniſh our ſinnes. <hi>Marci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> knew not this; but, becauſe of different operations, proceeding from God, hee made a diuerſitie of Gods; one good, another iuſt, or rather cruell; one the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the body, another of the ſoule; one, whom he would loue; another, whom he would feare; one in the Law, another in the Goſpell. But wee know one God alone; onely good, onely wiſe, onely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; whoſe mercie is free, and proceedeth from himſelfe; whoſe iuſtice is right, and is prouoked by vs: for as wee haue <hi>malum culpae,</hi> to offend him, ſo hee hath <hi>malum poenae</hi> to afflict vs. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.7.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, and laſtly; though Reaſon may ſeeme to perſwade vs (as it perſwadeth <hi>Babylon</hi> her ſelfe) that ſhe is ſo ſtrengthened by the confederacy of Princes (as, in many dangers, ſhee hath not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the tearmes of prudencie in this behalfe) by the amitie of her Friends, by the diligence of her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiators, by the policie of her Counſellours, by the art of her Learning, by the abundance of her Riches, and, finally, by a generall confluence of all outward meanes, for the ſupportation of her Eſtate, that ſhee ſhall neuer fall (for ſo <hi>ſhe ſaith in her heart; I ſit being a Queene, and am no Widdow, and ſhall ſee no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Apoc.</hi> 18.7.) yet Faith aſſureth me, that her owne Friends, her owne Vp-holders (her <hi>hornes</hi>) theſe <hi>ten Kings,</hi> her old Louers, ſhall bring her downe to the Earth; to <hi>fall</hi> ſo low, that ſhee can fall no lower; I meane not in place, and ſituation, but in condition, and eſtate. Now; if <hi>Rome aske;</hi> or if my owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18730:114"/>
demand of me; <hi>how can this be?</hi> I anſwere; God hath ſaid it, and hee will doe it; I haue heard his Word, and now I doe expect his Worke. Away then with <hi>quomodo</hi> (how can this, or how can that bee?) when God ſpeaketh, and God aſſureth vs, and God reuealeth his Will vnto vs. <hi>This Word commeth in with incredulitie, and want of faith;</hi> as the diuine Preacher Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently note vpon the queſtion of the <hi>Iewes; Iohn</hi> 6.52. <hi>How can this man giue vs his fleſh to eate?</hi> Therefore I reſt vpon the truth of God; that is it, which I beleeue, and I am no farther ſcrupulous, in regard of many improbabilities, and difficulties, which reaſon ſuggeſteth, and preſenteth vnto me in this point. If I haue (as now I haue) Gods Word, that this Worke ſhall be performed, I am not curious to inquire of the manner, and meanes, <hi>how</hi> hee will bring the ſame to paſſe. And ſo much concerning the ſecond cauſe of the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Kings.</p>
               <p>The THIRD is an excitant cauſe; <hi>inward,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the iuſt wrath of theſe Kings; but <hi>outward,</hi> in reſpect of the prouocation thereof, by the indignities, and iniuries of <hi>Babylon,</hi> againſt the Potentates of the Earth. Now, as in the firſt, and ſecond cauſes, I had the plaine teſtimonie of Scripture; ſo heere, in this third, I haue the certaine aſſurance of ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to confirme, and ſettle my iudgement therein; for now I beginne to diſcouer ſome impulſiue cauſe, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſtirreth vp theſe Kings vnto the execution of Gods Worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> therefore, <hi>Babylon</hi> hath treaſonable doctrines
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18730:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt the ſtate, and dignitie of Kings (though they were the <hi>hornes,</hi> and ſtrength of the <hi>ſecond Beast</hi> therein) as namely; to depoſe Kings from their roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeates; yea, to take away the faire Titles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe had inueſted them before; as this <hi>Beaſt</hi> had once taken vpon him to depriue <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, of his Title of <hi>the most Chriſtian King,</hi> and to tranſlate it vnto <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England</hi> (as <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> their owne Hiſtorian, doth record) though afterward, with greater furie and indignation, hee proceeded againſt the ſame <hi>Henry,</hi> who had beene a principall <hi>horne,</hi> to corroborate, and confirme the Maieſtie of the Triple Crowne. Againe, this <hi>Babylon</hi> expoſeth the perſons of Princes vnto priuate violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and publike impugnation by their owne ſubiects, as well as their States, vnto the Rapine, and Inuaſion, of forreigne power. Laſtly; this <hi>Babylon</hi> doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance her <hi>Beaſt</hi> aboue all ciuil Lords, and Souereignes; not onely by an indirect authoritie ouer them, in caſe of Hereſie, and for ſpirituall ends (to which opinion onely, and no farther a multitude of <hi>Babylonians</hi> doe incline, though with the peremptorie cenſure of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelfe, and violent oppugnation of his chiefe Adherents, in that behalfe) but by a direct, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour authoritie ouer them, as Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. So <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, intruded vpon the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> but found the ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Philippus Pulcher,</hi> to his great diſgrace. So <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fift, (that ſubtile, and inſolent <hi>Beaſt</hi>) diſdayned the Workes of their Learned <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, becauſe he did not attribute this direct Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie vnto the Pope (as a true, and lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18730:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all Kings) and therefore did conceiue a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſuppreſſe, and extinguiſh his Writings, that ſeemed to limit, and circumſcribe, the tranſcendencie of his power; as <hi>D. Barkley</hi> (a <hi>Pontifician</hi> in other points) doth relate in his very impugnation of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> opinion; that being alſo falſe, ſcandalous, and dangerous vnto the ſtate of Chriſtian Princes, and, in ſome reſpects, more abſurd, then the other, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did before reiect; though, in his Reply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>D. Barkley,</hi> hee ſeemeth to incline (like a <hi>Cardinall</hi> now) vnto the challenge of his holy Father <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and from an <hi>indirect</hi> power, groweth toward a <hi>direct;</hi> which doctrine paſſeth freely amongſt the <hi>Canoniſts;</hi> is much imbraced by the <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> is diligently furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Popes; and doth daily gather ſtrength in <hi>Babylon.</hi> No maruell then, if, as the proportion of <hi>Hercules</hi> his bodie was collected by the quantitie of his foot; ſo, by theſe foote-ſteps of <hi>Antichriſtianity,</hi> Chriſtian Princes doe now beginne to diſcerne, and diſcouer the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> himſelfe; and to be excited iuſtly vnto the ruine, and perdition of his eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly; Babylon</hi> hath treaſonable practiſes againſt the liues and ſtates of Princes; and theſe ſame iſſuing alſo out of her very doctrines, by a powerfull incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of bewitched ſoules; as namely out of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, Indulgences, Merit, Satisfaction,</hi> and the like; beſides a blind, and vnqueſtionable obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many ſtand more ſpecially deuoted, and alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged vnto this <hi>Beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore, though it bee ſo, that Chriſtian Princes ſhould be more iealous of Gods <hi>honour,</hi> then their owne ſtate; of his <hi>glorie,</hi> then their owne ſafetie;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18730:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his <hi>truth,</hi> then their owne liues; (and certainly, for theſe cauſes, God ſhall raiſe them vp, vnto this ſacred expedition, againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her <hi>Beaſt</hi>) yet now their own cauſe ſhall incite them forward to the ſame; their ſtate, ſafetie, and liues, being in danger, by the baſeſt Vaſſall of this <hi>Purpled Whore.</hi> For if his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may iuſtly depoſe a Prince, from his Royall Seat, by a Papall ſentence, and if execution thereof cannot otherwiſe proceed; then that may well follow, which <hi>Mariana</hi> (a learned, but a wicked Ieſuite) doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in this caſe; namely, that ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> may bee lawfully empoyſoned [if it were in their very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe, Papiſts know the practice of this villany] or, by ſome clandeſtine, and ſecret meanes, depriued of his life. And the truth is, that, if the generall, and current doctrine of <hi>Babylon</hi> (for depoſition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) bee ſound and ſubſtantiall; then ſuch practiſes (and ſpecially for defect of ſome other courſe, to put the Papall ſentence in execution) are by the verdict of good reaſon, and by faire conſequence of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to bee maintayned, and to bee performed; which horrible, and damnable impietie, is conuinced by the teſtimonie of Gods Word, by the pietie of the ancient Church, and by the iudgement of ſundrie Papiſts themſelues; not ſo deeply, and dangerouſly infected with the leauen of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in this point, and therefore leſſe neere, and deare vnto the Triple-crowned <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you haue a deciſion of the ſecond point; namely the cauſes (with the ſeuerall branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) why theſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> ſhall conſpire in this action,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18730:116"/>
for the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and therefore I will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed vnto the third.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="question">
               <head>The <hi>THIRD</hi> Queſtion.</head>
               <p>THIRDLY, then, if you require of me; when the ten Kings (theſe glorious ſtarres in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World) ſhall meete in this <hi>coniunction,</hi> which ſhall be ſo fatall vnto <hi>Rome;</hi> I anſwere; it is a curioſitie to enquire the time, and temeritie to define it. For who can looke, without his perill, into the <hi>Arke</hi> of the Diuine prouidence? Wherefore, in an vncertaine point, I will follow the greateſt certaintie, which the Scripture itſelfe, and my beſt obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will direct mee vnto in ſo doubtfull a caſe. The points, which I tender vnto your conſideration, are foure.</p>
               <p>FIRST; this fall of <hi>Rome</hi> (deſcribed <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.) is not long before the period, and concluſion of the World; for (as I noted in my former Sermon) the Saints reioyce for her ruine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. then, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. there is a recapitulation of things paſt in the ſtate of the Church, with a deſcription of the generall Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: then, in the two laſt <hi>Chapters,</hi> enſueth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of celeſtiall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and the happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Triumphant</hi> Church; the ſtate of the <hi>Militant</hi> being now conſummate, and ended (as it ſeemeth) in, or vpon, the fall of <hi>Babylon;</hi> as being one of the laſt glorious, and obſeruable Acts, preceding the generall Reſurrection of the dead. Howbeit I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18730:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
determinately affirme with <hi>Lactant. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. that the World ſhall receiue her end immediately vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this vaſtation of <hi>Rome;</hi> which, (as he falſly ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) ſhould be performed by the great Antichriſt; and conſequently, according to his account, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion of the Ancients, the World cannot ſtand longer, then the ſpace of three yeares, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, after the fall of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſince he, and they, did generally conceiue, that the Reigne of Antichriſt was confined within the compaſſe of three yeeres, and an halfe. But as their ſpeculations in this kinde had no ſufficient ground, and the very courſes of times, with the ſucceſſe of things therein (beſides the more cleere, and certaine expoſition of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Scriptures in this later Age) doe foundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the ſame; ſo they inferre with them this palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abſurditie, that, they, who ſee this extinction, and ruine of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall haue an infallible knowledge, that the World ſhall determine, and end within the ſpace of ſuch a time (the fire, in <hi>Romes</hi> deſtruction, giuing them this light) which conſequence as it is euident, vpon their ground, ſo it needeth no refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince it implyeth ſundry points of markeable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which I leaue vnto your prudent cenſure.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; her fall attendeth the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and full number of her ſinnes; according to a ſemblable caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. <hi>When the ſinnes of the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites <hi>are full, &amp;c.</hi> when the latter times of <hi>Rome</hi> haue filled vp the meaſure of her iniquities; when this Harueſt is ripe, then commeth the Sickle of Gods vengeance: or (to follow the very words of GODS Spirit) this <hi>fall</hi> ſhall come vnto <hi>Rome, when the words
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18730:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God are fulfilled (Apoc.</hi> 17.17.) concerning her tyrannie, pride, and inſolencie; which muſt haue their due courſe, before her fatall end.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, then, we may reaſonably conclude, that the time of her fall is neere at hand; for what can future <hi>Rome</hi> adde vnto the ſinnes of the former? —<hi>eadem facient, cupient<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> minores,</hi> (as the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poet ſpake of <hi>Imperiall Rome,</hi> vpon fifteen hundred yeeres agoe) they, that come after, ſhall deſire, and doe the ſame things with them, that went before. What Tyrannie, what Oppreſſion, what Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what Antichriſtian Pride, what Inſolencie againſt Princes, what Deluſions, what Impoſtures can wee expect from <hi>Rome</hi> hereafter, which wee haue not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready found?</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY, and laſtly; wee may obſerue, that, as the myſticall condition of this <hi>Babylonian Rome</hi> is, by cleere remonſtrance (made by learned, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men) notoriouſly diſcouered vnto all the World, ſo the <hi>hornes</hi> of the Papall Beaſt haue begun to fall from his head; his power being thereby much abated, and neuer likely to bee recouered againe; but one horne, after another, ſhall be plucked off. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I may certainly conclude, that the <hi>Turke</hi> ſhall not deſtroy the ſtates, and dignities of theſe ten Kings, (whatſoeuer <hi>Zanchius,</hi> a learned, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Diuine, did conceiue to the contrary; for which he ſuffered ſome oppoſition, as, in the ſecond part of his <hi>Miſcellanea,</hi> it may appeare; and whatſoeuer <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> himſelfe deliuered in his publike Lectures; that <hi>all</hi> Germanie <hi>ſhould bee poſſeſſed by the</hi> Turke) and my reaſon is grounded vpon the Scripture; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18730:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the ten Kings, which aroſe with the ſecond Beaſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall deſtroy <hi>Rome</hi> at the laſt (and therefore if the Turke obtaine their Kingdomes, it muſt be after the fal of the <hi>Rome,</hi> which they muſt firſt ruinate) ſo I may very reaſonably, and probably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the Kings, which are alreadie fallen from the <hi>Beaſt</hi> [the Pope] ſhall neuer returne vnto him againe, <hi>to giue their power,</hi> a ſecond time, vnto him, and to ſubmit their Royall States vnto the Papall Crowne.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould aduance her ſelfe in <hi>England</hi> againe (which wee haue no cauſe to feare, nor Papiſts reaſon to hope) yet that ſhall not hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this worke: for <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt <hi>fall;</hi> it is decreed by GOD; it ſhall bee performed by theſe Kings.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding; ſince <hi>Babylon</hi> is full of malice, and indignation, playing, firſt, the <hi>Foxe,</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords Vineyard, that ſhee might be a <hi>Lyon,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to kill the Keepers thereof; let vs not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in obſeruing her courſes, nor fearefull to ſuſtaine her conflict. Let vs be prepared for that, which may not, perhaps, be prepared for vs; Wee muſt not bee wanting to Martyrdome, though it may bee wanting vnto vs: <hi>ne deſit animus Martyrio,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian;</hi> Let vs not want a mind to die for the truth of Chriſt; hee may be an <hi>habituall</hi> Martyr euer, that is an <hi>actuall</hi> neuer; in preparation of mind, not in paſſion of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; in will, and not in worke: as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, that hee was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr in <hi>will,</hi> though not in <hi>worke;</hi> whereas the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> were Martyrs in worke, but not in will; and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18730:118"/>
Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>both.</hi> But here let no man deceiue himſelfe with a ſudden apprehenſion of Martyrdome, as a matter of little difficultie to vndergo; but let him conſider rather, that <hi>multi ante perſecutionem Leones, in perſecutione cerui;</hi> many are Lyons in the time of peace, but Harts in the time of perſecution (as one of the Ancients ſpake, by experience of thoſe times) that many, who ſpeake gloriouſly of their reſolution, appeare cowards in their performance (as the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Doctor <hi>Pendleton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Sanders</hi> may teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) and finally, that they, whom God calleth vnto ſo great a worke, ſhall bee prepared by him with gifts, conuenient for that purpoſe. Therfore Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (writing vnto his ſiſter <hi>Marcella; Epiſt.</hi> 44.) ſaith modeſtly of himſelfe; <hi>becauſe God knew me to be weake, hee hath not yet giuen the Deuill power ouer my bodie. And though I ſhould deſire martyrdome, and offer my ſelfe vnto it, perhaps he doth iudge mee yet to be vnable for ſo great a ſtrife, and therefore doth exerciſe mee with other labours, and diuers afflictions; but hath not tried mee in this kind.</hi> O the rare humilitie of ſuch an excellent ſpirit! Let vs, then, by his example, bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not boaſting; readie, not deſirous, to dye for the cauſe of God, if <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould yet againe try vs in the fire of her perſecution, before ſhee come to the fire of her owne ruine. And ſo much of the third point; namely, the time; when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed by theſe Kings.</p>

               <p>WE doe not now enquire concerning the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the Pope (whether a <hi>Iohn,</hi> as many were, or a <hi>Iohne,</hi> as one was ſuppoſed to be) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>State,</hi> place, office, and dignitie of the Pope, and as hee is the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there the <hi>Imperiall Seat,</hi> and, by another forme, or colour of gouernment, vſurping the <hi>Imperiall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> as the ancient Fathers doe vſually ſpeake of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (according to the tenour of the Scripture it ſelfe, in this behalfe) and as the experience of latter ages doth really verifie, and exhibite the truth of their iudgement herein, vnto our eyes.</p>
               <p>I anſwere then; that as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth vainely flatter himſelfe (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pont. Rom. cap.</hi> 4.) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18730:119"/>
the time of this ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> (namely, that it ſhall not be vntill the end of the world, and in the time of their chimericall, and imagined Antichriſt, whoſe reigne, enduring three yeeres, and an halfe, is ended by the ſecond comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as they ſimply pretend) ſo hee doth delude himſelfe, and others, when he ſaith, that, in the time, and after the time of her ruine, the Pope ſhall bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and indeed ſhall be, <hi>Romanus Pontifex,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the truth is apparant, by the tenour of the ſacred Booke of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that the <hi>Papall Beast</hi> is the cauſe of the expedition, made by the tenne Kings againſt <hi>Babylon;</hi> that this warre, made vpon <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> is in regard of the pride, oppreſſion, and other ſinnes in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſhee is borne vp, and ſupported by the ſecond Beaſt; whoſe Dominion was aduanced by their ſubmiſſion vnto him, and ſhall bee ſuppreſſed by their concurrencie againſt him. It is not, then, a quarrell againſt the Citizens, or the edifices of <hi>Rome,</hi> but againſt her vſurpations, exerciſed by the Triple-crowned Beaſt therein. Neither had theſe Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their deſigne, if, when they burnt the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould ſtill remaine. Therefore, as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> it ſelfe ſhall fall, ſo the power of her Beaſt ſhall be deſtroyed by theſe Kings, as being coupled, and commixed with the ſame. For as the ruine of Literall <hi>Babylon</hi> was accompanied with the ruine of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> Empire, ſo the fall of Myſticall <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall bee accompanied with the fall of her <hi>Beaſt;</hi> whom theſe Kings will now permit no more to tyrannize, with Papall dominion, in the Ciuill, or Eccleſiaſticall State; for as the power of the Beaſt ſtandeth by theſe Kings,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18730:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo it ſhall fall by theſe Kings. This is vnderſtood in the words of the Scripture; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. <hi>No man buyeth her ware any more of her;</hi> that is to ſay; The traffique of the <hi>Whore,</hi> and ſpirituall negotiations of her <hi>Beast</hi> (by Pardons, Diſpenſations, and other <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,</hi> as they are called) ſhall ceaſe vpon her ruine, made by theſe Princes of the earth. Whereas, then, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, the Pope ſhall ſtill continue <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome;</hi> I anſwere; <hi>not by any Souereignety, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> perhaps may pretend, that Antichriſt ſhall not permit him actually to exerciſe in that time; but wee affirme, by demonſtration of the Scripture, that the ten Kings ſhall depriue him of that power in the world, which he formerly enioyed by their conceſſion; which ſhall then expire. Notwithſtanding, if <hi>Sibylla</hi> doe truely propheſie of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it [being once <gap reason="foreign">

And, if the prophecie of <hi>Hildegardis</hi> (a ſacred Virgin, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, vpon the yeere 1150.) be of any force, <hi>the Biſhop of Rome ſhall bee reduced vnto the condition of other Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. as I haue ſeene, and read in a very faire, and ancient Manuſcript of parchment, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the predictions of that religious perſon.

ſome much adored Relikes; the Word of God was tranſlated into the vulgar tongue; and many other things were done in his time, for the reformation of blind, and ignorant ſtupiditie in the Church) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in the mayne, and eſſentiall things, which ſpecially giue the true denomination of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> he is to be exempted cleerely from the crime, and contagion of this Title.

               <p>I anſwere therefore, FIRST; that, when theſe ten Kings ſhall take vp their Armes againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> many Papiſts [of the ſecond, and worſt degree, and acception] ſhall firmely combine with the <hi>Pope</hi> [the ſecond Beaſt] and ſhall ſeeke his defence, againſt the incurſion of theſe mightie Kings: ſuch <hi>Papists,</hi> I meane, as ſpecially the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are, and the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> and all ſuch, as adore this Beaſt for his ſuppoſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, and glorie; ſo that, by the oppoſition of their owne force, and by their excitation of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, they ſhall make all poſſible (but yet a vaine) reſiſtance againſt this generall enterpriſe of theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Kings; becauſe they loue, reuerence, defend with writing, propugne with their power, and (aboue all

other <hi>Papists</hi>) maintayne, to their vttermoſt, this <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> as their deareſt Lord, and higheſt Potentate of the Earth; to whom (as they ſay) all men muſt be ſubiect, vpon the neceſſitie of their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, therefore; I inferre, that, ſince the <hi>Beast</hi> himſelfe ſhall fall with his <hi>Babylon</hi> (as being a fall not only of one particular <hi>place,</hi> but of ſome great <hi>power</hi>) theſe <hi>Papists</hi> alſo, concurring in his defence, and oppoſition of theſe Kings, ſhall certainely come vnto a finall ruine. For as theſe Kings ſhall bring the <hi>Beaſt</hi> vnto deſolation, ſo they will not ſuffer ſuch to liue, as ſhall, by doctrine, iuſtifie, and magnifie the power of this <hi>Beast</hi> (which they <hi>hate,</hi> and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy) or; by politike meanes, ſeeke his aduancement, or, by forcible contradiction, procure his ſupportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defence, againſt their inuincible armes, which, by Gods owne warrant, they ſhall take vp againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and againſt the Antichriſtian vaſſals, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the glorie, and follow the poyſon of the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>As for other <hi>Papiſts</hi> (of inferiour note, and not of this marke, or ſtampe) I will deliuer my iudgement in the third Branch; vnto which, therefore, I addreſſe my ſpeech.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18730:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And therefore we may heere, not impertinently, obſerue, that, in the points of <hi>Popery,</hi> all are not of one, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall degree; but ſuch doe ſpecially beare the marke, and cogniſance of <hi>Antichriſtianitie,</hi> as do more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduance this beaſt in his pretended authoritie ouer all Kings, and ciuill States, ouer all Churches, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons; in, and ouer the conſciences of men (in which he ſetteth vp his Dominion, to reigne therein) and finally, whereby hee doth moſt neerely

oblige, and tye men vnto him, by the glorious oſtentation of his great, and ſacred power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are other points of Poperie, not vniuſtly ſo called; as being defined by Papall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels (whoſe infallible Decrees depend vpon the Popes aſſent) as being parts of that corrupt bodie of erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrine, which is taught in his Synagogue, ſuſtayned by his authoritie, defended by his Writers, propugned by ſecular Princes (as ſeruants of the Pope; though ſtiled by more honourable names) fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, ſuch as tend to the confirmation of the Pope, and that <hi>Babylonian</hi> Church, in which <hi>the myſterie of iniquitie</hi> (beginning long agoe) hath now fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it ſelfe, in ſo great an Apoſtaſie, and defection from the truth. And if you require a ſpeciall cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of theſe Popiſh errours, they are (for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part) compriſed in the twelue Articles of the new Creed, framed, and propoſed by Pope <hi>Sixtus quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus [in Bulla, ſuper forma iuramenti profeſsionis fidei]</hi> which containe the principall errours of the <hi>Papall Beaſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> miſerably ſeduced therein from the integritie of Gods Word, and extreamely different from the Catholike ſenſe of the more pure, and ancient Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwere therefore; when God ſhall deliuer his Church from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage, which it ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnder this <hi>Babylonian Beast,</hi> that, in due proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of reaſon, if not all, yet many of theſe more groſſe, abſurd, and enormious errours (now predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſhall be corrected by the more ſound, and Chriſtian iudgement, euen of thoſe, who liue in the outward communion of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18730:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church (for there neuer wanted ſome more Religious ſpirits, that did diſlike, oppoſe, and ſeeke to redreſſe the growing, and growne errours therein) and that Chriſtian Princes ſhall willingly concurre to the reformation of Popiſh errours, when a more free, and indifferent courſe ſhall be opened for a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell (then can be yet obtained, while this <hi>Babylonian Beaſt</hi> doth reigne) to treate, diſpute, and conclude vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things, which appertaine vnto the peace, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church.</p>
               <p>To conclude this paſſage therefore, I ſhall intreat your prudent, and iudicious conſideration of three markable points, which I now tender, and preſent vnto your religious hearts.</p>
               <p>The FIRST; that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at this day) offending rather in <hi>additions</hi> vnto Gods truth (in regard whereof they fooliſhly call ours a <hi>Negatiue Religion;</hi> which doth truly deny, and iuſtly impugne their additions) then in <hi>ſubtractions</hi> from the ſame (though they erre alſo in this kind; taking lawfull authoritie from the ciuill Magiſtrate; taking halfe the Communion from the Laitie; taking away the Word of God from the people, by concealing it in an vnknowne tongue, &amp;c. and ſo in other things; againſt which, therefore, our doctrine is <hi>affirmatiue,</hi> in oppoſition of their errours) I ſay, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth hold, and teach the fundamentall points of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>poſitiuely,</hi> in the Articles of the Creed (though it haue ſome doctrines, that, by force of conſequence, may ſeeme to contradict the ſame) and that this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth well, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceiue of many great, and principall points (as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18730:125"/>
namely, of the <hi>two Natures,</hi> and <hi>one Perſon</hi> of Chriſt; as learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> himſelfe doth confeſſe; <hi>de Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and elſewhere) but it doth erre chiefly, and dangerouſly, in the <hi>Office</hi> of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, by deſtroying the merit of his Paſſion, and by falſe application thereof; not onely by the meanes of <hi>Holy water,</hi> and other <hi>Babylonian</hi> inuentions, but by ſuch meanes, as are contrarie, and repugnant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; as namely, by the paines of <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> where our Satisfaction concurreth with his, and his is <hi>applied</hi> by ours; as the Booke of <hi>Cardinall Peron,</hi> paſſing vnder the name of Maſter <hi>Henry Conſtable,</hi> doth blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly teach. Finally then; her many truths cannot iuſtifie her prodigious errours; her many errours can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not infringe her certaine truths: but the truths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in cannot ſo ſecurely ſaue, as the errours therein will greatly endanger the ſoule of any <hi>Babylonian</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, inthralled, and inſnared with the perill of <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Popiſh</hi> errours.</p>
               <p>The SECOND point, therefore, is this; that all particularities, which beare the name of <hi>Poperie,</hi> in the cenſure, and iudgement of ſome men, are not ſo in truth; but are ſo eſteemed by reaſon of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and precipitation, and for want of experience in the Monuments of venerable antiquitie; as being carried with the affection of <hi>Aëtius,</hi> who (as <hi>Socrates</hi> doth report; <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 28.) conuerſed not in the Bookes of ancient Writers, but reiected ſuch, as were of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reputation in the Church; following the ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall concluſions of his owne captious braine. Hence it is, that the intemperate <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> condemne <hi>the baptiſme of Children,</hi> as the inuention of a Pope.

Hence it is, that the peſtilent <hi>Trinitarians</hi> profanely teach, that the doctrine of the <hi>Trinitie</hi> is the fable of a Pope, and that therfore this popiſh myſterie is aptly ſignified in the triple Crowne. Hence it is, that the certaine, and indubious diſtinction of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter</hi> (the firſt hauing a paternall ſuperioritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſecond, in the adminiſtration of the Church) is, by ſome <hi>Aërian</hi> ſpirits, branded with the note of <hi>a Popiſh Hierarchy;</hi> as being ignorant in the perpetuall gouernment of the Church, or preſumptuous againſt all ages, and all ſucceſſion in the ſame. Hence it is, that the few, innocent, conuenient Ceremonies in this Church (iſſuing from the practiſe of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, learned, and holy Fathers) are ſcandalized with the contemptuous name of <hi>Popery.</hi> But by whom? By men commonly of vnlearned hearts, ſtrong paſſions, and weake iudgements; ſo that (as I obſerued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) whatſoeuer thing they diſlike, it is <hi>Popery;</hi> and, whatſoeuer perſon they diſtaſt, hee is <hi>Popiſh</hi> in their poore conceits. Much like, though not in hereticall opinion, yet in ſimple carriage, vnto the followers of <hi>Artemon,</hi> who taught that Chriſt was a pure Man, without any diuine Nature; and pretended that this true, and ancient doctrine was firſt corrupted by <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherine,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth relate <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 25. So ancient is this courſe. To end this point ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I wiſh all men, of ingenious mindes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wiſely of <hi>Popery,</hi> what is ſo to bee eſteemed; and all men of religious hearts, to deteſt it with a good conſcience, grounded vpon a ſufficient knowledge.</p>
               <p>The THIRD, and laſt point is this; that wee
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18730:126"/>
cannot probably conceiue, by any deduction of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in humane diſcourſe, that all, and ſingular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Popery</hi> (which are, indeed, erroneous, and may therefore iuſtly deſerue that name) ſhall euer be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fully purged out of the Church of God (after the ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi>) but that there will be variable, &amp; contrarie iudgements of learned men in ſome matters (truly deſeruing reformation) vntill the finall diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this preſent world; ſo that, in this caſe, wee muſt beare what we cannot amend; and rather enioy our ſolid vnitie in things of greater importance, then, vpon euery difference in things of leſſer moment, make a peruerſe diſtraction in the Church of God, and an vnhappy rent in the ſeameleſſe coate of Ieſus Chriſt, our Lord; remembring, <hi>to tolerate that for vnitie, which yet wee hate in equitie;</hi> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth diuinely ſpeake.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the <hi>Praedicate</hi> in my Text; the FALL of <hi>Babylon,</hi> diſcouered in this my ſecond Sermon. I ſhould now entertaine you with ſome obſeruations in the concluſion of this, as I did in the end of the firſt; had I not, in the perpetual courſe of this Sermon, (vpon incident paſſages) taken ſome occaſion, by the way, to make application of the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points vnto your hearts; to ſhew you the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in his ordination of this <hi>fall;</hi> his loue of his Church in his prediction of this <hi>fall;</hi> his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt ſinne, in his operation of this <hi>fall:</hi> our comfort in knowing this <hi>fall;</hi> our patience in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this <hi>fall:</hi> our inſtruction to preuent our owne <hi>fall</hi> by his Iuſtice (which will enſue vpon our <hi>fall</hi> from his Truth, and Grace) an aduertiſement to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18730:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to leaue their <hi>Locall</hi> communion with <hi>Babylon</hi> (if they dwell within her walls) or <hi>Spirituall</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they be deuoted vnto her <hi>Beast;</hi> ſince both muſt goe into perdition; and therefore, finally, here is an admonition vnto ſuch, as decline from the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth of Gods Word, vnto the darke ſuperſtition of Babylonian errours, to conſider well, and ſeriouſly in their hearts; <hi>I goe to</hi> BABYLON; <hi>which ſhall bee burnt: I ſubmit my ſelfe to that</hi> BEAST, <hi>which ſhall be deſtroyed:</hi> What feare, what ſuſpition, what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours will then poſſeſſe thy ſoule? what ſecuritie haſt thou in ſuch dangers? what comfort in ſuch frights? what happineſſe haſt thou, when thy Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thy Father-Pope therein, ſhall come to ſo great a ruine? Canſt thou be innocent, when they are guiltie? Haſt thou no ſinne, when they are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? Canſt thou ſtand, when they <hi>fall? O conſider this, yee that forget God, leſt he take you away, and there be none to deliuer you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince theſe particulars are touched more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, therefore I will conclude this Sermon (and ſo my whole Text) by ſtirring vp all degrees, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, vnto the performance of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; that, what we yet heare in <hi>Verbo,</hi> prophecied in Gods Word <hi>[It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon, &amp;c.]</hi> wee may once ſee in <hi>Opere;</hi> fulfilled alſo in Worke.</p>
               <p>FIRST, then, I begin with them, who are the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar inſtruments of Gods Iuſtice in this behalfe; the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> as the Scripture it ſelfe doth ſpeake. O No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Heroicall Princes, Gods Vice-gerents (ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his power, and ſacred with his owne name)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18730:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you haue the ſpeciall place in this warfare; God hath preſt you vnto this ſeruice, and not onely warranted, but required you vnto it. You are ſent againſt <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>Amalek</hi>) to deſtroy it with fire, and ſword. It is no voyage vnto the <hi>holy Land</hi> (where Chriſt did ſuffer for our ſinnes) but to <hi>impure Babylon;</hi> in which as it may be truly ſaid alſo, that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did die, in ſundry reſpects (but then ſhee was in her <hi>Ethnicall</hi> ſtate) ſo, in it, Chriſt doth ſtill ſuffer, in regard of his Truth, there oppreſſed; in regard of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, there aduanced; in regard of the Faithfull, by him perſecuted; for it is done vſually through the operation of this <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> abuſing the authoritie of Kings, and Princes, to this wicked purpoſe. There hee ſitteth, that trampleth vpon your Crownes, and Scepters; there hee ſitteth, that depoſeth you from your States; there hee ſitteth, that abſolueth your ſubiects from the two indiſſoluble bonds, of <hi>Oath,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> there he ſitteth, that diſpoſeth your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, at his pleaſure, that exciteth your owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt you (by the curſes of his Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſtirreth vp your friends, and neighbours) to make warre vpon your hereditary lands. Now the time is come [it is paſt with God] it is now at hand, that you may, you muſt, you ſhall take vp a temporall againſt his ſpirituall Sword; diueſt him of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded power, expoſe him vnto ſcandall, ignominy, ruine, extreame deſolation; <hi>reward her</hi> [or <hi>him;</hi> it is all one in effect; the one doth imply the other] <hi>euen as ſhee hath rewarded you, and giue her double, according to her workes; and, in the cup, that ſhe hath filled to you, fill her the double;</hi> as it is: <hi>Apocal.</hi> 19.6.</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:18730:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now if you require of me the names of theſe ten Kings (I meane not the names of their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> but of their <hi>States</hi>) I cannot, I dare not deale ſo punctually in this caſe, as ſome, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, by particular commemoration of their ten Kingdomes, to muſter vp the names of theſe ten Kings, that ſhall effectuate this great, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious worke. It may bee a queſtion (and ſo it is with mee) whether this number of <hi>ten</hi> may bee taken in that diſtinct, and preciſe accompt; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a certaine, for an vncertaine number, as the Scripture doth vſually ſpeake; or rather, whether, in theſe numbers of ſpeciall perfection (the <hi>Septenary,</hi> the <hi>Decenary,</hi> the <hi>Centenary,</hi> the <hi>Millenary</hi>) a whole, and vniuerſall companie is to be vnderſtood, or not. And I doe the rather ſo conceiue it to be vnderſtood, becauſe Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> himſelfe hath framed this opinion in my breaſt.

Prouinces for the glory of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to ſubdue the Perſian Monarch; it is no ſuch politicke attempt for humane ends; but it is the worke of heauen, and earth, conſpiring in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, who inſlaueth you with her tyrranny, poyſoneth you with her hereſie, defileth Gods name with blaſphemy, conculcateth all royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with her pride, murdereth Gods Saints with her crueltie; worke therefore her ruine, that ſeeketh yours.</p>
               <p>FOVRTHLY; I ſpeake vnto you, who are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of an inferiour degree; I doubt not, but (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of your Chriſtian pietie, and zeale) I may ſay of you, as <hi>Deborah</hi> of her magnanimous people, <hi>Praiſe the Lord, for the auenging of Iſrael, and for the people, that offered themſelues willingly.

And you, that are preſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this warre, by your rightfull Princes, ſhall not be troubled with that ſcruple (which ſo much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Schooles) how farre, in what cauſes, with what limitations, a Souldier may fight, vpon the commandement of his Prince (ſince the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vndertaking warre is in the King; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of executing it is in the Subiects; as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> writeth; <hi>contra Faustum l.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 75.) for you ſee, that the proclamation, and ordination of this warre is from the vnqueſtionable authoritie of God himſelfe; and therfore as you ſhall ſerue your

Souereignes, ſo they ſhall ſerue God therein. This warre, therefore, is honourable, religious, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to be preferred before a baſe, cowardly, and profane peace. If <hi>Iehoram</hi> ſpeake of peace, yet <hi>Iehu</hi> will heare of none, becauſe hee is the miniſter of Gods Iuſtice. <hi>Pax ab illis, non cum illis,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of wicked perſons; ſo I ſay here; haue peace <hi>from Babylon,</hi> in not medling with her ſocietie; you can haue no peace <hi>with</hi> her, in treating with her vpon ſweet, and amicable termes.</p>
               <p>FIFTHLY, and laſtly; I end with that, which is the beginning of euery ſucceſſefull enterpriſe; <hi>Prayer.</hi> Souereignes muſt pray with <hi>Moſes,</hi> while their Subiects fight with <hi>Amalek. Constantine</hi> the Great attributed his victories vnto the force of prayer; and therefore hee had a Tabernacle in his Campe, framed according to the modell of a Church. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> conquered a puiſſant enemy (<hi>Maximus,</hi> in name, and power) by the preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vertue of prayer. Let prayer alſo arme the Souldiers of this warre; it is more defenſiue, then any Shield, and more offenſiue, then any Sword. And you, that go not forth with them in perſon, to fight againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet fight alſo by your praiers, for their ſafetie, and ſucceſſe. Hee, that hath not an hand able to fight, nor a tongue learned to preach, may yet haue an heart well affected to pray. Pray then, pray all, for the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the ruine of <hi>Babylon;</hi> cry with one voyce, and cry ſtill, <hi>cadat, cadat,</hi> [let it fall] till wee heare, actually, <hi>cecidit, cecidit,</hi> it is fallen.</p>
               <p>And though God doth more reſpect, herein, the

goodneſſe of the cauſe, then of our perſons, in the iſſue of this warre, yet let vs be armed with pietie, vertue, grace; that we may be more fit, and proper inſtruments for his purpoſe; according to Gods owne precept; <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9. <hi>When thou goeſt out with the hoaſt againſt thine enemies, keepe thee then from all wickedneſſe.</hi> So ſhall our warres proſper abroad, &amp; peace continue at home, with the aduancement of Gods truth, both there, and heere; which the Lord of all mercies conſerue vnto vs, and vnto our poſteritie after vs, euen till the glorious appearance of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; <hi>Amen.</hi>
