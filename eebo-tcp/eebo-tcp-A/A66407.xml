            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="4">(4.) I am to consider, why God did thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually and <hi>at sundry times</hi> proceed in revealing his Will to Mankind; and why he did not at the first communicate his Will to them as fully and perfectly, as he did in <hi>the last daies by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then I am to conclude with the last Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. General; Where I am to shew the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Gospel Revelation, and that there is not to be any other Revelation till the end of the World.</p>
            <p>I have here a large Field before me; and many difficult Points to treat of; but because this is the Concluding Lecture of the Year, I shall sum it up, and pass through the Particulars with as much brevity as the time will allow; and with as much attention as I can; though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95631:4"/>
I must fall short of what the Subject and Nature of the things to be spoken of doth deserve, and might otherwise, be treated of.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) I am now come to the Third Branch, and to consider the several Periods, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal before the Law, the <hi>Mosaical</hi> under the Law, and the Evangelical under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The Patriarchal State, is that which extended from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Deliverance of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the giving the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which included in it the space of Two thousand five hundred Years, and upward.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mosaical</hi> or Legal State, was that which extended from the delivery of the Law at <hi>Sinai,</hi> to the preaching of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> with whom ended the <hi>time past,</hi> and the <hi>last daies</hi> began; which included in it the space of One thousand four hundred Years, and upward.</p>
            <p>The Evangelical State, is that which began with <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> and is to continue to the Worlds end.</p>
            <p>In the consideration of these three States, we may observe, That there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and a gradual ascent from the less perfect to the greater; so that the <hi>Mosaical</hi> is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the Patriarchal, and the Evangelical to the <hi>Mosaical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95631:5"/>
When I speak of the Patriarchal, I intend to give it all the advantage, by looking upon it as a State of Revelation, and not a bare State of Nature; for I have before proved, that there was a Revelation from the beginning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived down by a constant Pedigree and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, more or less. But what it was, we must in great part rather conjecture, than can certainly know; especially as to the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> State. For the Flood having swept away the whole Stock of the ungodly <hi>Cainites,</hi> it was the design of Providence that their <hi>Memorial should perish with them</hi>: And so the Divine Penman contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that State, and gives us only a Breviat of what passed before the Flood.</p>
            <p>We have there the History of the Creation, Fall, and Recovery of Man; and may observe how seasonably Almighty God interposed for his Comfort and Relief, by the promise of <hi>the Seed of the Woman.</hi> We may observe further, how for the maintaining of his Authority, and the manifestation of his Justice and Holiness, and to imprint on the minds of Men a dread of offending for the future, and to keep up an expectation of the Son of God's appearing and becoming a Sacrifice in our Nature, God esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished from the very first a course of Sacrifices;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95631:5"/>
by the means of which Atonement Sinners might have a right Notion of Almighty God: when his Justice and Mercy were thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled; that they might not be encouraged to presume on one hand, nor be thrown into despair on the other.</p>
            <p>We may observe farther, how God provided for the preservation of Religion, and especially Revelation, by the Longaevity of the Patriarchs, and a Race of Holy Men, who were Prophets and Testifiers of his Will; of whom there was a constant Succession; that by a long Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Father and Son, Progenitors and Successors, what was wanting in Records and Memorials, might be supplied.</p>
            <p>We may observe farther, how ineffectual this course proved in the Issue, how degenerate Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind grew, so inflexible and incorrigible, that to purge out this pest of Impiety that had infected the whole Race, God took up a resolution of discharging the World of that impious Stock, and to raise up a new Seed from the Righteous <hi>Noah</hi>; and that issued in the Flood.</p>
            <p>This is the short History of the first Sixteen hundred fifty six years of the World, the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95631:6"/>
The Revelation, so far as it is handed down to us in <hi>Moses,</hi> was then obscure; But a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they had, and Prophets, and those of the higher Form: Insomuch, that some of the <hi>Jews</hi> hold, that <hi>Enoch,</hi> in particular, was endued with a higher degree of Prophecy than <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever it was, the sum amounted to this, That God was reconciled to man after his Apostacy; that he had established an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that in process of time the Son of God should in our Nature actually appear, and become a Saviour to us, and be a Propitiation for our Sins.</p>
            <p>But there is a farther branch of this Patriarchal State, which is the Post-Diluvian, after the Deluge.</p>
            <p>Here we are in part in the dark as before; for there were no less than Three hundred sixty seven years, at the least, past (for so long it was from the Flood to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s departure out of <hi>Haran</hi>) of which the Inspired Historian gives little account. All that we have, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and their dispersion, and the division of Tongues upon the foolish attempt at <hi>Babel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95631:6"/>
The reason of this seems to be much the same as before the Flood; and that was the general depravation of Mankind, of which the said at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at <hi>Babel</hi> was an Instance; and the Call of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the Land of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> an Evidence.</p>
            <p>For the reason of that Call of his, was the Idolatry then growing upon the World; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of which, it seems, the Family of <hi>Sem</hi> had not altogether escaped: For this the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of <hi>Abraham</hi> are charged with, <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.2, 14. And then it was in him that pure Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lift up its head again; and for that reason that he might become an eminent Instrument for preserving and promoting it, God revealed himself to that Holy Patriarch.</p>
            <p>And this is the Third Branch of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Period, which I may call the <hi>Abraamical</hi> State.</p>
            <p>The first Revelation of this was (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was, that it should be <hi>the Seed of the woman,</hi> (whom the Serpent had seduced, and thought to have brought his ends about by). The next opening of this great secret of Divine Wisdom was, that this Seed, or <hi>Messias,</hi> should descend from the Stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. <hi>In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed,</hi> Gen. 12.3.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95631:7"/>
which the Apostle applies to Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and to which <hi>Abraham</hi> had a respect in the Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> when he gave him that Name, which signifies laughter, or rejoycing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.3. Thus our Saviour interprets it in that allusion, <hi>Your father Abraham rejoyced to see my day, and was glad,</hi> John 8.56.</p>
            <p>This was the reason why <hi>Moses</hi> did so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully draw down the Pedigree of <hi>Sem,</hi> which terminated in <hi>Abraham</hi>; passing slightly by the History of his Progenitors, and taking up that of this Patriarch, in whom the Holy Seed did more illustriously appear: And why also he so punctually set down the time when this promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> was first made,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.18. 22.18.</note> and which as the principal of all, God did several times repeat to him,<note place="margin">Gen. 26.4. 28.14.</note> and also to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> at the first time he is said to have appeared to them.</p>
            <p>So that though they had a standing Oracle,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.22, 23.</note> and had other Revelations, yet this of the holy Seed was the chief Revelation, and which was upon all solemn occasions renewed.</p>
            <p>But though Revelation did eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the good of the world, where it was promulged and received, and afforded a much brighter and more certain light than Nature and Reason of it self did; yet even here Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95631:7"/>
made, as it were, a pause, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal State gave way to another which we call,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Mosaical,</hi> which had a manifold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the other.</p>
            <p>As</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That Religion here was National, and the People were entire and embodied into one Society; whereas it was otherwise among the Patriarchs, as in the case of <hi>Terah</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia; Melchisedec,</hi> and even <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Canaan</hi>; and <hi>Job</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi>; where Religion and the Church was rather Domestical than National.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The State of the <hi>Jews</hi> was a Theocracy, and the whole of it, whether as to matters Civil or Divine, was established by God's peculiar appointment, and under whose immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment they were; having his Minister <hi>Moses</hi> their Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. and God making them his peculiar and propriety, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.33. 14.2.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It was a typical State, under which one of greater excellency, and thereafter in process of time to succeed, was adumbrated, I mean, the Evangelical: So that their Rites, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly their Sacrifices under that Dispensation, had a peculiar respect to the great Sacrifice, <hi>the lamb</hi> said to be <hi>slain</hi> (in God's Decree, and in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95631:8"/>
the vertue of it) <hi>from the foundation of the world</hi>: And which those Rites and Sacrifices were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the farther ratification, and for the preservation of in their minds.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) I may add, there was an improvement made upon this Legal and Typical State, by the Prophetical; which was enobled by the many illustrious Prophecies, more especially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Messiah, as to the time of his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his Birth, and the Place of it, his Family, Sufferings, Miracles, Resurrection, Ascension, in abundance of circumstances relating thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And when in the declension of the <hi>Jewish</hi> State, Prophecy might be expected should decay with it, it on the contrary increas'd, till on the sudden it wholly ceas'd, when the Revelation of that kind, and for that season, was sufficient: For what could have been more punctual than what was already Revealed?</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) After this there was a long interval of above Four hundred years, and a cessation of that Prophecy and extraordinary Revelation which had continued in that Church for the space of above a Thousand years, from the time of <hi>Moses</hi> to that of <hi>Zechary</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi>; at the close of which it had been foretold, that by the coming of the Messiah, Prophecy and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95631:8"/>
should revive, and a more plentiful effusion of the Holy Spirit should then be, than had been ever before. Now what should be the reason of this, but that there might be raised in that People the more earnest desire after the approaching of that happy Age; and that they might thereby be convinced that their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution was not to continue for ever, and that there was a more perfect Dispensation which they were to expect, and which was to rise, as it were, out of the ashes of the other.</p>
            <p>And that is</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Evangelical State, which is the close and completion of all; in which the Rites of the Law were completed, the Types answered by the Anti-Types, and the Prophecies were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and interpreted by the Event. So that the New Testament is the evidence and proof of the Old; the one declaring what is to come, and the other shewing that it is come; both bearing an exact correspondence to each other.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the Fourth Branch of the Third General; where</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am to consider why God did thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually and <hi>at sundry times</hi> proceed in Revealing his Will to Mankind, and why he did not at the first communicate his Will to them as fully
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95631:9"/>
and perfectly, as he did <hi>in the last days by his Son?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that there are Two Questions to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Why God did not communicate his Will <hi>at first?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Why in <hi>these last days?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> (1.) As to the former; it may as well be asked, Why God did ever promise? And why he did not actually give at the same time when he promised?</p>
            <p>It may again be as well asked, Why there was such a thing as Prophecy, and that the things Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of were not at the same instant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, as they were predicted?</p>
            <p>And if that be the question; it may again as well be asked, Why there is such a thing as Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession? Why there are Causes and Effects? And why all things are not Existent at once? And why all Acts are not done together? For Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Prophecies imply Succession; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire there should be no Promises and no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, is, in effect, to require there should be no Succession.</p>
            <p>(2.) A Promise on God's part, implies the certainty of the thing in its season, as well as a Prophecy. A Prophecy is certain because of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95631:9"/>
God's infinite Power, Wisdom, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to foresee what will be the effect of such Causes, what the events of such Actions, or how he will order and accomplish them: And a Promise implies besides that, his Faithfulness, and that he will infallibly see to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. And so whatever is Promised or Prophecied of by Almighty God, is as certain in its Causes, and shall be in the Event, as if it was now in being or now done, or that we had it in actual possession.</p>
            <p>(3.) It is as much, if not more, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Almighty God, that there should be a Succession of Beings, Actions, and Events, as if they were all Existent at once; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as much to order such Beings, Actions, and Events in Succession, as it is if they were present.</p>
            <p>(4.) As there are in Nature a First and a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and so on in progression; and all things appearing in their proper time, order, and course, till by degrees 'tis raised to its highest Perfection: So it is as accountable for God to make known his Will to Mankind, to begin and carry it on, from a lesser to a higher degree, as he sees fit; and upon a strict examination has as much Beauty and Order in it. And to have all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95631:10"/>
Revelation at once, would appear as irregular as for all Mankind to have lived and died all at once.</p>
            <p>(5.) Especially is this, where such Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are suited to the state of the World, and that the Dispensation of one Age would not suit the Temper and Circumstances of another; of which we have an instance in the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were of that Temper, that a burdensome and Ritual Religion was more fit for them than another more Refined and Spiritual, and whose External and Gorgeous Form was accommodated accordingly to it, <hi>as under age,</hi> Gal. 4.1. And therefore it is wisely observed by <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heret. Fab. l. 5. c. 11.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>That God suited his Instructions to every Age of the World.</hi> And we have good reason to believe this to be so, because there was such a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in Divine Revelation, as has been already shewn.</p>
            <p>(6.) This is still the more accountable, if we consider that the Obligation of Mankind arises from the Notification of the Divine Will; and that according as the Revelation of it is, so is the Obligation. And therefore those that have no Revelation, are not upon the same strict terms with those that have; nor are those that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95631:10"/>
live under the lower Dispensation, upon the same terms with those that have the higher: So the Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10.34.</note> 
               <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but every one that feareth God, and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this in part belongs to the next Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. From hence we may be able in part to resolve the other branch of the Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Why God did not at the first send his Son to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Will to the world, as he did <hi>in the last days?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celsus,</hi> a great Adversary to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, from the consideration of Christ's coming so late into the world for the Redemption of Mankind, compares God to <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Origen. contr. Cels. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>as waking out of a long sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this may as well be objected against any special act of Divine Providence; and were there no other answer to be given, this were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. But as there were many Prophecies concerning this state of things to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by the coming of Messiah, so we shall find sufficient reason for the Justification of Divine Providence in laying this Scene so remote from the first Ages of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95631:11"/>
For</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this means we see what a wonderful Concatenation there is in the Divine Operations, and how in an orderly course all Events succeed according to his determinate Will, and what he has foretold. For there is a History, as it were, of our Saviour before his Appearance; and by the Description and Characters given of him in Scripture for Four thousand years together, we may be able to prove, that he is the Messiah.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not seem that the world was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it before. For if Christ had been Born and Died as soon as <hi>Adam</hi> had Sinned, there would not have been among Mankind the sense of their Condition, and of the need they stood in of a Redeemer, and of the Goodness of God in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding one for them; nor of the Necessity of the Divine Power to rescue them, if they had not had a long experience of the ineffectualness of any other course or means for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are to consider, that the benefit of Christ's Death, looked backward as well as forward, and took place from the first publication of the Promise.</p>
            <p>For</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Immediately after the Fall, God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, That <hi>the seed of the woman</hi> should <hi>bruise</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95631:11"/>
the Serpent's head; and this being a Promise made to <hi>Adam,</hi> he himself must consequently have the benefit of it: For what advantage or comfort could it have been to him, that Four thousand years after there should be a Descendent from him that should become a Saviour to them that were at that time in being, and that should then and afterward believe on him?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We are to consider, that this Promise gave <hi>Adam</hi> as much a title to the benefit of such an atonement, and was to him as stable a ground of comfort, as if it had at the same time been actually executed; or as it could be to any that lived in or after the time that this atonement was offered, and the promise in all respects punctually made good.</p>
            <p>Hence we read in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>the grace that was in Christ Jesus before the world began,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, of ancient times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour</hi>; and that not in decree only, but in fact; so the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle uses the phrase, <hi>the hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, promised,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began</hi>; it's a promise made in time, and which he there distinguishes from the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of it. So the <hi>Gospel was preached before to Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.8. and who in the Faith of it, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95631:12"/>
and was glad,</hi> John 8.56. This is implied <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world</hi>; which implies that all sin, since the foundation of the world, was forgiven with respect to that Atonement. So that when there was a promise of such a means for our Reconciliation to God, and in the vertue of which the Penitent might plead for pardon, it was equally as advantageous to them that believed <hi>in him that was to come,</hi> from the first publication of that Promise, as if they had then had a plenary possession: So that Christ might be well said to be <hi>the lamb slain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I may say, in all appearance there was not a more proper time for the coming of our Saviour into the world, and for all the Events depending upon it, than that in which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>And that if we consider,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The general expectation of it, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to ancient Prophecies. This was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious among the <hi>Jews</hi>: So <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11. <hi>They thought the kingdom of God should immediately appear</hi>; that is, the Kingdom of the Messiah.</p>
            <p>So we find <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and others, <hi>waited for the consolation of Israel,</hi> Luke 2.25, 38.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95631:12"/>
of which number was <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> Mark 15.43.</p>
            <p>Nay, this or something like it, was got among the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: So <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist. l. 5. c. 2. Â§. 8.</note> the <hi>Roman</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, <hi>Many were perswaded, that it was contained in the ancient Writings of the Priests, that at that time it should come to pass, That the</hi> East <hi>should prevail, and that They should proceed from</hi> Judaea <hi>who should be Lords of all; which was a Prophecy of</hi> Vespatian <hi>and</hi> Titus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suetonius</hi> another Historian, saith, <hi>That it was an old and constant Opinion that had prevailed all over the</hi> East: <hi>This the Event,</hi> said he, <hi>shewed to be meant of the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperor; but the</hi> Jews <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to themselves, Rebelled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is agreeable to what is said by <hi>Josephus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joseph. de Bell. 7. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, some doubtful Prophecy in the Sacred Writings, that at that very time there should arise from that Countrey one of themselves that should Govern the whole World.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It was a proper time, because as the world had all along the experience of the inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all human means for reforming the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Tempers of Men, so in that age more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95631:13"/>
especially, when the Wisdom of the world was in its height both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When among the <hi>Jews</hi> they were at that time as averse to Idolatry, as ever their Ancestors had been inclined to it, and were in all the punctilio's of the Law as exact and scrupulous, as they were skilled in the Letter of it; and yet our Saviour found matter enough to condemn and chastise them for, and their practice was a fit Comment on that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh.</hi> So St. <hi>Hierom</hi> Comments upon it, <hi>Now the time was fulfilled, when through evil custom no man could keep the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we turn our selves to the Heathens, Learning is acknowledged to have flourished in the time of <hi>Augustus</hi> beyond any Age; and yet that Age seemed to equal it self in Vice, not only as the Apostle describes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. but as it is confirmed by their own Historians: So St. <hi>Augustin</hi> describes it,<note place="margin">De civ. dei l. 2. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>I am not the first that report it, but their own Authors; behold, before the coming of Christ, and after the destruction of</hi> Carthage, <hi>the manners of their Ancestors were neglected, not as before by little and little, but like a torrent by a strange precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; so much was the truth corrupted by luxury and avarice.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95631:13"/>
Now when the world was thus corrupted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the best human means, What could be a fitter season for our Saviour's Appearance? And therefore the Fathers, as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> triumph'd over the Philosophers, and despis'd their artificial methods of Vertue, as too weak for so great and noble an undertaking.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was a fit season, as way was made for the propagation of the Gospel by the dispersion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the success of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Arms.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By the dispersion of the <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> For as their Law did serve to introduce the Gospel, to which it had a Relation, and of which it was a proof; so by their dispersion upon the Captivity (whence many of them never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned) and by other subsequent means, many of the prejudices which other Nations had against the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion and Nation, were taken off.</p>
            <p>And this was much furthered by the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Old Testament into <hi>Greek</hi> (which was then the General Language). From whence I am apt to think, that the Opinion mentioned by the abovesaid <hi>Roman</hi> Historians, did arise. <hi>It was,</hi> saith <hi>Tacitus,</hi>

            <p>But God doth in the most extraordinary cases, use sometimes ordinary means; and especially was this observable, that at that very time of our Saviour's Birth, the Gates of the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> were shut, which were only in the time of an universal Peace; and which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened but twice from the foundation of that City, till the Reign of <hi>Augustus</hi> (though twice before this in his Reign, as I remember).</p>
            <p>And this was a very fit season for the <hi>Prince of peace</hi> to appear in, and what in this sence did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the Angels Anthem at his Birth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. <hi>On
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95631:15"/>
earth peace, good will</hi> amongst, as well as <hi>towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I am brought to the Evangelical State; where I am,</p>
            <p>4th General, To shew the Perfection of the Gospel Revelation, and that there is not to be any other Revelation to the end of the world; so it is here, <hi>hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son</hi>; which implies,
<list>
                  <item>1. The close and conclusion of all, it is <hi>in the last days.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Perfection of the Gospel Revelation, it is <hi>by his Son.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The close of all, it is <hi>in the last days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which all former Ages had a relation, and in which, being <hi>the last,</hi> they were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated.</p>
            <p>Here, setting aside all subdivisions of time; we may consider the world, as to Revelation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a twofold Period, <hi>viz.</hi> the Former and, the Latter days.</p>
            <p>And so<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 2.2.</note> the Prophets speak of <hi>the last days,</hi> as different from what both were before,<note place="margin">Mic. 4.1.</note> or what were in their own time.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>in these last days,</hi> there is a certain part of time circumscribed, which in reason is to have such characters belonging to it as it may be known
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95631:15"/>
by them when it was to commence, without which the <hi>Epocha</hi> was not to be determined. So that the first thing to be considered is, When these <hi>last days</hi> began, and what are the Characters by which that time is to be known?</p>
            <p>And they are such as these.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The appearance of a Person, that from his spirit and temper, the Scripture calls <hi>Elijah, Mal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>and</hi> 4.5. who was to be the Forerunner of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to <hi>prepare the way</hi> for his reception.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Restauration of the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which ceased among the <hi>Jews</hi> from the time of <hi>Zechary</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> (as has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) and was to be restored in <hi>the last days. Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Many Impostors which were to appear; and who did not appear till about the time of the <hi>last days,</hi> according to our computation of them; so 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. <hi>It is the last time; and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</hi> V. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.5, 24.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>The last days</hi> were, when the Messiah him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did appear, <hi>called the fulness of time,</hi> Gal. 4.4. and so it is express in the Text, <hi>hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.</hi> To which we may add the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles, Isa.</hi> 2.2. <hi>and</hi> 63.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95631:16"/>
From whence it is evident, that there is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for these two Periods, <hi>viz.</hi> the Former and the Latter days; and that the Latter began with our Saviour, and continue to the end of the world, whensoever that shall happen: And therefore as it is called <hi>the fulness of time,</hi> because it is the completion and consummation of all; so it is called <hi>the close of the Ages,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>. Heb. 9.26.</note> (we translate it <hi>the end of the world</hi>) or <hi>the last days,</hi> because there were none to come after the expiration of this; and comprehends in it (as aforesaid) all the space of time from Christ's first, to his second Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>And so there can be no other time, and so no other Revelation; for as long as the <hi>last days</hi> hold, so long the present Revelation is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; and then there can no more be any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, than there can be <hi>last days</hi> beyond the last.</p>
            <p>And this will be confirmed by the next Branch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Perfection of the Gospel Revelation, included in that phrase, God in these last days hath spoken to us <hi>by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis but reasonable to suppose, that since there has been a gradual Progression in Revelation from time to time, and from a lower to a higher degree (as has been already proved) that the honour of all in the close should be reserved for the Son of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95631:16"/>
God; to whom the Prophets were Harbingers, and the Angels themselves Ministers. This is the foundation of the Apostle's Argument, and the drift of his Discourse, in this Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Text, <hi>God who at sundry timesâ€”hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all thingsâ€”being made so much better than the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they: for unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>Now as the Son is the last that appears, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his there cannot be supposed to be any other Revelation, but that the Revelation must be like to himself, Perfect and Compleat; and so there can be no other Gospel; and whosoever pretends to another, falls under the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>If any preach any other gospel than ye have received, let him be accursed.</hi> For here it is;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we find the great Prophecies ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the Messiah; whose Characters, though many, all center in our Saviour, as to Person, Time, Place, Qualifications, and Event.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Him are all the Types fulfilled, and all the <hi>good things</hi> accomplished, which the Rites of the Law were the <hi>shadow of,</hi> Heb. 10.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Him is the most Perfect Revelation of the Will of God made known to the world, of all that God has promis'd and we may expect.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95631:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
4. By Him have we the most Perfect Rule, the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Motives, most Noble Principles, and Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and all things that conduce to the Perfection and Happiness of Mankind.</p>
            <p>So that to any one that reads and compares those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dispensations before spoken of together, as he must acknowledge there is this Gradation, so that the Christian Institution is for the Matter and the Evidence of it supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all; and it will be as evident, that it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by none.</p>
            <p>For it is as perfect as can or need to be; for we cannot ascend higher in our Notions and Conceptions of things than we are there taught. We cannot exceed its Rules in our Practice, nor be defective in any necessary part of our Duty, if we advise with and observe it. Nor can we desire more excellent Encouragements and Rewards than are therein proposed, such as are Eternal. So that though the <hi>Law of Nature, or of Moses made nothing perfect, yet the bringing in of a better hope</hi> by the Gospel did. Heb. 7.19.</p>
            <p>And now we have nothing farther to expect, no more another Revelation than another Messiah; no more than another God to reward us, and another Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us with.</p>
            <p>And with this I am to conclude, having passed, by God's Assistance, through the several Heads I at first proposed in the beginning of this Lecture. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the most Noble Subject in Religion; what has been wanting in the Management of it, is to be ascribed to the Weakness and Imperfection of the Instrument: But if there has been any thing offer'd, which may tend to the farther Proof and Confirmation, the Illustration and Improvement of it; it is to be ascribed to God, who is <hi>the giver of every good gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From him must we wait for the Blessing and Success, and <hi>To Him be all Honour and Glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
