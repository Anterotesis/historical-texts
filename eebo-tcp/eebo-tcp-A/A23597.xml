            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ENGLAND'S Great Intereſt IN THE CHOICE OF THIS New Parliament; Dedicated to all her FREE-HOLDERS and ELECTORS.</head>
            <p>SInce it hath pleaſed <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to begin to revive and reſtore to us our Ancient Right of <hi>Frequent Parliaments,</hi> it will greatly concern us, as to our preſent Intereſt, and therein the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs of our Poſterity, to act at this time with all the <hi>Wiſdom, Caution</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> we can. For beſides, that 'tis our own Buſineſs, and that if by a neglect of this ſingular Opportunity we deſert our ſelves, and forſake our own Mercies, we muſt expect to be <hi>Left of God and good Men too</hi>; It may be there has never happened, not only in the memory of the living, but in the Records of the dead, <hi>ſo odd and ſo ſtrange a Conjuncture as this we are under</hi>: It is made up of ſo many unuſual and important Circumſtances (all affecting us to the very Heart) that whether we regard the long ſitting of the late <hi>Parliament,</hi> or its abrupt and moſt unexpected <hi>Diſſolution,</hi> or the <hi>Prorogation</hi> of the laſt and its ſurpriſing <hi>Diſſolution,</hi> or the ſtrong Jealouſies of the People, and that univerſal agitation, that is now upon the ſpirit of the Nation, and the Reaſons and Motives thereof (ſo far as we can reach them) <hi>there ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have been a time, wherein this Kingdom ought to ſhow it ſelf more ſerious and diligent in the buſineſs of its own ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be plain with you, <hi>All is at Stake:</hi> and therefore I muſt tell you, That the Work of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To purſue the Diſcovery and Puniſhment of the <hi>Plot:</hi> for that has been the old <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> the <hi>Trojan Horſe</hi> with an Army in the Belly of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To remove and bring to Juſtice thoſe Evil Counſellors, and Corrupt and <hi>Arbitrary Miniſters</hi> of State, that have been ſo Induſtrious to give the King Wrong Meaſures, to turn Things out of their Antient and Legal Channel of Adminiſtration, and Alienate his Affections from his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To Detect and Puniſh the <hi>Penſioners</hi> of the former <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the Face of the Kingdom. This Breach of Truſt being Treaſon againſt the Fundamental conſtitution of our Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To ſecure to us the Execution of our <hi>Antient Laws</hi> by New ones, and among the reſt ſuch, as relate to <hi>Frequent Parliaments,</hi> the only true Check upon <hi>Arbitrary Miniſters,</hi> and therefore feared, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ated and oppoſed by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That we be ſecur'd from <hi>Popery</hi> and Slavery; and that <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters</hi> be eaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That in caſe this be done, the King be releaſed from his burdenſom <hi>Debts</hi> to the Nation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38338:2"/>
and eas'd in the buſineſs of his Revenue. And let me be free with you, if you intend to ſave poor <hi>England,</hi> You muſt take this General Meaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> To guide and fix your Choice upon Men, that you have reaſon to believe are <hi>Well Affected, Able</hi> and <hi>Bold</hi> to ſerve the Country in theſe Reſpects.</p>
            <p>The Words of the <hi>Writ</hi> (at leaſt, the <hi>Import</hi> of them) are, <hi>To chuſe Wiſe Men, fearing God, and hating Covetouſneſs</hi>; and what to do? ſays the ſame <hi>Writ, To Advice the King of the Weighty Matters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Let us not then play the Fools or Knaves, to Neglect or Betray the <hi>Common Intereſt</hi> of our Country by a <hi>Baſe Election</hi>: Let neither Fear, Flattery nor Gain Byaſs us. We muſt not make our Publick <hi>Choice</hi> the Recompence of <hi>Private Favours</hi> from our Neighbours; they muſt excuſe us for that: the Weight of the Matter will very well bear it. This is our Inheritance; all depends upon it: Men don't uſe to lend their Wives, or give their Children to ſatisfie <hi>Perſonal Kindneſſes</hi>; nor muſt we make a <hi>Swop</hi> of our <hi>Birth-right,</hi> (and that of our Poſterities too) for a Meſs of Pottage, a <hi>Feaſt</hi> or a <hi>Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi>; there can be no Proportion here: and therefore none muſt take it Ill, that we uſe our Freedom about that, which in its Conſtitution is the Great Bull-wark of all our <hi>Antient Engliſh Liberties.</hi> Truly, our not Conſidering what it is to chuſe a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and how much all is upon the Hazard in it, may at laſt <hi>Looſe us fatally</hi> by our own Choice. For I muſt needs tell you, If we Miſcarry, it will be our own <hi>Fault</hi>; we have no Body elſe to blame: For ſuch is the Happineſs of our Conſtitution, That we cannot well be deſtroy'd, but by our ſelves: and what Man in his Wits would Sacrifice his Throat to his own hands?</p>
            <p>We, the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are a great part of the Fundamental Government of it; and <hi>Three Rights</hi> are ſo peculiar and inherent to us, that if we will not throw them away for <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Favour,</hi> for <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> or thoſe other little preſent profits, that <hi>Ill Men</hi> offer to tempt us with, they cannot be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or abrogated. And this I was willing to give you a brief hint of, that you may know, <hi>what Sort of Creatures you are, and what your Power is,</hi> leſt through Ignorance of your own Strength and Authority, you turn Slaves to the Humors of thoſe, that properly and truly are but your <hi>Servants,</hi> and ought to be uſed ſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe three Fundamentals is <hi>Property,</hi> that is, <hi>Right and Title to your own Lives, Liberties and Eſtates:</hi> in this every man is a ſort of little <hi>Soveraign</hi> to himſelf: No man has power over his <hi>Perſon</hi> to Impriſon of Hurt it, or over his <hi>Eſtate</hi> to Invade or Uſurp it: only your own Tranſgreſſion of the Laws, (and thoſe of your own making too) lays you open to Loſs; <hi>which is but the Puniſhment due for your Offences,</hi> and this but in Proportion to the Fault committed. So that the Power of <hi>England</hi> is a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> Power, which truly merits the Name of <hi>Government:</hi> that which is not Legal,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>We ſee it daily in</hi> Weſtminſter-<hi>Hall, as well as in Parliamentary Tranſactions.</hi>
               </note> is a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and not properly a <hi>Government.</hi> Now the Law is Umpire between King, Lords and Commons, and the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> is <hi>One in kind through all Degrees and Qualities in the Kingdom,</hi> Mark that.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Fundamental, that is your <hi>Birth-right</hi> and <hi>Inheritance,</hi> is <hi>Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> or the Power of making Laws; <hi>No Law can be made or abrogated in</hi> England <hi>without you.</hi> Before <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third's</hi> Time, your <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> the <hi>Free-men</hi> of <hi>England</hi> met in their own Perſons, but their Numbers much encreaſing, the Vaſtneſs of them, and the Confuſion that muſt needs attend them, making ſuch Aſſemblies not practicable for Buſineſs, this way of <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> was firſt pitch't upon as an Expedient, both to Maintain the <hi>Commons Right,</hi> and to avoid the Confuſion of thoſe mighty Numbers. So that now, as well as then, <hi>No Law can be made, no Money levied, nor not a Penny legally demanded</hi> (even to defray the Charges of the Government) <hi>without your own Conſent:</hi> then which, tell me, what can be freer, or what more ſecure to any People?</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Third</hi> Great Fundamental Right and Priviledge is <hi>Executive,</hi> and holds proportion with the other two, in order to compleat both your <hi>Freedom &amp; Security,</hi> &amp; that is <hi>Your ſhare in the Judicatory Power, in the Execution and Application of thoſe Laws, that you agree to be made.</hi> Inſomuch as <hi>No man according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws of this Realm can be adjudg'd in matter either of</hi> Life, Liberty <hi>or</hi> Eſtate, <hi>but it muſt be by the Judgment of his</hi> Peers, <hi>that is, Twelve men of the Neighbourhood, commonly called a</hi> JURY; though this hath been infringed by two <hi>Acts</hi> made in the late long <hi>Parliament,</hi> one againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> in Particular, and the other againſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in General, called <hi>An Act againſt ſeditious Conventicles,</hi> where perſons are adjudged Offenders and puniſhable without a <hi>Jury</hi>: which 'tis hoped, this enſuing <hi>Parliament</hi> will think fit in their Wiſdoms to repeal, though with leſs Severity, then one of the ſame Nature (<hi>as to puniſhing men without Juries</hi>) was by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who for executing of it hang'd <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider with your ſelves, that there is nothing more your Intereſt, then for you to underſtand your <hi>Right</hi> in the <hi>Government,</hi> and to be conſtantly Jealous over it; for your <hi>Well-being</hi> depends upon its Preſervation.</p>
            <p>In all Ages there have been <hi>Ill Men,</hi> and we to be ſure are not without them now, ſuch as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelves of ill things, and dare not ſtand a <hi>Parliament,</hi> would put a <hi>Final Diſſolution</hi> upon the very Conſtitution it ſelf to be ſafe, that ſo we might never ſee another.</p>
            <p>But this being a Task too hard to compaſs, their next Expedient is <hi>To make them for their Turn,</hi> by <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> the <hi>Elections</hi>; and herein they are very Artificial &amp; too often Succesful; which indeed is worſe for us then if we had none. For thus the Conſtitution of <hi>Parliaments</hi> may be deſtroy'd by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38338:2"/>
and we, who by Law are <hi>Free,</hi> may hereby come to be made <hi>Slaves</hi> by Law. If then you are <hi>Free and reſolve to be ſo,</hi> if you have any regard to God's providence in giving you a claim to ſo <hi>excellent</hi> a <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> if you would not void your own <hi>Rights,</hi> nor lay a Foundation of <hi>Vaſſallage</hi> to your <hi>unborn Followers, the poor Poſterity of your Loyns,</hi> for whom God and Nature, and the Conſtitution of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> have made you <hi>Truſtees,</hi> then ſeriouſly weigh theſe following <hi>Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. In your preſent Election <hi>Receive no man's Gift or Bribe to chuſe him</hi>; but be aſſured, that <hi>he will be falſe to you, that baſely tempts you to be falſe to your Country, your ſelf and your Children.</hi> How can you hope to ſee God with peace, that turn <hi>Mercenaries</hi> in a matter, on which depends the <hi>Well-being</hi> of an whole Kingdom for preſent &amp; future times? ſince at a pinch <hi>One good Man gains a Vote &amp; ſaves a Kingdom</hi>; and what does any <hi>County</hi> or <hi>Burgeſs-Town</hi> in <hi>England</hi> know, but all may depend upon their making a good <hi>Choice</hi>? But then to ſell the Providence of God, and the dear-bought purchaſe of your painful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors for a little <hi>Money</hi> (that after you have got it, <hi>you know not how little a while you may be ſuffered to keep it</hi>) is the mark of a <hi>Wretched Mind</hi>: Truly ſuch ought not to have the power of a <hi>Free-man,</hi> that would ſo abuſe his own and hazard other mens Freedom by it: he deſerves to be caſt over Board, that would <hi>Sink the Veſſel,</hi> and thereby drown the Company embark't with him.</p>
            <p>Honeſt Gentlemen will think they give enough for the Choice, that pay their <hi>Electors</hi> in a conſtant, painful and chargeable Attendance; but <hi>Such as give Money to be choſen, would get Money by being choſen,</hi> they deſign <hi>not to ſerve you, but themſelves of you</hi>; and then <hi>fare you well.</hi> As you will anſwer it to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, I entreat you to ſhew your Abhorrence of this Infamous Practice: It renders the very Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contemptible, that any ſhould ſay, <hi>I can be choſen, if I will ſpend Money or give them Drink enough</hi>; and this is ſaid not without reaſon, <hi>Elections,</hi> that ought to be ſerious things, and gravely and reaſonably perform'd, being generally made the occaſions of more Rudeneſs and Drunkenneſs, then any of the Wild <hi>May-games</hi> in uſe among us.</p>
            <p>Thus by making men <hi>Law-breakers,</hi> they are it ſeems made fit to chuſe <hi>Law-makers,</hi> their <hi>Choice being the purchaſe of Exceſs.</hi> But muſt we alwayes owe our Parliaments to <hi>Rioting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs?</hi> and muſt men be made <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncapable</hi> of all Choice, before they chuſe their <hi>Legiſlators?</hi> I would know of any of you all, if in a difference about a private property, an <hi>Horſe</hi> or a <hi>Cow,</hi> or any other thing you would be as eaſie, indifferent and careleſs in chuſing your <hi>Arbitrators</hi>? Certainly you would not; with what reaſon then can you be unconcern'd in the Qualifications of men, upon whoſe fitneſs and <hi>Integrity</hi> depends all you and your Poſterity may enjoy? Which leads me to the other <hi>Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Chuſe no Man that has been a Reputed <hi>Penſioner</hi>; 'tis not only againſt your <hi>Intereſt,</hi> but it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to you and the <hi>Parliament</hi> you chuſe. The <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of a Nation ought to conſiſt of the moſt Wiſe, Sober and Valiant of the People, not Men of mean Spirits or ſordid <hi>Paſſions,</hi> that would ſell, the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the People that chuſe them, to advance their own, or be at the Beck of ſome great Man, in hopes of a <hi>Lift</hi> to a good Employ: pray beware of theſe. You need not be ſtreightned, the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> is wide and the <hi>Gentry</hi> numerous.</p>
            <p n="3">III. By no means chuſe a Man that is an <hi>Officer</hi> at Court, or whoſe Employment is <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> that is, <hi>at Will and Pleaſure</hi>; nor is this any Reflection upon the King, who being one Part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhould leave the other free, and without any the leaſt Awe or Influence to bar or hinder its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Beſides, an <hi>Officer</hi> is under a Temptation to be <hi>byaſt</hi>; and to ſay true, an <hi>Office</hi> in a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> man, is but a ſofter and ſafer word for a <hi>Penſion</hi>: the Pretence it has above the other, is the danger of it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In the next place, Chuſe no <hi>Indigent Perſons,</hi> for thoſe may be under a temptation of abuſing their Truſt to gain their own ends: for ſuch do not <hi>Prefer you,</hi> which ſhould be the end of their Choice, but <hi>Raiſe themſelves</hi> by you.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Have a care of <hi>Ambitious men</hi> and <hi>non-Reſidents,</hi> ſuch as live about Town and not with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, who ſeek honours and preferments above, and little or never embetter the Country with their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences</hi> or <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> for they intend <hi>themſelves</hi> and not the Advantage of the <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. Chuſe no <hi>Prodigal</hi> or <hi>Voluptuous Perſons,</hi> for beſides that they are not Regular enough to be <hi>Law-makers,</hi> they are commonly <hi>Idle</hi>; and though they may wiſh well to your <hi>Intereſt,</hi> yet they will loſe it rather then their Pleaſures; they will ſcarcely give their <hi>Attendance,</hi> they muſt not be relied on. So that ſuch Perſons are only to be preferred before thoſe, that are <hi>Sober to do miſchief</hi>; whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery is of the mind: Men of <hi>Injuſt Mercinary and ſiniſter Principles,</hi> who, the ſoberer they be to themſelves, the <hi>worſe they are to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. Review the <hi>Members</hi> of the laſt <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and their Inclinations and Votes, as near as you can learn them, and the Converſation of the Gentlemen of your own Country, that were not Members, and take your meaſures of both, by that which is your <hi>True and Juſt Intereſt</hi> at this Critical time of the day, and you need not be divided or diſtracted in your Choice.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Rather take a <hi>Stranger,</hi> if recommended by an unqueſtionable Hand, than a Neighbour <hi>Ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> to your <hi>Intereſt.</hi> 'Tis not pleaſing a Neighbour, becauſe rich and powerful, but <hi>Saving England,</hi> that you are to eye: Neither pay or return private Obligations at the coſt of the Nation; let not ſuch Engagements put you upon dangerous <hi>Elections</hi> as you love your Country.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38338:3"/>IX. Be ſure to have your Eye upon <hi>Men of Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Improvement.</hi> For thoſe that are Ingenuous and Laborious to propagate the Growth of the Country, will be very tender of weakening or impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing it: you may truſt ſuch.</p>
            <p n="10">X Let not your Choice be flung upon <hi>Men of Fearful Diſpoſitions,</hi> that will let <hi>good Senſe, Truth</hi> and your <hi>real Intereſt</hi> in any point ſink, rather than diſpleaſe ſome one or other great Man. If you are but ſenſible of your <hi>own Real Great Power,</hi> you will wiſely chuſe thoſe, that will by all juſt and legal wayes firmly keep and zealouſly promote it.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Pray ſee, that you chuſe <hi>Sincere Proteſtants</hi>; men that don't play the <hi>Proteſtant in Deſign,</hi> and are indeed <hi>Diſguis'd Papiſts,</hi> ready to pull off their Mask, when time ſerves: You will know ſuch by their <hi>Laughing at the Plot, Diſgracing the Evidence, Admiring the Traytors Conſtancy,</hi> that were forc'd to it, or their Religion and Party were gone beyond an <hi>Excuſe</hi> or an <hi>Equivocation.</hi> The contrary are men that thank God for this Diſcovery, and in their Converſation zealouſly direct themſelves in an Oppoſition to the <hi>Papal Intereſt,</hi> which indeed is a Combination againſt good <hi>Senſe, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and to introduce a blind Obedience without (if not againſt) Conviction. And that Principle which introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Implicit Faith and Blind Obedience in <hi>Religion,</hi> will alſo introduce Implicit Faith and Blind Obedience in <hi>Government</hi>: ſo that it is no more the Law in the one than in the other, but the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,</hi> that ſhall be the Rule and Bond of our <hi>Subjection.</hi> This is that fatal Miſchief <hi>Popery</hi> brings with it to <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and for which ſuch Societies ought to beware of it, and all thoſe that are Friends to it.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Among theſe be ſure to find out and caſt your favour upon <hi>Men of large Principles,</hi> ſuch, as will not ſacrifice his Neighbour's <hi>Property</hi> to the frowardneſs of his own <hi>Party</hi> in Religion: <hi>Pick out ſuch men, as will Inviolably maintain Civil Rights for all that will live ſoberly and civilly under the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt did not <hi>revile</hi> thoſe that <hi>reviled</hi> him, much leſs did he <hi>perſecute</hi> thoſe, that did not <hi>revile</hi> him. He rebuk't his Diſciples, that would have deſtroyed thoſe that did not follow and conform to them, ſaying; <hi>To know not what Spirit ye are of; I came not to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them.</hi> Which made the Apoſtle to ſay, that the <hi>Weapons</hi> of their Warfare were <hi>not Carnal, but Spiritual.</hi> This was the Ancient <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and where <hi>Proteſtants</hi> perſecute for Religion, <hi>they are falſe to their own profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Turn</hi> Papiſts <hi>even in the worſt ſenſe,</hi> againſt whom their Anceſtors did ſo ſtoutly exclaim, Read the <hi>Books of Martyrs</hi> of all Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> and you will find I ſay true: Therefore <hi>beware alſo of that Popery.</hi> Conſider, that ſuch Partial men don't love <hi>England,</hi> but a <hi>Sect</hi>; and prefer <hi>Impoſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> before <hi>Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> This is that Diſturber of Kingdoms and States, and till the <hi>Good Man,</hi> and not the <hi>Opinionative Man</hi> be the Chriſtian in the Eye of the Government, to be ſure, while force is uſed to propagate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>the outward Comforts of the Widow and Fatherleſs are made a Forfeit for the peaceable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Conſciences to God,</hi> he that fits in Heaven and judgeth Righteouſly, whoſe Eye pities the Oppreſſed and Poor of the Earth, will with-hold his Bleſſings from us.</p>
            <p>O lay to heart the grievous <hi>Spoils</hi> and <hi>Ruins</hi> that have been made upon your harmleſs Neignbours for near theſe twenty years, who have only deſired to enjoy their Conſciences to God according to the beſt of their underſtandings, and to eat the Bread of honeſt Labour, and to have but a <hi>Penny</hi> for a <hi>Penny's worth</hi> among you. Whoſe <hi>Ox</hi> or <hi>Aſs</hi> have they taken? whom have they wronged? or when did any of them offer you Violence? yet <hi>Sixty pounds have been diſtrained for</hi> twelve, two hundred pounds <hi>for</hi> ſixty pounds. <hi>The Flocks been taken out of the Fold, the Herd from the Stall; not a Cow left to give Milk to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, nor a Bed for the Widow to lie on; whole Barns of Corn ſwept away, and not a penny return'd</hi>; &amp; thus bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly proſecuted even by Laws made againſt <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And what is all this for? unleſs <hi>their worſhipping of God according to their Conſcience</hi>; for they injure no man, nor have they offered the leaſt Moleſtation to the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, I muſt take liberty to tell you, If you will not endeavour to redreſs theſe Evils in your Choice, I fear, God will ſuffer you to fall into great Calamity by thoſe you hate. You are afraid of <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet many of you practiſe it: for why do you fear it, but for its <hi>Compulſion</hi> and <hi>Perſecution?</hi> and will you <hi>compel</hi> or <hi>perſecute</hi> your ſelves, or chuſe ſuch as do? If you will, pray let me ſay, <hi>You hate the Papiſts, but not Popery.</hi> But God defend you from ſo doing, and direct you to do, as you would be done by: that chuſing ſuch as love <hi>England,</hi> her <hi>People</hi> and their <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> Foundations may be laid for that Security and Tranquillity, which the Children unborn may have cauſe to riſe up and bleſs your <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Memories</hi> for. Take it in good part, I mean nothing but <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to all; and ſo conclude my ſelf,</p>
