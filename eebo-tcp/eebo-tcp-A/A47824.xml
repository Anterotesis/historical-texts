            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT is a great deal of <hi>Time, Pains,</hi> and <hi>Good-Will,</hi>
that I have employ'd upon my <hi>Duty,</hi> in the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> from the Malice
of <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>petulant Libells:</hi> And not one word
of <hi>Reply,</hi> save only from the pittifull <hi>Expounder</hi> of my
<hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Appeal;</hi> (mentioned elsewhere) which
was, (in truth) so <hi>clamorously silly,</hi> that instead of an
<hi>Abuse,</hi> it prov'd a <hi>Complement.</hi> But to see the Luck
on't: Just as I was about to take out my <hi>Quietus;</hi> the
<hi>Cause,</hi> cold i'th' mouth; and to every bodies thinking,
without either <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Pulse;</hi> behold <hi>Two unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Confutations;</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> in <hi>Manuscript,</hi> by way
of a <hi>Familiar Epistle;</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> in <hi>Print.</hi> The
<hi>Letter</hi> was a <hi>Prologue</hi> to the <hi>Book,</hi> as the <hi>Book</hi> may
(in good time) be a <hi>Prologue</hi> to the <hi>Pillory;</hi> if making
the <hi>King</hi> One of the <hi>Three Estates,</hi> may recommend
the Author of it to That Preferment. This Epistle of his
crept in the dark one night into my <hi>Booksellers Shop;</hi>
as <hi>Naturally</hi> as if his Mother had been a <hi>Bulker,</hi> and
yet the Man's no <hi>Bastard</hi> neither, at least by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
side; as you will finde by his <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Logick:</hi>
which speaks him as true a Son of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> as if the Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lett
had been written with the very Milk of his <hi>Dam.</hi>
It is drawn out into <hi>Two Large Folio's;</hi> and truly
too <hi>much,</hi> and too <hi>beastly,</hi> to recite at length; so that
I shall only present ye with, here and there a <hi>Tast,</hi> of
his <hi>Vein,</hi> and <hi>Humour,</hi> and some short Notes upon it,
by the <hi>By.</hi> He begins, <hi>Monsieur CRACK.</hi> Now there
may arise some Controversy perhaps, among the <hi>Criticks,</hi>
about the Word <hi>Crack,</hi> and so I shall <hi>Expound</hi> it to ye:
but you'le finde the <hi>Rest</hi> to be Exceeding <hi>plain.</hi>

One <hi>Griffith</hi> wrote a smart Paper of Verses upon Dr.
<hi>Wild,</hi> wherein he call'd him the <hi>Presbyterians Jack-Pudding,</hi>
This was an Allusion proper enough; for why
should not <hi>Mountebanks</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> have their <hi>Jack-Puddings</hi>
as well as <hi>Mountebanks</hi> in <hi>Physick?</hi> But
however, the <hi>Dr.</hi> took <hi>mee</hi> to be the Authour of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and in Revenge, (the <hi>News-book</hi> being at that
time in my hand) was pleas'd to <hi>Christen</hi> me the <hi>Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fart</hi>
of the <hi>Nation.</hi> (As it may be many an honest mans
Fortune to have a Wag to his <hi>God-father.</hi> This Secret
I have told the Reader in <hi>Confidence;</hi> and I hope it
shall go no further: and upon that assurance I'le proceed.</p>
            <p>['Tis no new thing <hi>(says the Letter-man)</hi> for <hi>Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
to raise a <hi>Villain</hi> to preferment; and that has been
of late your daily bread: For what is all yonr <hi>Impudent
Scribling,</hi> but the Act of <hi>Procuring,</hi> for <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.]
So that writing for the</hi> King, <hi>and the</hi> Church <hi>it
seems, is writing for</hi> Popery <hi>and</hi> Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> is as much above your <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

            </p>
            <p>Now if it be <hi>Malicious Raillery,</hi> to magnify Dr. <hi>Oates's

to set forth his <hi>Hazzards</hi> (on <hi>Both</hi> Sides) as well
from the <hi>Fanatiques,</hi> as the <hi>Jesuits;</hi> to maintain him for
a <hi>Canonicall Asserter</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against
all Gainsayers; to Enumerate the <hi>Good-Offices</hi> he has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to the <hi>poor Protestants,</hi> and to <hi>pray</hi> that he may be
rewarded according to his <hi>Deserts,</hi> for all the good he has

               <hi>guilty</hi> of it: But if all This be <hi>Good,</hi> where's the <hi>Malice?</hi>
Or if it be <hi>True,</hi> where's the <hi>Raillery?</hi> And this is
not all neither; the purging of my <hi>Self:</hi> But whosoever calls
this <hi>Deference</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> by the Name
of <hi>Raillery,</hi> does manifestly imply the <hi>Ground</hi> of it to be
<hi>False;</hi> to the wounding of the <hi>Drs. Testimony,</hi> and to the

            <p>
               <hi>There's the same hand again in</hi> Tom <hi>and</hi> Dick; <hi>(for

<hi>(he says)</hi> has Serenaded <hi>Dr. Oates</hi> of late most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
and caress'd him, just as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abner. In which

<hi>The man</hi> Sweats <hi>ye see, on the behalf of the</hi> Dr, <hi>but

            <p>Here's <hi>Another Flower</hi> of his <hi>Rhetorique,</hi> and the
Blaspheming of a <hi>Protestant Martyr,</hi> over and above; with
two or three <hi>Presbyterianisms</hi> more, into the Bargain.</p>
            <p>Here's <hi>Wit at Will</hi> ye see, in the <hi>Dialect,</hi> directly of a

But whoever it is, by my Troth, I do e'enpitty the
Wretch, for he's <hi>set On,</hi> and only <hi>Barks</hi> for a <hi>Crust.</hi>
But upon the whole matter there went more Heads then

                  <p>It is certain,<note place="margin">The Tye of an Oath.</note> that an <hi>Oath,</hi> or the calling of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>

of the greatest effect, in the Manage of our most Important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
So that it is no wonder to see all matters of the Highest

without an <hi>Oath:</hi> Nor any thought of a <hi>Popular Oath,</hi>
without a <hi>Colour</hi> of some <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Countenance</hi> it; Nor any
<hi>Colourable Authority,</hi> but in a <hi>Well-Affected House of Commons;</hi>
and <hi>that Qualification</hi> depends wholly upon a Right Choice of
the <hi>Members,</hi> as <hi>that Choice</hi> again depends upon the <hi>good Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of those that <hi>Chuse</hi> them.</p>

                  <p>So that the <hi>Good-Will</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> is the Key of the
Work; and we have gain'd that point already.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Practises in Elections.</note> but they fall off most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundedly.
The next step, is a <hi>Well-principled House of Commons.</hi>

People: That by these Practices, diverse persons were Obtruded
upon the Nation, of <hi>remarkable Disaffections</hi> both to <hi>Church,</hi> and
