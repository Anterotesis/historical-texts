            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was, to celebrate the Paſſeouer the Sacrament of the Law: the motion hereunto was made by good <hi>Hezechiah:</hi> vpon the motion, a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of well-diſpoſed people came together to Ieruſalem to keepe the feaſt; and as that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and religious King ordered the matter in his great zeale for the glory of God, it was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with that ſolemnitie, as the like was neuer
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3141:4"/>
done before ſince <hi>Salomons</hi> dayes: <hi>A diuiſo regno non fuit celebrata tanta festiuitas iunctis cum Iehuda Iſraelitis:</hi> Neuer ſince the diuiſion of the Tribes, was there ſuch a feſtiuall time ſo ſolemnely kept by <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Now, to ſee the zeale and forwardneſſe of the Princes and people in ſo good an action, it was no ſmall comfort to the Prieſts and Leuites: they therefore, when they ſaw all things done to their owne hearts deſire, and to the glory of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their office, in the end they gaue the aſſembly their Prieſtly benediction, and obtained a bleſſing from the Lord vpon them, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt the Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The diuiſion.</note> The words may be diuided into two parts: The firſt is concerning the Prieſts bleſſing vpon earth: the ſecond touching the bleſſing of this bleſſing, from heauen. The firſt, in theſe words, <hi>Then the Prieſts the Leuites aroſe and bleſſed the people, and their voyce was heard.</hi> The ſecond, in the words following; <hi>and their prayer came vp to his holy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, euen to heauen.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The ſubdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> In the firſt part, euery word hath his weight, and there are ſixe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars obſeruable therein. Firſt, the time when this was done. Secondly, the agents by whom it was done. Thirdly, the preparation thereunto. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the action it ſelfe. Fifthly, the obiect of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sixthly and laſtly, the manner of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſenſe.</note> Firſt, for the time, <hi>Then:</hi> that is, <hi>Finito ſacro,</hi> All the ſolemnitie of the ſacrifice being finiſhed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſeaſonably and opportunely. In concluſion of that diuine ſeruice, when the people were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3141:4"/>
they were diſmiſt with a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the agents or perſons bleſſing, they were conſecrate perſons which had a calling to doe it: <hi>The Prieſts the Leuites bleſt.</hi> 
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What the Prieſts were.</note> The Prieſts were men immediatly called out of <hi>Aarons</hi> poſteritie, and anointed in the ſight of the people, among whom ſome that were Heads of their families, were called chiefe Prieſts, and the Princes of the Sanctuary, amongſt whom there was one ſuper-eminent perſon aboue all the reſt, called the High Prieſt, who had moſt glorious attire, and might alone enter into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> once a yeere, and was in his function a figure of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites.</note> The Leuites were inferiour Miniſters, and had offices appointed vnto them vnder the Prieſts, as aſſiſtants vnto them in the ſeruice of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, Numb. 8. 7. And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 7. 19.</note>the Prieſts and the Leuites: but here it is not ſaid, the Prieſts and Leuites, but <hi>Haccohanim haleuiijm,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew text, <hi>Sacerdotes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitici,</hi> as <hi>Iunius</hi> tranſlateth, the Leuiticall Prieſts. For <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the Prieſts were of the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> and to them it pertained by the Law to bleſſe in the name of God, Numb. 6. 22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the preparation, <hi>They aroſe.</hi> Sitting ſtill was not a geſture reuerend enough for them to vſe in publike prayer: kneeling downe would haue drowned their voyce and hindred the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; therefore it concerning the people to heare what they ſaid, that they might ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it, the Prieſts ſtood vp that they might be conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3141:5"/>
and ſo be the better vnderſtood of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for the action, it is ſaid, <hi>They bleſt.</hi> To bleſſe, hath diuers ſignifications in the Scripture. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1.</note> Firſt, man is ſaid to bleſſe God:  then it ſignifieth  to praiſe and giue thankes. <note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">What it is to bleſſe.</note> Secondly, God is ſaid to bleſſe man, and then it ſignifieth actually to conferre ſome good or other. Thirdly, man is ſaid to bleſſe man, and then it ſignifieth to wiſh well vnto, which is vſually done with inuocation of the name of God, the fountaine of all good that commeth to man, or to any creature in heauen or earth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 12.</note> Now thus a man bleſſeth either himſelfe or others.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3141:7"/>
the Prieſts bleſſed them all. Laſtly, for the maner; it was with a lowd voice: they ſpake out when they bleſt them, praying feruently for them, and earneſtly deſiring the bleſſing of God vpon them all. This is ſignifyed by that, that it is ſaid, <hi>Their voice was heard.</hi> Yet not the voice of the Prieſts only, but the voices of the people alſo: all which are ſpoken of, as if there were but one voice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the harmony and accord, all ſpeaking to the ſame effect: not that the people vſed the ſame words which the Prieſts vſed. But they did that which was their part to do, and ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prieſts bleſſing, and that alowd, from their hearts, wiſhing themſelues ſo happy. Deuotion amongſt our people is now growne ſo colde, that many times in great congregations when the bleſſing is pronounced, there is nothing but a little whiſpering; few ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſpeake out at the end of prayers. But in former times, when people were more deuout, they made ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed noiſe in the Church when they ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> that Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> likened it to the thunder: <note place="margin">Hier. in praefa. lib. <hi>2.</hi> in Gal.</note> and Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> to the roring of the ſea; ſuch a roring and thundring noiſe there was made by the Prieſts and people at this benediction: <hi>Their voice was heard.</hi> After this manner was the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing performed. And theſe are the circumſtances obſeruable in the firſt part of the Text. In the ſecond: firſt, another name is giuen to this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: ſecondly, local motion is aſcribed vnto it: thirdly, the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> or place whither it paſſed, is ſet downe. For the firſt, the name now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3141:7"/>
giuen vnto it, is prayer, which ſheweth how the Prieſts bleſſed the people, not vainly and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly, by caſting of holy water vpon them, or by croſſing with their fingers, but by prayer and inuocation of the name of God for his bleſſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For the ſecond, it is ſaid, <hi>tauo,</hi> it went; which is ſpoken of prayer metaphorically. Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as it ſeemeth, to a meſſenger, to which praier may be aptly compared: for <hi>Veluti officio internun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cij fungitur oratio pro nobis apud Deum:</hi> prayer doth the office of a meſſenger for vs vnto God. For the third, the place whither it went, hath two names giuen vnto it. Firſt, his holy dwelling place, or as it is in the Hebrew, the habitation of his Holineſſe; ſecondly, it is called Heauen. <note place="margin">God his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</note> For the firſt, it importeth not that God had, or hath need of any habitation, as a man hath, of a houſe to dwell in, or that any created place whatſoeuer can containe the tranſcendent Maieſty of the Creator.</p>
            <p>It is confeſt by <hi>Salomon,</hi> that <hi>the heauens, and the heauen of heauens cannot containe him,</hi> 1. King. 8. 27. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 8. 27.</note>But it hath pleaſed him of his abundant grace to condeſcend ſo farre, as to haue his cohabitations, where he hath decreed to dwell, and to conuerſe more familiarly with his creatures, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his goodnes vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 2.</note> Our Sauiour ſpeaketh of his Fathers houſe, wherein there are <hi>many manſions,</hi> that is, his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or rather cohabitation aboue, where he doth cohabit and familiarly conuerſe with the Angels of light; and on earth he alwayes had his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3141:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dwelling places; before the comming of Chriſt, he had a materiall Temple, called his houſe, where it pleaſed him to manifeſt his preſence continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and in euery good heart he dwelleth by his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now according to the adiunct or appellation of holines, the Lord his dwelling place is holy, what euer habitation he hath had, or hath, it was, and is holy. The Temple erected for him by <hi>Salo</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, was holy: and he neuer dwelleth in any heart but that which is ſanctifyed: But to which habitation of his holines did this prayer aſcend, the other name putteth this out of doubt: for the place whither it went, is alſo called heauen.</p>
            <p> Now heauen is a common name to diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſpaces. <note place="margin">Three hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</note> Firſt, according to the Scriptures there is <hi>coelum elementare,</hi> the ſublunary or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary heauen, where the winds blow, and the birds fly, and the clouds hang, and Comets and Meteors appeare; that is not the heauen heere ſpoken of; their prayer went vp higher then ſo. Secondly, there is <hi>coelum ſtellatum,</hi> the heauens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, where the Sun, Moone and ſtarres run their courſes continually: neither is this the heauen heere meant; their prayer went higher then the ſtarres.

Thither went this happy meſſenger, the prayer of the Prieſts. All this tendeth to ſet foorth the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3141:8"/>
ſingular acceptance which this ſacerdotall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction had with God: it penetrated the clouds, and had ſpeedy paſſage thorow all places, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent acceſſe vnto the King of glory.

            <p>But why is heauen called his holy habitation, and not rather his glorious habitation, it being ſo glorious a place as it is?</p>

               <note place="margin">Heauen why called holy.</note> I anſwere, it may as well, and aptly, and vpon as good reaſon be called his holy habitation, as his glorious habitation.

Chriſt which they taught, and from them we haue receiued that forme of Euangelicall benediction,<note place="margin">The Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall bleſſing.</note> vſed in all Churches by the publike Miniſters: <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14.</note>
               <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the loue of God the Father, and the communion of the holy Ghoſt be with you all, Amen.</hi> Which differeth from the former in words more than in ſubſtance. For it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth as much as that, but is ſo much the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe in this the ſweete and bleſſed name of Ieſus Chriſt is mentioned, and all the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſtinctly: therefore wee vſe this rather than the other.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, Is there any commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen to the Miniſters of the Goſpell to bleſſe? I anſwere, when Chriſt ſent Preachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the Cities whither he would come, he appoynted them to bleſſe the places where they came, and ſhewed them how to doe it: Luk. 10. 5. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 5.</note>
               <hi>Into whatſoeuer houſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yee enter, firſt ſay, Peace be to this houſe.</hi> Ther's a briefe forme of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing appoynted vnto them to vſe. <hi>And if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſonne of peace be there,</hi> that is, any worthie of peace which will receiue you, <hi>then your peace ſhall reſt vpon it;</hi> that is, that bleſſing which you prayed for, ſhall be vpon that houſe: but, <hi>if not, it ſhall turne to you againe:</hi> you ſhall be the better for it, but it ſhall take no effect for their good. Whereby we ſee, that as it pertained to the Prieſts vnder the Law to bleſſe the people, ſo it likewiſe belongeth to the Miniſters of the Goſpell: and as the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benediction of old was not meerely verball, but effectuall; ſo to the bleſſing pronounced by the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3141:11"/>
Miniſters of Chriſt, a promiſe of like efficacie is annexed. And this may ſerue for confirmation of the poynt propounded, and for information of the iudgement. I come now to the ſpeciall infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences hence, tending to the reformation of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, not anſwerable hereunto.</p>
            <p>Now the vſe concerneth either all hearers in generall, or Miniſters themſelues in ſpeciall. Firſt, al hearers, of what ranke or ſort ſoeuer, are taught hence to make more account of the prayers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and the better to reſpect their perſons. <note place="margin">Miniſters prayers to be preferd before others.</note>Firſt, their prayers are to be preferred before the prayers of others, eſpecially publike prayer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, and of publike prayers, their bleſſing prayer particularly: for it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>their prayer came vp to heauen,</hi> that is, the prayer of the Prieſts, and the prayer ſpoken of was publike prayer; and it is meant of the prayer wherewith the Prieſts bleſſed the people. For the firſt, it is true that <hi>the prayer of the righteous is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 15. 8.</note>as it is Prou. 15. 8. euen of any righteous man: but if a righteous Prophet or publike Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may be had, it is ſo much the better. When <hi>Abimelech</hi> was puniſht for taking <hi>Sarah,</hi> it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer that muſt doe him good, becauſe he was a Prophet, Gen. 20. 7.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7.</note> And S. <hi>Iames</hi> for this cauſe would not haue the ſicke man to  content himſelfe with his owne prayers only, but to deſire the Miniſters helpe, Iam. 5. 14. <note place="margin">The ſicke to ſend for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to pray for them.
<bibl>Iames 5. 14.</bibl>
               </note>He ſaith indeed, <hi>Is any man afflicted? Let him pray.</hi> Euery one is to pray for himſelfe, but that is not all that he is to doe. <hi>Is any ſicke among you? Let him call for</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:3141:12"/>
               <hi>the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him.</hi> Is any ſicke, be he what he will be, if he be neuer ſo good, let him not truſt to his owne prayers, if he may haue further helpe. Why but will it not ſerue the turne as well, if hee ſend for ſome good Chriſtian in the towne, to pray for him? No, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and it is promiſed that there ſhall be ſpeciall fruite of their prayers. The ſicke ſhal be raiſed vp, and if he haue committed ſinnes, they ſhall be forgiuen him.</p>
            <p>But it may be obiected: We doe not alwaies ſee this fruite of Miniſters prayers: many times the ſicke that haue their prayers, are little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A difference of Miniſters, and of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> I anſwere, it may well be ſo: becauſe there is a great difference of Churchmen, and a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of thoſe which haue their prayers. Firſt, all Churchmen are not alike, ſome are righteous, and ſome vnrighteous: ſome pray in faith, others haue not that grace. And the Apoſtle there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the prayers of the righteous, and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in a righteous Prophet, <hi>Elias.</hi> And it is the prayer of faith which he commendeth for effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. <note place="margin">A difference amongſt thoſe that are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</note>Secondly, all afflicted and ſicke perſons are not alike. Firſt, againſt ſome, almightie God is growne to ſuch diſpleaſure, that he will heare no man for them: As he ſaid, <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my minde could not be towards this people: caſt them out of my ſight, and let them go foorth,</hi> Iere. 15. 1.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jere.</hi> 15. 1.</note> And elſewhere, <hi>Though theſe three men were in it, Noah, Daniel and Iob, as I liue, ſaith the</hi>

               <hi>Lord God, they ſhould deliuer but their owne ſoules by their righteouſnes,</hi> Ezech. 14. 14, 16, 18, 20. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p> Secondly, that place before named, Luk. 10. 5.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 10 5.</note> may giue ſatisfaction touching this matter, where promiſe of bleſſing to the Miniſters prayer for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is but conditionall; If they be the ſonnes of peace, it ſhall doe them good, not elſe; if they be contemners of our office and miniſterie, as many be, they are not qualified and prepared for grace: they ſhall haue no benefit by our prayers. But for the ſonnes of peace, which humble themſelues, and vnfainedly loue the Lords meſſengers, and reuerence their doctrine, and deſire their prayers, God will heare his faithfull ſeruants: Such ſhall be the better for the prayers of Gods Miniſters, which they make for them vnto the Lord in their ſickneſſe. Therefore let them doe as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth them, call for the Elders of the Church for this purpoſe, preferring the prayers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters, before the prayers of any other whatſoeuer. But as their priuate prayers are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be deſired, ſo publike prayer performed by them, is to be preferd before priuate.<note place="margin">Publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd before priuate.</note> Such was the prayer ſpoken of in the Text, and it went vp to heauen. The diſtance of heauen and earth, the cloudes and celeſtiall bodies betweene them, the infirmities of them that prayed could not hinder, but it pierced thorow all, and had ſpeedie acceſſe vnto God, and gracious acceptance with him. When many ioyne together with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, it is pleaſing to God, and moſt auailable with him, when there is a conſort of hearts and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3141:13"/>
voyces, and a harmony of affections, and many haue one and the ſame ſuite and ſupplication vnto the God of heauen, it preuaileth mightily with him, prouided that the Miniſter be the ſpeaker. So it is appoynted, Ioel. 2. 16.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Gather the people.</hi> It is not enough for euery family apart to pray, but all families muſt aſſemble together and pray, and the prayer muſt proceed from the Prieſts lips: <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, ſay, Spare thy people, O Lord: then will the Lord heare and ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> Is there any man then in loue with his owne priuate deuotion, and thinketh that ſufficient, and therefore abſenteth himſelfe from the publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, when he might be preſent, if he would?

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3141:14"/>
to ſhew the ſingular acceptance it had with God. Wherfore let no man depraue our Church for this, becauſe we vſe ſet praiers in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor let any deſpiſe ſuch prayers as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe deſpiſeth not: for we finde in the Scripture vſe both of conceiued prayer and of ſet formes, and both pleaſing vnto God:<note place="margin">Our Church alloweth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to vſe conceiued prayer.</note> and in our Church as ordinarily we are appointed to vſe common ſupplications: ſo vpon extraordinary occaſions, the Preacher hath liberty to inlarge, and to vſe the beſt gift he hath, as God ſhall inable him, and his holy Spirit ſhall guide his hart &amp; tongue. Let al make vſe of both vnto the glory of God: for pleaſing vnto him are the publike prayers of the Church, whether extraordinary, or ordinary.

            <p>There being therefore ſuch neceſſity of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I can but wonder, that vpon the beſt Day of the weeke, many Country people are afraid to do nothing, but to goe forth to heare a Sermon. They dare ride abroad about their worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as often as they liſt; they dare goe to all the prophane Wakes in the Country one Sunday after another, but dare not goe to a Sermon ſo much as halfe a Sabbath dayes iourney, though they haue none at home, as they would make men beleeue for feare of Apparitors and Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3141:15"/>
I doe the more wonder at it, becauſe I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe, that our religious Fore-fathers, which had a hand in ſetting foorth the Common prayer booke, now eſtabliſhed by authority, held, and would haue the people taught the neceſſity of hearing the Word of God: for they haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted prayers to be vſed, that the Lord would giue Miniſters grace to preach diligently, &amp; it is giuen in charge to the ſureties at Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Thoſe of yeeres to bee called vpon to heare ſermons by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Church.</note> that when the baptized come to yeeres, they call vpon them to heare Sermons, not thinking it ſufficient for them to heare Seruice onely. And none haue written more effectually of the excellency of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, then thoſe learned and worthy Doctors and Diuines, which tooke paines lately in the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible; See what they haue written of this in their Epiſtle to his Maieſtie: <hi>Amongst all our ioyes,</hi> ſay they, <hi>there was no one that more filled our hearts, then the bleſſed continuance of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods ſacred Word amongst vs, which is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth, becauſe the fruit thereof extendeth it ſelfe, not onely to the time ſpent in this tranſitory world, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth and diſpoſeth men vnto that eternall happineſſe, which is aboue in heauen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus honourably haue they written of the preaching of the Word: and theſe I am ſure were no Puritans; for they haue written againſt Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and therefore there can be no ſuch excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken.</p>
            <p>Certainely the doctrine of our Church is, and euer hath beene, for the neceſſity and vtility of

The time hath been, that Preachers haue been too diſgracefully vſed by temporall Iudges in the face of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: but ſince his Maieſties comming to the Crowne, there hath been better reſpect had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: And a great Iudge of Aſſiſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it publikely, that he would aſſoone bind a man to his good behauiour for contempt of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as for contempt of a Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Now, in Eccleſiaſticall Courts, we haue reaſon to expect better regard than in the Temporall: for to that end thoſe Courts and Conſiſtories were granted at the firſt by Princes, as it is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by one that is not onely <hi>in legibus doctus &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus,</hi>  but <hi>legum Doctor,</hi>

And another reaſon of this, he ſaith, was, that Clerks ſuites &amp; quarrels ſhould not bee diuulged among the Lay people, to the diſcredit of their profeſſion. Otherwiſe the ſaid Author alſo ſheweth, how much anciently the credit of the Clergy was tendred; and he wiſheth the like regard towards Eccleſiaſticall men were ſtill retained, both becauſe it was reuerent, and

worthy the dignity of the Miniſtery, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he acknowledgeth to bee moſt honourable. Thus he, himſelfe a Iudge in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, of great place.
