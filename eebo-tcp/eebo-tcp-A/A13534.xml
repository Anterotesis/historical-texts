            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

good. This is the scope of
the whole first table, <hi>the
first and the great commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Mark. 12. 33. <hi>To loue
God witb all the heart, all the
vnderstanding, all the soule,
and all the strength, is more
than all burnt offerings and
sacrifices,</hi> as the Scribe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed;
whereupon the text

               </gap>, <hi>cordaté,)</hi> discreetly,
wisely, and that in Christs
iudgement. This is wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:242:27"/>
to giue God the first
place, first thoughts, first
seruice, chiefe prayse and
precedency:<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> for, <hi>of him, and

            </p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Purchase Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all gaine.</note> Another chiefe point
of spirituall wisedome in
the things of God, is, to
purchase Christ and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes aboue all
things in the world. The
sound Christian is that <hi>wise
marchant, that sels all to buy

and his righteousnesse:
that <hi>wise builder,</hi> that layes
Christ a sure foundation in
his heart: Hee is of the

Wisedome will
procure the best commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note>
and chiefe gaine,
which is <hi>Christ both in life
and death. Paul</hi> was a wise
marchant, who esteemed
all things drosse and dung
in comparison of Christ.
So were the Disciples, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Master wee haue lest all
and followed thee.</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note> So were
the Martyrs, whom the
world accounted simple
fooles, in following Christ
with the losse of life and
all. Happy is that soule,
and filled with found and

comes to Christ with this
resolution, <hi>Master, thou hast

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:242:28"/>
3.<note place="margin">3. Chuse best things first.</note> Let vs preferre in our
election and choice things
of higher nature, before
things of inferiour: for
wisdome keeps a method,
by which it euer subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth
lower things to
higher. This rule our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
prescribeth, Mat. 6.
33. <hi>First seeke the Kingdome

and then for earth. By
which rule of wisedome, 1.
all profits and pleasures
must giue place to piety:
for all is but pidling gaine
to godlinesse. 2. By this
rule of wisedome, the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
calling and trade of
life must giue place to the
generall calling, which is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:242:29"/>
the trade of Christianity.
3. By this rule a Christian
must chuse to bee rich in
God and good workes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in the world:
which because the rich
man in the Gospell negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 20</note>
hee is called <hi>foole</hi> for
his labour. 4. By this rule
wee must with <hi>Dauid,</hi> more
affect one glimpse of Gods
fauour and countenance,<note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note>
than all corne, wine, and
oyle, that is, the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and delightful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
in the world. 5. By this
rule wee must make more
account of pardon of sinnes
locked vp in our breasts,
than of the whole treasury
of a Kingdome in our
chests. 6. By this rule wee
must esteeme a graine of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:242:29"/>
grace aboue a million of
gold: and 7. a poore god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man aboue a wicked
Prince: Eccles. 4. 13. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is a wise childe than an old

13. This is to apply our
hearts to wisedome, to set
our hearts to keepe Gods
Commandements, and do
them: <hi>this is our wisedome,</hi>
Deut. 4. 5. <hi>Who is a wise man
among you, endued with

5. 13. A wise man will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the mouth of the
King, and will feare the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:242:30"/>
danger of the law: so a
wise Christian will walke
in the law of the Lord, Psa.
119. 1. and will be sure to
keepe him to this rule and
warrant contained in the
word of God, Gal. 6. 16.
And as a wise man is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to keepe his assurances
and euidences for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his lands and
earthly liuelihoods, and is
loth to forfeit any of them
by failing in any of the
conditions: So it is the
wisedome of a godly man
to keepe the Word safely
in his heart, which assureth
him of his estate in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and which hee is loth
to forfeit by failing in the

2. 13. This is a <hi>wisedome to

also the Apostle condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
curiosity and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse,
which wastes out

16. Our rule therfore must
be to grow vp in wisdome,
and as wee grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
so to grow in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
for the more sound

            <p>The <hi>generall</hi> rule for all

for any estate, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in euery estate, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thy selfe the present
estate (whatsoeuer it is)
is best for thee, though
not euer in thy sense, yet in
Gods gracious and wise
ordering of it. This lesson
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had well
learned, Phil. 4. 11, 12. <hi>I
can want, and abound; I can
be full, and hungry: I haue
learned in all estates to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>speciall</hi> rules are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for prosperity, or for

&amp; afflictions, these
are the rules of Christian
wisedome:<note place="margin">1. God may be as well inioyed in aduersity as prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Consider thou art not
placed here in the world
by God to enioy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:242:46"/>
of the world, but to
enioy God, which thou
maist doe as well in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as in prosperity, and
to cleaue to him in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
looking for nothing
but afflictions, as a pilgrim
going to thy Countrey,
the way whereunto, lyeth
through afflictions. This
ground not laid; men
count troubles a strange
thing, 1 Pet. 4. 11. and start
at the mention of them, as
the Apostles, Ioh. 11. 8.
when they heard Christ
speaking of going into <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
where the Iewes had
lately sought to stone him.
And note it to be a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heart, to bee
more grieued for thine
owne troubles than the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:242:46"/>
troubles of the Church,
for priuate than publike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils.</p>

Humility, to ouer-master
and tame the pride and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of our hearts, and
to bring in contentednesse
to sweeten our troubles;
and our labour will be well
spent: for if we can rellish
the hardest part of our life,
our whole life else will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
be more sweet and
ioyfull. 2. Growe vp in the
knowledge of God, which
will make thee rise vp in
much comfort, and will
bring in comfort against
that confused heauinesse,
distrust, and dangerous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
&amp; passions, which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:242:47"/>
else in trouble might beat
vs downe, and off him.
3. Get assurance of faith,
which will sweetly warme
the heart in the sense of
Gods loue in Iesus Christ:
The fruit of which will be,
<hi>First,</hi> to enable vs to trust
our selues with God in any
estate, and bee assured the

be sharper then ordinary,
it is sure some sinne or lust

attaine once a right

of a ready writer, <hi>Psal. 45. 1.
Such as the heart is, such
will bee the speech: and
therefore hee that hath no
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:242:54"/>
care of his heart, cannot
bee a good and carefull
speaker. The Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi>
gracious speech, <hi>Col.
4. 6. but that must come
from a gracious heart: as
Psal.</hi> 37. 30, 31. the mouth
of the righteous will speake of
wisedome, and his tongue will
talke of iudgement. For the
Law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps shall not slide.

is little worth: the lippes of
the righteous doe feed many;
but fooles shall die for want
of wisedome. <hi>The true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:242:54"/>
why many mend not

            </p>
            <p>2. Concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of speech:<note place="margin">Let the matter be choise.</note> 1. Because
all must be wholesome so
much as we may, therefore
chuse the best matters to

most reuerently, as those
who are not worthy to take
his name into our mouths.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:242:55"/>
The precept is, Leuit. 19.
12. <hi>Thou shalt not defile the
name of the Lord, but feare
his glorious name,</hi> Deut. 28.
58. And they defile his
name, who in common
talke, lightly and carelesly
vse his name, of <hi>God,</hi> or
<hi>Lord,</hi> or any other of his
titles in ordinary speech:
and they, who are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or idle swearers and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers:
and iesters in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phrases,
who are farre
from <hi>trembling at his word,</hi>
Isa. 66. 3. and those that
mocke at sinne and Gods
iudgements, and abuse or
are vnthankfull for any of
his mercies. II. If the

euery mans speech
by nature is corrupt,<note place="margin">1. Sauory.</note> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
striue to make it <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and powdred with salt,</hi>
Col. 4. 6. that is, well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
and sauoury, not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
of the flesh and
corruption, but wee must
driue out or drie vp the
corruption of them, with
the salt of grace. Against
many, who powder their

speech with oathes, and
curses, and filthy rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or fondidle speeches,
sauouring of the filthy
sincke and puddle within.
Secondly, it must bee iust
and sincere,<note place="margin">2. Sincere.</note> 
               <hi>the truth of our
heart,</hi> Psal. 15. 2. without
dissimulation or lies, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God made the tongue
to expresse the heart. A
fearefull thing it is, that
most mens speeches are
turned into meere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.
<note place="margin">3. Most earnest in things hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly.</note> Thirdly, it must
bee more earnest, ioyfull,
and comfortable when
thou speakest of heauenly
things, than of earthly:
<hi>not iesting, or foolish talking,
but rather giuing of thankes,</hi>
Eph. 5. 4.</p>
            <p>4. Concerning the end
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:242:57"/>
of our speech:<note place="margin">4. The end of our speech, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification.</note> It must

21. and <hi>minister grace to the
hearers.</hi> It must bend it selfe
still for God, the defence
of good men and actions,
and the disgrace of sinne.
Better no speech, than to
no good end. And yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their light, and idle
speeches say, why, I hope
I doe no harme. Yea, but
what good doth it? Shame
will not let thee say, thou
intendest edification. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looke well vnto it.</p>
            <p>5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of our speech:<note place="margin">5. The measure.</note> First,
wee must not speake too
little,<note place="margin">1. Not too little.</note> and omit gracious
speeches when occasion is
offered, as many dry and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:242:58"/>
barren hearts and mouthes,
haue not a word for God
and goodnesse, that haue
words enough, and more
then enough in any other
argument; like idols in
good things, that haue
mouthes,<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and speake not;</hi> or
as if they were possessed
with dumbe spirits, and
not suffered to speake any
good. Tell such a one of a
good farme, or bargaine,
or natural things, and they
sauour and rellish them
well enough: whereas a
good motion strikes them
dumbe, and makes them as
fishes out of their element.
Neither,<note place="margin">2. Not too much.</note> secondly, must
our words be too many:

            <p>6. Concerning the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our speech.<note place="margin">6. The sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> All our
words must be seasonable,
as well as seasoned, that is,
fitted to circumstances,
times, places, and persons.
Wisdome will seeke a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for good words: for
there is a season wherein
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:242:59"/>
               <hi>the prudent will keepe silence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 5. 13</note>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And <hi>how good is a good word
in due season?</hi> Pro. 15. 23. <hi>It
is like apples of gold, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of siluer.</hi> Husband
men obserue seasons in
sowing, and so must hee
that lookes for an haruest
of his speeches. <hi>Abigail</hi>
would not speake to her
husband <hi>Nabal</hi> in his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
but when he had
slept out his wine. Euery
man is not capable of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good speech, nor no
man at all times alike.
There is an vnaduised o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennes,
against which our
Sauiour by his example
armes vs, Ioh. 2. <hi>vlt. Hee
would not commit himselfe to
some, who are said to beleeue
in him, because hee knew what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:242:59"/>
was in man.</hi> Silence is best
where no good can bee
done, as Christ was silent
before the high Priest: and
<hi>Rabsecai</hi> must not bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
To meet a man in
the heat of his passion with
good words, is to meet a
Beare robbed of her
whelps: but let the passion
be calme, and then tell him
how disguised and vncoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he was, he will perhaps
beleeue it.</p>

is the word of God:
<hi>What I command thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deu. 12. 32</note>

               <hi>Who required those
things at your hands?</hi> And
for the matter of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we haue a special rule,
Phil. 4. 8. <hi>Whatsoeuer things
are true, honest, iust, pure;
whatsoeuer things pertaine to
loue, and are of good report; if
there be any vertue or praise,
thinke on these things.</hi> And
Rom. 12. 17. and 1 Cor. 8.
21. <hi>Prouide things that are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:242:61"/>
honest, not onely before the
Lord, but also before men.</hi>
2. Examine whether it be
good in <hi>the doer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. If good in the manner.</note> vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by vertue of a speciall
calling, and answerable to
that duty which himselfe
oweth to God or man. God
vpholdeth the societies of
men by <hi>order;</hi> which is,
when euery man keeps his

one moues (as the seuerall
starres) but euery one in his
owne spheare, not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the motion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So publike men
should attend the publike
office; and priuate men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in priuate, but let
the publike alone. For
Christ reproued <hi>Peters</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,

seasonable and conuenient,
or whether the season serue
not for some better action
then that. For wisedome

1. This will breed and

            </argument>
            <p>IF our actions concerne
others,<note place="margin">Rules for workes of mercie.</note> then they bee
works either of mercy, or
of iustice:</p>
            <p>For workes of mercy
much wisedome is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">1. Mercy must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from faith and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue.</note>
and that is shewed in
these particulars: 1. See
thy charity come from a
good ground, namely,
from a heart qualified with
two graces: 1. Faith: <hi>for
whatsoeuer is not of faith, is
sinne,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. Thou
must <hi>first giue thy selfe to the
Lord, and then to his Saints,</hi>
2 Cor. 8. 5. Thy mercie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:242:64"/>
must issue from the sense
of Gods mercie in Christ
to thine owne soule, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by faith in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Bring forth
fruit in this <hi>vine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1.</note> 2. It must
proceed from loue. Works
of mercy must come from
the fountaine of a mercifull
heart, Rom. 12. 8. <hi>He that
distributeth, let him doe it of
simplicity,</hi> that is, out of
meere compassion, not out
of any by and sinister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
For <hi>if I feed the poore
with all my goods, and want
loue, it profiteth me nothing,</hi>
1 Cor. 13. The reason is,
because the Lord lookes
more at the affection than
the action. Whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
not giuing out of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heart, sympathizing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:242:65"/>
and fellow-feeling their
brethrens misery, lose both
their gift and reward.
What comfort or helpe is
in that worke of mercy,
which is wrung out by
importunity, or by
strength of law, or for
shame lest a man should
be noted, or by terrour of
conscience, when a man
would heale the gripes of a
galling aud accusing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
by giuing away at
his death a little ill-gotten
goods to the poore, which
were none of his to giue
but to the right owners:
or when out of desire of
praise, or out of superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when a man knowes
not else what to doe with
his wealth, but some must
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:242:65"/>
haue it? if out of any of
these respects, all is lost.</p>

things. The Master that
sent his seruants into the
vineyard, sent them in to
worke. Doe wee thinke
that God sent man into the
world to play and sport,
for his recreation sake or
idlenesse, yea, or to eat and
drinke, and onely to get
what to maintain himselfe
by? No, but for some
thing beyond all these: else
his end were not beyond
the bruit beasts. Or can
we thinke that God hath
giuen men gifts of reason,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:242:77"/>
vnderstanding, iudgement,
and meanes of nature and
grace, for the culture of
all these, only to enioy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

No, but the Master gaue

the rule of wisedome
requires that the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
action be done first
and most: Eccles. 9. 10.
<hi>Whatsoeuer thy hand shall
finde to doe, doe it with all thy
might.</hi> Nothing in the
world is so necessary, as to
repent vs of sinne past, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:242:78"/>
the reason for it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time, <hi>to day.</hi> Nothing
so necessary as amendment
of life for time to come:
therefore doe it now: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
in all things are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
in this, often dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And this most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               </note> Well said <hi>Augustine,</hi>
He must needs faile in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,

can men answer the wasting
of their liues and time in
pleasures, recreation, ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting,
drinking, buying, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and sieldome finde in
their hands the businesse
which tends vnto eternall
life? A good rule therefore
it is, often to examine our
selues thus? What am I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:242:79"/>
doing? and whether in all
inferiour things doe I aime
at the chiefe? In eating I
must not forget the bread
of life. In recreation and
pleasure, I must chiefely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the pleasures of Gods
house. In buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
I must specially helpe
forward my purchase of
eternall life. In my earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the calling of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Sabbath-breaking, or
going to witches: Life is
not so necessary as without

which is good. In spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things, to preach the
word is so necessary, as <hi>Paul</hi>
cries <hi>woe</hi> vnto himselfe if
if he doe not,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> because the

with heretikes,
and blending truth with

but leaue the care of the
Church to God, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

vnlesse for peace sake hee

hee left the place, because
he must not doe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:242:81"/>
meanes. Neuer let any
thinke to thriue, by meanes
which God hath accursed,
and vpon which himselfe
cannot pray for a blessing.</p>
            <p>All necessary actions
must bee done according
to the order of the Tables,<note place="margin">5. For the order of the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note>
euer esteeming the duties
of the first Table,<note place="margin">Duties of the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble must be done first.</note> more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
then they of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
This is Christs owne
rule, Mat. 22. 38. <hi>This is the
first and great commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the second is like to
this,</hi> both in respect of the
necessary binding, and of
the end: for euen these are
a worship of God, if they
be performed in faith, and
for his commandement
sake. Wherefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> else did
the Lord deliuer two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:242:82"/>
whereas hee might
haue put all into one, but
that he would preferre and
claime the first place to
duties that immediately
concerne his worshippe?
From whence Diuines ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that rule of Antinomy
and truth, That when the
two Tables are opposed,
and both call for necessary
duties, which both cannot
be done at the same time,
the second Table must giue
place to the first: as Act. 5.
25. <hi>It is meet to obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then man.</hi> Magistrates
must be obeied; but the
first Table derogates from
the second, when both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be obserued. So in the
New Testament, Parents
and friends are to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:242:82"/>
but if they be not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for <hi>Christ,</hi> when both
cannot be loued together,
one cannot be Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>But here be three caue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats:
<note place="margin">Three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueats.</note> 1. That a speciall
Commandement is more
necessary, and dispenseth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
with all the ten: and it is
a principle, that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
runne with one excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>If God command not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
Thou shalt not kill,
nor steale,</hi> vnlesse God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his
sonne, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> to
rob the <hi>Aegyptians. Thou
shalt make no grauen image,</hi>
vnlesse God command <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to make a brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Thus obseruations
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:242:83"/>
of immediate commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
giue all Soueraignty
to God, who is to be simply
obeyed and acknowledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
aboue his Law. 2. Morall
duties must take place of
all ceremonies: The rule
of Diuines is, that charity
dispenseth with ceremony,
according to that,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I will
haue mercy and not sacrifice,</hi>
because mercy is morall,
and sacrifice ceremoniall.
So <hi>Abimelech</hi> gaue <hi>Dauid</hi>
the Shewbread which was
not lawfull but in the case
of necessary mercy. And
it was superstition in the
Iewes, that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffer their City to be

(wee say) hath no
law, but that is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in mans lawes,
when some sudden case fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out, so as the inferiour
cannot haue recourse to
the law-maker, that then
hee may interpret the law
himselfe, and breake the
letter of it, to follow the
reason and intent of it: as
in case of the murder of a
theefe. But in the law of
God, one onely case doth
dispense with it, and that
is when necessity so altreth
a fact, as it taketh away
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:242:84"/>
from it all reason of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
As for example; It
is not lawfull to marry
ones sister, but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
necessity altered this
fact, and gaue dispensation.
So it is not lawfull to take
away that which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but extreme necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
makes it lawful, because
it is not anothers any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
seeing the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe maketh some
things common in such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
necessity. On the
Sabbath we must hold our
selues strictly to Gods
worship, but if an house
be on fire, wee may leaue
it without sinne. Note the
equity of that law, Deut.

partly their friends, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Country, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God. But the Scripture
speakes more plainly, that
wee owe all our selues to
God: something indeed
we owe to our neighbour,

wee must hold our selues
bound to doe them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
follow. Two things
commonly hinder vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:242:85"/>
which wee must arme
our selues against: The first
is feare of mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
faces, offence, and
censures; but wee must
tread this vnder foot, if we
haue a commandement and
calling to doe any thing, as
<hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 Cor. 4. 3. <hi>I passe
little to be iudged of any man:</hi>
neither feared he any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
or trouble, so he
might finish his course
with ioy. <hi>Ieremy</hi> must make
his browe of brasse, to
speake the word of the
Lord, chap. 1. vers. 17. A
Christian must prepare to
passe through good report,
and bad report, and to
count neither liberty nor
life deare vnto him.<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi>
would open his window,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:242:86"/>
and pray as hee was wont,
euen when his life was
sought after. Secondly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
of actions doe often
and much trouble vs: for
remedy whereof obserue
two rules: 1. That of the
Wise-man, Eccles. 11. 4.
<hi>He that obserues the wind, shal
not sowe:</hi> it is a foolish hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
who for sight of
a cloud either his seed time
or haruest: So for sowing
workes of mercie, he that
sticks in doubts, and saith,
I may bee poore, or old,
long diseased, full of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or persecuted for the
Gospell, and must prouide
for one, neglects his seed
time by looking at winds
and clouds. So many a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Gospeller saith, If I
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:242:86"/>
should goe so often to
Church as some, and be so
forward in religion, I shold
lose much profit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
much rebukes and
reproches. Therfore, 2. we
must learne to leaue euents
and successes to God: for
it is not in man to direct
his steps, <hi>God</hi> disposeth as
he pleaseth. The Saints of
<hi>God</hi> are often frustrate of
their godly purposes, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> in purposing and
preparing to build an
house for the Lord: but
1. they lose nothing if they
doe their duty: 2. <hi>Gods</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ruling

all to the best: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there let them rest.</p>

            <p>A Great part of mans

of naturall and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

themselues are neither
good nor euill, but as they

common and ordinary, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinnes creep into them,
because we take our selues

Doth my apparell tend to
pride vp and aduance my

14. 26. <hi>Let all things be done

               <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
and his fellowes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:242:91"/>
and their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement:
but it was not
frowardnesse in them, nor
disobedience to the King,
but conscience and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a case offensiue to
themselues and others: so
they would not doe the
least euill for the greatest
good. So, is this garment
lawfull to mee, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
to other of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
Then haue I no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

lawfull to mee, and

I must auoid oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

            </p>
            <p>Now as we must be farre

How may that be? <hi>Answ.</hi>
When in the ciuill vse of
them we adde some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
meditation, as Christ
when hee spake of bread,
stirred the people to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on and labour for the
food that abideth to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life: so in eating and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:242:92"/>
drinking we should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
thinke of feeding on
Christ, the true bread and
water of life; in putting
on our clothes, of putting
on Christ as a garment: in
putting them off, of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the old man and
the lusts thereof: in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
of the contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Christ and the

               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:242:92"/>
and this is, 1. When wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
vse them as helps, not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
to our calling, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or speciall, but our
hearts are kept by them in
a fitnesse vnto both. This
is our Sauiours rule, Luk.
21. 34. <hi>Take heed that your
hearts bee not oppressed with
surfetting or drunkennesse, or
the cares of this life, that that
day come vnawares.</hi> 2. When
we exceed not in them our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
ability and degree, but
square our selues to the
most sober of our age and
condition: the neglect of
which rule makes the feast
of churlish <hi>Nabal, like the
feast of a King,</hi> and <hi>brings
soft apparell out of Kings
houses</hi> into very cottages,
to the great confusion of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:242:93"/>
all degrees, so as euery
man is out of order; the

his Master or Mistris,
Schollers arrayed in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely

the Gentleman like a
Noble-man, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
like a Courtier, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Degree many degrees
beyond it selfe. 3. When
wee hold them indifferent
not in our iudgement one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but also in affection,
keeping the command of
these, and bee sure they
command not vs: 1 Cor.
6 12. <hi>All things are lawfull
for me,</hi> but I will not bee
<hi>brought vnder the power of

30. <hi>Wee must reioyce in the
creature as not reioycing; vse
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:242:93"/>
it as not vsing; buy, sell, and
haue a wife as not hauing.</hi>
This is to affect indifferent
things indifferently. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereunto is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
desire and vse of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
creature, which makes
our seruants our masters,
and puts vs out of possession
of them, that we may be
possessed by them, as when
riches haue our hearts, and
wee haue not power to
command them to any
good vse; the heathen dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
this slauery, <hi>My
riches are mine</hi> (said <hi>Seneca)
not I my riches:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuitiae meae sunt, non ego di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitiarum. <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> would God
Christians would say so
much, to whom grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
better things. So when
a man or woman haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaued
themselues to any
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:242:94"/>
creature, and made it a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and commander, as
insatiable drunkards, who
can no more bee without
strong drink or wine, than
the fish without water, or
themselues without ayre:
The Mule (they say) must
haue the bag hang by his
mouth, and these must
haue the bottle or pot at
their elbow continually.
Others that so addict
themselues to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
weed Tobacco,
aboue all reason, set more
thoughts vpon it than they
bestow vpon God, bestow
more time on it by tenne
parts in one day than vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods seruice, yea,
than vpon any profitable
calling; bestow more
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:242:94"/>
charge vpon it then vpon
all pious and charitable v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
through the yeere; yea
serue it as their <hi>God</hi> night
and day, and all to turne
their bodies into chimnies,
their blood into foot, their
best and radicall humour
into smoake. This is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
and sinfull vse of
a creature, in it selfe good,
if physically vsed: for we
condemne not drinke,
when we condemne drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
but the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vse of it. Neither can
these dry drunkards more
iustifie their sinne then the
moist, nay farre lesse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the one is ordained for
common vse, so is not the
other. But without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them together, it is a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:242:95"/>
great sinne to be a slaue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to a pot or to a pipe.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> 5. In all indifferent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Women must be conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to spend as little

and trimming themselues;
for time is better then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.
Neither for wealth

to be counted dicers

infamous names, and such
persons were banished out
of the heathens Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:

that commonly all other

but a Christian
must consider, 1. That he
eats and drinks before the

must become the presence
of God, who heareth and
expecteth that all the

the speeches of Christians
ought to sauour of sobriety

               <note place="margin">8. Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 4. things.</note> in our eating
and drinking wee must be
carefull to season our harts
with these and the like
meditations: 1. How
prone we are to know im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
ioy, and prouoke
God in our feasts: <hi>Iob</hi> was
suspitious of his sonnes,
sent to them to sanctifie
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:242:101"/>
themselues, and afterward
himselfe sacrificed for
them. 2. That wee shall
not want incitements or
prouocations of such as
are inuited with vs, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to forget our
selues, which incitements
wee must watch against,
and arme our selues afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.
I remember the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inuited to a place
where a notable harlot was
to be present, asked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of <hi>Menedemus</hi> what
he should doe: hee bade
him onely remember that
hee was a Kings sonne.
Good men may be inuited
where none of the best
may meet them; the best
counsell is, to keep in mind
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:242:102"/>
that they be Kings sonnes,
Gods children; and a base
thing it were to be allured
from their profession, by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the vngodly. 3. To consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in our eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our owne end, and
mingle our feasting with a
meditation of death; as
<hi>Ioseph</hi> had his tombe in his
garden, to season his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meditation of
his end. Alas, this feeding
and feasting is but a little
repaire of a ruinous house
which must goe downe.
The Egyptians had a ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton
or carkasse brought
into their feasts to the same
purpose: So doe thou, set
thine owne carkasse before
the eye of thy mind, and it
will moderate thee in the

how many poore

It is a great sin
of great men, to <hi>drinke wine
in boles, and eat the fat, and to

Amos 6. 6. Therfore, Neh.
8. 10. <hi>Eat the fat, and drinke

Who am I to bee so full,

That I should abound when
so many want? How am I

2. Sinfull things are not to

1. To make a man drunke,
or sweare, or to laugh at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
such persons: for this is a
matter of sorrow to see
Gods image so defaced:
and <hi>Dauids</hi> eyes gushed

3. Mixt dancing of men

read of in Scripture
with approbation, and
here in our text noted to
be the fruit of idolatry, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
drinking, and all other
dissolute, behauior. Would
God, the root, and tree, and
all branches laden with

themselues condemned it:
It was an ordinary speech

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:242:104"/>
and the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Councels make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this wicked and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciuious
practice. <hi>Basil</hi> in
a Sermon of his concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

God made our knees not

Angeli.</hi> Therefore let the
Sonnes of light detest such
an vnfruitfull worke of
darkenesse: for what is
there here but lust of the
flesh, and lust of the eyes?
what is here else, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
fire in the bosome,
and walking vpon coles;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:242:105"/>
and how can a man auoid
burning? This practice
agrees neither with the
grauity of the man, nor the
shamefastnesse of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
nay, the very sight
of it in a woman, is known
more to ouerwhelme a
man than strong drinke, as
we may see in <hi>Herod,</hi> Mar.
6. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Vnlawfull games are
such as the lawes of the
land make vnlawful, which
binde the conscience in
things indifferent: now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vnlawful games, the
lawes reckon dicing, and
so doth the law of God,
because it hath no <hi>good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
in it, no prayse, no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
Phil. 4. 8. and then it
cannot be indifferent. And
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:242:105"/>
the like may be said of all
those playes, the ground of
which is lot, seeing a lot is
an oracle and declaration
of Gods will, a part of his
Name, more solemne than
any oath, and must not bee
vainly vsed, or for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Obiect.</hi> It is no lot, we
vse it for no such end. <hi>Ans.</hi>
That is no matter; the
Iewes cast lots for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours
garments, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of lots remained,
though the good end was
neglected. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Gods
prouidence ouer-rules all
other games. <hi>Answ.</hi> In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawfull games that
depend vpon wit, strength,
or skill, our owne infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or want of skill, may
bee blamed in all imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:242:106"/>
but here, because
the ground is a lot, wherin
we haue no cunning, (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
by cogging and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which very roysters
condemne) nothing can be
accused but Gods immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
direction: let men
consider whom they disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
when they say, What
lucke, what chance is this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyranus</hi> in his <hi>praeceptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
by nine reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the vnlawfulnesse of
playing with dice. The
heathens themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
it euen in their
Princes; as <hi>Suet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nius</hi> in the
life of <hi>Augustus</hi> reports,
that it was his greatest ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
that hee was at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to play at dice. <hi>Chilo</hi>
being sent from the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:242:106"/>
to <hi>Corinth,</hi> vpon
an Embassage, and finding
the Senators of that City
at cards and dice, would
performe no part of his
message, saying, he would
not so much dishonour the
<hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> as that they
should either make or
meddle with such persons.
Were such games infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
among lieathens?
how vnworthy then are
they among Christians.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as sports and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
playes must be indifferent
in their nature, so also in
their vse; and that is when
we confine our selues to
the lawful manner of vsing
them.</p>
            <p>1. The persons must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
haue two qualities: 1. they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:242:107"/>
must be pure: for <hi>to the
pure all things are pure,</hi> and
to none else:<note place="margin">2. The manner.</note> secondly,
they must be wearie, and
need refreshing: for God
alloweth not the most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sports, till the body
and mind stand in need; till
then wee must be busie in
better things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. All sports must bee
sanctified by the word and
prayer, 1 Tim. 4. prayer
before, and thanksgiuing
after: because wee are in
more danger to forget our
selues herein, than in any
thing else; in that we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
our selues from our
ordinary businesse, and
thinke wee may take more
liberty than vsuall. A
strange lesson to gamesters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:242:107"/>
3. All sports must bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
ioyned with the feare of
God: <hi>Reioyce with trembling,</hi>
which suffers not a man to
powre out himselfe to
pleasure.</p>
            <p>4. All must bee ioyned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
with moderation agreeing
to the time, person, and
place. A man must not be
a <hi>louer of pleasure,</hi> set vpon
sport, as some, who are
giuen ouer to sport, neuer
wearie, all the weeke long
is too little. The Apostle
commands, <hi>to reioyce, as
not reioycing:</hi> that is, to be
so moderate and retired, as
not to ouer-value sports,
nor to set our affections on
them, as those who haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things to doe. So ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
due circumstances:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:242:108"/>
Some at cards and dice
turne night into day, and
sit vp all night and day,
longer than they could for
ten times more money be
bound to any good busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Some wickedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
on time allotted to
Gods seruice, some part
of the Sabbath day, and
other times: some keepe
from Church, and some
runne from Church with
their games in their
mouthes: others bestow
vpon them too much time
which should be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the calling, either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or particular, and so
much indammage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
thereby. The mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
rifle is good to bee set
to his sythe, when it is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:242:108"/>
blunt; but if hee doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but whet still, hee
spoyles his sythe, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his worke. Therefore
let vs moderate our selues
in our sports, according to
the most sober of our age,
degree, condition, and
sort of life, and vse them
with such as are both god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wise, who may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
watch ouer vs that we
offend not, rather than
draw and prouoke vs so to
doe.</p>
            <p>5. Wee must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
any vertue or good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
thing with our delight and
sport: (as before we noted)
because euery thing that is
good, euen the least, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any indifferent
thing: and therfore, 1. We
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:242:109"/>
must not by sports hinder
our callings, but fit our
selues to them: 2. We may
not clogge our selues with
them, because they ought
to speed our way in our
spirituall course and race.
Take heed they become
not the deuils bird-lime,
in which while we wallow,
we are disabled to mount
aloft in heauenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
3. We may not lose
our patience, our meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
our loue, as they
that scorne, quarrel, storm,
and rage like heathens, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

persons, or a companion of
them, or by obscene, scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous;

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Now wee come to the
right ends, which in our
sports wee must set before
vs,<note place="margin">3. The right ends of sports.</note> if we would not sinne.</p>
            <p>1. The end of sports must
not bee to passe the time,<note place="margin">1. Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note>
which wee ought to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme,</hi>
and not let passe
without gaining some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it better than it
selfe. Nor to maintaine
idlenesse, as men that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
else tell what to doe
with themselues; for this
is as ill as idlenesse: for i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenesse
is not onely not
working, but a doing of
trifles, and that which we
dare not bring into our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to God. A pittifull
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:242:110"/>
thing, that Christians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so much to doe, and
so much meanes, and so
many cals to their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
should find nothing
so fit as cards and dice.</p>
            <p>2. The end of our sports
must not bee to purchase
our neighbours money, or
to helpe our selues by his
hinderance. And I would
know, by what right of
Gods word I can hold my
neighbours money, which
comes into my hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
labour, loue, gift, or
iust contract. If it bee not
mine by iustice distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
or commutatiue, it
cannot bee mine by God:
But no law of God or man,
hath ranked wagers in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
nay, the ciuill law
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:242:111"/>
compels none to pay that
which is lost; or if he haue
paid, hee may recouer it
within fifty houres.</p>
            <p>But the right ends of
sports are these:<note place="margin">2. Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> 1. Gods
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> glory: nothing can bee
lawfull wherein some glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is not wonne to God, <hi>in
whatsoeuer wee doe,</hi> 1 Cor.
10. 31. And therefore such
sports as doe not inable vs
to cheerefulnesse in the
duties of religion and
Christianity, faile in this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> end. 2. All our earthly
ioyes must helpe forward
our spirituall ioy in God,
and the eternall ioyes of
his Kingdome: if they
come in comparison with
them, or will step vp to
hinder vs therein, they are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:242:111"/>
to bee contemned. Our
chiefe ioy must euer bee
placed <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and our
chiefe affections must bee
reserued for that fulnesse
of ioy which is at Gods
right hand. <hi>First seeke the
kingdome of God,</hi> euen in
these, and aboue these:
how doth hee so, who
spends more time in these
than in that; yea, more by
a thousand degrees, if wee
would measure the time
of his sports, by the time
of godly desires, &amp; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duties? 3. The preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of our own health,
&amp; not to impair the health
of our soules or bodies,
as many by their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to play destroy their
health, and call numbers of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:242:112"/>
diseases vpon themselues,
and oftentimes vntimely
death. In this vse alone can
all recreations become
good and comfortable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, although our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature is loth to be so
confined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> If onely these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,

Onely these, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

and yet wee disallow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which Gods word
alloweth, which ought to

1 Peter 3. 3. 1 Tim. 2. 9.
<hi>Answ.</hi> They are: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
simply condemneth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:242:119"/>
not the things themselues,
which are the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

sparingly, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,

bee for great, not for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

affected the adorning of

to which the Apostle in

put down by the heathens,
but retained the former
manner of adorning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
4. Hee condemnes
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:242:120"/>
their end in wearing these
things, which was to set
forth their bodies, and
pride vp themselues with
their ornaments; whereas
all ornaments must be vsed

must not commit
himselfe to euery one that
seemeth good by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christ, Ioh. 2. 24.
For, 1. Much hypocrisie
lieth at the root of mens

many to transforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and make religion
and good words a cloake
for their own ends: 3. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

they speake faire to thee,</hi> Ier.
12. 6. He that eateth bread

he that dips his finger in

he lift vp his heele against
me: and Christ saith, <hi>A

saith, An vnfaithfull man is

himselfe to some that
are said to beleeue in his

was in man.</hi> Many friends
are like deepe ponds, cleare

Now if a man must

how carelesse are men of

Did not Christ and
his followers so? This rule
is opposite to that worldly
wisedome, to swim with
the streame, and to doe as
the most doe, to auoid the
note of singularity. But
here, as in all the course of
godlinesse, 1. Wee must
<hi>become fooles, that we may be
wise:</hi> 2. We must not auoid
mens euill speaking, by
running with them into
the same excesse of riot:
3. Wee must not take the
example of many &amp; great

and Phil. 3. 17. <hi>Be yee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

            <p>5. Christianity enioynes
loue vnto all,<note place="margin">Loue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans person, no mans sin,</note> euen the

must hate, their persons we
must loue; by which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
all men haue place in

            <p>6. Religion requires
curtesie as well as piety,<note place="margin">Ioyne with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note>

to lowre vpon them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord obserues what

These are the last times in

               <hi>First,</hi> to consider one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

            </p>
            <p>1. Consider how in our
company we are especially
to watch, seeing in no part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of our life we are sooner
corrupted then in that, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in no part of our life
wee doe so much discouer
our selues, and seeing in no
part thereof, we doe either
more good or more harme
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:242:138"/>
seeing wee doe nothing
without witnesse, &amp; should
doe nothing which wee
would not haue exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plary.</p>
            <p>2. As Sathan laies snares
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> euery where, so also in our
company one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not so much to bring
the godly to such excesse
of riot, as he effecteth in
wicked societies, where is
swearing, gaming, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rayling, &amp;c. but to
make them vnfruitfull, and
keepe them from the good
they might do: and sofarre
preuaileth, as sometimes
impertinent speech, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
debate &amp; detracting
speeches arise, and the
most tolerable speech is
worldlinesse, which stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
away the heart and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:242:138"/>
the time; so as some who
intended more good to
themselues and others,
carry away hearts smiting
them, for not better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
that oportunity.</p>
            <p>3. There is apparant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
losse, when we watch not
to doe or receiue good, in
company with good men.
For godly men by reason
of their callings, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of places, seldome
meet; and when they doe,
they lose the gaine of that
time in their speciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
and if they get it not
vp in the furtherance of the
generall calling of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
it is vtterly lost. And
what but this makes the
mindfulnesse one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sweet in their absence,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:242:139"/>
when there was reaped so
good fruit one of another
in their presence?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. By this wise and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
carriage of company
and meetings of good
men, Christians shall stop
the mouthes of such as are
euer complaining of, and
accusing Christian mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to be scarce to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpose, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
defame, slander, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
to strengthen one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in faction, and the
like. Or if such mouthes
will not bee shut, yet the
conscience of Christians
may reioyce in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

that <hi>Ionathan</hi> defended
<hi>Dauids</hi> innocency to <hi>Saul</hi>

the danger of his own life.
<hi>Ebed-melech</hi> the blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore

And how dangerous is it
to deuise and inuent words

<hi>Dauids</hi> enemies; to belie,
or reproach them, to raise
or receiue slanders against
them? If such as stand not
for grace, shall fall, then
much more they that stand

this Apology for them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the reproaches and

earnestly would children
speake for their parents,

so should it bee here. It is

2. What shall I gaine, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

Surely I must nor only not
haue a hand against good

And so it shall

For what comfort can a

obserue these rules. First,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
grieue thou wast not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>Woe is me, that I remaine in

or opportunity of good,
that thou hast no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>with them in any of the

If they will be no

be not thou defiled by
theirs. If they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

not thou to them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinne. Thirdly, please
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> them not by yeelding to
any sinne, but giue appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
tokens of dislike.
<hi>Obiect.</hi> Why, may we not

<hi>Answ.</hi> No, but the way to

No corruption of

And beware of falling into

what need men be so strict?

            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. A great many
haue liued honestly and
well, that were neuer so
foolish and strict. I hope to

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Wee must walke

and yet if our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
exceed not theirs, we

5. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The righteousnesse of
God goes beyond all ciuill

it is inward, <hi>in spirit
and truth;</hi> it cuts off not
onely outward acts of
murder, vncleannesse, theft

and strict walking is
taken vp but by a few, and
those of the meanest: some
men of great wisedome,

it not, but scorne and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Christianity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

<hi>blacke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>because the sunne lookes

makes few enter that way.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The Apostle directly
meets with this obiection,
1 Cor. 1. 27. <hi>Not many

many wise:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>but God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
a few poore people, and
they shall call vpon his Name:</hi>
And why not many of
those? Because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so easily deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and this euill world,
which they must doe that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> will be saued. 3. Let vs not
wholly cast our eyes vpon
the examples of the world
now declining; and, as at

such as formerly haue been
set as eye-markes in the

who <hi>endeauoured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to haue a cleare consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
before God and all men,</hi>
Acts 24. 16. yea, the most
wise, noble, and learned
that euer was, the Sonne of
God, whose conuersation
was such as none could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him of sin. These are
<hi>the cloud of witnesses,</hi> which

the race set before vs,
Heb. 12. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. But what an
impossible comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement
is this, and who can beare
it? Can wee be Saints in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:242:163"/>
this world, thus to order
our selues in euery thing?
Wee are sinners, and must
be sinners, and cannot be
thus strict as you require.
Wee hope wee generally

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The scope of
this plea is, to giue ouerall,
because they cannot attain
all: which is but a false
fire, by which the deuill
discourageth many from
<hi>the narrow way,</hi> and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
looking to their owne
way. For true it is, that we
call with the Scripture for
a keeping of all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
alwayes, and
to liue with God, and walk
with him: but with Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
interpretation,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:242:163"/>
which accepteth the will,
desire, and endeuour to
walke with God in euery
thing; which cannot but
in some measure be found
in a true beleeuer, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but in Christ be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
where it is true and
hearty. Thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
interpret themselues:
1 Chr. 28. 7. <hi>If Salomon shall
endeuour to keep my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
&amp;c.</hi> Hos. 6. 3. <hi>Wee
shall endeuour to know the
Lord.</hi> What can God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
lesse, or a good heart
tender lesse than hearty

wanting to please God in
all things? 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let vs by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the straitnesse of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
consider
whence we are fallen, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:242:164"/>
see our impotency, and
confesse our failings, but
not therefore allow our
selues in any euill, or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on any sin which wee
might by this <hi>circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
auoid, or remit our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
in the respect of all
Gods Commandements.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 3. For such as thinke it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to meane wel in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
consider this, that
as no Master is pleased, if
his Steward bring him in a
generall bill of great sums
spent, wherein hee may
hide much deceit; but sets
downe no dayes accounts,
or weekes bils of parcels:
no more in the matter of
heauenly treasure, is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to hide himselfe in
generall good meanings,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:242:164"/>
but in euery particular to
auoid deceit and suspition
of it. And as it is with a
traueller in an vnknowne
way, who will not goe at
random, nor count it a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
direction to bee set
Eastward or Westward,
but he will aske euery man
of euery Towne, and take
good heed of euery marke,
to passe him from one
place to another: so in this
our passage to heauen, we
must keepe our speciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and walke with
God in euery thing, if we
wil happily passe vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4. But what need
such daily and continuall
troubling of our selues?
What was the Sabbath
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:242:165"/>
made for, but for Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice?
and wee keepe our
Church as well as any: but
for the weeke-dayes, wee
haue callings to follow, and
cannot intend such things:
and it were better if some

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Seeing the rule
by which we must walk, is
to serue God in holinesse
and righteousnesse all <hi>our
dayes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 75.</note> we haue no liberty to
part the weeke betweene
God and vs. Neither must
wee put on holinesse as an
holy-day garment, to put it
off at night: neither may
wee be lesse holy on other
daies than on the Sabbath:
howsoeuer wee must exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:242:165"/>
our holinesse in the

that day, and in the priuate

thy special and

            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 5. But this is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Ministers and cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
persons, who haue

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If all Christians
be alike subiect to sinne, al
haue need to be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alike fenced against it. If
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:242:166"/>
all haue the same enemies,
all had need stand vpon
their ground. If one mans
heart be as wicked as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
euery man had need
set a watch round about
himselfe. And if any haue
more need than other, it is
vnlearned and simple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who want such means
of helping themselues, as
learned Preachers haue.
2. As for the nouelty of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

and vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
it hinders neighbours
from sports and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

and besides, I should

lose some profits and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers,
and wrong my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
by neglecting it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is a cleane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

watcheth all occasions for

and if they be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

lookes round about him,
and so ordereth his many
businesses, as one hinder
not the other, but all may
goe forward, and so saueth
one commodity as another
be not lost or lie in hazard:
So a circumspect Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
casteth his occasions; as,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:242:170"/>

but as one hand helpes

His loue with mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

brings him not into
loue with their sinnes, and
his hatred of their sinnes,

will be sure not to disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
himselfe by his
words, but will speake to
his owne profit: So a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect

            <p>4. As a wary and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
man proues a good
husband for the world, so
circumspect Christians are
the best husbands for their
soules: such a one hath wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and will to increase
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:242:172"/>
his estate of grace by euery
thing, and thinkes himselfe
then truly rich, when hee
thriues in the best commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
He conceiues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
rich, not when hee
hath things about him to
leaue to his heirs, but when
hee hath his wealth perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in himselfe, and for
himselfe, such wealth as
he carries to heauen with
him. A circumspect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
will not winne the
whole world with the losse
of his owne soule, which is
nothing but to make his
heires happy in his owne
eternall misery. A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
Christian is not so
carefull to heape vp gold,
as good workes in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and by workes of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:242:172"/>
mercy and loue, hee makes
himself bags that wax not
old, a treasure in heauen
that can neuer faile, where
the thiefe commeth not,
nor the moth corrupteth,
Luk. 12. 33. A circumspect
Christian is not so carefull
for the soyling, tilling, and
sowing of his ground, the
mounding of his pasture,
the weeding of his field,
the pruning of his trees, the
feeding of his cattell; as in
fencing the heart against
temptation, in sowing the
seed of Gods word, in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of sinne by the roots
out of his soule; in feeding
and fostering of grace.
Here is a good husband for
himselfe: hee hath that
within himselfe that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:242:173"/>
then all without him,
and requires more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
then they all.</p>
            <p>How improuident then
are we in our generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
whiles wee take not
opportunities of good in
publike or priuate, but slip
many lessons, Sermons, and
comforts on the Sabbath,
and on weeke-dayes? and
whiles wee will not offer a
sacrifice of almes, when
God sets vp an Altar before
vs? How doe our speciall
callings eat out our care of
the generall, and are all in
ciuilities, whiles for the
thrift of grace, wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
idle and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table?
How many vaine
and vile speeches, vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
vnsauoury, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:242:173"/>
doe our corrupt hearts
send out, according to
their owne fulnesse, by
swearing, slandering, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
cursing, and the like?
How bad husbands are
men for their soules, whiles
they haue not a horse, a
pig, a sheepe, yea, scarce a
dog about their house, but
is more tended, and better
prouided for than their
soules? whiles they will
scarce let any dunghill lye
about their house, so nasty
as their soules? nor any
patch of ground so negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as their owne hearts,
that they grow like nettles
and brambles, to bee cut
vp and cast into the fire?</p>
