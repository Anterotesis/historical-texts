            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this moſt Illuſtrious PRINCE, may moſt cleerlybee diſcerned, that Gods judgements are onely knowne to himſelfe, and his thoughts and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations unſearchable: For having ſo framed and faſhioned him, as his moſt rare parts in youth gave ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preſages of his becomming to his divine Majeſty, (from whom he received them) an honour and glory, to the world a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to the people of theſe Kingdomes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94033:5"/>
an exceeding happineſſe; yet was hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſpring of his yeares, and of the hope had of him, to take him to himſelf, and to deprive the world of him, neither could of his ſhort life (ſo farre as the eyes of man could diſcerne) the reaſons grow either out of neglect, or want of performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, or of obedience to his Parents, the obſervance of which Commandement, onely hath the enlarging of time upon this earth annexed unto it: for in the firſt, it cannot bee denyed but hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly obſervant, never failing to ſacrifice unto God the firſt of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to continue in them with all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of reverence, without any diverſion or diſtraction; to cheriſh ſuch as in whom he found ability to teach, and piety to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in life the fruits of their doctrine, to reſolve ſo far to become immutable in the Religion hee profeſſed, as long before his end with ſolemne proteſtations, he vowed that he would never joine in marriage with a wife of a different faith, &amp; had beſides a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination (if longer he had lived) to have made choice of a Chapleine of his owne, a man in yeares, grave in Divinity, rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, and of great diſcretion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94033:5"/>
and wiſdome, by whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in all matters, ſpirituall and tending to the rectifying of his Soule, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have received a continuall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>Of the ſecond, to ſpeake not by hereſay, but of mine owne knowledge (howſoever ſome moaths and mice of Court in that time, not enemies to him in particular) but maligners of true vertue, and only friends to their own ambitions and deſires, to poſſeſſe the eares &amp; opinions of Princes, had in that particular traduced him: So true and ſincere he was both in profeſſion, and execution of all duties and obedience, and bare ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and filiall a reverence and reſpect to the King his Father, as although ſometimes out of his owne inclination, or the incitation and encouragement of others, hee repaired to the Court and moved the King in ſome things, either concerning the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, his own particular intereſt, or that of others; yet with the leaſt word, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or ſigne given him of his Majeſties diſallowance, hee would inſtantly deſiſt from further purſuite of it, and returne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſatisfaction in regard that hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94033:6"/>
it to be diſagreeing with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſures, or with ſuch a reſolved patience, as he neither in word nor worke gave ſo much as any ſemblance of being diſpleaſed or diſcontented: Nay, which is more, ſotruly was hee affected to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſatisfying of the King his Father in all things, as ſome good time before his death, hee made unto my ſelfe a ſolemne proteſtation, that to the end he might not in any thing <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee either diſpleaſing or give the leaſt diſtaſte unto his Majeſty, hee would from thenceforth utterly remove his thoughts from all affaires whatſoever, that ſhould not particularly concerne himſelfe, his owne eſtate, or the government of his houſhold.</p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe of that memorable Prince, I will for beare to ſpeake of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy or youngeſt yeares, (although I have heard by ſuch as did then attend him) the ſame did moſt preſage his enſuing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. My purpoſe and deſire is to deliver to hing but verities knowne to my ſelfe, not things received by tradition from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94033:6"/>
In the firſt ſpring of his yeare of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the King his father committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the diſpoſing of the Lands and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues aſſigned to him, and the government of his houſhold; for the adminiſtration whereof, his Majeſty appointed unto him certaine eſpeciall Officers; in the number of whom (my ſelfe being not long before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of Spaine, where I ſerved the King divers yeares as his Ambaſſadour) was conſtituted Treaſurer of his houſe.</p>
            <p>The place gave me occaſion continually to attend him, and the eſpeciall favour that I after found with him, not onely meanes to obſerve his actions, but to become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly acquainted with the moſt of his thoughts.</p>
            <p>My firſt ſtep into his favour and eſpeciall truſt, grew out of that which with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes would have caſt mee downe either into perpetuall diſgrace, or at leaſt into a temporary diſtaſte and diſlike, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recoverable; I ſo much admired his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious parts in ſo unripe an age, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in him ſo great a will to know, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94033:7"/>
ſo Noble and rare a diſpoſition to give eare to advertiſements, as out of the duty of my place, and extraordinary affection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, taking hold of ſome fit occaſion and opportunity, I adventured to make proofe whether he would endure advice or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement reprehenſive.</p>
            <p>Young Princes left to their owne wills, and great men that are ſet upon the higheſt ſtage of worldly greatneſſe, and lulled in the lap of fortune, doe rarely endure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving voice, eſpecially from thoſe of a lower forme.</p>
            <p>I take the occaſion from a then generall ſuppoſall, or at leaſt, ſuſpition of a little too much ſtreightneſſe of his hand in rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and of ſome errors in his actions, but did ſo tenderly tread upon thoſe grounds, and with ſo retiring a foote, as occaſioned a diſcovery from himſelfe of deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and have a full ſight of them, before I pulled off the maske wherewith I had covered them.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, I delivered them in ſubſtance plainly, but in words ſoft and reſpective,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94033:7"/>
(as to ſuch a Prince became me) Kings and Princes being to bee treated with, with words of ſilke not of iron.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, he gave anſwers ſatisfactorily.</p>
            <p>To the other, excuſively.</p>
            <p>But what were the fruits ſucceeding to his ever enduring honour, Truth enforceth me to publiſh, that I ever after in mine own particular, found my ſelfe exceedingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greated in his favour, and that thoſe few things that were erred became reformed.</p>
            <p>To this ſo rare a diſpoſition, which being by a Prince entertained, cannot but make him both ſcient of the Offices appertaining to his high eſtate, and in time alſo, as good as great, which in one borne to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, of all things is the moſt deſireable, is to be added another vertue in one of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power, as valuble, and not much leſſe neceſſary: So very cloſe hee was and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a keeper of whatſoever ſecret was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed unto him, as it was never knowne to any, that ever hee diſcovered any one word in that kinde delivered unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94033:8"/>
Apt he was to heare and deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive advertiſements and adviſes, by any in whom he deſcerned knowledge gained by learning, or abilities wonne out of time, and experience to give them, neither did he take them in <hi>Tranſitu:</hi> As in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they celebrated the Paſſeover, nor as a man receiveth his cloake to put about him, not within him; but gave both time to the deliverers to relate them, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to himſelfe to conſider and digeſt them.</p>
            <p>Counſells are to be chewed not ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would therefore unrip every ſeame of them by interrogations uſed by himſelf, and receive reaſons and reſolutions by thoſe that offered them, untill by mature debate and conſultation, (which are the true foiles that give cleerneſſe and aſſuredneſſe to counſells) he had both perfected and made them ſollid and fit for his uſe whenſoever occaſion ſhould be offered.</p>
            <p>In the government of his houſhold in yeares ſo very young, hee gave examples imitable to all other Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94033:8"/>
His family was ample, as that which conſiſted of few leſſe then five hundred, many of them young Gentlemen, borne to great fortunes, in the prime of their years when their paſſions and appetites were moſt ſtrong, and their powers and experiences to temper and ſubject them to reaſon moſt weake, his judgement, his grave and Princely aſpect, gave temper to them all, his very eye ſerved for a commandement, and more and better ſervice have I noted to be done by the very lookes of him, then by ſharpe reprehenſions of ſome other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: If any queſtions or quarrells were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongſt his ſervants, he would give a ſtoppe and ſtay to them, at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by referring them to ſome ſuch of his principall Officers, as hee thought to bee moſt ſcient in matters of that nature, and beſt did know to give juſt compenſation to the inured, and reproofe to them that ſhould be found to have offered the wrong; ſo as in ſo numerous a family there was not ſo much as any blows given, or any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of quarrell or debate betweene any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94033:9"/>
Plenty and magnificence were the things that in his houſe he eſpecially affected, but not without ſuch a temper as might agree with the rules of frugality and moderation; he cauſed to bee ſet downe in writing unto him the ſeveral heads of al his annuall char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the ordinary expence of his houſe and his ſtables, the charge of his apparrell and wardrobe, his rewards and all ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, as yearly were to bee iſſued out of his coffers, and comparing them with his annuall revenue, did ſo judiciouſly faſhion and proportion them by ſhortning what he found ſuperfluous, and encreaſing what was wanting and too ſhort in any of them, as hee reduced them to a certainty, and ſuch as his revenues would well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray, beſides a yearly ſpare of ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of pounds which hee reſerved for a ſtore or treaſure to be ready for all events and occaſions accidentall.</p>
            <p>By giving of which ſo good and ſolid foundation and order unto his ſtate, hee delivered himſelf from all neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming rigid or ſtrait to his Tenants, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any unmeaſurable improving their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94033:9"/>
Farmes or their Fines, or ſeeking or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of any their forfeitures, and became alſo unneceſſited to take the benefit that both law and right afforded unto him, of ſuch as had in time of former Princes purchaſed lands appertaining to his Dutchy of Cornewall, which could not by Law be alienated from the ſame, to whom out of his Princely bounty and gracious compaſſion, upon reſuming of them, hee gave ſome reaſonable ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The banquets and feaſts that any time he made, his deſire was, ſhould be magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and agreeing with his Princely digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet not without an eſpeciall eye and care had that nothing ſhould bee ſpent in diſorder, or the charge made greater through the want of providence, or well managing by his officers; in thoſe hee ever affected the demonſtration of a Princely greatneſſe, and that all things ſhould paſſe with decency and decorum, and without all rudeneſſe, noiſe or diſorder.</p>
            <p>In any thing either committed or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him by the King his Father, concerning the State and defence of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94033:10"/>
Kingdome, exceeding willing, ſedulous and carefull hee ever ſhewed himſelfe, to performe all offices and duties underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and with much circumſpection.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Highneſſe during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in that place, lay at Mr. <hi>Legats</hi> houſe, then Clarke of the Chequer.</note> He was once ſent by his Majeſty to take view of the Navy at Chatham, whither my ſelfe waited upon him and obſerved how great his deſire was not onely to ſee with his owne eyes every particular Ship, but to inable himſelfe by conference and conſultation with the beſt experienced of his Majeſties Officers of the Navy, in the faſhion and fabricature of the Ships, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their ſtrengths and the forme of their ſailing, to take knowledge of ſuch as were then perfited and fitted for preſent ſervice, and which defective, and in what ſeveral parts, to the end there might inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be order given for the repairing of them; he alſo very perticularly enformed himſelfe of their ſeverall equipages and furnitures, went in perſon to take an exact view of them and of his Majeſties ſtore for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and would not bee ſatisfied without underſtanding the ſpeciall uſes of every of thoſe things, and of all other that tended to make them ſerviceable and uſefull, what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94033:10"/>
further in yeares more ripe was in Navall affaires, wherein conſiſted the principall ſtrength, honour and advantage of this Kingdome, to be expected of him, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be diſcerned by his will, his diligence, his underſtanding and Princely courage, ſhewed upon occaſion of diſcourſe, delivered unto him by a ſervant of his own, concerning a Navall warre with Spaine, whenſoever that King ſhall give cauſe of a publicke hoſtility.</p>
            <p>To publiſh particulars agrees not with the rules of State, but two eſpeciall thinges being propounded, which were the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Navy, conſiſting of a certaine number of Ships to bee ſent into the Weſt Indies, and another to attend the coaſts of Spaine to prohibit all entry or iſſue of Ships either into or out of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Admirable it was in one of yeares ſo young, to heare what interrogations he uſed of every particularity of that deſigne, of the feiſibleneſſe and of the difficulties of every branch of it, how hee inſiſted upon every doubt, untill by the beſt experienced &amp; practiſed both in Sea ſervices &amp; in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94033:11"/>
with reaſons and demonſtrations he became fully ſatisfied, &amp; that done, how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly &amp; neerly he ſearched into every knot, both of the honour and utility, and of the danger &amp; charge that an attempt of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would draw with it, &amp; ceaſed not untill he underſtood every particular of the ſame, and eſpecially the yeerly charge which that whole expedition would amount unto; which having found ſo very reaſonable, and the hopes ſo great, and all doubts ſo well reſolved, to ſhew the valour of his owne heart, hee openly proteſted to ſuch as were preſent, that ſhould the King his Father bee pleaſed upon any future occaſion to breake with Spaine, himſelfe (if ſo it ſhould agree with his Majeſties pleaſure) would in perſon become the executor of that Noble attempt for the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>In perſons private it may ſuffice to bee Religious, honeſt and juſt within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>To Princes and men conſtituted in high places, it behoveth to bee alſo givers of good example to others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94033:11"/>
Inferiours and Subjects caſt their eyes more upon what Princes doe, then upon what they command, their examples with them are of more force then any Law of letters.</p>
            <p>This became to this Prince ſo great a motive, as hee thought not fit to loſe any houres of the life that upon this earth were appointed unto him, but ſo to beſtow them, as they might not onely become profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to himſelfe, but imitable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary to others</p>
            <p>He ſo diſtributed the day by dividing his houres into the ſervice of God, to the apting himſelfe to the office hee was borne unto, both in government Civill and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and to neceſſary exerciſes and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as no part of it could bee ſaid to bee in vaine beſtowed; to inable his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in government civill, he read Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the knowledge of things paſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing much to reſolution in things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, and to prevention of thoſe to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94033:12"/>
In the military, hee added thereunto the Mathematicks ſtudy of Coſmography, and had one that inſtructed him in the matter and forme of fortifications.</p>
            <p>For practice, hee uſed in a manner dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ride and manage great horſes, with which hee had his ſtables moſt excellently furniſhed, oftimes to runne at the Ring and ſometimes at Tilt, both which he ſo well and dexterouſly performed, and with ſo great a comelineſſe, as in thoſe his firſt yeares, he became ſecond to no Prince in Chriſtendome, and to many that practiſed with him much ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>His other exerciſes were dancing, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and in times of yeare fit for it learning to ſwimme, at ſometimes walking faſt and farre, to accuſtome and enable himſelfe to make a long march when time ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; but moſt of all at Tennis play, wherein, to ſpeake the truth, which in all things I eſpecially affect, hee neither obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moderation, nor what appertained to his dignity and perſon, continuing oftimes his play for the ſpace of three or foure
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94033:12"/>
houres, and the ſame in his ſhirt, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming an Artiſan then a Prince, who in things of that nature are onely to affect comelineſſe, or rather a kinde of careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſhew, to make their activities ſeeme the more naturall, then a laborious and toiling induſtry.</p>
            <p>Of this and of his diet, wherein he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much inclination to exceſſive eating of fruits, he was as in al other things content to heare advice, but in theſe two particulars not to follow it.</p>
            <p>To other play or gaming, hee ſhewed himſelf not much inclined, yet would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times play at Obeſſe at Biliors and at Cards, but ſo very Nobly and like himſelfe, as plainly ſhewed his uſe of it to bee onely for recreation, not for appetite of gaine; for whether he wonne or loſt, his countenance was ever the ſame, and for the moſt part, greater appearance of mirth in him when he was in loſſe, then when hee wonne, thereby plainly demonſtrating both his judgement in adventuring no more then what he made no regard of if he loſt it: and his Princely magnanimity and temper in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94033:13"/>
ſuffering no paſſion or alteration to take hold of him through any croſſeneſſe of Cards or chance.</p>
            <p>In ſome young Gentlemen whom he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he ſeemed to miſlike too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to play, and did not onely diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them from it, but gave unto ſome of them matter of value to become bound to leave the uſe of it; for pleaſure hee tooke them all as it were in paſſage without ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, either to deſire them, or at leaſt to have a will to dwell in them.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure of the fleſh, eſpecially which is moſt incident to young yeares, and by Princes rarely avoidable, whoſe fancies and affections, are commonly as vehement as their perſons and powers are great; and therefore moſt like to fall themſelves, and give occaſion of falling to others, although ſome in thoſe times, there were that taking meaſure of him by the yard wand of their owne unbridled appetities, were pleaſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to conceive and report of him, yet my ſelfe having beene preſent at great feaſts made in his houſe, whereunto hee invited the moſt beautifull and ſpecious Ladies of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94033:13"/>
the Court and City, could neither then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by his behaviour, his eies or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, any ſhew of ſingular or eſpeciall fancy to any, or at any other time ſuch looſeneſſe either in words or action, as whereupon in juſtice or reaſon to ground any ſuch opinion of him.</p>
            <p>But rather thus with truth and aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to determine, that were he not himſelf chaſte in his inward thoughts, yet did hee with ſo incomparable judgement and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cover them, as to juſt and judicious eies they gave no true occaſion to ſuſpect him.</p>
            <p>It is true, that to take a wife though hee ſhewed no vehement deſire, yet he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated a good inclination.</p>
            <p>Marriages were propounded and offered for him in Spaine, in the time that my ſelfe there ſerved, who had from the King his Father commiſſion to treate it, but finding that the overture there, grew rather out of a deſire to winne time to advance their owne deſignes, then with true intention to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, in regard of the difference of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I for my part gave end to that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94033:14"/>
negotiation in a manner ſo ſoone as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it.</p>
            <p>After my returne from thence and entry into his Highneſſe ſervice, like motions were made both by Florence and Savoy: But thoſe not conforming with what in alliances with Princes of his greatneſſe, either in encreaſe or equality of Honour or Utility, or for ſtrength and ſurety of eſtate was eſpecially to be regarded.</p>
            <p>That of Spaine was upon a new over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made by the Ambaſſadour of the King there, againe entertained and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Majeſty here, to be treated of by his Ambaſſadour, who in that Court ſucceeded me.</p>
            <p>But after ſome protractions uſed there, it was upon the firſt opening, found to have come too late, that Princeſſe for whom the Treaty was intended, being the eldeſt daughter of that King, and the onely who in yeares was fit for him, being formerly promiſed to the French King that now is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94033:14"/>
Laſtly, there grew a propoſition for a daughter of France, wherein his Highneſſe having as in duty it became him, ſubmitted and reſerved himſelfe to the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame was not proceeded in, to any effect.</p>
            <p>In this Noble Prince was to be obſerved a ſingular integrity and cleerneſſe of thoughts; hee had a true Kingly diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo farre from being induced to piece up the skinne of the Lion, with that of the Fox, as above all things hee hated flattery and diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>A Noble man in thoſe times, in the higheſt favour with the King his Father, wrote unto him by the eſpeciall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Majeſty, a letter wherein he recommended unto him a matter of very great conſequence to bee inſtantly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto, and in his ſubſcription uſed theſe words,
<q>Yours before all the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94033:15"/>
This anſwer his Highneſſe committed unto me, who having written it, did alſo ſet down ſome words of favour to the Noble man to precede his Highneſſe Signature; the letter it ſelfe hee read, and having conſidered it, allowed it wholly without alteration.</p>
            <p>Onely in regard of the words of ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, notwithſtanding the great haſte that he made of the diſpatch, hee commanded me, it ſhould be new written and thoſe left out, and notwithſtanding all the reaſons that I uſed to the contrary, would by no meanes bee perſwaded to ſuffer it ſo to paſſe, ſaying, that he to whom he wrote had untruly and unfaithfully dealt with him, and that his hand ſhould never affirme that his heart thought not.</p>
            <p>This Prince as he was no coverer of his thoughts where he had juſt cauſe of diſlike, ſo would he alſo to thoſe he truſted, hee acknowne of his love to ſuch as hee affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94033:15"/>
Of the titular Nobility of this Kingdome upon occaſion offered, he would expreſſe himſelfe beſt to love and eſteeme ſuch as were moſt anciently deſcended, and moſt nobly and honeſtly diſpoſed, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo he would not forbeare by name to particulate.</p>
            <p>His Highneſſe brother our now So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne then Duke of Yorke, and his ſiſter ſince that time Queene of Bohemia he entirely loved; yet muſt I confeſſe at ſometimes by a kinde of rough play and dalliance with the one, and a ſemblance of contradicting the other, in what he deſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her to deſire, he tooke a pleaſure in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both to the one and the other, ſome cauſe in thoſe their ſo tender yeares to make proofe of their patiences.</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth, ſuch were both thoſe excellent Princes, their owne rare parts and moſt ſweet diſpoſitions, as had there beene none other attractive of bloud or nature would to them have enforced his love and beſt affection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94033:16"/>
He gave alſo in the adminiſtration &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his own particular eſtate, much preſage of what hee would have become if he had lived to poſſeſſe the Diademe.</p>
            <p>At ſuch times as hee attended the King his father to houſes of remove, or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, hee would not endure that carriages or proviſions, ſhould bee taken for him without full contentment given to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>In removes to his owne houſes in like manner.</p>
            <p>Nay ſo carefull he was that none by him, or any of his traine ſhould bee either preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced or annoyed; as whenſoever he went a hawking, before harveſt ended, he would take care that none ſhould paſſe through the corne, and to give them example, would himſelfe ride rather a furlong about, truly and judiciouſly conceiving that to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there is no ſurer fortreſſe then that of hearts, and that thoſe once had and ſetled, the reſt of what they poſſeſſe is at their commandment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94033:16"/>
Of his diſpoſition to juſtice, hee gave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon all occaſions much proofe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
            <p>Hee would never either condemne or cenſure any man unheard or undefended, retaining in his memory that notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample given to Princes by God himſelfe, whoſe divine knowledge both of workes and thoughts, needing no informers; yet after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, would neither cenſure him nor his <hi>Eve</hi> without hearing what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them could ſay in their own defence.</p>
            <p>This I could demonſtrate by divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as alſo of his being miſericordious after offence acknowledged, ſhould not a long diſcourſe ſeem unproportionable to ſo ſhort a life.</p>
            <p>It is true, that he was of an high minde, and knew well how to keepe his diſtance, which indeed he did to all, neither admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a neere or full approach either to his power or his ſecrets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94033:17"/>
Hee oftimes proteſted that neither fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie nor flattery ſhould move him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon any a ſuperlative place in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but would to the uttermoſt of his underſtanding, meaſure unto all according to the merit of their ſervices, as holding it not juſt to yeeld unto affections, or rather ſecond reſpects, that which is onely due to vertue and deſervings.</p>
            <p>That remunerative hee was of ſervices, and conſiderative of thoſe that deſerved and and needed.</p>
            <p>A moſt memorable and imitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hee gave before his death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to divers of his ſervants, who longeſt had ſerved, and in whom hee noted want, given by ſeverall Patents ſent unto them, Penſions during life, to the value of eleven or twelve hundred pounds by yeare, and that without all mediation and intreaty by others, and at a time when themſelves did leaſt expect it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94033:17"/>
To conclude of this Prince, did hee not all thinges well? The fault is rather to bee imputed to thoſe that in yeares ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe, by their advice ſhould have aſſiſted him and lined out his wayes, then to any want of will or Religious and Princely diſpoſition in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>He was of a comely perſonage, of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtature, well and ſtreight limmed, and ſtrongly proportioned, his countenance and aſpect inclining in thoſe his young yeares to gravity and ſhew of Majeſty.</p>
            <p>His judgement ſo farre beyond what his age could promiſe, as it was truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.</p>
            <p>His ſpeech ſlow and ſomewhat impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, rather as I conceive, by cuſtome and a long imitation of ſome that did firſt inſtruct him, then by any defect in nature, as appeared by much amendment of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94033:18"/>
After that he had beene adviſed to a more often exerciſe of it, by uſing at home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his owne ſervants, firſt ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and after longer as he ſhould finde himſelfe inabled.</p>
            <p>Yet would he oftimes ſay of himſelfe that he had the moſt unſerviceable tongue of any man living.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter part of his time, ſo well became forraine Princes by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours informed of his rare parts, as the adverſe to this Kingdome beganne to feare and redoubt him, and the well affected and confederated to love and entertaine great hopes of him.</p>
            <p>But God ſeeing it good to beſtow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crowne upon him, excelling all that on earth was to be had or hoped.</p>
            <p>After ſome five dayes ſickneſſe endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with patience, and as often recognition of his faith, his hopes and his appeales to Gods mercy, as his infirmity which affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94033:18"/>
him altogether in his head would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly permit.</p>
            <p>He yeelded up the Ghoſt at Saint <hi>Iames</hi> next Weſtminſter, and was interred at Weſtminſter, where his body now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</p>
