            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the preceding verses the Apostle had been wading through the great Doctrines of Justification and Adoption; My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries so arduous and profound, that without the help and conduct of the Spirit, he might soon have waded beyond his depth. In this verse the Apostle toucheth upon that pleasant string of Consolation; <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God.</hi> Not a word but is weighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore I shall gather up every filing of this Gold, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be lost.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The glorious Priviledge; wherein there are two things considerable: 1. The certainty of the Priviledge, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A Christian may come not onely to a loose opinion, but to a certainty of what he holds. As the Axiomes in Logick, and Aphorismes in Physick, are demonstrated to Reason; so the Truths in Religion are demonstrated to Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106271:24"/>
Temptations, there are three things to be considered:
<list>
                     <item>1. His Method in tempting.</item>
                     <item>2. The Extent of his Power.</item>
                     <item>3. That these Temptations work for good.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Satans Method in tempting: Here, take notice of two things. 1. His <hi>Violence</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> tempting, and so he is the <hi>Red Dragon:</hi> He labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to storm the Castle of the heart, he throws in thoughts of blasphemy, he tempts to deny God; these are the <hi>fiery Darts</hi> he shoots, whereby he would enflame the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>Subtilty</hi> in tempting, and so he is the <hi>Old Serpent.</hi> There are five chief subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Devil useth. 1. He observes the temper and constitution; he layes suitable baits of temptation. As the Husbandman knows what Grain is proper for the Soyl, Satan will not tempt contrary to the natural disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temperament: This is his Policy, he makes the Wind and Tyde go together: That way the natural Tyde of the heart runs, that way the Wind of temptation blows. Though the Devil cannot know mens <hi>thoughts,</hi> yet he knows their <hi>temper,</hi> and accordingly he lays his baits: —<hi>Omnium discutit more</hi> — He tempts the ambitious man with a Crown, the sanguine man with beauty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan observes the fittest time to temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106271:25"/>
in: As a cunning Angler casts in his Angle when the Fish will bite best. Satans time of tempting is usually after an Ordinance; and the reason is, because <hi>then</hi> he thinks he shall find us most secure. When we have been at solemn Duties, we are apt to think all is done, and we grow remiss, and leave off that zeal and strictness as before; just as a Souldier, who after a Battel leaves off his Armou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, not once dreaming of an enemy: Now Satan watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his time, and when we least suspect, then he throws in a tentation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He makes use of near Relations; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil tempts by a proxy: Thus he handed over a temptation to <hi>Iob</hi> by his Wife, <hi>Iob</hi> 2.9. <hi>Dost thou still retain thy integrity?</hi> A Wife in the bosom may be the Devils instrument to tempt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Satan tempts to evil by them that are good; thus he gives poyson in a golden Cup: He tempted Christ by <hi>Peter; Peter</hi> disswades him from suffering; <hi>Master, pity thy self.</hi> Who would have thought to have found the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the mouth of an Apostle?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Satan tempts to sin, under a pretence of Religion. He is most to be feared when <hi>he transforms himself into an Angel of Light.</hi> He came to Christ with Scripture in his mouth; <hi>It is written.</hi> The Devil baits his hook with Religion; he tempts many a man to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106271:25"/>
and Extortion, under a pretence of providing for his Family; he tempts some to make away themselves, that they may live no longer to sin against God; and so he draws them into sin, under a pretence of avoyding sin. These are his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and subtil stratagems in tempting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Extent of his Power; how far Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans power in tempting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eacheth. 1. He can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> propose the Object; as he set a wedge of Gold before <hi>Achan.</hi> 2. He can poyson the Phansie, and instill evil thoughts into the mind: As the Holy Ghost doth cast in good motions, so the Devil doth bad; he put it into <hi>Iudas</hi> his heart to betray Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.2.—</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satan can excite and irritate the corruption within, and work some kind of inclinableness in the heart to embrace a temptation. Though it is true, Satan cannot force the Will to yield consent, yet he being an earnest Suitor, by his continual solicitation may provoke to evil. Thus he provoked <hi>David</hi> to number the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1.—The Devil may by his subtil Arguments dispute us into sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That these temptations work for good to the children of God. A Tree that is shaken by the wind is more settled and rooted: so the blowing of a temptation doth but settle a Christian the more in grace. Temptations work for good eight wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106271:26"/>1. Temptation sends the soul to prayer. The more furiously Satan tempts, the more fervently the Saint prayes. The Deer being shot with the Dart runs faster to the water: When Satan shoots his fiery darts at the soul, now it runs faster to the Throne of Grace. When <hi>Paul</hi> had the Messenger of Satan to buffet him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>For this I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</hi> Temptation is a Medicine for security. That which makes us pray more, works for good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Temptation to sin, is a means to keep from the perpetration of sin. The more a child of God is tempted, the more he fights against the temptation: The more Satan tempts to blasphemy, the more a Saint trembles at such thoughts, and saith, <hi>avoid Satan.</hi> When <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph's</hi> Mistriss tempted him to folly, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er her temptation was, the stronger was his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. That temptation the Devil useth as a Spur to sin, God makes it a Bridle to keep back a Christian from it. The more a chast Virgin is assaulted, the more she abhors the motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Temptation works for good, as it abates the swelling of pride: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Least I should be exalted above measure, there was given me a Thorn in the flesh, a Messenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> The Thorn in the flesh was to

                     </gap>. <hi>Chrysost.</hi>
                  </note>. Better is that temptation which humbles me, than that duty which makes me proud. Rather than a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an shall be haughty minded, God will let him fall into the Devils hands a while, to be cured of his Imposthume.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Temptation works for good, as it is a Touch-stone to try what is in the heart. The word <hi>tentare,</hi> signifies <hi>explorare.</hi> The Devil tempts that he may deceive; but God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us to be tempted to try us. 1. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is a tryal of our sincerity: It argues our heart is chast, and loyal to Christ, when we can look a temptation in the face, and turn out back upon it. 2. It is a tryal of our Courage: <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Ephraim is a silly Dove, without an heart.</hi> So it may be said of many, <hi>they are without an heart,</hi> they have no heart to resist temptation; no sooner doth Satan come, but they yield: Like a Coward, assoon as the Thief approacheth, he gives him his purse. But he is the valourous Christian, that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The courage of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was never more seen, than when they were assaulted by the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour &amp; Puissance of a Saint is never more seen, than in a Field-battel, when he is fighting with the <hi>Red-Dragon,</hi> and by the power of faith puts the Devil to flight. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which can stand in the <hi>fiery tryal,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>fiery Darts. Fidei robur potest esse concus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, non excussum</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertul.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Temptations work for good, as God makes them who are tempted, fit to comfort others in the same distresse. A Christian must himself be under the buffetings of Satan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can speak a word in <hi>due season</hi> to him that is weary. St <hi>Paul</hi> was versed in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>We are not ignorant of his Devices:</hi> and he was able to acquaint others with Satans cursed Wiles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. A man that hath rid over a place where there are Boggs and Quick-sands, is the fittest to guide others through that dangerous way. He that hath felt the claws of the roaring Lion, and hath lay'n bleeding under those wounds, is the fittest man to deal with one that is tempted. None can better discover Satans sleights and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than those who have been long in the fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing School of temptation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Temptations work for good, as they stir up paternal compassions in God to them who are tempted. The Child which is sick and bruised is most looked after. When a Saint lyes under the bruisings of temptations, Christ prays, and God the Father pities. When Satan puts the soul into a Feaver, God comes with a Cordial; which made <hi>Luther</hi> say, that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are <hi>ample <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

because he doth then most sweetly manifest himself to the soul.</p>

In regard of grace, when God suspends the influence of his Spirit, and with-holds the lively actings of grace. If the Spirit be gone, Grace freezeth into a chilness and dedolency. Or 2. A withdrawing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Comfort; when God with-holds the sweet manifestations of his favour, he doth not look with such a pleasant aspect, but vails his face, and seems to be quite gone from the soul.</p>
               <p>God is just in all his withdrawings: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before he deserts us <note n="*" place="margin">

We usually desert God first, therefore we have none to blame but our selves.</p>
               <p>Desertion is very sad; for as when the light is withdrawn, darknesse follows in the aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So when God withdraws, there is darknesse and sorrow in the soul. Desertion is <hi>an Agony of Conscience,</hi> as <hi>Alstead</hi> calls it; God holds the soul over Hell; <hi>Iob</hi> 6.9. <hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poyson whereof drinks up my spirits.</hi> It was a custom among the <hi>Persians</hi> in their wars (as <hi>Drusius</hi> notes,) to dip their Arrows in the poyson of Serpents, to make them more deadly: Thus did God shoot the poysoned Arrow of desertion into <hi>Iob,</hi> under the wounds whereof, his spirit lay bleeding. In times of desertion the people of God are apt to be dejected, they dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves, and think that God hath quite cast them off; therefore I shall prescribe some comfort to the deserted soul. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner when he hath no star to guide him, yet he hath light in his Lanthorn, which is some help to him: So when the poor soul is sailing in the dark of desertion, and wants the <hi>bright morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing star,</hi> I shall lay down four Consolations,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106271:30"/>
which are as the Mariners Lanthorn to give some light.</p>
               <p n="1">1. None but the Godly are capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. Wicked men know not what Gods love means, nor what it is to want it; they know what it is to want health, friends, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but not what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is to want Gods favour. Thou fearest thou art not Gods child, because thou art deserted, whereas none but the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are deserted. The Lord cannot be said to withdraw his love from the wicked, because they never had it. The being deserted, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth thee to be a Child of God. How couldest thou complain that God hath estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself, if thou hadst not sometimes received smiles and love-tokens from him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There may be the seed of grace, where there is not the flower of joy. The earth may want a crop of Corn, yet may have a Mine of Gold within. A Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. Desertion works for good, as it is a means to imbitter sin to us. Can there be a greater misery than to have Gods displeasure? what makes Hell but the hiding of Gods face? and what makes God hide his face, but sin? <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.13. <hi>They have taken away my Lord,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106271:31"/>
and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> So, our sins have taken away the Lord, and we know not where he is laid. The favour of God is the best Jewel; it can sweeten a prison, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting death: Oh how odious then is that sin, which robs us of our best Jewel! Sin made God desert his Temple, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.6. Sin causeth him to appear as an enemy, and dress himself in armour. This makes the soul pursue sin with an holy malice, and seek to be avenged of it. The deserted soul gives sin <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Vinegar</hi> to drink, and with the Spear of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, lets out the heart-blood of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Desertion works for good, as it works these three gracious effects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It sets the soul a weeping for the losse of God. When the Sun is gone, the dew falls; and when God is gone, tears drop from the eyes. How was <hi>Micah</hi> troubled when he had lost his gods? <hi>Iudg.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</hi> So, when God is gone, what have we more? It is not the Harp and Viol can comfort, when God is gone. Though it be sad to want Gods presence, yet it is good to lament his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Desertion sets the soul a seeking after God. When Christ was stept aside, the Spouse pursues after him, she seeks him <hi>in the streets of the City,</hi> Cant. 3.2. And a <hi>non inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106271:32"/>
being returned, she makes a hue and cry after him, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Saw ye him whom my soul loves?</hi> The deserted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul sends up whole Vollies of sighs and groans, it knocks at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-gate by prayer, it can have no rest till the golden beams of Gods face shine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Desertion puts the Christian upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; he enquires the cause of Gods depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: What is the accursed thing that hath made God angry? Perhaps pride, perhaps sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit on Ordinances, perhaps worldlinesse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetousnesse, was I wroth; I hid me.</hi> Perhaps there is some secret sin allowed. A stone in the pipe hinders the current of water: So sin lived in, hinders the sweet current of Gods love. Thus Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as a blood-hound, having found out sin and overtaken it, this <hi>Achan</hi> is stoned to death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Desertion works for good, as it gives us a sight of what Jesus Christ suffered for us. If the sipping of the Cup be so bitter, how bitter was that which Christ drank upon the Crosse? He drank a Cup of deadly poy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on, which made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> None can be so sensible of Christs sufferings, none can be so fired with love to Christ, as those who have been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by desertion, and have been held over the flames of Hell for a time.</p>
               <p n="6">

                  <hi>Light is sown for the Righteous.</hi> The Saints comforts may be hid like seed under ground, but the seed is ripening, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and flourish into a Crop.</p>
               <p n="7">7. These desertions work for good, as they will make Heaven the sweeter to us. Here our comforts are like the Moon, sometimes they are in the full, sometimes in the wain. God shews himself to us a while, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into the withdrawing room: How will this set off Heaven the more, and make it more delightful and ravishing, when we shall have a constant aspect of love from God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p>Thus we see desertions work for good: The Lord brings us into the deep of desertion, that he may not bring us into the deep of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; he puts us into a seeming Hell, that he may keep us from a real Hell. God is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us for that time, when we shall enjoy his smiles for ever; when there shall be neither

I may now say, as the Apostle in another sence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. <hi>Behold, I shew you a Mysterie:</hi> Sin it self to the Godly works for good. Indeed 'tis matter of wonder, that any honey should come out of this Lyon. — We may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it in a double sence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The sins of others work for good to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Godly. 'Tis no small trouble to a gracious heart to live among the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 120.5. <hi>Wo is me that I dwell in Meshech:</hi> Yet even this the Lord turns to good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The sins of others work for good, as they breed holy sorrow. Gods people weep for what they cannot reform: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy Law. David</hi> was a mourner for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106271:33"/>
the sins of the times; his heart was turned into a Spring, and his eyes into Rivers. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men make merry with sin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.15. <hi>When thou dost evil, then thou rejoycest.</hi> But the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are <hi>weeping Doves,</hi> they grieve for the oaths and blasphemies of the Age, they take the sins of others, and make them spears to pierce their own souls. This grieving for the sins of others is good. 1. It shews a Child-like heart. 'Tis ingenuity to resent with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the injuries done to our Heavenly Father. 2. It shews a Christ-like heart, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5. <hi>He was grieved for the hardness of their hearts.</hi> 3. The Lord takes special notice of these tears; he likes it well that we should weep when his glory suffers. It argues more grace to grieve for the sins of others, than for our own. We may grieve for our own sins, out of fear of Hell, but to grieve for the sins of others, is from a principle of love to God: These tears drop as water from the Roses, they are sweet and fragrant, and God puts them in his Bottle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The sins of others work for good to the Godly, as they set them the more a praying against sin. If there were not such a spirit of wickedness abroad, perhaps there would not be such a spirit of prayer. <hi>Crying Sins</hi> cause <hi>Crying Prayers:</hi> The people of God pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the iniquity of the times, that God will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106271:34"/>
give a check to sin, that he will put sin to the blush; if they cannot <hi>pray down</hi> sin, they <hi>pray against</hi> it; and this God takes kindly; these prayers shall be both recorded and rewarded. Though we do not prevail in prayer, we shall not lose our prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.13. <hi>My prayer returned into my own bosome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The sins of others work for good, as they make us the more in love with grace. The sins of others are a foyle to set off the lustre of grace the more. One contrary sets off another: Deformity sets off beauty. The sins of the wicked do much disfigure them: Pride is a disfiguring sin; an ambitious man is but a Bladde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whom the Devil hath blown up; now, the beholding anothers pride, makes us the more in love with humility. Malice is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring sin, it is the Devils picture; the more of this we see in others, the more we fall in love with meeknesse and charity. Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is a disfiguring sin, like <hi>Cyrces</hi> Cup, it turns men into Beasts, it deprives of the use of reason; the more intemperate we see others, the more we fall in love with sobriety. The black face of sin sets off the beauty of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse so much the more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The sins of others work for good, as they work in us the stronger opposition against sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.126. <hi>The wicked have made void thy Law; therefore I love thy Law. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:106271:34"/>
had never loved Gods Law so much, if the wicked had not set themselves so much against it. The more <hi>violent</hi> others are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth, the more <hi>valiant</hi> the Saints are for it. Living fish swim against the stream; the more the Tyde of sin comes in, the more the Godly swim against it. The impieties of the times, provoke holy passion in the Saints: that anger is without sin, which is against sin. The sins of others are as a Whet-stone to set the sharper edge upon us, they whet our zeal and indignation against sin the more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The sins of others work for good, as they make us more earnest in working out our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. When we see wicked men take such pains for Hell, this makes us more industrious for Heaven <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106271:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God by his mighty over-ruling power makes sin in the issue turn to the good of his people; God can make a Treacle of this poyson: Hence, that golden saying of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin, God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permit evil, if he could not bring good out of evil.</hi> The Reliques and remains of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Saints, work for good several wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin makes them weary of this life. That sin is in the godly, <hi>is sad,</hi> but that it is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>is good.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s afflictions (pardon the expression) were but a play to him in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of his sin; he rejoyced in tribulation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. But how did this bird of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise weep and bemoan himself under his sins! <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Who shall deliver me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this death?</hi> A Believer carries his sins, as a Prisoner his shackles: Oh how does he long for a Goal-delivery! This sensibility of sin is good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This in-being of corruption makes the Saints prize Christ more. He that feels his sin, as a sick man feels his sickness, how welcome is Christ the Physitian to him! He that feels himself stung with sin, how precious is the brazen Serpent to him! When <hi>Paul</hi> had cryed out of a <hi>body of death,</hi> how thankful was he for Christ! <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. <hi>I thank God through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ my Lord.</hi> Christs bloud saves from sin, and is the sacred oyntment which kills this Quick-silver.</p>

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:106271:37"/>3. Sin works for good, as it is an occasion of putting the soul upon six rare Duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It puts the soul upon self-searching. A child of God being conscious to himself of sin, takes the Candle and Lanthorn of the Word, and searcheth into his heart: he desires to know the worst by himself; as a man who is distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in body, desires to know the worst of his disease. Though our joy lies in the knowledge of our graces, yet there is some benefit in the knowledge of our corruptions: Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> prays, <hi>Make me to know my transgressions,</hi> Job 13.23. 'Tis good to know our sins, that we may not flatter our selves, or take our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be better than it is. 'Tis good to find out our sins, least they find us out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The inherency of sin puts a child of God upon self-abasing. Sin is left in a godly man, as a Cancer in the breast, or a bunch upon the back, to keep him from being proud. Gravel and Dung are good to ballast a Ship, and keep it from overturning: The Dung of sin helps to ballast the soul, that it be not overturned with vain-glory. We read of the <hi>spots of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Deut. 32.5. When a godly man looks his face in the glass of Scripture, and sees the spots of infidelity and hypocrisie, this makes the plumes of Pride fall; they are humbling spots.

When we do what in us lies to lift up Gods name in the world, and cause others to have high reverential thoughts of God, this the Lord interprets a glorifying of him; as a man is said to dishonour God, when he causeth the name of God to be evil spoken of.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> How many wayes are we said to advance Gods glory? <hi>Answ.</hi> Three wayes. 1. When we aim at his glory<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>·</note>; when we make him the first in our thoughts, and the last in our end. As all the Rivers run into the Sea, and all the Lines meet in the Center, so all our actions terminate and center in God. 2. We advance Gods glory by being fruitful in grace, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.18. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much fruit.</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness reflects dishonour upon God; then we glorifie God, when we grow in fairness as the Lilly, in tallness as the Cedar, in fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as the Vine: The Spouses Breasts were like <hi>Clusters of Grapes,</hi> Cant. 7.7.— 3. We glorifie God, when we give the praise and glory of all we do unto God. It was an excellent and humble Speech of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> He feared the peoples ascribing that glory to him, which was due to God, would remove him before the work was done. When the Silk-worm weaves her curious work, she hides her self under the Silk, and is not seen. When we have done our best, we must vanish in our own thoughts, and transfer the glory of all to God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I labour more abundantly than they all:</hi> One would think this speech favoured of pride? but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle pulls off the Crown from his own head, and sets it upon the head of Free-grace, <hi>Yet
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106271:48"/>
not I, but the Grace of God which was with me. Constantine</hi> did use to write the name of Christ over his <hi>Door,</hi> so should we over our <hi>Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus let us endeavour to make the name of God glorious and renowned. If God seek our good, let us seek his glory; if he makes all things tend to our edification, let us make all things tend to his exaltation. So much for the first part of the Text, <hi>the Priviledge.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The <hi>Ground</hi> of love to God, and that is, <hi>knowledge. Ignoti nulla cupido</hi> — We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love that which we do not know. That our love may be drawn sorth to God, we must know these three things in him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>fulness, Col.</hi> 1.19. He hath a fulness of grace to cleanse us, and of glory to crown us, a fulnesse not only of <hi>sufficiency,</hi> but

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Kinds</hi> of love, which I shall branch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> into these three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a love of <hi>Appretiation,</hi> when we set an high value upon God, as being the most sublime and infinite good; we so esteem of God, as if we have him we care not though we want all things else. The Stars vanish when the Sun appears: All creatures vanish in our thoughts when the Sun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shines in his full splendour, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.13. <hi>A bundle of Myrrhe is my well-beloved unto me, and as a cluster of Camphir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A love of <hi>Complacency</hi> and delight: So <hi>Aquinas</hi> defines love to be <hi>complacentia aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis in amato</hi>: As a man takes delight in a friend whom he loves. The soul that loves God rejoyceth in him, as in his treasure, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106271:50"/>
rests in him, as in his Center. The heart is so set upon God as it desires no more, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.8. <hi>Shew us the Father, and it sufficeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> which is a wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </note>. He that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared in affection to his friend, wisheth all happinesse to him.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The <hi>Properties</hi> of love. 1. Our love to God must be <hi>entire,</hi> and that <hi>ex parte subjecti,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Subject,</hi> it must be with the whole heart. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.30. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with all thy heart.</hi> In the Old Law, an High Priest was not to marry with a Widow, nor with an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; not with a Widow, because he had not her first love, nor with an Harlot, because he had not all her love. God will have the whole heart. <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their heart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi> The true Mother would not have the child divided; nor God will not have the heart divided: God will not be an <hi>Inmate,</hi> to have only one Room in the heart, and all the other Rooms let out to sin. It must be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire love.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:106271:50"/>2. It must be a <hi>sincere</hi> love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24. <hi>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in sincerity.</hi> Sincere, <hi>quasi sine cera</hi>; it alludes to Honey that is pure, and hath no Wax in it: Our love to God is sincere, when it is <hi>pure,</hi> and without self-respects: This the School-men call, <hi>Amor amicitiae, a love of friendship.</hi> We must love Christ <hi>propter Christum</hi> (as <hi>Austin</hi> saith) for <hi>himself</hi>: as we love sweet Wine for its taste. Gods Beauty and Love must be the two Load-stones to draw our love to him. <hi>Alexander</hi> had two freinds, <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> and <hi>Craterus; Ephestion</hi> saith he, loves me because I am <hi>Alexander: Craterus</hi> loves me because I am <hi>King Alexander</hi>: The one loved his person, the other loved his benefits. Many love God because he gives them Corn and Wine, and not for his intrinsecal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> would have Virgins to be married without dowry, because their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands should marry them purely for love. We must love God more for what he is, than for what he bestows. True love is not mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: You need not hire a Mother to love her child: A soul deeply in love with God needs not be hired by rewards; he cannot but love him for that oriency of beauty that sparkles forth in him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106271:51"/>3. It must be a <hi>fervent</hi> love. The Hebrew word for <hi>love</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies ardency of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Saints must be Seraphims, burning in holy love. To love one coldly, is all one as not to love him. The Sun shines as hot as it can. Our love to God must be intense and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; like the <hi>Coales of Iuniper,</hi> which are most acute and fervent, <hi>Psal.</hi> 120.4. Our love to transitory things must be indifferent; we must love <hi>quasi non, as if we loved not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.30<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non jubet Apostolus ut mundana haec abjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus, sed ne si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The Spouse was <hi>amore perculsa, Sick of Love</hi> to Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. We can never love God as he deserves: As Gods punishing us is less than we deserve, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.13. so our loving him is lesse than he deserves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Love to God must be <hi>active</hi>; it is like fire, which is the most active element; it is called, <hi>The Labour of Love,</hi> 1 Thes. 1.3. Love is no idle grace, it sets the head a study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for God, the feet a running in the wayes of his Comandments: <hi>The love of Christ constrains,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.13. Pretences of love are insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. True love is not only seen at the Tongues end, but at the Fingers end; 'tis <hi>the labour of love.</hi> Those living creatures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.8. had wings, and hands under their wings: an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of a good Christian; he hath not only the wings of faith to flie, but hands under his wings <hi>he works by love,</hi> he <hi>spends and is spent for Christ.</hi>

Some say they love God, but their love is lame of one hand, they give nothing to good uses. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed faith deals about invisibles, but God hates that love which is invisible: Love is like new Wine which will have vent; it vents it self in good works.

Love to God is <hi>peculiar:</hi> He who is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Lover of God, gives him such a love, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon none else.

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have espoused you to one hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that I may present you as a chast Virgin to Christ.</hi> A Wife espoused to an Husband, gives him such a love as she hath for none else; she doth not part with her conjugal love to any, but her husband: So a Saint espoused to Christ, gives him a peculiarity of love, a love incommunicable to any other, namely, a love joyned with adoration. Not only the <hi>love</hi> is given to God, but the <hi>soul,</hi> Cant. 4.8. <hi>A gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den enclosed, is my Sister, my Spouse.</hi> The heart of a Believer is Christs Garden, the Flower growing in it, is love mixed with Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and this Flower is for Christ alone to smell to; the Spouse keeps the Key of the Garden, that none may come there but Christ.</p>

Love to God, as it is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere without hypocrisie, so it is constant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apostacy. Love is like the Pulse of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, alwayes beating; 'tis not a Land-floud, but a Spring.

            <head>CHAP. IX. Discovering the Signs, or Fruits of love to God.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. LEt us try our selves impartially,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Tryal.</note> whether we are in the number of those that love God. For the deciding of this, (our love will be best seen by the Fruits of it) I shall lay down fourteen Signs, or Fruits of love to God, and it concerns us nearly to search, whether any of these Fruits grow in our Garden.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first Fruit of love is, <hi>musing of the mind upon God.</hi> He who is in love,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Fruit</hi> of love.</note> his thoughts are still upon the Object: He who loves God, is ravished and transported with the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.17. <hi>When I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, I am still with thee.</hi> The thoughts are as travellers in the mind: <hi>Davids</hi> thoughts kept Heaven-Road, <hi>I am still with thee.</hi> God is the Treasure, and where the Treasure is, there is the heart. By this we may try our love to God: What are our thoughts most upon? Can we say we are ravished with delight when we think on God? Have our thoughts got wings? are they fled aloft? Do we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Christ and Glory? Oh how far are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106271:55"/>
they from being lovers of God, who scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of God? <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.4. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> A sinner crowds God out of his thoughts; he never thinks of God, unless with horror, as the Prisoner thinks of the Judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Fruit of love is, <hi>desire of Communion:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note> Love desires familiarity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.2. <hi>My heart and flesh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> King <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debarred the House of God, where was the Tabernacle, (the visible token of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) he now breaths after God, and in an holy <hi>Pathos</hi> of desire, cryes out for the living God. Lovers would be parlying together. If we love God we prize his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> because there we meet with God: He speaks to us in his Word, and we speak to him in Prayer. By this let us examine our love to God. Do we desire intimacy of communion with God? Lovers cannot be long asunder. Such as love God, have an holy fondness, they know not how to be from him; they can want any thing but Gods presence; they can want health and friends, they can want a full Table, but they cannot want God: <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.7. <hi>Hide not thy face from me, least I be like them that go down into the Grave.</hi> Lovers have their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, fainting fits: <hi>David</hi> was ready to faint away, and dye, when he had not a sight of God. They
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106271:55"/>
who love God cannot be contented with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinances, unless they may enjoy God in them; that were to lick the glass, and not the honey.</p>
            <p>What shall we say to them who can be all their lives long without God? they think God may be best spared: They complain they want health and trading, but not that they want God. Wicked men are not acquainted with God; and how can they love who are not acquainted? nay, which is worse, they do not desire to be acquainted with God, <hi>Iob</hi> 21.14. <hi>They say to God, depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> Sinners shun acquaintance with God, they count his presence a burden; and are these Lovers of God? Doth that woman love her husband, who cannot endure to be in his presence?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third Fruit of love is <hi>grief.</hi> Where there is love to God,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note> there is a grieving for our sins of unkindness against him. A Child that loves his Father cannot chuse but weep for offending him. The heart that burns in love, melts in tears: O that I should abuse the love of so dear a Saviour! Did not my Lord suffer enough upon the Cross, but must I make him suffer more? shall I give him more <hi>Gall and Vinegar</hi> to drink? How dis-loyal and dis-inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious have I been? how have I grieved his Spirit, trampled upon his Royal Commands,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106271:56"/>
sleighted his Bloud? this opens a Vein of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow, and makes the heart bleed afresh. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75. <hi>Peter went out, and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> thought how dearly Christ loved him; he was taken up into the Mount of <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> Christ shewed him the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven in a Vision; now that he should deny Christ after he had received such signal love from him, this broke his heart with grief, <hi>he went out, and wept bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this let us try our love to God: Are our hearts spiritual Lymbecks, dropping the water of godly tears? Do we grieve for our unkindnesses against God, our abuse of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, our non-improvement of Talents? How far are they from loving God, who sin daily, and their hearts never smite them! they have a Sea of sin, and not a drop of sorrow; they are so far from being troubled, that they make merry with their sins, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.15. <hi>When thou dost evil, then thou rejoycest.</hi> Oh wretch, did Christ bleed for sin, and dost thou laugh at it? These are far from loving God: Does he love his friend, that loves to do him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note>4. Another Fruit of love is <hi>Magnanimity.</hi> Love is valourous, it turns cowardise into courage: Love will make one adventure upon the greatest difficulties and hazards; <hi>Amor nescit difficultates.</hi> The fearful Hen will fly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106271:56"/>
upon a Dog or Serpent, to defend her young ones. Love doth infuse <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a spirit of Gallantry and Fortitude into a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. He that loves God will stand up in his Cause, and be an Advocate for him: <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. <hi>We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</hi> He who is afraid to own Christ, hath but little love to him. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came sneaking to Christ <hi>by night,</hi> John 3.2. He was fearful of being seen with him in the day time. <hi>Love casts out fear.</hi> As the Sun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels Fogs and Vapours; so doth Divine Love in a great measure expel carnal Fear. Doth he love God, that can hear his blessed Truths spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against, and be silent? He who loves his friend, will stand up for him, and vindicate him when he is reproached. Doth Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us in Heaven, and are we afraid to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for him on Earth? Love animates a Christian; it fires his heart with zeal, and steels it with courage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth Fruit of love is, <hi>sensibility.</hi> If we love God,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note> our hearts ake for the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours done to God by wicked men: To see, not only the Banks of <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>Civility,</hi> broken down, and a Flood of wickednesse coming in; to see Gods Sabbaths prophaned, his Oath violated, his Name dishonoured; if there be any love to God in us, we shall lay these things to heart. <hi>Lot's</hi> righteous soul was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106271:57"/>
               <hi>vexed for the unclean conversation of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.17. He took the sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and made Spears of them to pierce his own soul. How far are they from loving God, who are not at all affected with his dishonour? if they have but Peace and Trading, they lay nothing to heart. A man who is dead drunk, though another be bleeding to death by him, he never minds, or is sensible: so, many being drunk with the wine of Prosperity, when the honour of God is wounded, and his Truths lye a bleeding, they are not sensible. Did men love God, they would grieve to see his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry suffer, and Religion it self become a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The sixth Fruit of love is, <hi>Antipathy against sin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note> Fire purgeth the Drosse from the Metal. The Fire of Love purgeth out sin. <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Ephraim shall say, what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> He that loves God, will have nothing to do with sin, unlesse to give battel to it. Sin is <hi>Dei-cidium,</hi> it strikes not only at Gods <hi>Honour,</hi> but his <hi>Being.</hi> Doth he love his Prince, that harbours him who is a Traitor to the Crown? Is he a friend to God, who loves that which God hates <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quomodo amas Deum, cum adhuc amas quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dit Deus?</hi> Austin.</note>? The love of God, and the love of sin, cannot dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: The Affections cannot be carried to two contraries at the same time. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love health, and love poyson too: so, one
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106271:57"/>
cannot love God, and sin too. He who hath any secret sin in his heart allowed, is as far from loving God, as Heaven and Earth are distant one from the other.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Fruit of love is, <hi>Crucifixion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note> He who is a Lover of God, is dead to the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>I am crucified to the world</hi>; I am dead to the honours and pleasures of it. He who is in love with God, is not much in love with any thing else <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cui Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus dulces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, mundus am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rescit.</hi> Bern.</note>: His love to God moves as the Sun in the Firmament, swiftly; but his love to the world, is as the motion of the Sun upon the Dial, which is very slow. The love of God, and the violent love of the world, are inconsistent <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Fortis est ut mors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; sicut mors vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentèr sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat animas a corpor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, ita amor Dei violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tèr segregat hominem a mundano amore.</hi> Isidor.</note>. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15. <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Love to God swallows up all other love; as <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod swallowed up the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Rods. If a man could live in the Sun, what a small Point would all the Earth be! So when a mans heart is raised above the world, in the admiring and loving God, how poor and slender are these things below! they seem as nothing in his eye. It was a sign the Primitive Christians did love God, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney did not lye near their heart, but they <hi>laid down their money at the Apostles feet,</hi> Acts 4.35.</p>
            <p>Try by this your love to God. What shall we think of such as have never enough of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106271:58"/>
the world? they have the dry Dropsie of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, thirsting insatiably after riches, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.7. <hi>That pant after the dust of the earth.</hi> Never talk of your love to Christ (saith <hi>Ignatius</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, when you prefer the world before the <hi>Pearl of price</hi>; and are there not many such who prize their gold above God? If they have a South-Land, they care not for the <hi>water of life</hi>; they will sell Christ and a good Conscience for money. Will God ever bestow Heaven upon them, who so basely undervalue him, preferring glittering dust, before the glorious Deity? what is here in the Earth that we should so set our hearts upon it? only the Devil makes us look upon it through a Multiplying Glasse. The world hath no real intrinsecal worth; it is but Paint and Alchymy. The world hath two Breasts, the one Breast is dry, it is <hi>vanity</hi>; the other Breast runs blood, it is <hi>vexation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <note place="margin">8. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note>8. The next Fruit of love is <hi>fear.</hi> In the Godly love and fear do kisse each other. There is a double fear ariseth from love. 1. A fear of <hi>displeasing.</hi> The Spouse loves her husband, therefore will rather deny her self, than displease him. The more we love God, the more fearful we are of grieving his Spirit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How then can I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sin against God?</hi> When <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empresse threatned to banish <hi>Chrysostome,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106271:58"/>
Tell her</hi> (saith he) <hi>I fear nothing but sin.</hi> That is a blessed love which puts a Christian into an hot fit of <hi>zeal,</hi> and a cold fit of <hi>fear,</hi> making him shake and tremble, and not dare willingly to offend God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A fear <hi>mixed with jealousie,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.13. <hi>Elies heart trembled for the Ark.</hi> It is not said, his heart trembled for <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas,</hi> his two sons, but his heart trembled for the <hi>Ark,</hi> because if the <hi>Ark</hi> were taken, then <hi>the glory was departed.</hi> He that loves God is full of fear least it should go ill with the Church; he fears least prophaness (which is the plague of Leprosie) should encrease, least Popery get footing, least God should go from a People. The presence of God in his Ordinances, is the beauty and strength of a Nation. The <hi>Trojans</hi> had the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> and they had an opinion that as long as that Image was preserved among them, they should never be conquered. So long as Gods presence is with a people, so long they are safe; but the soul inflamed in love to God, fears least the visible tokens of Gods presence should be removed.</p>
            <p>By this Touch-stone let us try our love to God. Many fear least peace and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding go, but not least God and his Gospel go; are these Lovers of God? He who loves God is more afraid of the losse of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106271:59"/>
blessings than temporal. If the <hi>Sun of Righteousnesse</hi> remove out of our Horizon, what can follow but darknesse? What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can an Organ, or Antheme give, if the Gospel be gone? is it not like the sound of a Trumpet, or a Volley of shot at a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral?</p>
            <p n="9">
               <note place="margin">9. <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </note>9. If we are lovers of God, <hi>we love that which God loves.</hi> 1. We love Gods Word. <hi>David</hi> esteemed the Word, for the <hi>sweetnesse</hi> of it, above honey, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.103. and for the <hi>value</hi> of it, above gold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.72. The Lines of Scripture are richer than the Mines of Gold. Well may we love the Word; it is the Load-Star that directs us to Heaven, it is the Field in which the <hi>Pearl</hi> is hid. That man who loves not the Word, but thinks it too strict, and could wish any part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torn out (as that Adulterer did the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandement) he hath not the least spark of love in his heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We love Gods day; we do not only keep a Sabbath, but love a Sabbath. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.13. <hi>If thou call the Sabbath a delight.</hi> The Sabbath is that which keeps up the face of Religion amongst us; this day must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated as glorious to the Lord. The house of God is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Palace of the Great King; on the Sabbath God shews himself there, through the Lattice. If we love
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106271:59"/>
God, we prize his day above all other dayes. All the week would be dark, if it were not for this day; on this day Manna falls double; now, if ever, Heaven-gate stands open, and God comes down in a golden shower: This bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed day the Sun of Righteousnesse riseth upon the soul. How doth a gracious heart prize that day, which was made on purpose to enjoy God in?</p>
            <p n="3">3. We love Gods Laws. A gracious soul is glad of the Law, because it checks his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exorbitances. The heart would be ready to run wilde in sin, if it had not some blessed restraints put upon it by the Law of God. He that loves God, loves his Law, the Law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Law of self-denyal. Many say they love God, but they hate his Laws, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</hi> Gods precepts are compared to <hi>cords,</hi> they bind men to their good behaviour; but the wicked think these <hi>cords</hi> too strait, therefore they say, <hi>let us break them.</hi> They pretend to love Christ as a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> but hate him as a <hi>Prince.</hi> Christ tells us of his <hi>yoak, Mat.</hi> 11.29. Sinners would have Christ put a Crown upon their head, but not a yoak upon their neck. He were a strange King should rule without Laws.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106271:60"/>4. We love Gods picture, we love his Image shining in the Saints, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.1. <hi>He that loves him that begat, loves him also that is begotten of him.</hi> 'Tis possible to love a Saint, yet not love him <hi>as</hi> a Saint; we may love him for something else, for his ingenuity, because he is affable and bountiful. A beast loves a man, but not <hi>quatenus homo, as</hi> he is a man, but because he feeds him, and gives him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinder. But to love a Saint <hi>as he is a Saint,</hi> this is a sign of love to God. If we love a Saint for his Saint-ship, as having something of God in him, then we love him in these four Cases.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We love a Saint though he be poor. A man that loves gold, loves a piece of gold though it be in a rag: So though a Saint be in rags, we love him, because there is <hi>aliquid Christi,</hi> something of Christ in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We love a Saint though he hath many personal failings. There is no perfection here; in some, rash anger <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>revails; in some, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; in some, too much love of the world. A Saint in this life is like gold in the ore, much drosse of infirmity cleaves to him, yet we love him for the grace that is in him. A Saint is like a fair face with a scar: We love the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful face of holinesse, though there be a scar in it. The best Emerald hath its blemishes,

the brightest Stars their twinklings, and the best of the Saints have their failings. Thou that canst not love another because of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, how wouldst thou have God love thee? hast not thou good store<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We love the Saints though in some les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser things they differ from us. Perhaps another Christian hath not so much light as thou, and that may make him erre in some things; wilt thou presently un-Saint him, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come up to thy light?<note place="margin">☜</note> Where there is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> there ought to be union in <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We love the Saints though they are persecuted. We love precious Mettal though it be in the furnace. St <hi>Paul</hi> did bear in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>marks</hi> of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.17. Those marks were like the <hi>Souldiers scar,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. We must love a Saint as well in Chains, as in Scarlet. <hi>Constantine</hi> did kisse the hole of <hi>Paphnusius</hi> his eye, because he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the losse of his eye for Christ. If we love Christ, we love his persecuted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>If this be to love God, when we love his Image sparkling in the Saints, Oh then, how few Lovers of God are to be found! Do they love God, who hate them that are like God? Do they love Christs person, who are fill'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106271:61"/>
a spirit of revenge against his people? How can that wife be said to love her husband, that tears his picture? Surely <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> are not yet dead, their spirit lives in the world. Who are guilty but the innocent? What greater crime than holinesse, if the Devil may be one of the grand Jury? Wicked men seem to bear great reverence to the Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they canonize dead Saints, but persecute living. In vain do men stand up at the Creed, and tell the world, <hi>They believe in God,</hi> when they abominate one of the Articles of the Creed, namely, <hi>The Communion of Saints.</hi> Surely, there is not a greater sign of a man ripe for Hell, than this, not onely to <hi>want</hi> grace, but to <hi>hate</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Another blessed sign of love, is, <hi>to entertain good thoughts of God.</hi> He that loves his friend construes what his friend doth in the best sence. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Love thinketh no evill.</hi> Malice interprets all in the <hi>worst sence</hi>; Love interprets all in the <hi>best sence</hi>; it is an excellent Commentator upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It thinks no evill.</hi> He that loves God, hath a good opinion of God; though he afflicts sharply, yet the soul takes all well. This is the Language of a gracious spirit: My God sees what an hard heart I have, therefore drives in one Wedge of affliction after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106271:61"/>
to break my heart; he knows how full I am of bad humors, how sick of a Plurisie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lets me blood to save my life; this severe dispensation is either to mortifie some corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to exercise some grace: How good is God that will not let me alone in my sins, but smites my body, to save my soul! Thus he that loves God, takes every thing in good part. Love puts a candid glosse upon all Gods actions. Thou who art apt to murmur at God, as if he had dealt ill with thee, be humbled for this; say thus with thy self, if I loved God more, I should have better thoughts of God. 'Tis Satan that makes us have good thoughts of our selves, and hard thoughts of God. Love takes all in the fairest sence, <hi>it thinketh no evill.</hi>

If Jesus Christ should have said to us, I love you well, you are dear to me, but I cannot suffer, I cannot lay down my life for you, we should have questioned his love very much; and may not Christ suspect us, when we pretend love to him, yet will endure nothing for him? They who bear true affection to God, will according to their vow in Baptisme, fight under his Banner to the death, and make Christs Crown flourish in their ashes.</p>

Love is not squemish, it will visit the sick, relieve the poor, wash the Saints wounds.

               </note> but how much we love. If a servant doth not his work willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and out of love, it is not accepted.

To do duty, without love, is not <hi>sacrifice,</hi> but <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2.</note>2. Love is the most noble and excellent grace, it is a pure flame kindled from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by it we resemble God who is <hi>love.</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:106271:65"/>
Believing and obeying do not make us like God, but by love we grow like him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16. Love is a grace doth most delight in God, and is most delightful to him. That Disciple which was most full of love, lay in Christs bosome. Love puts a verdure and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre upon all the Graces: the Graces seem to be eclipsed, unlesse love shine and sparkle in them: Faith is not true, unless <hi>it work by love</hi>; the waters of repentance are not pure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they flow from the Spring of love. Love is the <hi>savoury meat</hi> God loves, it is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense makes all our Services fragrant and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous; it is <hi>Vinum aromaticum, the Spiced Wine, and the juice of the Pomgranate.</hi>
            </p>

'tis but our love;<note place="margin">3.</note> if he should ask our estate, or the fruit of our bodies, could we deny him? but he asks only our love; he would only pick this flower; is this an hard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest? was there ever any debt so easily paid as this? we do not at all impoverish our selves by paying it. Love is no burden. Is it any labour for the Bride to love her Husband? Love is delightful; <hi>Non potest amor esse, et dulcis non esse</hi>

            <p>There is nothing in God to dull our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or quench our love, no infirmity, no deformity, which do usually weaken and cool love. There is that delicious sweetnesse in God, as may not only <hi>entice,</hi> but <hi>command</hi> our love. If there were more Angels in Heaven than there are, and all those glorious Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims had an immense flame of love burning in their breasts to eternity, yet could they not love God equivalently to that infinite perfection and transcendency of goodnesse which is in him. Surely then here is enough to tempt us to fall in love with God; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not spend our love upon a better object.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Love doth facilitate Religion, it oyls the Wheels of the affections,<note place="margin">5.</note> and makes them more lively and cheerful in Gods service; love takes off the tediousness in duty. <hi>Iacob</hi> thought seaven years but little, for the love
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106271:66"/>
he did bear to <hi>Rachel.</hi> Love makes duty a pleasure. Why are the Angels so swift and winged in Gods service? it is because they love him. Love is never weary. He that loves Gold is never weary of telling it; and he that loves God, is never weary of serving him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God desires our love. It were much for a King to desire the love of a woman that is deformed and leprous.<note place="margin">6.</note> We have lost our beauty, and stained our blood, yet the King of Heaven is a Suitor to us. What is there in our love that God should come a wooing for it? What is God the better for our love? he doth not want it, he is infinitely blessed in himself; if we deny him our love, he hath more sublime creatures who pay the cheerful tribute of love to him. God doth not need our love, yet he seeks it.</p>

               </note>2. I proceed to the second Branch of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: You who have love to God, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preserve it; let not this love dye, and be quenched. As you would have Gods love be continued to you, let your love be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to him. Love, as fire, will be ready to go out: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Thou hast left thy first love.</hi> Satan labours to blow out this flame, and through neglect of Duty we lose it. When a tender body leaves off cloaths, it is apt to get cold: so when we leave off duty, by degrees we cool in our love to God. Of all graces, Love is soonest apt to decay; therefore we had need be the more careful to preserve it. If a man hath a Jewel, he will keep it; if he hath Land of Inheritance, he will keep it; what care then should we have to keep this grace of Love? 'Tis sad to see professors declining in their love to God: Many are in a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual consumption,</hi> their Love is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>There are four Signs, whereby Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may know their love is in a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When they have lost their tast. He that is in a deep Consumption, hath no tast; he finds not that savoury rellish in his meat, as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106271:74"/>
formerly: So when Christians have lost their tast, they find no sweetness in a promise, it is a sign of a spiritual Consumption, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>If so be ye have tasted the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi> Time was, when they found comfort in drawing nigh to God; His Word was as the dropping honey, very delicious to the pallat of their soul: but now it is otherwise, they can tast no more sweetness in spiritual things, than in the <hi>white of an Egg,</hi> Job 6.6. This is a sign they are in a Consumption; to lose the tast, argues the loss of the first love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When Christians have lost their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. A man in a deep Consumption, hath not that Stomack to his meat, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Time was when Christians did <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst after righteousness,</hi> they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things of an heavenly aspect, the Grace of the Spirit, the blood of the Cross, the Light of Gods Countenance; they had a stomack to Ordinances, and came to them as an hungry man to a feast; but now the case is altered, they have no Appetite, they do not so prize Christ, they have not such strong affections to the Word, their hearts <hi>do not burn within them</hi>; a sad presage they are in a consumption, their love is decaying. It was a sign <hi>Davids</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural strength was abated, when they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106271:75"/>
him with cloaths, and yet he gat no heat, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.1. So when men are ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hot Cloaths, I mean <hi>Ordinances,</hi> yet they have no heat of affection, but are cold, and stiff, as if they were ready to be laid forth; this is a sign their first love is declined, they are in a deep Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Christians grow more in love with the World, it argues the decrease of spiritual love. They were once of a sublime Heavenly temper, they did speak the <hi>language of Canaan</hi>; but now they are like the fish in the Gospel, which had <hi>money in its mouth,</hi> Mat. 17. <hi>ult.</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lisp out three words, but one is about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; their thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (like Satan) are still <hi>compassing the earth</hi>; a sign they are going down the hill apace, their love to God is in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption. We may observe, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture decays and grows weaker, persons go more stooping: And truly when the heart goes more stooping to the Earth, and is so bowed together, that it can scarce lift up it self to an Heavenly thought, it is now sadly declining in its first love. When Rust cleaves to Mettal, it doth not only take away the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Mettal, but it doth canker and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106271:75"/>
consume it: So when the earth cleaves to mens souls, it doth not only hinder the shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lustre of their graces, but it doth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees canker their graces.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Christians make little reckoning of Gods Worship; Duties of Religion are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in a dead formal manner; if they are not left <hi>undone,</hi> yet they are <hi>ill done</hi>; this is a sad Symptom of a spiritual Consumption; Remissness in Duty, shews a decay in our first love. The strings of a Viol being slack, the Viol can never make good musick: When men grow slack in Duty, they pray as if they prayed not, this can never make any harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious sound in Gods Ears. When the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Motion, like that of the Eighth Sphea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ow and heavy, and the Pulse of the soul beats low, it is a sign Christians have <hi>left their first love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us take heed of this spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; 'tis dangerous to abate in our love. Love is such a grace as we know not how to be without. A Souldier may as well be without his weapons, a Limner without his pensil, a Musician without his Viol, as a Christian can be without love. The body cannot want its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tural heat. Love is to the soul,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106271:76"/>
as the natural heat is to the body, there is no living without it. Love doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the graces, it excites the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it makes us grieve for sin, it makes us cheerful in God; it is like oyl to the wheels; it quickens us in Gods service. How careful then should we be to keep alive divine love!</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>How may we keep our love from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Watch your hearts every day; take notice of the first declinings in grace; observe your selves when you begin to grow dull and listless, and use all means for quickening; be much in prayer, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, holy conference. When the fire is going out you throw on fuel: So when the flame of your love is going out, make use of Ordinances, and Gospel-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, as fuel to keep the fire of your love burning.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> blow up those divine sparks into a flame. A Christian should not be content with so small a dram of grace, as may make him scruple whether he hath any grace or no, but should be still improving the stock. He who hath a little gold would have more; you who love God a little, labour to love him more. A godly man is like a drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie man, the more grace he drinks in, the more he thirsts: He is contented with a very little of the world, yet he is never satisfied, but would have more of the Spirits influence, and labours to add one degree of love to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To perswade Christians to put more Oyl to the Lamp, and encrease the flame of their love, let me propound these four divine Incentives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The growth of love evidenceth the truth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If I see the Almond tree bud and flourish, I know there is life in the root. Paint will not grow; an hypocrite, who is but a picture, will not grow; but where we see love to God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing and growing bigger (as <hi>Elisha's</hi> cloud) we may conclude, it is true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the growth of love we imi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:106271:77"/>
the Saints in the Bible: Their love to God, like the <hi>waters of the Sanctuary</hi> did rise higher. The Disciples love to Christ at first was weak, <hi>they fled from Christ,</hi> but after Christs death it grew more vigorous, and they made an open profession of him. <hi>Peters</hi> love at first was more infirm and languid, he denied Christ, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards how boldly did he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ach him! <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10. yea, when Christ put him to a trial of his love, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.16. <hi>Simon, lovest thou me? Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> could make his humble, yet confident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Christ, <hi>Lord thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> Thus that tender plant which before was blown down with the wind of a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now is grown into a Cedar, which all the powers of hell could not shake.</p>
            <p n="3">The growth of love will ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the reward. The more we burn in love, the more we shall shine in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The higher our love, the heavier our Crown.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The more we love God, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> more love we shall have from him. Would we have God unbosom the sweet secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of his love to us? would we have the smiles of his face, the kisses of his lips? Oh then let us strive for higher
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106271:77"/>
degrees of love. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> counted Gold and Pearl but dung for Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Yea, he was so inflamed in love to God, that he could have wished himself <hi>accursed from Christ, for his Brethreo the Iews,</hi> Rom. 9.3. Not that he could be accursed from Christ; but such was his fervent love, and pious zeal for the glory of God, that he would have been content to have suffered, even beyond what is fit to speak, if God might have had more honour.</p>
            <p>Here was love scrued up to the highest pitch, that it was possible for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to arrive at; and behold how near he lay to Gods heart! the Lord makes known the <hi>Arcana Coeli,</hi> he takes him up to Heaven a while, and lays him in his bosom, where he had such a glorious sight of God, and heard those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. Never was any man a loser by his love to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If our love to God doth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> encrease, it will soon decrease: If the fire be not blown up, it will quickly go out. Therefore Christians should
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106271:78"/>
above all things endeavour to cherish and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite their love to God. This Exhortation will be out of date when we come to Heaven, for then our light shall be clear, and our love perfect; but now it is in season to exhort, that our love to God may abound <hi>yet more and more.</hi>

It is an holy call. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath called us with an holy calling.</hi> This call of Gods calls men out of their sins; by it they are consecrated and set apart for God. The Vessels of the Tabernacle were taken from common, and set apart to an holy use; so they who are effectually called, are separated from sin, and consecrated to Gods service. The God whom we worship is holy, the work we are imployed in is holy, the place we hope to arrive at is holy; all this calls for holiness. A Christians heart is is to be the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence-Chamber of the Blessed Trinity; and shall not <hi>Holiness to the Lord</hi> be written upon it? Believers are Children of God the Father, Members of God the Son, Temples of God the Holy Ghost; and shall not they be holy?

Nay, let not the moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

Gods words are <hi>Verba creativa,</hi> Creating words; when he said, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> there was light; and when he saith, <hi>Let there be faith,</hi> it shall be so.

This is that the Saints will stand wondring at to all eternity. 5. It is a marvelous light, because it is more virtual than any other; it doth not onely enlighten, but quicken, it makes alive those who <hi>were dead in trespasses and sins</hi>; therefore it is elegantly called <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vita, the light of life, Iohn</hi> 8.12.— 6.
