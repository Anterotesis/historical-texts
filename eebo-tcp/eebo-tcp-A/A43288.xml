            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In this <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> lyeth hidden the whole Art of the true Chymistry. If a Chymist know not how to make or separate that <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiolum</hi> from <hi>Mercurius vivus,</hi> he will fail of the whole Art.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> is the matter whereof shall be made the Philosophers <hi>Mercury,</hi> that is, when it is reduced to his first matter, that is in a clear Water, like the Water which runs out of our Eyes now and then, and is slippery: This Water will eat and drink his own Flesh and Blood, and multiply it self with it <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and this Water will bring all Gold and Silver into their first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> is brought into his first matter, (it is when it is prepared Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically without Corrosiveness) it will cure <hi>triplicem Hydropem, podagram, morbum vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> and also many more sicknesses.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Processus compositus Praecipioli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take in the Lords Name of the <hi>Mercury</hi> which is well purged: ten parts of our Gold or of our Silver, (not common Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as the common-people make use of it) take ours, that is to say, Gold which is well refined through Antimony, or if you will make it with Silver refine it with Lead, and purge those both very well from their Dross and foulness: If you have ten parts of our Mercury.</p>
            <p>Take one part of our Gold or Silver made to fine leaves or made into fine Powder with a File, and make an Amalgama of them both in a warm Glazen or Marbel Morter, and with a Pestel of Glass mix it well, and then put this Amalgama into a Retort (as I shall give you direction below) and put it into an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Copel or Earthen Pan, with one part of clear Sand, and three times as much sifted Ashes, and cover it with another Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Pan, and put to it a little Receiver, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out luting, and then make Fire in your Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and give an indifferent heat, and distil the <hi>Mercurium</hi> from our Gold and Silver with an indifferent heat, now and then, then take the Pan from it: If you see the Mercury
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37625:4"/>
is distilled from the Gold or Silver, cover it again and let the Fire go out.</p>
            <p>The next morning take your Retort and Receiver from the Furnace or out of the Sand, your <hi>Mercury</hi> will lye some part in the Receiver, and some part will hang in the Neck of the Retort, which you shall wipe off with a Feather, to the other Mercury which is in the Receiver.</p>
            <p>If you will, you may now and then hold a glowing Coal under the Neck of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort that the <hi>Mercury</hi> may run into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
            <p>When you have separated the <hi>Mercurium,</hi> then scrape the Gold which will lye at the bottom of the Retort with a crooked Iron, from the bottom of the Retort, and take it out, and put it into a Glass Morter and powder it small, then mingle or Amalga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate your Mercury with it again by degrees or by little and little, and put your Amalga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma again into the Retort, and if you shall find any Powder that will not go into the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, do not cast it away, but put it with the Amalgama into the Retort (or else you will lose your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi>) and distil it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as it is mentioned. Now and then take the Earthen Pan from it to see if the Mercury be almost gone over, and if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most gone over, let the Fire go out, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37625:5"/>
with the Earthen Pan again, and let it stand until the next morning, and then take the Retort and the <hi>Recipient</hi> again from the Furnace or out of the Sand, and wipe your Mercury again with a Feather out of the Neck of the Retort into the other <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> in the <hi>Recipient,</hi> and scrape again with your crooked Iron, your Gold out of the Retort as you did before, and put it again into your Glass Morter, (observe you shall distil so that the <hi>Argent vive</hi> go from the Gold, and that not any <hi>Mercury</hi> may be found nor be seen by your Gold which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth at the bottom of the Retort.) And then take your Glass Pestel, and Powder again your Gold very small, and Amalgame your Mercury again with your Gold, by little and little, as before is mentioned.</p>
            <p>You will find that the Gold and Mercury will not well mix together as it did in the first and second time.</p>
            <p>Then take it and put it again in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort and distil it again as it is mentioned, not casting any Powder away, which you will think to be faeces, if you do cast it away, you will I say lose your <hi>Praecipiolum.</hi> And when the Mercury is distilled away from the Gold again, take your Glass out of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace or out of the Sand copel, scrape your Gold with the crooked Iron, again out of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37625:5"/>
your Retort and you shall find that your Gold is much encreased, if you should weigh it; the reason is your Gold is the Load-stone, which hath attracted the <hi>Praecipiolum,</hi> or your Gold is the Cask wherein the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Wine hath let fall its Tartar which <hi>Paracelsus &amp; Helmont</hi> calls <hi>Praecipiolum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how shall the Philosophical Tartar or <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> be separated from our Gold?</p>
            <p>Take your Gold which you have scraped out of the Retort, and put it into your Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Morter, and pouder it very small with your Glass Pestel and mingle your Mercury by degrees as by little and little.</p>
            <p>Your Mercury will hardly mix with the Gold, the reason is, the Gold is full of the <hi>Praecipiolum,</hi> and then it is time to separate the <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> from the Gold and Mercury, which is a Womans work, when her Cloaths, are foul, she washeth them from their foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The same way you must cleanse your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> from your Gold and Mercury as followeth.</p>
            <p>When you have the sign that your <hi>Mercury</hi> will hardly mix with your Gold, and your Gold will not enter into your <hi>Mercurium vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> then power on it the clearest and fairest Water (distilled is best) that it may go over three Fingers breadth your Gold and Mercury, then wash it well, stirring it with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37625:6"/>
your Pestel the Gold and the Mercury and the Water together which is in the Morter, I say you shall wash it together very well, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you see your Water is discoloured blewish black: Then is the sign that the Gold doth let fall the <hi>Tartarum</hi> or <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> in the Water and maketh it blewish black, then power off the Water into a Glass (observe that not any Mercury may fall with the powring out the blewish Water) then powr more fresh Water upon your Gold and Mercury, and wash it again as is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and when your Water is blew again powr off the Water to the former Water in the Glass, and thus continue washing till your Water remain white, then power this Water to the other Water in the Glass, and cover your Glass very close, that not any foulness may fall into the Glass. Observe that your Gold will go again into the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, when that <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> is washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as Wax goes in melted Butter.</p>
            <p>Take your Amalgama abovesaid, make it dry upon warm Ashes very softly with a Spunge, and by a little heat that the Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gama may be dryed and when it is dry put it again in the Retort, and distil it as is before mentioned with the Mercury as with coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating; that is to say in distilling your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, so often from the Gold that the Gold
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37625:6"/>
will hardly mix with the Mercury, and this is the sign that the Gold hath attracted enough from the <hi>Praecipiolum,</hi> and then it is time to separate with washing your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> from your Amalgama.</p>
            <p>Now observe, I gave you Charge that you should keep your Glass wherein you put your blewish Water: which will be clear, and a Powder settled at the bottom, which is some of the <hi>Praecipiolum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then power off the clear Water from the <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> without disturbing the Water, as soon as you can into another Glass: Now when you have that sign, that your Gold will not mix well with your Mercury, or not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Trouble, then power the same Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which you powred off from your <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiolum</hi> into another Glass, as it is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon your Amalgama, and wash it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and when your Water is blewish pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er off the Water to your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Glass, as it is afore mentioned, upon your Amalgama, and wash it again, till all your Water hath washed away the <hi>Praecipio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> and then stop your Glass again that no foulness fall into it, then take your Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gama and dry it again very gently, and distil again, as is mentioned, till you have the sign, and then you shall wash it again with the first Water, and you shall find that your
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37625:7"/>
               <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> will Augment or increase daily. Thus stilling and washing shall you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the Mercury is freed from its Mercury coagulated or <hi>Praecipiolum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe if the Water should grow less add to it now and then fresh Water.</p>
            <p>Now the sign is when the <hi>Mercurius</hi> hath lost all its Sperm, or its Tartar, or its Mercury coagulate, or its <hi>Praecipiolum</hi>: The Mercury and the Gold will mix always well together, and if you should distil it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times that Gold and Mercury the one from the other, and if you should wash it a thousand times the one from the other with fresh Water, the Water will be clear, not blewish and so long as the <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> is in the Mercury, the Gold and Mercury will hardly mingle one with another, and then when you would have it mix together you must wash it, and then it will lovingly mix again when it is washed: So I say when your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> is all separated from the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, if you should a thousand times distil your Mercury from your Gold, it will mingle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lovingly together, and you will not find any Powder left, it will go all into the Mercury and your Water remain clear and white.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:37625:7"/>Now further to our intent, as to make or prepare your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> for a Medicine, power your clear Water, from the Powder which lyes at the bottom, in the Glass that no Water may be left by the Powder.</p>
            <p>Put the Glass upon a little warm Ashes that the Powder may be dryed, the Powder will look blewish yellow; also, put the powder into a little Cucurbit Glass, and distil five or six times <hi>Spiritus vini</hi> from it, then your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> is made ready for a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>

               <p>Take your Salt and twice as much of your <hi>Praecipolum,</hi> when it is made dry first dissolve your Salt in fair warm Water, and power it upon the <hi>Praecipiolum,</hi> and evaporate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way very gently in warm Ashes with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fire; then take your <hi>Praecipiolum</hi> with its one Salt and put it into a little Retort, nip the Neck of the Retort very close, or melt it together, or Seal it with <hi>Hermes</hi> Seal, then put it into <hi>Balneum vaperosum</hi> and let it stand six Weeks in digestion or to putrifie, and it will turn to a slimy Water, then take your Retort, and open the Neck, then lay your Retort in a Sand Furnace and cover your Retort with an Earthen Pan, and lay a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver well luted, and first give a slow Fire, then a stronger, and this continue till your Spirits be well resolved into Water, first your Spirit will come in form of a white Cloud, and at last in the form of red Clouds or red Smoak, and give Fire so long till all your Spirits be come over into clear white Water, and when you have this sign, take your Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the Retort, and stop the Receiver very well with Wax that no Spirit may fly away: Then let your Fire go out, then take
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37625:9"/>
the matter which remaineth in the Retort out of the Retort, and put the same into a Bolthead and stop it well, and set it in a warm place, then take your Spirits which are in the Receiver and rectifie them once, and keep those Spirits very carefully. Observe this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may remember, when the <hi>Praecipiolon</hi> hath lost its Mercury that the same Mercury, will be so bright, as a <hi>Venus</hi> Lookinglass; take the same bright Mercury and dissolve him in your before-mentioned Spirit, as now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Take one part of your bright Mercury and put it into a Bolthead, and power upon it two parts of your Spirit of Mercury, and stop it very close and let it stand in a little warmth, and the Mercury will dissolve or melt in your Spirit, and then distil it together through a Retort in Sand, and again take one part of your bright Mercury and put it into a Bolthead, and power upon it two parts of your Spirit and set it in a warm place and the Mercury will melt in the Spirit; then distil again through a Retort in Sand, and it will come over in the form of Water; this continue as long until the half part of your bright Mercury is brought to a clear Water, when you have this clear Water, keep it very close stopped with Wax, and take your Powder, which I gave you to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37625:9"/>
keep in a Bolt-head, and place it very deep in a Sand Copel, and give it a very strong Fire for twenty and four Hours, then let the Fire go out of the said Copel, and stir the Powder with a Wooden-stick, and power upon it the half part of your clean Mercurial Water, and stop the Glass or melt the Glass-mouth together; then shake it, and let it stand in a warm place for three or four days in digestion, powr off this into another Glass, and powr upon the remainder of the Powder another half of the Water and stop or melt the mouth of the Glass again, and let it stand again for three or four days in a warm place in digestion; then powr it out to the former Water, and stop the Glass, or melt the mouth of the Glass very close, that no Spirit may fly out or fly away, and let it stand in your <hi>Balneo Vaporoso</hi> eight days, and then distil it through a Retort, and if any stuff shall remain in the Retort, which will be very little, powr upon it your Spirit again, and distil it over until all is gone over.</p>
               <p>Now is the Salt with his own Spirit mixt together and brought into the first matter, keep it very well stopped.</p>

               <p>First you must wash your Mercury with Salt and Vinegar divers times, and at last with Water to wash away the Salt, then mix this Mercury with Calx Vive and calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Tartar, and distil it in a Retort in a Sand Furnace, and lay to it a Receiver, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led almost half full with Water, and when your Mercury is dry, then squeeze him eight or ten times through Leather, and then is your Mercury well purged from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness.</p>
