            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here dwelt in the Iſle of <hi>Sicily,</hi> an old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, reverent for his yeares, wiſe in Counſell, vertuous in life, and rich in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, named <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> yet was not fortune ſo much his friend in giving him wealth, as nature in inriching him with two Daughters, the elder whereof was named <hi>Calanthia,</hi> and the younger <hi>Florella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not farre from the dwelling of old <hi>Clidamas,</hi> there liv'd two young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16805:7"/>
not brothers by birth, yet as much or more then brothers by affection, the elder named <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> and the younger <hi>Polidore;</hi> equall they were in all things ſave in age, of equall height, of equall wit, of equall beauty, of equall ſtrength; their valour ſuch, that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> never found a match for himſelfe before hee tried <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> neither could <hi>Polidore</hi> be ever paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd by any other then <hi>Cleanthes:</hi> oft had they tried their forces againſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and as oft had they come off to their adverſaries diſgrace, and their owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; oft had they tried their own ſtrengths together, and as oft given over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſadvantage on either ſide: ſo that perceiving neither to be the better, they gave over further proofes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that ſince neither could brag of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers overthrow, they would from thence forth perticipate of each others honours.</p>
            <p>In this ſort long they lived, haunting all places where honour was to bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and where ever they came, doing ſuch admirable deeds of armes, that their fame ſpead it ſelfe, not onely over <hi>Sicily,</hi> but alſo over the greateſt part of <hi>Greece</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:16805:7"/>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polidore</hi> were generally reputed the onely Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Long it was ere theſe famous Martialiſts (not yet weaned from the ſweates of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like honours) taſted the bitter-ſweets of <hi>Cupids</hi> Artillery, till it fortuned that <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella</hi> (who were as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for beauty as they for valour) paſſed by their Caſtle, when both at one inſtant ſaw them, both at one inſtant liked them, both at one inſtant lov'd them, both at one inſtant proteſted they were Goddeſſes, both at one inſtant vowed to injoy them; both at one inſtant were about to runne out of the Caſtle and ſeize on them, and yet both at one inſtant accounting it a diſhonour to offer violence to weake women, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pondering the danger that might ariſe thereof, deſiſted from ſuch an enterpriſe; yet ſtill continued they gazing, extolling above meaſure the excellency of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the ſparkling luſter of their radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent eyes, calling them (by overſtrain'd hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles) Starres, Sunnes, Angels, or indeed any thing that love-ſicke imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation fancieth, till by their continued
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16805:8"/>
motion their eyes were denyed the ſight of their faces; but then fell they to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring of their back-parts, prayſing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound meaſure) the decency of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſetting downe for an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that never could garments bee ſo extraordinarily well faſhioned, unleſſe an extraordinarie excellent mould were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, thus by things ſeene, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the perfection of things not ſeene, making their eyes beare them company till they were quite out of ſight.</p>
            <p>But then their eyes being robbed of their felicitie, imagination fell harder to worke; yet in all this time did neither take heede to the others paſſions, each were ſo buſied in his owne particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, ſo being both wearie of eithers company (it being the nature of love to affect lonelineſſe) they agreed without any motion made to either, to depart aſunder, yet remembring their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient friendſhip, they were once about to returne to take leave of one another, but the remembrance of their new love drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this part of good manners, yet did each marvaile at the others ſtrangeneſſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16805:8"/>
and ſtill imputed the cauſe to himſelfe, determining when occaſion ſhould ſerve to finde an excuſe, which tooke away all cauſe of debate betweene them, neither dreaming that the other was taken as wel as himſelfe, but either ſteadfaſtly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that himſelfe was the onely aime of <hi>Cupids</hi> archery, in theſe imaginations either departed from the other to their private Chambers.</p>
            <p>Twice had the Sunne runne his diurnall race, and ſtill theſe lovers continued in their ſolitarineſſe, not talking at meate as they were wont to do aforetime, but both would fit ſilent and ſtill, thinking more of the beauty of their miſtriſſes, then either of meate or table-talke, yet remembring themſelves they would ſometimes caſt forth a ſtealing looke, to ſpie whether the one perceived the others manner of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when if theſe their ſtolen glaunces hapned to be at one inſtant (as ſometimes they were,) <hi>Cleanthes</hi> would bluſh, as a ſhamed to be ſeene by <hi>Polidore,</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> would change colour, as loth to have his paſſion noted by his deare <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:16805:9"/>At length ſolitarineſſe (to which they had not formerly beene uſed) grew weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them, and either deſired to make his friend pertaker of his ſecret thoughts; in this Sympathy of affection, one day, when the Sunne was deſcending to his weſterne habitation, they grew more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and after ſome unnceſſary chat, they reſolved to walke into the freſh ayre of the fragrent fields, to which they had now theſe two dayes beene ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; a long time for them that had beene brought up abroad in the fields, and taught to rouſe the ſavage lyon from his den, and to follow deeds of armes, and not to ſpend their time within doores, in a private chamber croſſing their armes, and crying heyho to ſee the ſtrangeneſſe of loves laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths.</p>
            <p>Not farre from this caſtle, there was a ſpacious and thicke wood, ſo frequently beſet with aged oakes, and ſtraight uprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red pines, as if Lady Nature had entended to make that place as a common arbour for the neighbouring region; &amp; ſo indeede it was uſed, for thither reſorted the chiefeſt perſons of the land, women and

mutually to aide one another, and in this reſolution, they left the wood, and went home to their caſtle.</p>
            <p>Long it was not, ere they learned who, and what their ſweethearts were, wherupon they grew into acquaintance with old <hi>Clydamas,</hi> which was not hard for them to doe, they being men of ſo great note, and he a man of ſo affable a nature, that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly intertained the acquaintance of any, that were vertuouſly given, howſoever ſtrangers, ſo that he thought himſelfe to be highly graced, to bee familiar with two ſuch men as <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydore:</hi> and they thought themſelves no leſſe happie, in being entertained into the friendſhip of <hi>Clydamas.</hi>

            <p>I cannot tell whether you have heard reported, how in former times, the gods had bleſſed mee with a paire of ſonnes,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16805:13"/>
whom I cannot praiſe, becauſe it was my hard fortune to looſe them, before either themſelves could tell what honour meant, or I, or indeede any man tell, to what end the fates had reſerved them, yet was their expectation great with all men: for being but nine yeares old, they gave forth ſuch evident ſignes of a hopefull valour, that it amazed ſtrangers, &amp; joyed me exceedingly, to heare how they were generally praiſed, even in their childiſh exerciſes; but now begins the tragedy (&amp; with that the teares trickled downe his faire white beard) for as they were playing together on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, certaine Sea-rovers eſpying them, tooke them and forcibly carried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourd their gally, preſently hoiſting up their ſailes and getting away, maugre all our endeavours, who preſently made after them with what ſpeede wee might, but to no purpoſe, for they labouring with ſaile and oare, ſo farre outſtripped us that it was impoſſible for us to overtake them, and therefore ſeeing that we laboured in vaine, with ſorrowfull hearts wee turned backe againe, leaving my deare children behind, of whom ſince then I never heard any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16805:14"/>
This ſorrow comming to the mothers eare, who was then great with child and neere her time, it ſo wrought on her, that ſhe preſently fell in travile, and in travile died, yet did ſhe leave (to comfort my old age) theſe two daughters whom you know, and indeede they have beene hitherto a comfort to mee, I will not ſay too much of them, becauſe they are mine owne: yet thus much I may ſay, that they are vertuous, and ſince the gods have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft me of my ſonnes, I ſuppoſe they have in ſome ſort made me a recompence, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on me ſuch daughters, as may by their fortunate marriages inrich mee with two noble ſonnes in law, and thoſe I have determined to be you, if you can like of them, or if your affections be not ſetled otherwhere; thinke them not the worſe becauſe they are profered, but thinke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is a ſure preſage of a following good, to have a full aſſent on all parts, for how ever I give you my conſent, yet doe I limit it to your and their liking; for I will not bee the maker of inforſt matches; therefore if you have heeretofore, or doe now newly, entertaine any liking to my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16805:14"/>
daughters, here you have my conſent, as eſteeming you worthy ſonnes in law, whom I have found to bee ſuch worthy friends; on therefore freely, and if you like them, woe them, for mine owne part, now I have given you thus much way, I will be neither a hindrance, nor a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to your attempts, but either betake himſelfe to his beſt cunning.</p>
            <p>You may imagine, it was ſome comfort to the poore lovers to have ſuch a way laid open to them, for well they knew that it was requiſite to get the fathers good will, if they would have the match pleaſing and fortunate, therefore without any further circumſtances, <hi>Cleanthes</hi> in the name of himſelfe, and his friend <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> thus ſpake.</p>
            <p>For the love worthy ſir which you have had to us, wee are rather to thanke your goodneſſe, then any deſerts in our ſelves, your age being more apt to fancy where you finde the leaſt occaſion of lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then our youth able to merit any thing to make you fancy us, howſoever we are the more bound to you, for inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with your love, that have no title

to lay claime to it by. Of the unhappy loſſe of your hopefull ſonnes, ſome glimmering of knowledge we have had heretofore, but never the truth till now from your ſelfe, in which you have related ſuch a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed race of ſorrow, knit up with ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a period of joy, that if your report urged teares from us, your concluſion was of ſufficiency to dry them; the loſſe of your ſonnes was much, the loſſe of your wife much, and indeede I know not which we ſhould eſteeme the greater loſſe, but for theſe two loſſes, the Gods have returned you a large reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence, foure for three, two daughters (whom I know not whether the earth can paralel) for one wife, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their owne inherent excellencyes) bring with them two husbands, which though they cannot equal your own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet may they in ſome ſort bring a comfort to your aged yeares.

To anſwer you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with what a ſympathie our affection meet, you cannot be ſo willing to have us your sonnes, as we (if your faire daughters be but gratious as I hope they will) are deſirous to call you father.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Cleanthes</hi> had uttered in words, <hi>Polydore</hi> failed not to teſtifie for himſelfe, by the pleaſing geſture of his countenance, which the good old man perceiving, it did ſo wrap him in joy, that the teares ranne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16805:16"/>
trickling downe his white beard, his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gladded heart not being able to containe in it ſelfe ſo ſuddaine an extaſy of joy, at ſo great a felicity (as he eſteemed it) to have <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> for his ſonnes in law, which they taking for a ſure preſage of a fortunate event, it made them ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with him in delight, though their eyes did not teſtifie it with ſuch teares of joy as his did, their youthfull fire being better able to dry up thoſe flouds of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing paſſion then the froſt of age; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without more a doe, they deſired him only to aide them thus far, as to help them to the ſpeech of the maides, and they did not doubt of a happie ſucceſſe, which hee willingly agreeing unto, promiſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme accordingly. But becauſe it was then to late, the ſunne being almoſt gone to hide himſelfe in the booſome of <hi>Tethis,</hi> he invited them to a courſe ſupper and a hard bed (as he termed it) and there for that night the lovers tooke up their Inne.</p>
            <p>All ſupper time did they ſit gazing on their miſtreſſes, feeding on their eyes more then on the Cates that was before them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16805:16"/>
that it was a meriment to old <hi>Clidamas</hi> to ſee them ſo attentive, and to heare them anſwer ſo impertinently to every queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he askt of them, yet would he finde out pleaſant diſcourſe to beguile the time, and thus ſupper was paſſed over; after with muſicke and dancing, and other delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures, they wore away the howers till bed time, &amp; then lights being brought they were conducted to their chambers. Faine would the youths have beene pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing their skill in Venus warfare, but the company of gueſts then preſent denied them opportunity, therefore awaiting for a fitter houre, they betooke them to their lodging; for reſt I cannot call it, their minds being ſo diſtracted betweene joy and feare; joy for the fathers willingneſſe, feare for the daughters miſlike if it ſhould happen; that they debard their eyes from the leaſt ſlumber, yet was the fancy of joy the ſtronger, as having the ſurer ground, which ſo filled their heads with pleaſing immaginations, that themſelves I thinke (had they beene askt the queſtion) could not have recounted them.</p>
            <p>The burning hoofes of <hi>Apollowes</hi> firce-breathing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16805:17"/>
ſteeds, had not as yet attained the lower pavement of the vaulted hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, and roſy fingerd <hi>Aurora</hi> had but newly ſtrewd the way for the King of lights, when the two lovers (wearie of their reſtleſſe beds) perceiving the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings bluſh through the chamber window, aroſe, and apparrelling themſelves went downe to receive the freſh mornings aire in the garden; but all their earlineſſe could not outſtrippe the wakefull <hi>Clydamas,</hi> who was the continuall morning cock to the whole houſe, who ſeeing the two lovers comming towards him, with a merry countenance gave them the bonjour thus.</p>
            <p>So early up, nay then I ſee, you will bee ſure ſpeeders that are ſo early riſers; See, how the ſunne comes ſtealing over yon hill, dying his cheekes with bluſhes as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamd to be outſtript by mortalls; Rather he teacheth us (ſaid <hi>Polydore</hi>) to bluſh for ſuffering our ſelves to be ſurpaſt by you, that ſhould rather bee at reſt, then thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſo ſoone before the day, young bloods may better indure watching then weake age: Indeede (ſaid <hi>Clydamas</hi> yong men that have the ſame watchbel that you

have, can worſe indure their beds then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that want it, and commenly where ther's a lover in the houſe there needs no other cock to call up the reſt, but otherwiſe youth loves their eaſe, and to nouriſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a morning nap, when old men rather deſire to feede (as it were) on the freſh aire without doores; yet the caſe goes ill of our ſides (ſaith <hi>Cleanthes</hi>) for though we have the watchbell which you talke of, yet either it went falſe, or wee minded it not, for me thinkes for all our larum, you are got up before us.</p>
            <p>With ſuch like pleaſing conference they paſſed on the time till <hi>Clydamas</hi> perceived his daughters were come into the garden, whereupon taking the two friends by the hands he thus incouraged them: Yonder is the game, and you are skilfull huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, upon them then, and if you miſſe them, blame not me for negligence, but your ſelves for ſlothfulneſſe, that had the game in view, and yet loſt it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he parted from them.</p>
            <p>Who then had looked on the lovers, might have perceived a maidenly bluſh overſpread their cheekes, as afraid of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16805:18"/>
having never beene trained in <hi>Cupids</hi> military diſcipline, yet gathering their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits together, and arming themſelves with their greateſt reſolution, they approched nigh and taking them by the hands kindly gave them the good morrow, which they with a modeſt bluſh returned. Whereupon <hi>Cleanthes</hi> taking his faire <hi>Calanthia</hi> by the hand, whilſt <hi>Polydore</hi> did the like to his deare <hi>Florella</hi> thus accoſted her.</p>
            <p>If what I ſpeake (beautious <hi>Calanthia</hi>) be not ſo powdered with art, as may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the tender tympane of a Ladyes eare, impute it to the fault of war, that teacheth her ſchollers no better language: yet thus much may my ſimpleneſſe in that kinde gaine me, that wanting colour to daube my meaning over with, my truth will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more naked and cleare. I love thee deare <hi>Callanthia;</hi> nay ſtart not ſweet, love is not ſuch a bugbeare to affright a Lady with, time was when I my ſelfe would have laught at the name of <hi>Cupid,</hi> as if he had beene as lame as hee is blind: but ſince, his piercing ſhaft hath made ſo large a wound, that I feare it never will be healed, unleſſe you proove the gracious
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16805:18"/>
phiſitian and cure me; It was the wiſedom of the gods (divine <hi>Calanthia</hi>) to make man and woman, ſo framing them, that it is almoſt impoſſible for them to live aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for if either had beene made alone, how ſhould the ſpacious fabrick of the world have beene ſupplied with inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants? or if when both had beene made, they might have lived aſunder, to what end had ſerved mans affibility? or thoſe excellencies that are in women? they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained therefore that man and woman ſhould be joyned together, that mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall harſhneſſe might bee molified with womans tenderneſſe, and womans weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might bee upheld by mans ſtrength. Now ſince this is the pleaſure of the gods, (my deare) be not you diſpleaſing to them, by obſtinate refuſing to ſubmit your ſelfe to their decree: but agree to bee my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and I (more then willingly) will conſent to bee thy man, give mee thy love as freely, as I aske it honeſtly, for farre from me, be the thought of villany; I know it is the faſhion of maidens to bee coy, and hard to bee wonne at firſt, and ſome fooles I know there are, that eſteeme

a woman light if ſhe bee wonne at the firſt onſet, but truſt me <hi>Calanthia,</hi> I am of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, for never could a thouſand yeares of growth, nouriſh a truer love in any lovers breſt, then a minuts ſight hath bred in mine: for no ſooner did your eyes ſparkle on mine, but from thoſe eyes of yours, <hi>Cupid</hi> let fly his golden headed arrow at my heart, and why then may not a minuts talke, breede as true a love as a minuts ſight: delay not then my deare <hi>Calanthia,</hi> but yeeld thy ſelfe without any further circumſtance, for by thy love, (which is an oath that I would ſooner die then breake) I ſhall account thee more wiſe and conſtant, as wanting thoſe arts which cunning women have, by fained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſalls to draw poore beſotted youths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fooles paradiſe, my requeſt is faire and honeſt, thy gracious love, to bee conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by a happy marriage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee ceaſed, griping her faire hand within his ſo hard, as if he would have her feele his meaning as well as heare it.</p>
            <p>But the excellent <hi>Calanthia</hi> (who was as faire as any that the ſunne ere lookt on, and yet more gracious then faire, and as

            <p>Worthy Sir, if warre teach her Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers no worſe language then ſhee hath taught you, ſhee neede not bee aſhamed of them; for beleeve me ſir, (and let theſe bluſhes teſtifie for me) I know not how, but your words have ſo wrought with mee, that I never felt the like paſſions in my ſelfe, as I do at this time, if you deceive me be it on your owne head, I am the ſilly fiſh eaſily caught with a faire bait, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I could have held off longer, and would have done, (though I imagine what torments I ſhould have undergone) but your proteſtations have ſo farre prevailed with mee, that you ſee how eaſily I am wonne to yeeld you up the fort of my chaſt love, almoſt without the leaſt batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which if it be a fault; (as I know not how you may eſteeme it,) blame your owne tongue for having ſo much power to overcome me.</p>
            <p>Bleſt be my tongue ſaid <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> for having ſo much power, and bleſt bee love for making thy heart ſo pliable; but more then bleſt bee thy deare ſelfe, (excellent

               <hi>Calanthia</hi>) for inriching me with ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and enſtimable a treaſure as thy love; when I am falſe or once thinke a thought of deceiving thee, may all the plagues of love and jealouſie light on this heart, and never bee removed. O happie preſage of a moſt fortunate end, in ſo bleſt a beginning; what man can have more cauſe of joy then <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> when he ſhall fold in his armes ſo delicate a bride as is <hi>Callanthia;</hi> for ever will I conſecrate this day to pleaſure, &amp; the ſprightly <hi>Cupid,</hi> dul bloody warre, when did I ever feele ſuch an extaſy of joy in all thy ſervice, when I came home laden with the ſpoyles of foes, crowned with tryumphant bayes, and all the ſouldiers crying out <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> the mortall <hi>Mars</hi> that leades <hi>victory</hi> bound in an iron chaine, that ſhee dares not but attend on him, victory, victory to the great <hi>Cleanthes;</hi> yet have I rid one drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and dull, no more ſtird with theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious acclamations, then if they had not belonged to me; yet here for the glory of one cumbate in the field of Love, my heart dances to the muſicke of <hi>Callanthias</hi> voice, chaunt on my deere <hi>Callanthia</hi> and never

            <p>
               <hi>Callanthia</hi> ſeeing into what an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of joy imagination had led him, thought to give him a kind of cooling card, and therefore ſpake to this effect.</p>
            <p>Let not my words <hi>Cleanthes</hi> make you to looſe your ſelfe, for my poſition was generall, in regard of mine owne will, yet is it not without a lemitation; you know that beſides the liberty of my free will, I have the obedience of a child impoſed on me, and beleeve me, that howſoever I fare (as indeede I thinke I ſhall not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you) his will ſhall be the limits of my affection, beyond which I will on no termes wander; get therefore his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and you have mine.</p>
            <p>This was ſo farre from abating any thing of <hi>Celanthes</hi> his joy, that it augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it rather, which he was about to utter, and tell her that he had her fathers good will already, but that <hi>Clidamas</hi> (who all this while hard all their talke) perceiving already that <hi>Polydore</hi> had wrought his Lady <hi>Florella</hi> to the ſame point, ſtepped out, and put them together with theſe or the like benidictions.</p>

            <p>The next care was in providing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie things for the wedding, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the day, which for the convenient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the celebration, was deferred till a moneth after: till when let us leave them, and in the meane goe a while to ſea, to heare (if we can) ſome tidings of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo,</hi> the loſt ſonnes of old <hi>Clydamas</hi> who as you heard himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, were ſtolen away in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by ſea rovers; but before wee enter into the diſcourſe of their fortunes, it is requiſite that we looke into the paſſage of an age, or two before.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſea coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> there
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16805:21"/>
ſtands an auncient and renowned citie, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally knowne to Merchants, called <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> in which ſometime their raigned a King (or a tyrant rather) named <hi>Mariab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela:</hi> This monſter (for ſo wee may call him more juſtly then a man) not content to wallow, and glut himſelfe in ſuch ſins as might have ſome excuſe, or agreed ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with the courſe of nature, went on yet further, letting looſe the reines to his voluptuous appetite, jeſting at the majeſty of the Gods, and thinking them to be idle fictions of witles heads, to make fooles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of doing that, which might content their ſenſuality.</p>
            <p>So far proceeded his enormous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as to the deflowring of his own daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, a maiden ſo exceedingly beautifull, and ſo excellently vertuous, that ſhee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a faire roſe ſprung from a crooked brier; yet neither her excellent beauty, (which would have molified a tiger) nor her admirable vertues (which would have moved any but a devill) could purchaſe any remorſe in this helliſh tyrant; thrice did ſhe conjure him by the name of father, to deſiſt from ſo unhumaine a villany, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16805:22"/>
yet thrice did the feind reject the name of father and would not heare; thrice did ſhe provoke him by the paines of her carefull mother, that he would not let thoſe many labours imployed to bring her up vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, to periſh and come to nothing by his beaſtlineſſe, and yet thrice did the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous wretch withſtand thoſe exccellent provocations; becauſe they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him from his beaſtlineſſe: thrice did ſhee ſtirre him by the ſence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, telling him how unmanly it was to offer violence to a tender virgin, much more for a father to offer villany to his owne child, and yet thrice did he refuſe theſe motions, ſetting more by the fruition of his inceſtuous luſt, then by the credit of manhood, ſo that (perforce) taking her in his armes he carried her into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whilſt ſhee poore ſoule with bitter cries, and many a brine-ſalt teare, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aide from the Gods; but all in vaine, for the inſatiate devill having her there in his power, villanouſly raviſh't her; but then his luſtfull liking turned to a mortall hate, loathing the perſon but not the fact, ſo that throwing off all pitty of a man, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16805:22"/>
before hee had done of a father, hee drew his ſword, and while the ſweete angellike creature ſate bewailing her loſt honour, the cruell devill moſt unhumainely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered her, and commanding preſently to raiſe a rumour of her ſuddaine death, in moſt pompious manner he ſolemnized her funerall, where the diſſembling crocadile ſhed ſuch a multitude of falſe teares, that he made the moſt hearts preſent to condole with him, his infinite loſſe in ſo precious a daughter.</p>
            <p>Yet could not all his cunning clooke his wickedneſſe from the all-ſeeing eyes of the divine powers, for though hee ſcaped corporall plagues, yet was his minde ſo diſtracted with hideous thoughts, and the everlaſting gripes of a guilty conſcience, as if a thouſand devills had taken up their habitation in his boſome, nor could the comfort of ſleepe any thing benefit him, for no ſooner were his eyes cloſed, but his imagination preſented him with gaſtly viſions and horred dreames; amongſt the reſt, one night hee dreamt that hee ſaw his daughter comming towards him with her haire diſhevel'd about her eares, and her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16805:23"/>
eyes flaming like fire, in her hand a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whip, with which ſhe laſht him in moſt cruell manner, with horrour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of crying out amaine, ſpare me <hi>Carapreſa</hi> he waked; and yet ſtill was his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo throughly poſſeſt with terror of thoſe burning laſhes, that hee ranne about the chamber like a mad man, crying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on <hi>Carapreſa</hi> to hold her hands, which the guard (that ordinarily watcht about the chamber) hearing, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruſhed in upon him, and by violence held him, till being ſomething come to himſelfe, they left him, and hee went to bed againe.</p>
            <p>In ſuch like tortures did hee ſpend his time, ſo that growing weary of his life, and indeed deſperate, not caring what ſhould happen to him, he gave himſelf over to delights, and ſuch paſtime as were of moſt likelihood to drive away ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome thoughts; at laſt (by what meanes I know not) it came into his head to have a great deſire to know to what end the fates had reſerved him, this fancy growing ſtronger and ſtronger, hee ſent two of his truſtieſt ſervants to the oracle of <hi>Iupiter
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16805:23"/>
Ammon</hi> to know his deſtiny, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before the Alter, and offering their gifts according to the cuſtome, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the oracle this anſwer.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The man that <hi>Tunis</hi> doth command,</l>
               <l>Shall fall by a <hi>Sicilian</hi> hand.</l>
            </q>
            <p>With this ſhort anſwer they returned home againe, where delivering the King their ſcroule, he read it, &amp; plainely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how evidently his deſtiny was figured out, he preſently gave command, that all <hi>Sicilians</hi> ſhould within a moneths ſpace, voide the country on paine of death, if any were found after the moneths end; he himſelfe in the meane time walking ſtrongly guarded, admitting none into his company or ſervice, untill hee had throughly examined him, what, and of whence he was, not caring of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they were, ſo they were not <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this he ſent out his gallies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhips of warre to ſurpriſe al <hi>Sicilians,</hi> without reſpect of age, ſexe, or degree, ſo that by theſe meanes the <hi>Mediteranian</hi> ſea
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16805:24"/>
was ſo haunted, as no one durſt venture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he went extraordinarily ſtrongly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the aſſault, for under colour of ſurpriſing <hi>Sicilians,</hi> theſe rovers ſet on all that they ſaw, ranſacking ſhip and goods, ſlaying ſome of the men, and ſending the others to the ſhore naked and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
            <p>One of theſe gallies it was, that ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the two children as they were playing by the ſea ſhore, for eſpying them, and ſuppoſing that the King would give them an extraordinary reward, for adventuring to fetch them out of their country, when ſo largely he recompenced thoſe that tooke any on the ſea, they put it to the venture, and ſwiftly ruſhing out of their gally, they carried them away, maugre all that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants could doe.</p>
            <p>Thus with their rich booty (as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it) they ſayled on, being carried with a merry gale of wind, till they came within the ſight of <hi>Tunis,</hi> but then, on a ſuddaine the wind changed quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that it was impoſſible for them to approach to the ſhore, and preſenly upon it, aroſe ſo vehement a tempeſt, as if heaven
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16805:24"/>
and earth would have met together, to the confuſion of the weather beaten gally, the winds ſtorm'd, the ſeas roar'd, the ſhippe crackt, and the men howl'd for anguiſh, making a moſt confuſed &amp; hideous noyſe, the day grew darke, and the Sunne wrapt up his face in his clowded mantle, as loth to ſee the confuſion of mankind, the moone and the ſtarres, lookt gazing out of their ſpheres, wondering to ſee the cruelty of enraged <hi>Aeolus,</hi> to the generall amazement of all the diſtracted beholders, to ſee the Moone uſurpe the Sunnes office, and the ſignes of midnight, when it ſhould bee noone.</p>
            <p>To adde to the horred noyſe of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging waters, ſometimes were heard the ſuddaine crackes of furious thunderbolts, which compared with the harſh grumbling of the turbulent ſea, ſeemed like the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of ſome great peice of ordinance amongſt a volly of ſmall ſhot. The ſhippe in the meane time violently tumbled up and downe, by the continuall agitation of the troubled ocean, now mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as if it would never leave aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, till it had toucht the clouds, and by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16805:25"/>
and by downe againe, as if it would never leave falling till it came to the loweſt hell, the amaz'd ſaylors, not knowing which way to turne them in ſo urgent an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, were inforced to commit ſhip, lives, goods, and all, to the mercy of the winds and ſea, therefore taking downe all their ſayles they lay hulling up and downe, as the tempeſt drove, carefully expecting a more proſperous gale; but in vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they any comfort, for on the ſecond night after the tempeſt began, they were ſet a ground on the coaſt of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who had then ſeene the diſtracted marriners, would have thought them mortal foes, rather then combined friends, ſo did every one beſtirre himſelfe in this danger, ſnatching out of his fellowes hand that which hee thought would ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not caring who periſhed ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe eſcaped: amongſt the reſt the young lads ſhifted for themſelves, as well as their tender age would give them leave, for ſeeing how every one provided for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, no man regarding them, they thought that they ſhould doe the like too, and therefore getting up into the upper decke,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16805:25"/>
(becauſe that place was onely free from water,) they remained there till that alſo began to be poſſeſſed by the incroaching ocean, but then, as it were inſpired with a riper wit, which it may be the ſight of the preſent danger had lent them, they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that to ſtay longer in the ſhip, nothing was to be expected but moſt certaine ruine, &amp; therefore eſpying a cheſt which by good fortune was in the place (as they had ſeene others doe) they threw themſelves and it into the ſea, intreating <hi>Neptune</hi> to bee gentle to them, becauſe they were but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and had never done him wrong.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed that <hi>Neptune</hi> heard their prayers, for ere breake of day they were caſt on ſhore half dead hard by <hi>Tarragona,</hi> where an old fiſherman (who about ſome buſineſſe was come ſo early to the ſea ſide) found them, and being moved with tender commiſeration of their misfortunes, hee ranne to them, and uſed ſuch diligence that he recovered life in them, yet long it was ere they could call to mind how they came there, but at laſt remembring the ſhip and the ſtorme at ſea, they asked the old man what was become of the ſhip; but hee
<pb facs="tcp:16805:26"/>
perceiving them to be faint, carried them home with him, and told them that the ſhip would come againe one day, and till then they ſhould dwell with him, which they according to their childiſh ſimplicity preſently conſcented to.</p>
            <p>Thus were theſe two children ſaved from the ſwords tyranny by the cruell mercy of the angry ſea, the other that were in the ſhip were either drowned, or if they eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to the land they fell into the hands of the inhabitants, who hated them deadly, as being ſubjects to the tyrant <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abdela.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good old <hi>Sancho</hi> (for ſo was the fiſherman called) perciving by divers que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, who and what his orphans were, regarded them the more charily, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when occaſion ſhould ſerve to carry them home againe to <hi>Sicily,</hi> which hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped might be a meanes of bettering his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, by a good recompence which hee made account to obtaine, by preſenting their father with ſo worthy a gift.</p>
            <p>It fortuned, that about ſome two or three yeares after, the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> Lord Admirall of <hi>Spaine,</hi> having
<pb facs="tcp:16805:26"/>
beene upon a ſervice to ſcoure the Sea of pyrats, for want of water and freſh victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, happened to put into that haven, where comming himſelfe aſhore, he chaunced to eſpie <hi>Martuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo</hi> as they were comming from ſchoole, when preſently he tooke ſuch a liking to them that he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them whoſe children they were, they (as they were taught by old <hi>Sancho</hi>) made anſwer they were his, whereupon the Duke commanding him to be ſent for, requeſted him to let him have his two children, which the good old man hearing, and glad to preferre them to ſo honorable a man, (becauſe he knew not when his owne eſtate would be ſufficient to carry them to <hi>Sicily</hi>) willingly condeſended unto, and therefore taking them aſide thus ſpake unto them.</p>
            <p>My ſonnes (ſaid he) for ſo I may juſtly call you, as having given you a ſecond life from the ſeas cruelty, and my care of you ſince that time, hath beene little leſſe then that of a father, you are old enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine my counſell, and of underſtanding ſufficient to put it in practiſe, you ſee how the meanes that the Gods have lent me is ſo

ſmall, that it is onely ſufficient to keepe us, ſo that I know not whether ever I ſhall be able, to convey you home to your owne father or no; ſee therefore my deare childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how the Gods have provided for you, in moving the heart of the great Duke of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Sidonia</hi> to fancy you, a man mighty in power, &amp; great in authority, under whom you may ſooner get meanes of tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your country, then by ſtaying here with me, goe with him my boyes, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Gods to give you as many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as there are ſorrowes in my poore heart to part with you, were it not that I know it is for your greater good: yet wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſhall go, or howſoever the fates ſhall diſpoſe of you, remember old <hi>Sancho</hi> your poore foſter father; laſtly, it will not be amiſſe for you to entertaine my counſell in this to, whenſoever folkes ſhall aske you what or whoſe ſons you are, you may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, a poore fiſhermans on the coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for if you be knowne to be <hi>Sicilians</hi> it will go hard, but the tyrant <hi>Mariabdela</hi> of whom you have heard tell, will worke ſome meanes to get you into his clutches for the whole ſea is full of his warlike ſhips,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16805:27"/>
and hee accounts not the loſſe of his ſhips, equall to the purchaſe of one <hi>Sicilian,</hi> ſo monſtrouſly doth he hate your nation: but by terming your ſelves my children, you may go for <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; ſo eſcape the feare of any ſuch danger, beſides going under my name, you may much benefit mee, for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall take a liking to you, cannot chuſe but favour the father of ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, goe one therefore on Gods name, and whatſoever become of you, remember to ſhew your ſelves to bee nobly borne, rather by your vertuous and noble acts, then by your owne report.</p>
            <p>When hee made an end of his counſell he kiſſed their tender cheekes, the teares ſtanding in his eyes, as loth to part with his pritty children, and they alſo crying ripe, not willing to leave their loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in this ſort he delivered them to the Duke, who gave him a great reward for them, which nothing diſpleaſed the old man: Sometime they lived with the Duke at ſea, till the ſea being ſufficiently ſcoured as he thought, he returned home to <hi>Biſcay,</hi> where the two children grew up ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation in beauty, ſtature, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16805:28"/>
ſtrength, that it much delighted the good Duke to ſee them, their greateſt delight wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to beſtride great horſes, and when their age began to be able to endure it, they gave themſelves wholy to deeds of armes, haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juſts &amp; tournaments, which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing frequent, where continually they carried themſelves ſo well, that they ſtill came off with honour, to the exceeding comfort of the Duke, and admiration of all that beheld them, to ſee ſuch admirable worth in ſo young yeares.</p>
            <p>Thus ſometime they lived in this faſhion of life, till it was rumord in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> that a certaine Pyrat name <hi>Martoll,</hi> went roving up and downe the Levant, ſeizing on all the ſhips that came in his way, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhips, that came from <hi>Candy,</hi> laden with wines: Theſe tidings were beyound meaſure welcome to bold <hi>Martuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo,</hi> as hoping now to put in practiſe, what they had al this while been learning, ſo that no ſooner had the Duke given commandement for the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the gallyes to be ſet out againſt the pyrats, but they came to him, and with humble earneſtnes beſought him to let them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16805:28"/>
waite on him in this expedition, which he ſeeing their forwardneſſe conſented to.</p>
            <p>The winds blew faire, and all things were prepared for the purpoſe, whereupon they preſently went aboard, leaving the ſhore full of people praying for their good ſucceſſe; with pleaſant gaile they ſailed on, till they came over againſt <hi>Zante</hi> where one from the top diſcerned ſayles, and thereupon gave warning to the men below, to make ready for the fight, for hee had now evidently diſcried that they were <hi>Martolls</hi> gallyes, whereupon every man fell cloſely to his buſineſſe, ſome to fitting the ſayles, others to raiſe up defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies, others to reare their engines of battery, wherewith they would ſend whole ſhowres of ſtones &amp; arrowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the foes, others making ready their grapling to lay hold of the adverſe ſhips, if peradventure they came to boarding, who had then ſeene, the two young <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> would have thought they had beene going to a feaſt, rather then to a diſmall and unuſuall fight; their greateſt care was to ſee, whether their ſworde were ſharpe enough, as for their armour they did not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16805:29"/>
ſo much regarded it, yet knowing by their little experience, that it was not the leaſt duty of a valient man, to looke well to his owne defence, they provided for that too, making every thing as ſure as they might, that the enemie might not have too much advantage againſt them; thus being armed in compleate harneſſe they came before the Admirall, who ſeeing and praiſing their courage aſſigned them their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>No leſſe were the Pyrats buſied, for <hi>Martoll</hi> being a man of great experience, and having beene in many ſea fights, knew that now he was to uſe an other manner of proceeding, and a greater care then in the ordinary ſurpriſall of a weake Marchant, and therefore with as great care and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as was poſſible, providing all things either for offence or defence, he incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his men with theſe or the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

            <p>Amongſt all this confuſion the two <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi> behaved themſelves beyond won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as if <hi>Mars,</hi> and his ſiſter <hi>Bellona</hi> had aſſumed the ſhapes of youths &amp; come to aide the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and not as if they had beene but pupills in the feates of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, all the while before it came to boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ſtood ſtill, incouraging on thoſe that wrought in the engines, but no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were the grapling yrons caſt out, &amp; the ſhips intangled together, but they leapt both together into the Admirall of the Pyrats, and in ſpight of all oppoſition, with their ſwords they laid about them luſtily, quickly ſcouring the hatches and making a way for others to follow them: which <hi>Martoll</hi> ſeeing, perceiving that now or never he was to uſe his uttermoſt valour, like a chafed bore, hee leapt to him that was next him, which happened to bee

            </p>
            <p>Till this time had the fight continued in an equall ballance, Fortune her ſelfe ſcarce knowing on which ſide the dice would runne; but no ſooner did the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats ſee their chiefe Captaines fal (like huge towers) on the bloody hatches, but their hearts died within them, and they ſtood ſtill and unmou'd, like thoſe men that <hi>Meduſa's</hi> head transformed into ſtones, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this advantage the <hi>Spanyards</hi> tooke freſh courage, and afreſh boording them, they entred almoſt without reſiſtance, and being whetted on with rage, they made ſuch havocke as would have moov'd hard rockes to pittie. What pen is able to relate the extreme confuſion of that houre, the Pyrats cryed out mercy, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> cryed out <hi>Victoria;</hi> yet could not the ones cryes obtaine mercy, nor was the others victory without exceſſe of blood: the ſea

            <p>Due thankes being rendred unto the Gods for ſo great a victory, the Duke who by chance had ſeene the latter end of the fight, between the foure brave combatants, called <hi>Martuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo</hi> before him, and after a multitude of exceſſive praiſes for their admirable valour, hee rewarded their worths with the honour of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whether he joyed more that victory was wonne, or wonne by them, I know not; once his joy was ſo ſuper-exceeding, that he claſped them about the neckes, and welcom'd them with ſo naturall a love, as if he had beene their owne father; ſo did their noble acts worke on his pliant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p>The day drew nigh, and every thing was in a forwardneſſe, when it fortuned (ſuch is the frailety of humane eſtates) that it was croſſed by an unlucky accident. Not farre off their liv'd two brothers, famous

for nothing but infamie, the one named <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> and the other <hi>Pollipus,</hi> who were ſo commonly noted for lewd livers, and licentious libertines, that every man of any good condition hated their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, yet were they ſtrong and hardy, as ſometime wee ſee, nature gives her good gifts to bad men, and keepes them from thoſe that would imploy them to better purpoſes; ſo was it with them, for their force they imployed in oppreſſing the weake, and if they were valiant, it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the executing of ſome villany, rapes and murthers were common with them, oppreſſion and wrong were their daily leſſons that they never left practiſing: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wealth they had, partly by inheritance from their anceſtors, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten by extorting uſury.</p>
            <p>Theſe paire of excellent creatures hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to eſpie <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella</hi> as they walked in the fields, and were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtricken with their love, with violence whereof (their luſtfull deſire not being able to compriſe it ſelfe in any reaſonable limits) they grew almoſt mad, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their longings, love or luſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>One day ere the morne expected the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of <hi>Apollo</hi> from the bed of the ſeas Queene, old <hi>Clidamas</hi> rouſed up the lovers from their early beds, to hunt the ſtagge in the neighbouring forreſt, the huntſmen quaintly attired all in greene, with their hornes about their neckes, and their jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins in their hands, ſtood at the entring of the wood to welcome them with the ſound of their merry bugles, their eager bloodhounds longing for the pray, ſtood whining as angry to bee kept ſo ſhort: the two gentlewomen mounted on a couple of ſwift palfries rode like a paire of <hi>Diana's</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:16805:36"/>
nimphes, gaurded with a troope of luſty Sylvanes: the game was a foot, and the following dogs with a gallant cry, made the ſhrill Ecco bable to the woods, a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that ſhee undeſtood not, poore ſilly wat frighted with the noyſe, ſtretched out his ſmal legs to their utmoſt length, and with a pace outſtripping <hi>Boreas,</hi> he taught the lazy curres to paſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſwift careeres, the merry huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with their lowd hallowes encouraged on the eager perſuers.</p>

and ſorrowfull hearts, conſidering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperateneſſe of their eſtate, <hi>Calanthia</hi> in the name of her ſelfe and her ſiſter made this anſwer.</p>
            <p>Blame us not (great <hi>Horſmiſda</hi> and you renowned <hi>Polipus</hi>) if what wee account ſo deere, we are ſo loth to part with, conſider there is nothing ſo precious to a woman, as her virginity: neither is there any thing that ſhee can call her owne after ſhee hath loſt that, then condemne us not if ſelfe love make us ſo chary of that which is our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſure: yet for your ſakes (if bluſhes would give me leave) I would part with it, upon one condition, and it is but a ſmall one, that you will grant us time to bewaile the loſſe of our honour, and afterwards wee will yeeld our ſelves up to your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: if you refuſe to grant us this poore requeſt, know, this knife ſhall ſooner end my dayes, rather then you ſhall enjoy the leaſt favour from us, and of this reſolve your ſelves.</p>
            <p>This anſwer was ſo pleaſing to them who beleev'd ſhee had ſpoken as ſhee thought, and therefore kiſſing them over and over, they granted foure dayes ſpace,

(which was the time of their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and in which they look't for helpe) but the brothers bewitch't with joy and delight, thought verily that not any man had ſeene them, or if they were deſcried, truſting to the ſtrength of their caſtle, with hearts overcharged with delightfull fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they left the ſiſters together; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now alone, and looking more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the certainety of their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger, it made the ſalt teares trickle down their faire cheekes, ſad ſilence lock't up their ruby lips, and impriſoned their griefes in the delicate priſon of their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low breaſts, till at laſt the ſweet <hi>Florella</hi> (whoſe ſweetneſſe ſurpaſſed the faireneſſe of the morning) uttered her griefe in this dolefull manner.</p>

aroſe, and doing (more than uſuall) devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the riſing ſunne, they went to the chamber of the ſorrowfull ſiſters, whom they found up and ready, as loth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a bed, by ſuch as they, though they wiſh't it had been otherwiſe, yet not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring much for it, the luſtfull brothers fell to dallying with them, which they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not give them the leaſt pleaſure, being determined to dye, rudely repulſed, yet ſtill new batteries were layd to their fortes of chaſtitie, which were ſtill beate backe as violently as they were preſented ſhameleſly; at laſt growing paſt patience by ſo many (as they call'd them) injuries, <hi>Horniſda</hi> in a great chaſe thus thundred. 'Tis true I ſay, that too much familiaritie begets contempt, elſe had not our gentle loves beene refuſed, if wee had uſed ſuch meanes as was becomming us, but ſince faire meanes can worke nothing with ſuch waſpes as you, wee will try our owne way, and ſee if wee can get that by force, which wee could not by intreaty. Foule devill (replyed <hi>Callanthia</hi>) doe thy worſt, 'tis not thy terrifying threats that can diſmay us or alter our determinations,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16805:40"/>
for know that wee are reſolved to dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to yeeld to thy villanie. Yet you ſhall dye (ſaid hee) but firſt will I have my fill of you, then perchance, my ſword ſhall bee ſo mercifull as to rid you out of the world, in the meane time let you and I ſtrive for maſterie, and therewith he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently tooke her by the haire, as <hi>Polipus</hi> did the like to the tender <hi>Florella,</hi> forcibly dragging them to the beds ſide, whil'ſt thus (poore ſoules) made what ſhift they could to defend themſelves: and praying to the juſt God to lend them ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to reſiſt thoſe tyrants.</p>
            <p>Now was their forces loſt, and the cruel wretches had almoſt laid them on the lothed beds, when on a ſudden they were ſcared with the noiſe of a hideous outcry, the caſtle was up in an uproare, and every man cryed arme, arme; whereupon, the brothers fearing what might happen, and making account that another time might ſerve for their miſcheivous purpoſe, they went to ſee what this ſuddaine outcry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when preſently mounting on the caſtle walls, they might deſcry a troupe of armed men, coming in all haſt toward
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16805:40"/>
them, whereupon, preſently ſuſpecting who they were, they provided for their defence: but wee muſt of neceſſitie a while, looke backe to them that wee left hunting in the wood.</p>
            <p>Every man was ſo earneſt at the ſport, that no one tooke heed to the two ſiſters, ſo they were ſeiz'd on, and carried away not being ſeen of any, ſave a poore ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, who knew the man beſt, not the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>The fearfull ſtagge wearied with the continuall motion of ſo ſwift a pace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deſpaire of any longer ſafety by his legs, and therfore turning his taile to a tree, hee laid about him with his faire branch of weapons, ſo that hee made the cruell blood-hounds pauſe upon the fight, and as it were to take counſell whether it were better to rebegin, or quite give o're the battell: which the huntſ-man percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and finding by the change of the cry, that he was at a bay, they came in, &amp; with their horns incouraged them, who therby taking freſh heart, never gave over till they had brought the vaunting champion on his knees, than would it have mov'd remorſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16805:41"/>
to ſee the gentle beaſt lament his death in many a brine ſalt teare, as it were blaming mans crueltie, for whetting on his enemies to kill him.</p>
            <p>The ſport was done and every one retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned homeward, when (and not before) <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella</hi> were miſt, theſe newes ſtroke a cold feare to the heart of <hi>Clianthis</hi> and <hi>Polydore,</hi> preſaging the danger that was like to fall unto them, preſent ſearch was made, every one taking a ſeverall way, and traverſing the whole wood, yet all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning without any newes of any thing, but that they were not to be found. <hi>Clian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this</hi> like a franticke man ranne about cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on <hi>Callanthia,</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> rid as hee had loſt his wits, crying nothing but <hi>Florella,</hi> yet neither could <hi>Clianthis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any anſwer from <hi>Callanthia,</hi> nor <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi> from <hi>Florella.</hi> Eccho condoling theſe true lovers miſeries, holpe them to call, for no ſooner could <hi>Clianthis</hi> call <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthia,</hi> but the eccho would take the word and call <hi>Callanthia,</hi> no ſooner could <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> cry out <hi>Florella,</hi> but eccho would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him, and cry out <hi>Florella,</hi> as if ſhee would have ſummoned all the powers in

heaven and earth, to the ſearch of <hi>Callan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> and <hi>Florella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus long in vaine they ſought, yet would not be perſwaded that they ſought in vaine, every ſound they heard ſeemed the anſweres of their deareſt loves, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their eares with theſe imaginations, ſo long, till at the laſt they knew that they were onely flattered, and therefore plainly perceiving that they were not there to bee found, with carefull hearts, and ſorrowfull thoughts, they returned home againe: where contrary to their expectation, they heard newes of them; for <hi>Clidamas</hi> as the reſt, wandring up and downe the wood, hapned to meete with the Shepheard, of whom inquiring if hee ſaw any ſuch, hee made him anſwer plainely, that they were perforce carried away, by <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus;</hi> glad hee was that hee had heard newes of his daughters, yet was he greived extreamely to heare they were in ſuch a place; but making neceſſitie a vertue, hee went home, and telling theſe newes to the lovers, and others that were preſent, they forthwith conſulted to regaine them by force, for by intreaty they knew it was in

vaine to try, to this end they made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men, and convenient armour, with what ſpeed poſſibly they might. All things heing provided, they marched forward, and coming neere the Caſtle, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried by the watch, they were no ſooner under the walls, but they ſummon'd a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereupon they within asked them what they came for, anſwer was made, that they came to redeeme the two faire ſiſters, <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella,</hi> whom <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus,</hi> had moſt villanouſly ſtolne away, which <hi>Horniſda</hi> hearing, with a countenance threatning death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he made anſwer thus.</p>
            <p>The girles are mine, fairly wonne by the force of armes, and I will keepe them mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre the proudeſt he amongſt yee that dares ſay nay: I would I had thee in the openeſt field in <hi>Sicily,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Clianthis</hi>) I would make that boaſting tongue of thine give thy ſelf the lye, I would make thee confeſs thy ſelfe to be a villaine. What in wordes (ſaid <hi>Polipus</hi>) we have them, and will keepe them if we can, if not wee'l looſe them, let them that ſight beſt take them: agreed (ſaid <hi>Polydore,</hi>) and ſo the ſignall being
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16805:42"/>
given, the aſſault began, the ladders were ſet up to the walls, and the ſouldiers mounted up to the top of them, from whence they were thruſt downe headlong by the defendants, to receive their deaths kiſſe at the ground; but the two lovers burning in rage, and thinking the delay of victory a kinde of overthrow, guarding themſelves with their broad ſheilds, and taking their truſty ſwords in their hands, they valiantly got footing on the walls, maugre all the reſiſtance that could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be made, where with their ſwords they made havocke of all that were nigh them, making way for their ſouldiers to follow them, who without delay did ſo, and ſo became maſters of the wall: which <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſda</hi> and <hi>Polypus</hi> perceiving, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to encounter them for all their vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they fled by a poſterne to <hi>Palermo,</hi> the men of the Caſtle ſeing their Captaines were fled, preſently threw away their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and craved mercy: which was as ſoone granted them.</p>
            <p>Things being thus ovdered, <hi>Clianthis</hi> and <hi>Polydore,</hi> leaving the other buſineſſe to be managed by <hi>Clidamas,</hi> ranne into the

Caſtle from chamber to chamber, ſeeking their loves, whom when they found, you may imagine what joy, what kiſſes, what embraces paſſed betweene them, for ſo bleſt a meeting; hand in hand they went out of the chamber, till they came to the ſight of old <hi>Clidamas,</hi> who (overcome with exceſſe of joy) ranne and tooke them about the neckes, kiſſing them, and welcomming as if hee had not ſeene them in a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but when they had recounting in what danger they had been, and how neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had eſcaped raviſhing, wonder and joy ſtopt up their ſpeech, and they ſtood like men confounded with exceſſe of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, out of which they were no ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, but yeelding due praiſe to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall powers, that continually guard the vertuous, and ſetting all things in order, they left that lothed place, and returned home againe to their owne habitations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the day of marriage, till when, we will once againe leave and returne our <hi>Sicilians</hi> in the court of <hi>Scaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long time they lived there, dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their fame with new deedes of armes, yet knowne to be no other than the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16805:43"/>
poore fiſhermans ſonnes of <hi>Tarracona.</hi> Till at the laſt Fortune offered them a glorious occaſion, to build an ever dying ſtatue to eternize them to all ſucceeding generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thus it was.</p>
            <p>It fortuned (beſides the generall greifes which were before taken) there ſprang up a new particular occaſion of debate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Tunis:</hi> for as before time, there had beene a league for entercourſe of merchants betweene the two kingdomes. It fel out that upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of miſlike, falſe <hi>Mariabdela</hi> on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, when they dream't of no ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, cauſ'd all the Spaniſh ſhips that were in his dominions, to be ſeized on, and the goods to be confiſcated: as for the men, ſome hee cauſed cruelly to bee ſlaine, others he made ſlaves, to tugge at the oares in his gallies; this indignity ſeemed ſo greivous, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hearing of it, ſent his Ambaſſadors to <hi>Tunis,</hi> to demand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of thoſe things that were ſo ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or elſe to denounce warre againſt him; reſtitution was denied, and their defiance was laught at, as if the denouncers had bin children, or boies not worthie to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16805:44"/>
or regarded: for the fell tyrant ſtrong perſwaded of the truth of the Oracle, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not any danger, but what came from <hi>Sicily,</hi> &amp; therefore (with a ſcornfull ſmile) hee made anſwer to the Ambaſſadors, in theſe or the like words.</p>
            <p>You have ſpoke well, and to a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and I cannot but commend the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of your ſtile, but let me tell you, that you want the cheifeſt part of rhetorick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion: your oration in ſome other man (I muſt confeſſe) might have begat a kinde of alteration, but in mee, it workes no more than if I had beene deafe when yon were ſpeaking; for thinke not my nature can be changd by words, or that what I have once but determined to doe, much leſſe what I have alreadie done, can be altered either by fair perſwaſions or your bittereſt menaces; what I have done, I meane not to repent of, your merchants have offended me, and therefore have I puniſhed them according to mine owne will, as being an abſolute King in mine owne dominions: What I have got. I'le keepe, and ſooner ſhall hee have this head from theſe ſhoulders, than I willl conſent to the reſtitution of our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16805:44"/>
poore device: Goe therefore, and tell your King, that I neither minde his flatteries, nor feare his threats, when he comes he ſhall be welcome, but I doubt hee will bee ſo long coming, that his minde will be altered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſet forward on his voyage.</p>
            <p>With this anſwer, the Ambaſſadors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmiſſed with as much honour as was to bee expected in ſo barbarous a place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home againe, where they reported the effect of their ambaſſage; which the King hearing, his heart was filled with ſo juſt an anger, that he forthwith proclaimed open warres, preſently giving commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the preparation of galleyes, and other navall furniture, fit for ſo weightie an expedition, as for the leving of men, both mariners and ſouldiers: the managing of the whole buſineſſe hee committed to the Duke of <hi>Midnia Sidonia,</hi> who was no way ſlacke in performing his dutie, everie thing being in readines, they ſet forward, but they had not gone halfe the way, ere they met with the huge fleete of bold <hi>Mariabdela,</hi> who as ſoone as the Ambaſſadors were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, provided every thing fitting, as loth to be taken tardie in ſuch a buſineſſe, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16805:45"/>
therefore chooſing rather to meete the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, than to bee incloſed in his citie walls, he went out to encounter them in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, no ſooner had the fleetes deſcried each other, but they made defiance, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell began, wherein Fortune (according to her blinde wiſedome guided) gave the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie to the barbarians, for the good Duke being overcloied with oddes, perceiving he had loſt the greater number of his ſhips, with a heavie heart he ſounded the retreat, and fled.</p>
            <p>Two ſuch other fleetes were ſet out from <hi>Spaine,</hi> that returned home againe, theſe misfortunes greatly ſtird the reſolution of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo that ignorant in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe what to doe, hee called his counſell together to heare their adviſe, what courſe he ſhould take in this extremitie; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell being aſſembled, and everie man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſpeake his minde. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Santa Crux</hi> (who was a man that never from his youth affected the warres) ſtood up, and ſpake to this effect.</p>
            <p>Had this order beene taken before this unhappy difference was begun, it might have ſav'd the effuſion of much innocent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16805:45"/>
bloud, and the expence of many millions of crownes: which now are vainely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in theſe bloudy broiles; then it ſhould not have been needfull to inquire whether it were better to proceed any further in this unfortunate warre, or quite to give it over with diſhonor and diſadvantage: but ſince it pleaſed your Majeſtie then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to your owne minde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the adviſe of your counſell, (which I wiſh to the Gods you had not) I will not urge that point any further, but come to the maine matter that is in queſtion. I am not ſuch an enemie to warre, that I ſhould utterly baniſh it, nor do I thinke ſo dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerately of ſouldiers, as to eſteeme them of no uſe, or ſervice in a Kingdome; for I know that warre is the arme of a country, and ſouldiers are the ſinews of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; but if this arme be broke with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie toile, if the ſinewes bee ſtretched paſt their naturall length, marvaile not if the whole bodie bee not out of joint: the cheife end of war is to defend our ſelves, not to offend others, and therefore peace is ſaid to be the childe of warre, which could not be, if for everie light occaſion we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16805:46"/>
ſhould move unneceſſarie debates, but to the purpoſe. <hi>Mariabdela</hi> hath offred inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our merchants, revenge hath beene ſought, and ſtill wee have come home by the worſt, and yet wee inquire, what is to bee done? alas, what doe wee aile to move ſuch a needleſſe queſtion? Aske the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that hath loſt his venture, whether hee had rather keepe that hee hath toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or hazard more to a certaine ruine? can wee expect any hope of victorie, now our ſtrengths are weakned? the beſt of our ſhips are ſunke and ſpoiled, the greateſt part of our treaſures waſted, and the moſt of our ſouldiers ſlaine, that could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it when all theſe were whole; but you may ſay, the fortune of the fight may change, and what wee could not get by force, wee may obtaine by ſome cunning ſtratagem: a weak confidence God knows, to truſt to fortunes favour now, that have hitherto had her frownes, and a vaine toy to thinke to entrap <hi>Mariabdela</hi> by a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that hath beene all his life time a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in warres diſcipline. I knew <hi>Midnia,</hi> to be a wiſe and prudent cheifetaine, and his ſouldiers to be men of excellent valour,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16805:46"/>
yet this ſame <hi>Midnia</hi> hath beene over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach't by <hi>Mariabdela,</hi> and his ſouldiers have beene vanquiſhed by the other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: 'tis true, that chance carries a great ſtroke in militarie affaires, yet 'tis a cold comfort, to hope for a happie chance, where there is no likelihood to beare off the ſhocke: and little cauſe have wee to truſt to fortunes ficklenes, that loſt her in ſo good a cauſe, but fortune is blinde; and therefore I will ſpeak no more of her, as not eſteeming her worthy to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in mans affaires, rather I judge that the divine providence, for ſome greivous offences of ours, have laid this plague up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: and therefore, to ſtrive further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the gods, I think you will ſay 'twere madnes. What ſhould we ſay, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons crie out, for the greivous taxations raiſed upon them, to maintaine the war, which ſorting to ſo unwelcome an end, cannot chooſe but be a great greife to all, the treaſuries are drawne drie, the navy is unfurniſhed, widowes in every place la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſſe of their husbands, fathers, and mothers ſit weeping and wailing for the untimely loſſe of their deare children.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16805:47"/>
               <hi>Mariabdela</hi> laughes at our teares, and make the miſerie of our loſſes, the trophies to renowne his victory; and for all theſe expences, not onely the firſt indignitie is not revenged, but alſo it is made greater by many new and latter misfortunes: they being enriched with our loſſes, and making proviſion for themſelves of our ſtores. My adviſe therefore to your Majeſty is, that you would finde out ſome honourable conditions of peace to be offered the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, rather than to continue the war, that hath hitherto ſorted ſo unluckily on our ſides, and therewith he ceaſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke of <hi>Midnia,</hi> whoſe valour, fortune could never diminiſh, though ſhee might frown upon his actions, hearing he roſe, and making due reverence, he ſpake to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>What honourable peace can the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> make with <hi>Mariabdela,</hi> when he was the firſt that provoked the <hi>Tuniſian</hi> to fight? I grant this had beene good counſell at firſt, before the majeſty of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had beene ingaged upon the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but now, ſince it hath proceeded ſo far, as to the ſterne deciding of the ſword;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16805:47"/>
I hold it no way honourable, for a little loſſe, to hazard the perpetuall honour of a mightie Kingdome, which cannot be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if wee give over now ſo faintly, what we begun with ſuch alacritie; what though we have loſt the fortune of a day or two, is that of force to impoveriſh a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? (as you my Lord of <hi>Santa Crux</hi> would make us beleeve) can the expence of a million, were it two, empty the coffers of this <hi>Spaine?</hi> you much undervalew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venews of this rich Kingdome, to thinke ſo poorely of it; but if it were true, that theſe warres have ſo exhauſted the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the remainder will not ſuffice to furniſh another fleete, is <hi>Spaine</hi> (I pray you) growne ſo deſolate, that it hath no friend to helpe her in an extremitie ſo urgent? what is become of <hi>Italy,</hi> the ancient friend of <hi>Spaine?</hi> where is ſpacious <hi>France?</hi> is <hi>Sicily</hi> vaniſh't? is <hi>Rhodes</hi> periſh't? is <hi>Malta</hi> drowned in the ſea? or is the famous <hi>Greece</hi> ſunke into the earth? can it be that none of theſe ſhould yeeld us ſuccour? Is it poſſible, that <hi>Mariabdela</hi> ſhould have done no wrong to any of them? did not the fierce <hi>Martoll</hi> (waged by the King of

               <hi>Tunis</hi>) reſcue the ſhips of <hi>Candy?</hi> force the fleete of <hi>Malta,</hi> ſpoile the navy of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and ranſome certaine <hi>Sirians</hi> bound for <hi>Greece,</hi> never ſparing to doe any villany, till my ſelfe with the helpe of the brave brothers, overcame him; and ſince his death, have not whole fleetes of rovers bin ſet forth from <hi>Tunis,</hi> to rob and ſpoile, ſo that no merchants dare paſſe to and fro in any part of the ſtraits, and doe you thinke that all theſe injuries can bee put in ſilence, as would bee, if theſe petty kings and princes had but the countenance of the great King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to animate them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would have them come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their ſervice unto you, unſent for, ſmall reaſon for that, when you have not ſent them any notice of your purpoſes, which if you neglected (as ſcorning to uſe the power of your inferiours) it was ill done, if as truſting to your owne force, to goe through with the enterpriſe, you ſee you are too fond in that: but never can it be too late to learne wiſedome, and to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe any honourable action, it cannot be, that if your Majeſty ſend your Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to theſe Princes, to crave their aide,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16805:48"/>
they ſhould be denied, nay rather it ſeemes to me, that they will (more than willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) imbrace the motion, whereby, they ſhall not onely redeeme their owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular loſſes, but alſo binde the great king of <hi>Spaine</hi> to be their friend; with the aide of them, you may furniſh out another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which ſhall not onely beate the proud <hi>Barbarian,</hi> but alſo fully redeeme the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and the loſſe of the former bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: you urge the teares of orphans, the cryes of widowes, the laments of parents, and the wailing of freinds, as if they were not incident to the warres, can it bee (I pray you) that a battell ſhould bee fought, and not one ſlaine? and if ſome bee ſlaine? can it bee there ſhould bee none to bemoane them? or doe yee thinke there bee no wet eyes in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> as well as here in <hi>Spaine.? Mariabdela</hi> I am ſure bought not his victory ſo cheape, nor am I a man ſo noted for cowardiſe, to give over the fight for nothing; I never fled before I met with <hi>Mariabdela,</hi> and then, I thinke I was vanquiſh't, meerely and ſolely, by the overpreſſe of multitudes: almoſt two for one were ſlaine on their partie, yet ſtill
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16805:49"/>
they were ſupplyed with freſh ones, that it amazed mee, to ſee them ſpring up ſo faſt (like <hi>Hydraes</hi>-heads) when one was lopt off, two aroſe in their places, ſo that (if I may ſpeake it without being taxed of boaſting) I thinke wee were overcome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by being wearie of conquering; and I ſuppoſe, that the conquerour loſt more, than wee that were vanquiſhed: and well might they ſay with their countrie-man <hi>Hanniball,</hi> many ſuch victories would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe them. Conſider I pray, wee went (as you know) not paſt fifty gallies ſtrong, when as <hi>Mariabdela,</hi> met us with about two hundred, and yet againſt ſuch, we held out fight for the ſpace of five yeeres, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſigne of diſadvantage: imagine what wee could have done, had wee beene of any equality. Theſe things conſidered, (my gracious Lord) it is my opinion, that it were beſt for your majeſtie, to ſend your meſſengers to the mighty young Princes for aide, wherewith you may raiſe ſuch an army, as may quell the vaunting foe, and bring him downe in ſpite of his ſun-burnt <hi>Moores:</hi> for my ſelfe I ſhall be ready as I have beene heretofore, to ſpend my beſt

indeavours in your graces ſervice, ſo hee ceaſed; when preſently <hi>Martuvio</hi> aroſe, and making all humble reverence, he ſpake on this manner.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall not ſeeme too much arrogance (my noble Lordes) for ſuch younglings verdites amongſt ſo many <hi>Nestors,</hi> or if wee bee not overhaſty in ſpeaking alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that ſhould rather bee ſeven yeares in hearing, I ſhall with confidence reveale a ſecret, which hath long time beene ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering in my head. What you my Lords of <hi>Midnia,</hi> and <hi>Santa Crux</hi> have worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, hath its time, but not now; (pardon me if I reject ſuch worthy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell) for if what I have thought, may bee put in action, neither needeth his Majeſty to ſeeke to the <hi>Barbarian</hi> for peace, nor to continue the warre, which hath already beene ſo unfortunate, and are both ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily to ſucceed any thing well: for what peace, how little ſoever honour it may carry with it is to bee exqected from <hi>Mariabdela?</hi> whoſe nature ſeemes to be bloudily deſirous of warre, that I ſuppoſe he did this injury to the merchants, as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary of an idle peace, and thirſting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16805:50"/>
greedily after death and ſpoile, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it makes mee thinke, that hee will bee ſo farre from accepting a league of amity, now hee hath once beene fleſh't in victory, that hee will rather come to ſeeke us at our owne homes, if wee once give him over; he wil with whole worlds of <hi>Moors,</hi> come up and ſpoile the country, and when your Ambaſſadors ſhall bee heard to treate for peace, hee will bee thereby the more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, as thinking it to bee done for feare. Hee is no childe, to thinke that wee would let him reſt if wee could chooſe, beſides, no honourable conditions of peace can bee concluded on, without requiring reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the wrongs done to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and doe you thinke that hee will heare it once ſpoken of, now hee is puft up with fame and victory, that was ſo farre off from conſenting to it before the warre? never thinke that hee that dares doe a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, when he knows not his own ſtrength, will make any amends for it, when hee knowes he can defend himſelfe: ſo for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further proceeding in the warres, I hold that to be as unprofitable too, not becauſe I thinke we have no ſouldiers left, that dare
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16805:50"/>
not fight, or no commanders that dare va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly leade them on, or that I deſpaire of the helpe of the neighbouring Princes, but that I am verily perſwaded, that all theſe together cannot make an army potent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to meete him with two hundred ſayle; as hee met our fleete of fifty: and do you thinke he can make no more, now hee hath taken ſo many of ours, and hath had ſo much time to provide more of his own? He hath all <hi>Africk</hi> at his command, a country large and wide, ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of timber, to make many fleetes of gallies, bigger than all our kingdome is able to make, and wonderfully repleniſhed with a world of nations: 'tis true as my Lord Admirall hath ſaid, that the onely advantage hee hath had againſt us, hath been by overpreſſe of multitude, and ſhall wee thinke that hee will at any time want that advantage, having ſuch an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of people that yet never ſaw the ſea? who though they bee not ſo expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient in fights, yet will they ſtand a blow, and ſo (as my Lord ſaid) wee ſhall bee againe vanquiſhed, with wearineſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming. I am no coward, that I dare
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16805:51"/>
not fight (for bee it ſpoken without boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting) were it put upon the point, my ſelfe would encounter with the whole hoſte of <hi>Mariabdela,</hi> came hee in his greateſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but what good ſucceſſe I ſhould have, your Lordſhips may imagine: but I ſpeak this, to ſave the great effuſion of humane bloud, that muſt of neceſſity bee ſpilt in theſe bloudy actions, howſoever they ſpeed. I ſpeake it to dry up the teares of women and children, for the loſſe of their husbands and fathers; I ſpeake it to ſtop the clamorous grumbling of the greived commons, that have beene, and ſtill muſt bee, if the warre continue, taxed and oppreſſed with ſubſidies and toles, that of neceſſity they muſt bee drawne dry, or elſe fall to flat rebellion againſt his majeſty, which might beget another danger grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the former. Yet would I not have your majeſty wholy to give over the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, for I would not be thought to think ſo baſely and poorely of the majeſty of the kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but a way is to bee found out, which may make amends for all injuries, yet neither by ſeeking to the Tyrant for peace, nor by vexing our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16805:51"/>
ſelves with any further broiles; but the matter needes not much conference, for my ſelfe with the aſſiſtance of my brother (and therewith <hi>Roderigo</hi> ſtood up too) have found out a way (which if it ſhall pleaſe your Majeſty, and you my noble Lords to countenance,) I doubt not, but will bring the Tyrant <hi>Mariabdela</hi> to make you ſuch recompence as you ſhall aske of him, or elſe hee ſhall forfeite his head to your Majeſties clemency. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in it ſelfe is dangerous, but what danger can appall a minde greedy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? nor ſhall you thinke, that wee have invented a thing, wherein we ſhal have the glory of the counſell, and ſome other the danger of the action; for as wee have beene the firſt founders, ſo doe wee alſo offer our ſelves (if it ſtand with your Majeſties good liking) to put in execution our owne devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I have heard it reported that the only men in the world that <hi>Mariabdela</hi> fears, are <hi>Sicilians,</hi> moved therto by a certain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (how true, I know not) that a <hi>Sicilian</hi> and none elſe, ſhall bee his overthrow: and to this end, doth hee uſe all the meanes he can to get all <hi>Sicilians</hi> into his clutches,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16805:52"/>
and having them, hee cruelly butchers them, as for other nations, hee entertaines men of all ſorts into his ſervice, without reſpect of any whatſoever. I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the truth of this oracle, leaſt I might ſeeme to queſtion the knowledge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine powers; rather I think, this oracle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in ſuch plain words, does as al ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles uſe to doe, carry a double meaning, ſo wrapped and clouded in ambiguous obſcurity, that onely the event of all muſt make it apparant: for ſeldome do the gods give forth their oracles, but the ſame implies a quite contrary thing, than is propounded by the bare words, which is alwaies manifeſted by the event; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is not my purpoſe, to enter into any mens diſcourſe, onely my intent is by deedes, to make proofe whether the words of the oracle, and the meaning of it doe concurre together. But to come to the point, my brother and my ſelfe, according to a ſetled determination (which wee ſtill ſubmit to bee faſhioned on the anvile of your grave wiſedome) will as it were in ſecret depart from hence to <hi>Tunis,</hi> where by ſome meanes or other, wee will get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16805:52"/>
into the Kings ſervice, when if the meaning of the oracle deceive me not, wee ſhall uſe ſuch meanes, as to bring the Tyrant away with us to <hi>Spaine,</hi> elſe let us dye forgot and unregarded; this if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen according to our intentions, as the willing forwardneſſe of my heart makes mee preſage it will, you may then uſe your owne pleaſure, whil'ſt you have him in your power: but if it pleaſe the Gods that wee miſcarry in the action, it cannot greatly hurt the ſtate, but you may at your pleaſure either conclude all, with what honourable peace you can, or elſe if that bee refuſed, you may proceed in the warre, in either of which two buſineſſes, our two lives can ſmally ſhade you; this is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, which if it pleaſe your Majeſty to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, ſhall before to morrow morning bee put in practiſe: and I beſeech the Gods, that the event may bee as fortunate, to the good of <hi>Spaine</hi> and you, as wee with wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heartes, and more wills to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than to give it over, doe undergoe the enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had hee made an end of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but a generall ſilence was over the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16805:53"/>
whole houſe, every man above meaſure, wondring at the great courages of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble youthes, thinking a thing almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that ſuch young yeares ſhould harbour ſo much valour, at laſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> who was a man ſingularly reputed for wiſedome and courage, and had all this while attentively liſtned to the wordes of the young man, marking with what confidence hee ſpake, as if the thing had beene done already, and not ſtill to doe, roſe up and ſpake thus.</p>
            <p>For evetmore bleſt bee the gracious Gods of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for ſending hither two ſuch excellent men in ſo great a danger, and happy may that man bee, that firſt brought them into this aſſemhly. With favcur of your Majeſty and the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble convent, it may pleaſe your Majeſty and you my Lords to conſider, that there can bee no more ſaid in this buſineſſe, than what hath been already delivered, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you muſt as my Lord Marqueſſe counſelleth, ſeeke out for ſome honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conditions of peace, which are as hard to finde, as they are unlikely to ſpeed, or you muſt as my Lord of <hi>Midnia</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16805:53"/>
continue the warre, and ſend for aide to the neighbouring Princes, which way as it cannot chooſe but bee chargeable, ſo it is uncertaine to what end it will ſort: or if neither of theſe pleaſe you, you muſt of neceſſity take hold of the device of yong <hi>Martuvio,</hi> which as it is in it ſelf, a matter dangerous, and hopeleſſe ever to come to good, ſo being managed by men of ſuch excellent wiſedome and approved, it bindes in my breaſt a ſetled hope of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, worthy the men that undertake it. <hi>Mariabdela</hi> wee know is ſecure of his fate, fearing none but <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and who knows but (as <hi>Martuvio</hi> urged) the oracle may aime at ſome thing that is ſpecified by the wordes, beſides how eaſie a thing will it be for men brought up and exerciſed in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to worke upon the nature of a rude <hi>Barbarian?</hi> whoſe onely wiſedome is to feaſt and revell, giving himſelfe over to drunkenneſſe and ſenſuality, not fearing any thing that may befall him, becauſe hee onely feares <hi>Sicilians,</hi> of whom hee hath none in all his kingdome, they have all things on their ſide that may animate them, excellent ſhapes to procure admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16805:54"/>
excellent eloquence to perſwade, excellent wiſedome to inſinuate into the ſecrets of the Barbarian, excellent valour to undertake any danger, that hath the leaſt ſhew of likelihood, and excellent fortune I hope, to ſecond their juſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. Stay not then for ſecond thoughts, but if my counſell, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath prevailed with you, may now alſo bee of force to perſwade you; you ſhall without delay put this attempt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and with your continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, obtaine a happy end to ſo couragious an adventure, which howſoever, it may advantage the ſtate, by bringing into your hands the man that hath ſo annoyd it, yet cannot it much hinder your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, if it fall contrarie to your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I am not ſo urgent in this buſineſſe, as annoying the glory of the men, and therefore willing to put them upon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, that if it ſucceed amiſſe, may bee their inevitable deſtruction, for the Gods bee my witneſſes that my ſoule loveth them, and I rather bite this tongue out, than it ſhould bee ſuch a traitor to the ſtate, to give ſuch counſell as might rob
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16805:54"/>
the kingdome of two ſuch precious jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells: but my heart is (I know not how) ſo fully perſwaded of the good ſucceſſe of this ſo honourable action, that I imagine, I ſhould do much wrong to ſuch excellent valour, if I ſhould bee a meanes to ſtarve it, by giving counſell to deprive it of ſuch honourable food to nouriſh. On therefore moſt noble youthes, and may your hande bee as ready to put in execution, ſpeed in your ſucceſſe, and you may returne home crowned with glory, honour, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>This ſpeech ſo wrought with the whole aſſembly, that preſently without any more debating on the matter, every man gave his aſſent, and the king highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their worth, gave his conſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Now to avoide all feare of revealing of the matter, by meanes of ſpies, or elſe by treacherous &amp; malecontented people, (as is too commonly ſeene in ſuch buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) every thing was carried in moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſecrecy: The two brothers getting on a ſuddaine on horſebacke, and riding in all poſt-haſte to the ſea-ſide, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a fiſher-boate, they preſently went
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16805:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into it, ſuch was their confidence in their juſt cauſe, and with it they croſſed the ſeas to <hi>Tunis.</hi> In the meane, time the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> provided every thing for a new army, as if hee would preſently have gone on another voiage in his owne perſon, and in this preparation wee will leave them.</p>
            <p>Our two <hi>Sicilians</hi> row'd ſo long, till at laſt they came to their journeyes end, and were no ſooner landed, but they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet upon by the guard of the place, and ſtrict inquirie was made; who, what, and of whence they were, they made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that they were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and were come to offer up their ſervice to the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> hereupon, preſently they were carried before the king, who being ſet in his Majeſtick ſtate, with a ſterne counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, asked who they were? whereupon, <hi>Martuvio</hi> (nothing daunted with his great lookes) boldly made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>The time has beene great king of <hi>Tunis,</hi> when hee that ſhould have ſaid, wee two ſhould have come to offer thee our ſervice, might have perchance received the lye for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16805:55"/>
his labour, for wee were once thy profeſt enemies, nay that if wee could, and would have cut thy head off, had it beene in the middeſt of this royall pallace; wee are the men, that ſlew <hi>Martoll</hi> and <hi>Folco,</hi> the two ſwordes of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides done thee no ſmall miſcheife: but now it ſo falls, that wee that have been thy profeſt foes, are now become votaries, wee that have done thee ſo much outrage, are come hither to ſeeke ſhelter under thy wings, for the ingratefull king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not content to leave our vertue unrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (which hee ought to have cheriſhed with the beſt of his indeavours,) hath gone further, even to the ſeeking of our lives, and yet (good Gods) how many wayes is that man beholding to us! what had become of the poore Duke of <hi>Midnia,</hi> and his weather-beaten fleete, when they encountred with couragious <hi>Martoll,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zanto,</hi> if our ſwordes had not ended the controverſie, by the death of thoſe brave men; for whom, I could weepe, to thinke that ſuch excellent ſouldiers, ſhould end their lives to benefit thereby, ſo ingratefull a perſon, and that by our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16805:56"/>
hands, to make us ſo much more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: by how much it is more wretched, to bee enforced to aske releife of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than to remaine at home, in eaſe and tranquillitie, beſides, in thoſe latter fights in which it pleaſed the Gods to favour mee, what had become of his whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if our breaſts had not beene the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes to their ſafe intreaty? in which though it was our fortune to looſe the day, yet I may ſpeake it withaut boaſting, they that eſcaped alive, may thanke our valours for their ſafeties, and yet for theſe things (for I take the Gods to bee my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that we never injur'd him,) this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful king, this king (ſaid I) this any thing, this indeed nothing, laid wait to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap our lives, but that by ſpeedy flight we prevented it. Wee come therefore to thy imperiall Majeſty, as the <hi>Roman Coriolanus,</hi> did to his enemies the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> &amp; if it ſhall pleaſe thy Majeſty, to commit any charge of truſt to us, wee make no doubt, but as <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was the ſoreſt enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo <hi>Martuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo</hi> ſhall prove the greateſt oppoſites to ingratefull <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words ſo bewitched the tyrants
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16805:56"/>
affection, that hee was on fire to entertaine them, hee ſaw no cauſe to feare, they were not <hi>Sicilians,</hi> their ſpeech, their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their lookes, and all their geſtures, openly proclaimed them <hi>Spaniards:</hi> their ſparkling eyes full of revengefull fire, their menacing ſpeeches, repleate with deadly threatning, their conſtant and unmov'd geſture anſwering to their lookes and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, did evidently manifeſt a deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to their native countrie: their bold adventuring in ſo ſmall a veſſell, argued the neceſſity of their flight. Valiant hee knew they were, for hee himſelfe had had experience of their force, and hee eſteem'd them to bee wondrous wiſe, as chooſing rather to put in hazard the clemency of their enemy, than to tarry at home with a certaine aſſurance of deſtruction, nor did hee want preſidents of the like kinde to warrant his acceptance of them, til he had heard of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> the <hi>Romane,</hi> and his flight to the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> and what followed thereupon; hee remembred <hi>Themiostcles</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and his eſcape to the king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as alſo <hi>Alcibiades</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and his departure to the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:16805:57"/>
and why ſhould not the revolt of theſe two brave <hi>Spaniards,</hi> be as fortunate to him, as that of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> to the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to the <hi>Lacedaemonians?</hi> Upon theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and withall building upon his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, he bade them heartily welcome, telling them they ſhould injoy as much ſafety in his court, as they had found treachery in the court of <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; that they ſhould find, when occaſion ſerved to imploy them, in the mean time, they ſhould be dear to him, and alwayes neere about his perſon.</p>
            <p>The good fortune at the entrance of their enterpriſe, put our two gallants in an aſſured hope of an abſolute concluſion; and therefore, with attractive greedines they expected opportunitie to put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their buſineſſe in practiſe, much honour was done them by the rude <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and highly reſpected were they of all men, becauſe every body knew it was the kings pleaſure they ſhould bee ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected: the king himſelfe exceedingly favouring them, as being bewitched with their inſinuating ſpeeches, not knowing that hee hatched ſerpents to ſting himſelfe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16805:57"/>
to death, yet did they not want enemies, who laboured what they could to bring them into diſpleaſure with the king, ſome envying that ſtrangers ſhould bee ſo highly advanced above the native people, others emulating their glory in deedes of armes, hating all worthineſſe in others, becauſe they had none to bragge off in themſelves, but others of a more ſubtile and acute inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie, deepely ſuſpected that this might be ſome ſubtle practiſe from the cunning <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and therefore they uſed all diligence, to pry into their actions, if perchance, they could learne any thing, to make their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition ſeeme a certainty. But our ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſed themſelves ſo warily, that they failed of their purpoſe, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, they ceaſed not to obſerve them more narrowly, not ſticking at laſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold their ſuſpition to the king, uſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons to perſwade him to looke more neerely to himſelfe, than to truſt his ſafety to the faith of them, that were borne his enemies, but hee lull'd in ſecuritie by their pleaſing his humours, would not liſten to any ſuch complaints.</p>
            <p>This could not bee ſo cloſely carried,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16805:58"/>
but the two ſtrangers underſtood it, and therefore wiſely conſidering, that though now they were fully poſſeſſed of the kings favour, yet the tide might turne, and hee might bee wrought to injure them, they reſolved betweene themſelves, that it was time to put in practiſe their adventure, to which effect, the ſureſt way (as they thought) was, that an army ſhould bee brought from <hi>Spaine</hi> thither, but than they wanted meanes to certifie the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> of their purpoſe, but fortune that would not ſuffer ſuch deſignes to periſh in the bloſſome, provided them of a meanes for that too. It fortuned that a merchant of <hi>Genoa,</hi> at that time reſiding in <hi>Tunis,</hi> was at that time providing to return home to his owne country, with him they agreed to carry a letter for them, and to convay it to <hi>Spaine,</hi> which hee readily conſented to, and accordingly performed.</p>
            <p>Theſe newes being on this manner brought to the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> without any the leaſt ſuſpition in the <hi>Barbarian</hi> of any ſuch practiſe, an army was forthwith levied, and ſet forth under the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Midnia,</hi> in the meane time, the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16805:58"/>
two brothers, ſo wrought with the king of <hi>Tunis,</hi> that hee had promiſed them the conduct of an army, to bee lead againſt <hi>Spaine,</hi> but this newes of this new army, quite put out ſuch determinations for now it was fitter to looke to his owne defence, than to the aſſayling of others: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all ſpeed poſſibly hee prepared his navy to meete them, ſome there were, that counſelled him to leave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at home, (as it ſeemed) preſaging what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward proved to bee true, but hee would not by any means heare of any ſuch thing, yet did hee (for the more ſecurity as hee thought) take them into his owne gally, becauſe he would bee ſure alwayes to have an eye on.</p>
            <p>In this manner, they met with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who preſently gave them battell, and the ſigſtht was fierce on both ſides; in the heate whereof, and when the ſhips of either partie had boorded each other, and were faſt grapled together, the two brothers (who were placed as I ſaid before, in the kings owne ſhip) thinking now or never, to bee the time they had ſo long loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for: on a ſuddaine, they tooke
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16805:59"/>
the <hi>Barbarian</hi> in their armes, and violently threw him into the ſhip that was next them, where before hee could riſe againe, hee was taken and carried under hatches, the brothers in the meane time, ſhewing what they were, violently ſet upon the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in that ſhip, making a way for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who preſently boorded her.</p>
            <p>This chance ſo terrified the poore <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> that they knew neither what to ſay or doe; and the cry went in an inſtant, that the king was taken: whereupon, being infinitely amazed, and in this amazement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> furiouſly aſſaulting them, they loſt all courage, and therefore, with what ſpeed they could, ungrapling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in a moſt confuſed order they fled, and were as faſt purſued by the enemie, who tooke and kill'd as many as they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertooke, in this ſort, they reſted not, the one party flying, and the other following, till they came to the haven of <hi>Tunis,</hi> where the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> preſently getting a ſhore, made a freſh reſiſtance, to ſtop al the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> from landing, but ſmally had it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged them, being already beaten, and

their enemies the conquerours, had not preſently a flagge beene put out: for the Lordes of the countrey, who were left as governours of the place, while the king was at the warres, hearing of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and of the captivity of the king, and now fearing the ſurprizall of the towne, they choſe rather, to ſtand to ſuch conditions of peace, as the enemy ſhould propoſe to them, than by their further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacies to procure an inevitable deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to themſelves, and to their whole countrey. Upon theſe conſiderations, the flagge of truce was put forth, which was anſwered with the like from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whereupon, it came to a treaty, and conditions were made, that the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſhould make ſuch ſatisfaction, both for the wrong done to the merchants, and for the charges the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had beene at in theſe preſent warres, and for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their king, as the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould impoſe: and to that end, their Ambaſſadours ſhould forthwith goe with them to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and for ſecurity of this, they ſhould entertaine into the city, till the conditions were performed, ſuch a

company of ſouldiers, as the Lord admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhould thinke ſufficient, for the guard of the place; this if they would not agree to, they ſhould ſtand to the hazard of the fight, neceſſity ſo urged them, that of force theſe conditions were excepted: only they deſired that they might bee no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with their king, who was ſo fell a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that they were not able longer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him, and therefore, they requeſted the Duke, that ſince it was his fortune to have him in his hands, hee would bee pleaſed to uſe ſuch meanes with the king, as that the tyrant might no more trouble them, and if hee would take ſuch an order, they would wholy ſubmit themſelves to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, rather chooſing to bee commanded by a ſtranger, than ſuch a monſter.</p>
            <p>Every thing being ordred, in a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient maner, and a garriſon of ſouldiers put into the towne; the Duke of <hi>Midnia,</hi> with the two noble youthes, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner king of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors of the towne returned homeward, where they were received with the loud clamours and ſhoutes of joy, of the overgladded

people, every where they came, ſhewes and triumphes were preſented them, and all of them, ſome in one ſort, and ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſetting forth the honourable actions of the noble <hi>Sicilians:</hi> in this pompous manner, they came at laſt to the court at <hi>Sivill,</hi> where they were entertained by the king in moſt loving manner, eſpecially the two brothers, whom with the armes of love hee imbraced, calling them his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and defenders, imputing thoſe things to their honour and fame, that they of duty ought to have performed. Thus liv'd theſe two in honour and credit, every man highly eſteeming them, as the onely mirrours of admirable valour, and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wiſedome in that age.</p>
            <p>This honour done to the overthrowers made the <hi>Barbarian</hi> beyond meaſure mad, and his fortune ſo contrary to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, made him to doubt of his oracle, yet did he not abſolutely deſpair of it, till the Ambaſſadours being diſmiſſed, and every thing being agreed upon, and hee ſeeing no hope of eſcape, hee began then utterly to taxe the Gods of falſhood, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly blaſpheming thoſe powers for ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16805:61"/>
deluding him. After ſome time (at the requeſt of the brothers) hee was brought to the kings preſence (where to vindicate the Gods of ſuch injury as hee had offered them) they told him plainely that they were <hi>Sicilians,</hi> relating to the king, and the reſt of thoſe that were preſent, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, kindred, and family, and how they were ſtolne from <hi>Sicily</hi> by the Pyrats, and afterwards with them caſt away upon the coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where they were found by fiſherman of <hi>Tarragona,</hi> this newes as on the one ſide, it amazed the king, with ſuch an accident, ſo on the other ſide, it much more madded the <hi>Barbarian,</hi> curſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for neglect, for being overreach't in ſuch manner, and therefore, what with ſhame of his overthrow, and with new tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conſcience, for his old wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hee deſperately abſtained from food, and ſo dyed by famine, nor was his death lamented of any, but rather it much joyed the heart of the <hi>Tuniſians,</hi> to heare that hee was ſure enough for ever troubling them any more.</p>

countrey, their parents, and kindred, humbly requeſted the king to grant them his Majeſties licence to depart for a time to <hi>Sicily,</hi> to ſee whether their father and mother were alive or no, and afterward they would returne, and ſpend their lives in his graces ſervice. This ſo reaſonable requeſt, the king ſoone conſented to, and therefore willingly, hee gave them licence to depart at their pleaſure, and withall gave them his commendatory letters to the governors of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to receive them as men whom hee highly favoured. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly therefore, taking their leaves, (after due proviſion of every thing for their journey) they departed to <hi>Tarragona,</hi> where they inquired for old <hi>Sancho</hi> their foſter-father, whom having found, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with rich gifts, which did not ſo much glad the good old man, as it did joy him to ſee them, whoſe lives hee had ſaved, in ſuch honour and dignity; there they tooke ſhipping, and departed to <hi>Sicily,</hi> in which journey, wee will for a while leave them, and returne once againe to our wedding, which wee left in ſo good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe.</p>

Her continuall practiſe was to entiſe youth to any evill, and when ſhee fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of her intents, ſhee would ſit feeding herſelfe with deſpite and anguiſh, other mens adverſity was as a cordiall to her, but their proſperity poyſon'd her: ſhee practiſ'd phyſicke, but to what purpoſe I know not, for there were few that knew her, that would venture under her hands for a cure; ſo that generally ſhee was deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and contemned, as a woman of the

moſt wretched co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of the whole city.</p>
            <p>To this gracious miſtreſſe, did theſe two (ſtriplings in her art) come for ſhelter, who though ſhee were crabbed to others, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> did ſhee love them intirely, mov'd thereto perhaps by the congruitie of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and therefore welcoming them, ſhee inquired of their eſtate, and what chance had driven them to <hi>Palermo?</hi> but when ſhee knew the cauſe, her heart was ſo full of revengefull anger, that ſhee could not ſpeake in a good while, her teeth chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in her head, and her eyes ſtared, as if they would have leapt out, to ſeeke thoſe over-happy couples: at laſt anger gave place to words, and therefore taking her kinſmen by the hands, and ſeating them by her, ſhee thus ſpake unto them.</p>
            <p>Since the death of your good uncle (my deare nephewes) I have not entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned news that was ſo diſpleaſing to me, to ſee that fortune ſhould ſo much foole you, as to bring you to the goale of happineſſe, and then to leave you, and turne to your enemies. Truſt mee nephewes, I could bee angry with you, for loving, for what is love? that hee ſhould have power over
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16805:63"/>
you, that are men of a more auſtere condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then thoſe that are <hi>Cupids</hi> Votariſts; but more angry I am, in that being ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love, as you were, you would ſuffer your ſelves to bee ſo gull'd by a couple of wenches: had you them not in your owne power, to doe with them what you pleaſed? and yet muſt you needes ſtand to their courteſie, that would not yeeld to your prſwaſion, now by the criſped lockes of ſterne <hi>Hecate,</hi> you were too blame, too childiſh; you ſhould rather have ſhewed your ſelves like men, and as you ſurpriſed them well and cunningly, ſo you ſhould have proceeded accordingly, and not uſed ſuch intreaties to ſuch peeviſh sluts: who now that they are free, will laugh at your folly, and boaſt themſelves in your indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, vaunting of their wits in beguiling two men ſo well skill'd in <hi>Venus</hi> art, as <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus.</hi> It was not well nephews, it was not well, and I could chide you for it, but that I ſee you penitent and aſhamed of your owne weakneſſe, but ſhall theſe royſters boaſt themſelves thus? ſhall they ſay <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polypus</hi> are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? and <hi>Andriana</hi> cannot helpe them?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16805:63"/>
no, rather will I move hell, and call all thoſe powers to my aide, rather will I ſend the furies with their whips of ſteele to ſcourge them, till they fall to deſpaire, and hang themſelves, were not that a ſweet revenge, nephewes? truſt mee, were I to chooſe; no other way would I revenge my ſelfe, but by their deathes: but I ſee unwonted pitty appeare in your eyes, and you that were wont to delight in nothing ſo much as blood, now me thinkes ſtarted at the name of death. O then I ſee, love hath ſuch maſtery over you, that nothing but the fruition of thoſe ſweetes of love can ſatisfie you, and is it ſo indeed? well then, though I hate this fooliſh compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love in you, whom in my minde, it fitted rather to laugh at their downefall, than to deſire their company, yet ſince I hope, that after you have had your wils on them, your ſelves will be their fatal execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, I am contented for this once, to mollifie my hardned nature, and to beate my brains for a way to work your deſires.</p>
            <p>Theſe kind wordes ſo fired their hearts, that they thanked their aunt, promiſing if ſhee would performe this, that afterward
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16805:64"/>
they would bee wholly at her comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, whereupon, ſhee thus began againe.</p>
            <p>It is a hard matter nephewes, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe your deſires, it being a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible, for man or devill to change the will of any, and therefore you muſt not expect that they can bee wrought to love you, but you muſt determine, that when you have them in your power againe, (which is all I can performe for you) you muſt baniſh al lenity from you, and be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mov'd with their teares or intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; now to worke this, a new way muſt bee invented, becauſe I thinke they will not bee ſo fooliſh hereafter, to truſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo without company, and to attempt to take them perforce, were a matter of much difficulty, if not impoſſibility. I have therefore invented a meanes, whereby in ſpite of all the world you ſhall enjoy <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella;</hi> get mee preſently without delay, two paire of gloves, rich and coſtly, ſuch as you thinke may fit their hands, theſe will I ſo charme with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke ſpells, and forcible incantations, that whoſoever drawes them on, ſhall ſuddaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16805:64"/>
fall into ſo deepe a ſleepe, that all ſigne of life ſhall bee extinguiſhed in them, till they are pull'd off againe. Theſe inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gloves, ſhall one of you in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, preſent to the two wenches, as from their ſweet-hearts (but ſee you chooſe your time wiſely, that you bee not intrapped in your owne ſubtility) which they ſhall no ſooner have pull'd on, but drowſie ſleep will take poſſeſſion on their eyes, and then I hope I ſhall not need to inſtruct you how you ſhould uſe them: this (if you play your parts as well as I will mine) cannot chooſe but bee a plot thriving and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>This plot was ſo pleaſing to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, that thanking their aunt excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly for her good counſell, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fetch't the gloves, with which the devill and ſhee wrought ſo throughly, that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivolent power, was transfuſed into them; which was no ſooner done, but <hi>Hormiſda</hi> having by diligent inquiry, found a time when the two lovers were at their owne caſtle, in the diſguiſe of a ſerving-man, went to preſent their giftes to the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſiſters. Fortune ſo favoured him, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16805:65"/>
he found them walking together, all alone, in a little grove, which as it was out of ſight of their fathers houſe, yet was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hearing, and therefore they feared no treachery there, the falſe <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> finding them ſo conveniently, applauding highly his good fortune, went boldly to them, and with an humble reverence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with the gloves, with theſe ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>My noble maſters <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> humbly kiſſe the hands of their beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſtreſſes, and by mee their ſervant, preſent your Ladyſhips with theſe gloves, though farre too meane to be worne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch delicate handes, earneſtly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, to pardon their whole dayes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, from your wiſh't preſence: prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it hath beene, as a tedious winter of perpetuall froſt, to bee kept ſo long from the comfortable ſunne of your faire beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuch is the urgency of their preſent buſineſſe, that they muſt of neceſſity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this torment, till to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and then they will delay no longer, to tender you their ſervice, in the meane time, not to bee thought altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindefull
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16805:65"/>
of you, they have ſent me their unskillfull meſſenger, to make their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: but leaſt my unlikely preſence, might worke no beleife in your eaſie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they have intruſted mee with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of theſe gloves, as an inſtance that I came from them, kiſſing them before they parted with them, and deſiring you to put them on, that thoſe gloves that kiſt their lips, might bee ſo happy as to kiſſe your hands.</p>
            <p>The gentlewomen, could not chooſe but ſmile to ſee, with what a ſhamefac't baſhfulneſſe, the fellow delivered his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as ſeeming to bee an unskillfull rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician in the art of love; and therefore taking the gloves of him, they bade him returne their thankes to their maſters, and tell them, that had they not ſent a good oratour to make their way, they ſhould ſurely have beene well chidden for their negligence, but now they would pardon them, if they would keep their words, and not faile to ſee them on the morrow, and therewith they drew on the gloves, which were ſo fit for them, that they much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their skill in chooſing them, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16805:66"/>
transformed ſervingman, having done his meſſage, humbly taking his leave, told them hee would carry their anſwers to his maſters.</p>
            <p>Hee had not gone farre, but looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, hee might perceive them to bee laid downe on the graſſe, the vertue of the charme having ſo wrought on them, that they were not able to goe any further, and therefore yeelding to neceſſitie, they laid them downe: which hee well ſeeing, call'd forth his aunt &amp; brother, (who ſtood not farre off in a thicket) requiring their aide to beare them away, but the wretched <hi>Audriana,</hi> excellently well skill'd in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife, feeling their breath and pulſe, and perceiving all to bee quiet as ſhee wiſhed, ſtayed them with this gracious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</p>
            <p>Raſh beginnings (nephewes) make as untoward an ending, and a haſty bitch you know brings but blinde puppies: wiſe men ſhould conſider of their actions, before they undertake them, and ſee what ſucceſſe or feare of danger they carry with them, and not runne headlong on without diſcretion, as if fortune muſt needes favour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16805:66"/>
you, howſoever you order your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. I ſpeake this (nephewes) as taxing your overhaſty forwardneſſe, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great moment; for what could you get by thus conveying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but an aſſured deſtruction? for you would bee the firſt that would bee ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for ſtealing them, as having done it before: therefore my counſell is, that you ſtay till they are buried, and then you may at pleaſure take them out of the tombe, and uſe them without ſuſpition; beſides, how would my heart leape within mee, if wee could by ſome quaint meanes, accuſe their ſweethearts of their death, and bring them to death for it. O it would make mee young againe, which mee thinkes were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to bee brought o paſſe, would you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my counſell, and behave your ſelves reſolutely &amp; like men! Not far off the two lovers are coming hitherwards, I deſcried them now againſt they come hither, goe you and raiſe the officers and the people to apprehend them, as guilty of poyſoning them, which you muſt conſtantly avouch; as for my ſelfe I will not bee ſeene in it, that it may carry the more ſhew of truth,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16805:67"/>
and when they come to ſee their ſweete-heartes, they ſhall not onely finde them (as they will ſuppoſe) dead, but alſo they ſhall bee apprehended, arraigned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and executed for their deathes, whileſt you two, void of all manner of feare, may freely injoy the ſweet imbraces of your loves, and I may fat my ſelfe with joy for the happy overthrow of two ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>This counſell was ſo well liked, that it was preſently put in practiſe, for the two brothers perceiving the gentlemen to bee neere at hand, ranne in all haſte to the towne, with a loud outcry, ſtrongly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydore,</hi> for the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella,</hi> which they conſtantly avouched themſelves to have ſeene, as they went that way by chance; this ſtrange accident amazed all men, eſpecially ſuch as knew the perſons that were ſo taxed, yet their conſtant accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of them, upon their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, moved a beleife in them, yet mixt with admiration for ſo rare a chance: of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers therefore and a guard being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then they went directly to the place
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16805:67"/>
where they found the two gentlemen, and old <hi>Clidamas</hi> (whom their outcry had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth) wofully lamenting the loſſe of two ſuch excellent creatures, blaming the crueltie of death and fortune, for croſſing ſo happy a marriage, as would have beene in the conjunction of ſo excellent paires: ſeldome is it ſeene, that greife goes alone, but commonly one falls upon the neck of another, and ſo it was here, for the guard upon the ſight of the Gentlemen, preſently apprehended them on ſuſpition of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for poiſoning the two gentlewomen: which <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus</hi> (being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed) conſtantly maintained to bee true, as having themſelves ſeene the deede done.</p>
            <p>This was ſtrange newes to the diſtracted lovers, and as ſtrange it was to old <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> for though hee was ſtrongly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the integritie, and vertue of his ſonnes, and knew by experience, that they lov'd his daughters exceedingly, yet the unmov'd geſture of the accuſers, his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, as not knowing them, made him wonder, yet could hee not bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but that they were falſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16805:68"/>
he told the officers, that they were miſtaken, and tooke wrong perſons, that the accuſers eyes had deceived them, taking one for another, that the gentlemen and his daughters were contracted together, and within three or foure dayes ſhould have beene married, had not this untimely chance hapned, and therefore it was not to bee credited, that they ſhould ſo ſudainely bee changed from dying for their loves, if it ſhould have beene denied them, to flat poyſoning them, which could not be done but for a mortall hate: but all would not doe, for the accuſers were inſtant and urge their aſſertion; and the officers beleeved, and therefore without any more reply, they carried them away to <hi>Palermo</hi> to priſon, yet before they went, they deſired <hi>Clidamas</hi> not to beleeve any ſuch report, proteſting that they were, as cleare of the fact, as they were grieved for the loſſe of their eſpouſed wives: requeſting moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he would for their ſakes, whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had affected, keepe the bodies unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, till the truth of the whole matter, ſhould bee made manifeſt, this he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to performe, ſo with teares on either<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16805:68"/>
they departed, they to priſon, and hee home, with his ſuppoſed dead daughters to his owne houſe.</p>
            <p>The day of triall was within two dayes after, which being come, and the Iudges ſeated according to the cuſtome, the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were placed at the barre, where plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not guilty, and putting themſelves to the triall of the law, the accuſers were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſtand forth and ſpeake, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Hormiſda</hi> ſtood forth, and ſpake thus.</p>
            <p>It may ſeeme a ſtrange matter (reverent Iudges) for us, that are meere ſtrangers in this place, to accuſe them of ſuch eminent note as theſe two are reported to bee, and of a crime ſo monſtrous and hainous, but our conſciences told us, that if wee kept ſuch a deed of darkeneſſe privy to our ſelves, wee ſhould make our ſelves alſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the fact, and therefore wee thought it better to accuſe them, then to carry about with our ſelves the tedious gripings of a guilty conſcience; for alas, what elſe would it have benefited us, to have them periſh? they being men ſo farre from doing us any injury, that I know not whether wee have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16805:69"/>
ſeene them heretofore or no, and therefore farre bee it from you, to imagine that wee ſhould accuſe them out of ſpleene or anger, whom now firſt of all wee know: and I would to God it had not beene our hap ſo to have knowne them, then ſhould we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance have beene ſafer, and avoided the envy of the over-affectionate multitude, for accuſing them great in their favour: for you are not ignorant my Lordes, what a burthen we have brought upon our ſelves, wee incurre the malice of the people, what more violent? we adventure rude and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt men of excellent eloquence and attracting rhetorick, and what more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe? we undergoe the ſharp cenſure of the law, if wee ſhould bee overthrowne, and what more dangerous? yet ſuch is our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led confidence, in the juſtice of our owne cauſe, &amp; the truſt we have in your upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that wee dare adventure all theſe, and as many more, in the diſcharging our ſoules of ſo heavy a weight, as the concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſo impious a murder</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhips, therefore to underſtand, that upon the day of this bloody deed, my friend here and my ſelfe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16805:69"/>
travailing towards <hi>Palermo,</hi> and paſſing through a little grove, ſuddainely heard a cry, and the neerer we appoached to it, the more perfectly we perceived it to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans voice, and therefore making haſt, wee might ſometimes by fits, hear theſe or ſome like ſpeeches, as gentle loves have pitty on us, bee not ſo unmercifull, to ſtaine your faire hands, in our innocent bloods, theſe words made us mend our pace, to ſee if wee could (as manhood willed us) ſave the lives of the women, from ſuch bloody butchers; wee were no ſooner come into ſight, but wee might behold, the two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen (that are now dead) kneeling at the feet of theſe two, (men I cannot call them) who with their daggers in one hand, and a cup of poiſon in the other, ſtood over them with menacing looks and threatning geſture, offring them deadly poiſon, or they ſhould feele the ſharpneſſe of their merciles daggers, which we ſeeing, preſently cried out to them to hold their hands, and deſiſt from ſo unmercifull a deed, withall with our ſwords drawne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring to inforce them, if they would not give over, but they (as we then proved, and

ſince have heard) being men approved in warre and fights, preſently grew too hard for us, &amp; would have charmed our tongues for ever babling, if our legs had beene no better than our hands: but the Gods bee thanked wee outranne them, and ſo ſaved our ſelves, they had no ſooner chaſed us, but they returned againe to their former buſineſſe; wee being now ſafe from their ſwordes, willing to ſave the Gentlewomen, and yet not daring to come into their ſight any more, reſolved that my friend ſhould runne to the towne to fetch helpe, whil'ſt I getting as nere as I could, obſerved their actions: ſo wee parted, and I cloſely creeping along a banke, came within hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them, when I might heare one of the Gentlewomen, thus ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Alas deare love! what chance hath ſo ſuddainely converted thy earneſt love, to ſo deadly hate? what hath poore <hi>Callan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> done, to incite <hi>Cleanthes</hi> to this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? alas my love, tell mee my fault, that before I dye (if I muſt needes dye) I may repent me of it if I can, if not, I may the more willingly receive my death, as having done a fault which <hi>Cleanthes</hi> cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16805:70"/>
To which, hee made this anſwer, Plague of my heart (ſaid hee) thy life is the onely fault that I finde in thee, and of that I would faine purge thee, either by this precious potion, or letting thee blood with this daggers point, and why is my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fault (ſaid ſhee?) becauſe whileſt I live (ſaid hee) I ſhall never bee happy, for mine eyes have beheld ſo tempting a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I am dead till thy death releaſe mee of that fond contract, that formerly I made with thee. Nay then tis time that I were dead, (ſaid ſhe) that am a hinderer of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes</hi> happineſſe, and is this your doome too (ſaid the other gentlewoman to her falſe friend) it is (ſaid hee) and therefore diſpatch, and either drinke this poyſon, or feele the ſharpneſſe of my daggers point, and therewith they thruſt the cups to their mouthes, holding their daggers at their breaſts, but the poore gentlewomen not knowing which to chooſe, and inforced to chooſe one; dranke the poyſon, and ſo died: oft did my heart bid mee to goe and reſcue, yet I durſt not adventure mine own life to ſave an others. No ſooner were the two gentlewomen cold and dead, but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16805:71"/>
my friend returned with officers from the towne, but too late, for they were paſt all helpe, the two murderers no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them coming, but thinking no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had ſeene the deed done; they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dead bodies, lamenting their deaths with many a fained ſigh, and many a teare forcibly wrung from their relentleſſe eyes. Thus my Lords you have heard the truth of all, which how ſtrange ſoever it ſeemes, yet if you conſider the force of prevailing luſt, what power it hath over mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will not ſeeme a thing impoſſible, for two ſuch youg men to bee overcome with luſt, and being overcome, to be drawn by it to worke ſuch outrage. Conſider my Lords, that they which could do ſuch a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, could diſſemble it, &amp; they that could ſo well diſſemble, can as ſtiffely deny the fact, it being now their onely ſafety; for I do not thinke they are ſo fond to hope for mercy, after the doing of an act ſo foul, and conſider that when wee would have ſaved them, and could not, wee doe now our beſt indeavours to bring the actours to due puniſhment, that ſuch a vile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane deed, may not want a deſerved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16805:71"/>
recompence.</p>
            <p>This hee ſpake with ſo ſetled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd a countenance, that he poſſeſſed the hearts of the whole bench, with a ful belief of what he ſpake: yet that the cuſtome of the law might proceed according to the cuſtome, the priſoners were commanded to ſpeake for themſelves, what they could, whereupon <hi>Cleanthes</hi> thus ſpake.</p>
            <p>Were thy ſword as valiant as thy tongue, I would deſire theſe Lords that the juſtice of the cauſe might onely bee decided by our ſwords, then would I make thy falſe tongue unſay, what it hath now ſpoken, or ſend thy blacke ſoule to the loweſt hell to teach thoſe lying ſpirits a new way to falſhood: but ſince thou haſt cunningly confeſt thy ſelfe too weake, I ſcorne to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee a combat, rather will I fight with thee at thine owne weapon; and though my tongue bee not ſo voluble as thine, yet ſhall thee pure ſincerity of my hearty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, out ballance the faire colours of thy ſlanderous rhetoricke. What ere thou art, thou art as farre from my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as thy ſpotted ſoule is from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, onely I know thee to bee falſe and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16805:72"/>
wretched, hired it may bee for ſome bribe, to accuſe innocent men, or if thou doſt it of thy ſelfe, thou art ſo farre below mee, that I cannot imagine an occaſion why thou ſhouldeſt doe it, nor know I how to anſwer thee as thou deſerveſt. To anſwer to his accuſation with an abſolute negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (though it were ſufficient in reſpect of the clearneſſe of our conſciences) yet in reſpect of your ſatisfaction (worthie Lordes) it might ſeeme lame, as wanting due proofes to make it goe upright. To anſwer therefore, to this falſe accuſation, I abſolutely deny it to be falſe, for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reverent Iudges, the perſons accuſing, men of no note, inſomuch that I think there is no man in this whole aſſembly, that hath any knowledge of them, ſo that for ought I or any man elſe know, they may bee men of ſo wicked converſation, that they are not to bee beleeved, but of that I am not now to diſpute, next conſider my Lordes the perſons accuſed, men (that if it may bee lawfull for us to ſpeake in our owne praiſe) have alſo been reputed vertuous and honeſt, never before tainted with the leaſt crime, but eſteemed among
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16805:72"/>
the beſt and moſt vertuous people of this countrey, and among them not as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings of all, but as men of cheife note and reckoning, but that is not now to availe us, for wee are accuſed, and theſe are our accuſers, but of what doe they accuſe us? of the deathes of <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> good Gods! how miſerable are wee two of a ſuddaine become, not onely to be deprived of the lives of our lifes, our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſpouſes, but to bee alſo accuſed as men ſo voide of grace and pitty, nay of valour and manly conſtancy, as not onely on a ſuddaine to hate, but alſo ſo cruelly to murder thoſe our ſo deare ſpouſes, good Gods what ſhould I ſay if this be beleeved! who ſhall bee free from ſlanderous accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? whom will not deſperate villains for gaine or malice dare to accuſe? if it bee beleeved that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> were the deaths of <hi>Callanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella,</hi> who will not feare to love, leaſt his love ſhould miſcarry, and hee bee condemned for the fault, for were they not our deareſt treaſures? could wee live one day from their ſight? were they not our ſelves? and how ſay you then? that <hi>Callanthia</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:16805:73"/>
kneeled at <hi>Cleanthes</hi> his feete, begging for mercy and could not obtaine it: as if <hi>Cleanthes</hi> ſhould have ſought for pitty from himſelfe, and been denied it, how ſay you that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> preferred the beauty of another before <hi>Callanthia's,</hi> as if <hi>Cleanthes</hi> ſhould love any ones face more then his owne, how will you perſwade that <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> ſhould poyſon <hi>Callanthia,</hi> as if <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> ſhould bee drawn to poiſon himſelfe, and how will you make any one believe, that <hi>Polydore</hi> was of that minde too, as if <hi>Polydore</hi> ſhould bee as madde as <hi>Cleanthes</hi> to poyſon himſelfe, if you can believe this? what will you not believe? or if you will not believe this to bee falſe? I can onely foreſee what will follow, but know not how to avoide: for wee can ſay no more in our defence then this, that none loved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better then wee did them, and therefore none ſo unlikely as wee to murder them.</p>
            <p>This ſpeech though it were in it ſelf true; and bred a like working in the hearts of many, yet weighed with the others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement aſſeverations, and reproofes, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſmall force to them that were of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16805:73"/>
indifferent affection to either, which the Iudges pondring and overwaighing of the plaintiffes truth, hee proceeded to ſentence in this manner.</p>
            <p>It is a hard matter in ſo difficult a cauſe, to give a right ſentence, it is therefore the duty of the accuſers, to bring in a true evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, elſe it will redound to their owne ſhame and ignominy: conſider therefore, you that are the plaintiffes, that if you falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe theſe gentlemen, their blouds will bee required at your hands, and you ſhall dearely pay for it, you alſo that are heere accuſed, if you bee guilty of the crime? I would adviſe you openly to confeſſe it, and disburthen your ſoules of ſo cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a trouble, as I know the ſmoothering of ſuch a ſinne will bee, but if you know your ſelves innocent? you ſhall bee ſure of an unſpeakeable joy at your deathes, and that is all the comfort I can give: for wee have not eyes that can pierce into the bottomes of mens hearts, wee are to judge by the outward appearance, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccording to the evidence that is brought againſt you, now therefore conſidering, your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, doe heere accuſe you of this murder,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16805:74"/>
not by meere probability, by plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, as having themſelves ſeene the deed done, which you doe not cleare your ſelfe off, but onely by certaine likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, as how unlikely it is for men of your ranke and quality, to doe ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes to perſons whom you ſo dearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, indeed it is ſomething unlikely, but not a matter of impoſſibility, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hearing what either ſide hath or can ſay, I thinke it the ſafeſt way to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the great appearance of truth.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, you two <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydore,</hi> have beene here accuſed, arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and convicted, of the murder of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthia</hi> and <hi>Florella,</hi> I then pronounce your ſentence, that you be had from hence, to the great market place, and there a ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold being erected, you ſhall upon it loſe your heades, and the Gods ſhew mercy on your ſoules.</p>
            <p>The ſentence was forthwith put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for a ſcaffold being errected in the market place, the two condemned gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (with a ſufficient guard) were brought unto it, where being mounted up, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16805:74"/>
the officer that was appointed to ſee the execution done, that hee would grant them ſo much reſpite, till they might ſend to the houſe of old <hi>Clidamas,</hi> to bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bodies of his dead daughters, that they might take their laſt farewell of them: to this the officer willingly conſented, and one was ſent to fetch them.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Clidamas,</hi> who all this time had kept his houſe, as in ſuſpence what ſhould become of his two friendes, now that hee heard of their condemnation, and the meſſage they had ſent unto him, riſing up and ſaying nothing but, O juſtice, how are thy blinde eyes abuſed! hee tooke the dead bodies, and laid them both upon one beere, apparrelled ſtill as they were at firſt, and with them went to the city, and coming to the ſcaffold, and taking his friendes about the neckes, it was a good while ere teares would let him ſpeake, at laſt ſpeech made an eruption to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>How is it, O yee Gods! that yee have no way to defend the innocent? muſt it needes bee that a guiltleſſe life muſt be loſt for a deed that ſome other blondy villaine
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16805:75"/>
hath committed? if it be ſo then? at leaſt grant me this boone, that the truth of this miſtery, may at one time or other be more evidently knowne to all the world, that though they loſe their lives, yet their fames may live in everlaſting memory: for thinkes my deare <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> that I beleeve this accuſation? no, no, my heart is as free from any ſuch ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as your hands and hearts I know were farre from doing a deede ſo misbecoming you, and may your ſoules take as much comfort after death, as mine is farre from thinking any harme in you. Theſe words were ſpoken by him ſo affectionately, that it mov'd all his hearers to pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, but the gentlemen with undaunted hearts, teſtifying that his thoughts did not deceive him, thanked him for his good opinion of them, nothing doubting but time would make it more cleare to bee a truth infallible. And therewith they went to take their laſt leaves of their dead miſtreſſes, and therefore approaching neere the beere, &amp; diſcovering their faces (which death could not rob of thoſe innate perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that liberall nature had beſtowed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16805:75"/>
on them in their births, <hi>Cleanthes</hi> (while <hi>Polydore</hi> did the like to <hi>Florella</hi>) tooke his farewell of his ſenſeleſſe <hi>Callanthia</hi> in theſe laments.</p>
            <p>Could that dead tongue of thine, (O lovely corpes of my once deare <hi>Callan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi>) relate the ſtory of thine owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I know it would pronounce mee as guiltleſſe of thy death, as thou in death art beautifull, but ſince it hath ſo pleaſed the Gods, that thoſe pleaſing oracles are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc't, by whoſe miſchievous hands I know not, let thy ſoule freely pardon thy <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi> for leaving thee alone when this wretched deede was done, which elſe my preſence might have prevented, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the Gods laid this juſt plague up-mee, and I acknowledge my ſelfe, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to indure this ſhame for ſuch a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Yet I beſeech thee by thoſe chaſte kiſſes that oft have paſt betweene us, by thoſe firme troth-plights, which have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly beene regiſtred in the bookes of our true hearts, pardon mee this fault, that when our two ſoules ſhall meete in the happy ſhade of faire <hi>Elyſium,</hi> mine may not be chidden away from thine, but wee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16805:76"/>
may with eternity of joy, renew thoſe loves never to have ending there, which here are abnoxious to ſo many caſualties, that wee may ſit together hand in hand, and with a fulneſſe of joy, recount the laborinth of our hapleſſe love. In the meane time, O give mee leave to dew thy cold hands, with theſe warme drops of love, the onely tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of my dying conſtancy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he pull'd of her gloves, and putting her hands to his eies moiſtned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his true teares, and thus proceeded: now may you cloſe your ſelves in peace my happy eyes, having imbalm'd thoſe precious hands of hers, that inrich't every thing that touch't her: and you pale lips of my <hi>Callanthia,</hi> O give me leave to kiſſe you, and though I expect not the like comfort from you, that I was wont to have, when (like a bold theefe) I have ſtolen that odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous breath, ſilently creeping through your ruby doores, whilſt mine eyes were gazing in hers, to ſee if they perceived me, yet let mee take of you the laſt kiſſe that I am likely ever to take from you; and therewith laying his lippes to hers, hee might ſenſibly perceive the warme breath
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16805:76"/>
come ſtealing forth, whereat not a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, hee felt againe, and ſtill hee felt it more freſh and warme, therefore calling ſuddainely to old <hi>Clidamas,</hi> hee bade try if he could feele nothing.</p>
            <p>By this time the charme being remov'd, the vitall ſpirits became to get the maſtry over drowſie ſleepe, and ſhe began to open the faire windowes of her eyes: when loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king round about her, not knowing where ſhe was, or how ſhe came thither, ſeeing her father by her almoſt diſtracted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and her lover ſtanding bound before her, and herſelfe lying dead, ſo the wonder had almoſt made her to dye in earneſt, that was before but dead in ſhew.</p>
            <p>You may better imagine (gentle reader) then I can any way expreſſe the overflow of joy, that was then on all ſides, but ſtil the wonder remained, when the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women being asked, how ſhee came into that caſe? could anſwer nothing, but that on ſuch a day, a ſervant of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> brought to either of them a paire of gloves, which they had no ſooner put on, but they fell aſleepe, but what hapned
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16805:77"/>
ſince, they knew not, this was as ſtrange as the reſt to the two gentlemen, neither could they imagine who it ſhould be, that ſhould deliver ſuch a preſent in their names, yet by her wordes gathering that the ſleeping power lay in the gloves, they went and pull'd off the gloves from the hands of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> which was no ſooner done, but ſhee alſo awaked, to the no little comfort of the father and the lovers, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull amazement of all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>This ſuddaine accident hapning ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their expectation, wrought as ſtrange an effect in <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus,</hi> for ſeeing the exceeding affection, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of joy theſe lovers welcomed one another with, as if they had been raiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from death to life, they preſently tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their malicions purpoſes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolutely determining never to uſe any more waies to hinder their happineſſe, but alſo angry with themſelves for having done ſuch a deed, as denied them any part in this generallity of joy, and therefore that they might teſtifie their penitence, by an open cnofeſſion of ſo open a crime, they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16805:77"/>
came before them vpon the ſcaffold, and diſcovered themſelves, and earneſtly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their pardons, truly diſcovering the whole courſe of their proceedings, deſiring them, that as they themſelves had taſted the effects of love, they would ſo conſider the like in them, and judge of them with what lenity and charitie they could, this newes coming to the governours eare, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently coming to the place, and hearing the ſtory related againe, ſet the two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at liberty, and committed <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus,</hi> and the miſcheivous <hi>Audria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to cloſe priſon, till it ſhould bee knowne what ſhould further bee done with them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being finiſhed, <hi>Clidamas</hi> with his lovely company returned home, and as ſoone as the appointed day came, the two couples conſumated their joyes in a happy marriage, all the day was ſpent in variety of delight and pleaſure, and the moſt part alſo of the night, which being ended, every one prepared to bed-ward, when preſently they were ſtayed by a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſound of cornets, but we muſt returne a while to our <hi>Sicilians</hi> on the ſea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:16805:78"/>So long they ſailed, till they arriued at <hi>Sicily,</hi> not long before this marriage, they went preſently to the governour, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their letters, they were according as their dignitie required, entertained with him, they ſtayed till they had learned as much as they deſired, wherefore hearing their father lived, and their ſiſters were ſhortly to bee married to ſuch worthy men, they determined to reveale them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the wedding in ſome gratefull manner, for which purpoſe they thought a maſque to bee the fitteſt meanes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſcovering to the governour what they were, and their whole determination, they requeſted him to furniſh them with gentlemen fit for ſuch a buſineſſe, which hee both for their owne ſakes, whome by this little acquaintance hee began to affect, as alſo for the expreſſe commandement of the king to uſe them nobly, as alſo for his own liking of the plot performed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, divers firme reports had beene brought to the governour, by the keepers of the priſon, that <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus</hi> were wonderfull penitent for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16805:78"/>
their former offences, never ceaſing night and day to puniſh themſelves, with abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and teares, ſo that it was wonderfull to ſee thoſe men, that were but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo obdurate in wickedneſſe, to be now ſo penitent for their obdurateneſſe. Theſe newes made the Governor much compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate them, and conſidering that their fact, howſoever heinous, could not in law finde with death, and willing to nouriſh vertue in ſo good beginnings, and if it might bee, to beget a friendſhip betweene them and the other, hee thought it would not be amiſſe, to prefer them to be actours in the masque, as knowing them to be men not unskilfull in ſuch qualities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt revealing his intents to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who readily conſented to it, he ſent for them, and told them of his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they with a multitude of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke embraced, as a moſt gracious favour.</p>
            <p>Every thing being prepared for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they came into the bride-houſe, with a noiſe of cornets in this maner.

               <l>Two children erſt ſtolen from the <hi>Italian</hi> ſhore</l>

               <l>But firſt they came to honour this faire night,</l>
               <l>And beauteous brides, preferring their delight</l>

               <l>A milder cenſure for them, but before</l>
               <l>Wee proceed further. You whoſe aged boare</l>

               <l>To anſwer to a queſtion. Theſe have brought</l>

                  <hi>Neptune</hi> and wee to waite on them tonight,</l>
               <l>

               <l>The queſtion is, whether in doing ſo,</l>
               <l>They have deſerved a reproofe or no?</l>
            </q>
            <p>All this while <hi>Clidamas</hi> at muſing on the maner of this ſtory, entertaining thoughts of his loſt ſons, hee knew it was not impoſſible for the Gods to preſerve them, &amp; the words of the ſpeech lively pointed out their hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, only their country danted him, but that he thought might be a trick of poetry to ſay one thing and meane another, yet would he not give too much to his fancy, leaſt proving contrary, it might prove to his greater grief, and perceiving <hi>Triton</hi> to have finiſhed with that requeſt, he thus returned his anſwer,</p>
            <p>To anſwer you in your owne Poetical ſtraine, (truſt me gentle <hi>Triton</hi>) is more then my tired braine can performe, ſuch fancies rather fits young heads, then ſuch froſtbitten trees as I am, but yet not to ſend you away without your anſwer, thus in plain dunſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proſe I give my verdit, that if the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s father be here in preſence (as you ſay he is) they do not only deſerve no reproof, but alſo commendations, in chooſing a time to reveale themſelves in, which will make the fulneſſe of joy the more, by how much the company of participators will be greater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:16805:81"/>This judgment given, they all forthwith unmask't themſelves, and <hi>Hormiſda</hi> (who had with his vizar put off <hi>Neptune</hi>) taking the two gentlemen in his hands, came with them before old <hi>Clidamas,</hi> and kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſpake in his owne perſon thus.</p>
            <p>I cannot blame you to wonder to ſee us, that were but a little before your deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſo rudely to preſſe into your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but we truſt that as our penitent teares have made our peace in heaven with thoſe powers above, ſo this gift which wee here preſent to you, will beget a friendly league of amity betweene us, that were once ſuch mortall foes. Know then that <hi>Italy</hi> is turn'd to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and theſe two <hi>Italian</hi> gentlemen, are become to be <hi>Martuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo,</hi> the two loſt ſons of <hi>Sicilian Clidamas,</hi> ſtolen in their nonage by Pyrats, and ſince paſſing ſuch fortunes, as they themſelves can better then I relate unto you, and therefore if you meane to ſtand to your owne judgment, it is your part to welcome, as their wiſedome in ſo fit a time electing deſerveth.</p>
            <p>The good old man hearing this, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving plainly, that his former thoughts proved true prophets of what enſued, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe preſently &amp; running to them, he caught
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16805:81"/>
them about the neckes, crying out are yee come, more he would have ſpoke, but his overflowing joy, breaking into whole flouds of teares, ſtopped his utterance, long it was ere hee revived out of this extaſie, at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring himſelf, and giving them his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, hee turned to <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and <hi>Polipus,</hi> greatly rejoycing at their good converſion, &amp; thanking them for ſo gracious a preſent, &amp; entertaining them moſt willingly into his friendſhip, whil'ſt in the meane time the new come ſtrangers, were welcomed of their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and their new brothers in law, and by courſe of the whole aſſembly, a firme league alſo of never dying amity was concluded betwixt the bridegromes and the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted brothers,</p>
            <p>All this joy was poiſon to the envious <hi>Audriana,</hi> who ſeeing the good ſucceſſe of her enemies, and that her nephews alſo had forſaken her, and lothed her for her wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, malice and envious ſpleen ſo wrought on her, that of meere ſpite ſhe died, her death was not only not lamented of any, but alſo came as a happy newes to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, eſpecially to her nephewes, as not knowing the ſtrength of their new reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it ſhould bee battred by the force of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16805:82"/>
her inveterate malice.</p>
            <p>In this faſhion they lived together ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, til their urge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t affairs called <hi>Martuvio</hi> and <hi>Roderigo</hi> to keep promiſe with the king, taking leave of father, brothers, and ſiſters, and returning into <hi>Spaine,</hi> where they lived in much renowne and glory. Whil'ſt old <hi>Clidamas</hi> lived among his ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till he ſaw himſelfe made a grandfather by them, and then paying his due debt to extorting nature, he left many weeping eies for his death, and was in much honour bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by his ſons in law, who long after with their faire wives, lived in joy and felicity, making of an involved laborinth of growing love, a moſt happy and fortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
