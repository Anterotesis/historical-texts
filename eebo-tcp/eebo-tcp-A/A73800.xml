            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Anſweres to the particulars proponed by <hi>his Majeſties Commiſſionar.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving ſeriouſly conſidered with our ſelves that nothing in this world is ſo pretious, and ought to be ſo deare unto us as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that the diſeaſes of this Kirk after long toleration did threaten no leſſe than her owne ruine, and expiring of the trueth of Religion at laſt. And that a free generall Aſſembly was the ordinarie remedie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by divine authoritie, and bleſſed by divine providence in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kirks, and after a ſpeciall manner in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Wee have often and earneſtly ſupplicated for the ſame, and have laboured to remove what was objected, or what we could concieve to bee any hinderance to the obtaining of our deſire, like as wee have now for the ſame good end reſolved to returne this Anſwer to the particulars proponed to bee performed by us before an Aſſembly be indicted.</p>
            <p>The particulars proponed are either matters Eccleſiaſtick or civil: Eccleſiaſtick or kirk matters are, the Firſt concerning Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or ſuſpended by the presbyteries, ſince the firſt of Februar laſt without warrant of the Ordinar, that they bee reponed to their own places. The ſecond concerning Moderators of presbytrys depoſed ſince the forſaid day to be reponed, and all Moderators appointed by the ſaid presbyteries without warrant forſaid to deſiſt from executing the office of Moderator. The third anent Miniſters admitted ſince the day forſaid that they deſiſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exerciſing the function of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in that place to which they had beene admitted. Theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars doe concerne the power, duetie and particular facts or faults of presbyteries where in wee have no power to judge and determine whether they have lawfully proceeded or not, far leſſe can wee urge or command them to alter or recall what they have determined or done, in the ſuſpending, depoſing or admitting of Miniſters or Moderators: they beeing properly ſubject to the ſuperiour Aſſemblies of the Kirk, and in this caſe and condition of the Kirke, to the generall Aſſembly, where if they ſhall not after tryall juſtifie their proceedings from the good warrants of Scripture, reaſon, and of the acts and practiſes of the Kirk, they ought ſuſtaine their owne deſerved cenſure. And ſince upon the one ſide there be many complaints againſt the Prelates for their uſurpation over Presbyteries in the like particulars: And on the other ſide there bee ſuch complaints of the doings and diſorders of presbyteries to the offence of the Prelats. Wee truſt that his Majeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb facs="tcp:173359:3"/>
Commiſſioner will not eſteeme this to bee an hinderance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a generall Aſſembly: but rather a powerfull and principall motive with ſpeed to conveen the ſame, as the proper Iudicatorie for determining ſuch dangerous and univerſall differences of the Kirke. Neither doe wee heare that any Miniſters are depoſed, but ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpended during this <hi>interim,</hi> till a generall Aſſembly for their erronious doctrine and flagitious life: So that it were moſt offenſive to God, diſgracefull to Religion, and ſcandalous to the people to repone them to their places till they be tried and cenſured. And concerning Moderators none of them (as we underſtand) are depoſed, but ſome only changed, which is verie ordinarie in this Kirk.</p>
            <p>The fourth, anent the reparing of Parochinars to their own kirks, &amp; that Elders aſſiſt their Miniſter in the diſcipline of the Kirk, ought to bee cognoſced and judged by the particular Presbyterie to which the Parochiners and Elders are ſubject, ſince the cauſe may bee in the Miniſters no leſſe than the Parochinars and Elders. And incaſe they find no redreſſe there, to aſcend till they come to a generall Aſſembly, the want wherof makes diſorders to be multiplyed both in preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and paroches.</p>
            <p>To the ſixth, that Miniſters waite upon their owne Kirks, &amp; that none of them come to the aſſembly or place where the ſame is kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: but ſuch as ſhall bee choſen Commiſſionars from presbyteries.</p>
            <p>Wee anſwere, that none are to come to the place of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but ſuch as are either allowed, by commiſſion, or other-wiſe have ſuch <hi>interest</hi> as they can approve to his Majeſties Commiſſionar, and the Aſſembly conveened.</p>
            <p>To the ſeventh, anent the appointing of Moderators of presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be Commiſſionars to the genertll aſſembly: only conſtant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratours, who ceaſed long ſince, were found in the aſſembly 1606 (which yet was never reputed by this Kirk to be a lawfull national aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly) to be neceſſarie members of a generall aſſembly. And if both the Moderators, who if they bee neceſſarie members need not to bee choſen, and the choſen Commiſſionars repare to the aſſembly: the Aſſembly it ſelf can judge beſt of the members where-of-it ought to bee conſtitute.</p>
            <p>To the nynth, that no laick whatſoever meddle with the chooſing of Commiſſionars for the presbyteries, and no Miniſter without his owne presbyterie: Wee ſay that according to the order of the Kirk
<pb facs="tcp:173359:3"/>
none but Miniſters and Elders of Kirks ought to have voice in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Commiſſioners for presbyteries: And that no Miniſter or Elder ought to have voice in election, but in his own presbyterie.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the particulars are civill matters, as the fifth, anent the paying of the rents and ſtipends of Biſhops and Miniſters: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which wee can ſay no further, but that the Lawes are patent for them as others his Majeſties ſubjects. And that the generall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ought not to bee delayed upon any complaint of that kind.</p>
            <p>The eight, requiring that Biſhops and other Miniſters may bee ſecured in their perſons: Wee think ſo reaſonable, that we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe everie one of us for our owne parts they ſhall ſuffer no violence from us, and ſhall hinder others ſo far as we may, and if any trouble them otherwiſe, or make them any kind of moleſtation in that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, except by order of Law: the parties are juſtly puniſhable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrie of their fault as other ſubjects are.</p>
            <p>To the tenth, concerning the diſſolving of all convocations &amp; meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the peaceableneſſe of the Countrie: Theſe meetings beeing keeped for no other end, but for conſulting about lawfull remedies againſt ſuch preſſing grievances as threaten the deſolation of this kirk and State, cannot be diſſolved till the evills be removed: And we truſt that nothing in theſe our meetings hath eſcaped us, which carryeth in it the ſmalleſt appearance of undutiefullneſſe, or which may ſeeme to tend to the breach of the common peace; But although our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have heerein calumniated us, yet we have alwayes ſo behaved our ſelves as beſeemed his Majeſties moſt humble and loyall ſubjects petitioning his Majeſtie for a legall redreſſe of our juſt grievances.</p>
            <p>To the laſt, concerning the Covenant: The Commiſſioner his G. having many times and moſt inſtantly preſſed us with that point. We did firſt by invincible reaſons make manifeſt that we could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinning againſt God and our conſciences, and without wrong done to this Nationall Kirk, and the poſteritie, reſcind or alter the ſame. And thereafter did at length cleare the ſame of all unlawfull combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt authority by our laſt Supplication &amp; declaration which his Majeſties Commiſſionar accepted as the moſt readie and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all other meanes which could come within the compaſſe of our thoughts to give his Majeſtie ſatisfaction. The ſubſcription of this our Confeſſion of Faith and Covenant, beeing an act ſo evidently tending to the glorie of God, the Kings honor, and happineſſe of of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb facs="tcp:173359:4"/>
And having already proven ſo comfortable to us in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our hearts: It is our ardent and conſtant deſire, and heartie wiſh that both his Majeſtie, and all his good Subjects may bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame comfort: Like as wee find our ſelves bound by conſcience and by the Covenant it ſelfe to perſwade all his Majeſties good Subjects to joyne with us for the good of Religion, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties honour, and the quyetneſſe of the Kingdome, which being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly uſed by us without preſſing or threatning of the meaneſt, wee hope ſhall never give his Majeſtie the leaſt cauſe of diſcontent.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore according to our power and intereſt we are moſt willing to remove all hinderances, that thinges may bee carried in a peaceable manner worthie of our profeſsion and Covenant, doe ayme at nothing but the good of the Kingdome, and preſervation of the Kirk, which by conſumption and combuſtion is like to bee deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diſeaſed, except remedie ſome way bee ſpeedily provided; and delight to uſe no other meanes but ſuch as are legall, and have beene ordinarie in this Kirk ſince the Reformation, We are confident that without further delaye for preventing of greater evills and miſeries than wee can expreſſe Our juſt deſires ſhall bee granted. So ſhall we bee incouraged in the peace of our ſoules ſtill to pray for his Majeſtie all encreaſe of true honour and happineſſe.</p>
