            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Public is so seldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
in the Debates of
privat Men, and I am so
little concern'd at the Malice or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
of my Adversaries, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
som better Motive, I would never
presume to trouble the World with any
thing merely personal. But if the
Subject in question be of extraordinary
Weight and Consequence, and that on
the certain Decision of it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
the Tranquillity of a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of People, then I think a
Man is indispensably oblig'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
for the Truth; and so, while he's
endeavoring to serve others, no body
will say he ought to neglect his own
<pb facs="tcp:62348:3"/>
Defence. Whether the Treatise I now
send you be of this Nature, is submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to your equal Iudgment: And
unless I really design'd a Nobler
End by it than the Iustification of one
Person, neither you nor any body else
should lose your time in reading, no
more than I my self would be at the
Pains of writing it, which yet I'll
count the highest Pleasure if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it has never so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed

OR, A
DEFENCE
OF
Milton's Life.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I undertook
to write the Life of
the most celebrated
MILTON, I was far from ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that I should ever (much
less so soon) be oblig'd to make
an Apology in justification of
such a Work, both harmless in
it self, and greatly desir'd by
the World. There was no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law or Custom against
publishing the particular History
of this extraordinary Person, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62348:4"/>
in any respect whatsoever:
for the Lives of Good Princes and
Tyrants, of Orthodox and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Divines, of Virtuous and
Wicked, of Public and Privat
Men, are indifferently perus'd by
every body; of which it would
be superfluous to alledg Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
the thing being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known by all that have
learnt to read. Nor without such
a Liberty could we possibly
form a true Taste, or have any
certain Knowledg of Affairs,
since the Excellence or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of all Matters best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by opposing 'em to one
another. And I was sure (which
I find was no Mistake) that the
Learning and Sentiments of
JOHN MILTON were too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
not to deserve the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Commendation or Dislike,
according to the Judgment or
Affection of the Readers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62348:4"/>
SINCE therefore it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
lawful for me to write
whose Life I pleas'd (when my
Hand was in) the first Charge
against me, one would think,
should have bin, that I had
not fairly represented my Hero.
But, very far from that, the great
Crime whereof I am arraign'd,
consists in telling more than
som People would have me;
or discovering Truths not fit to
be known; and the Manner of
my Relation is to them altogether
as offensive and displeasing as the
Matter of it. 'Tis strange that
Men should be found of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
weak enough to make a
Crime of such Proceedings in a
Writer, who labors to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly independent from the
Fears or Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ments of any
Party; and who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ofess'd in the
very beginning of his Book, that
<q>being neither provok'd by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
nor brib'd by Favor, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62348:5"/>
would as well dare to say all
that was true, as scorn to write
any Falshood.</q> But the rude
Opposition with which I have
met, notwithstanding such plain
Declarations, convinces me more
than ever how much I was in the
Right by following the peculiar
Method I propos'd to my self
in compiling MILTON's Life,
and which I partly declar'd in
these Terms: <q>In the Characters
of Sects and Parties, Books or
Opinions, I shall produce his
own Words as I find 'em in his
Works; that those who approve
his Reasons, may owe all the
Obligation to himself; and
that I may escape the Blame
of such as may dislike what he
says.</q> Now, what could be more
impartial than this? or more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to secure me from all Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whatever should be the
Reception of MILTON from
the Public? Yet if by adhering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62348:5"/>
religiously to this Rule so loud
a Clamor was raised against me,
it is apparent how much worse I
might expect to be treated, had
I trod in the common Road. For
if, like most Historians, I had in
my own Words (tho' with never
so much Candor) related the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
or Sentiments of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
my Adversaries would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
have told the World that
this was not the true MILTON,
but one of my own Creation,
whom I promted to speak what
I durst not own; and by whose
Mouth I had publish'd all hose
Opinions which I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to other People. Well
knowing therefore the ordinary
Temper and Artifices of these
Men, I did partly on that Account
produce his own Words to obviat
their Sophistry and Calumnies,
their two principal offensive
Weapons; and also to spare my
self the Pains of Quotations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62348:6"/>
to prove I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injur'd him nor abus'd my
Readers. Besides this particular
Regard to them, I am also of
opinion that this is the best and
only good way of writing the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of such a Man. And had
the Ancients always follow'd it,
our Modern Critics would have
been less exercis'd to discern
their real Sentiments; nor wou'd
they be so often oblig'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
whether they understood
or mis-represented their Authors.</p>
            <p>BUT instead of any Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
like these, I am expresly told
that I ought not to meddle with
MILTON's Books, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
his Sentiments, or the
Memory of those Quarrel's where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was engag'd; which is
only, in other Words, that I
ought not to write his Life at
all. For what, I pray, is the
principal Part of a Learned Man's
Life, but the exact History of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62348:6"/>
his Books and Opinions, to inform
the World about the Occasion
of his writing, what it contain'd,
how he perform'd it, and with
what Consequences or Success?
I have no Reason from my own
second Thoughts, the Opinion
of better Judges, or the Fortune
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ok, to be dissatisfi'd
with my Conduct on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And had this Method, as
I said before, been strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
we might have more
Knowledg and fewer Critics.</p>
            <p>AY but, say these Gentlemen,
you have made an Inroad on our
Persuasion, and directly attack'd
the sacred Majesty of Kings, the
venerable Order of Bishops, the
best constituted Church in the
World, our holy Liturgy, and
decent Ceremonies, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Councils, the Testimony
of the Fathers, and a hundred
other things which we profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
respect and admire: nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62348:7"/>
are we the only Sufferers; for
almost all other Sects and Parties
have equal Reasons of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against you. Well, be it
so then; but, good Sirs, betake
your selves for Reparation to
JOHN MILTON; or, if he is
not to be brought to easie Terms,
defend your Castles and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
against him with all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
you can. For, I assure
you I am no further concern'd
in the Quarrel than to shew
you the Enemy, and to give a
true Account of his Forces.
And all this, if you were of a
peaceable Disposition, you might
learn from these plain Words
in the Conclusion of the Life:
<q>'Tis probable that you (as well
as I, or any other) may disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of MILTON's Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in several Cases; but
I'm sure, you are far from
being displeas'd to find 'em
particulariz'd in the History
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62348:7"/>
of his Life: For we should have
no true Account of Things, if
Authors related nothing but
what they lik'd themselves:
One Party would never suffer
the Lives of TARQUIN, or
PHALARIS, or SYLLA, or
CAESAR to appear, while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
would be as ready to
suppress those of CICERO,
of CATO, of TRAJAN, or
BRUTUS. But a Historian
ought to conceal or disguise
nothing; and the Reader is
to be left to judg of the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tues
he should imitat, or the Vices
he ought to detest and avoid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS might serve for a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Answer to all that has bin
yet objected to MILTON's Life,
if any Reply were thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
For the trivial and scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
Libels of mercenary Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
I shall never regard, they
being already sufficiently negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the World, and making
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62348:8"/>
themselves as little by this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as any of a more vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Temper could desire: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that to answer 'em in their
own Dialect, I must first learn to
speak it; which is absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my Genius, and below
the Dignity of Human Nature,
since no body openly approves it
even at <hi>Billingsgate.</hi> I shall as little
consider the censorious Tongues
of certain more Zealous than Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
People, who judge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by their own narrow
Schemes, and despise all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in comparison of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
Imaginations, wherein they
exceedingly please themselves; a
Happiness no body envies them.
Nor should I, if that were all, think
my self concern'd in making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Return to the obliging Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of those Gentlemen who
(as Father PAUL formerly said of
himself) remember me oftner in
their Sermons than in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62348:8"/>
tho' som of them are apt
to say, that when they mention
<hi>Turks, Iews, In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idels,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics,</hi>
they do not forget me.
But when I am openly accus'd
before the greatest Assembly in
the World, the Representative
Body of the People of <hi>England,</hi>
let the Charge be never so frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in it self, or to be slighted
on any other Occasion, yet such
a Respect is due to the Dignity
of those to whom it was exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that I hold my self oblig'd
to convince 'em of my Innocence;
and to remove all Suspicion far
from me, of what in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is acknowledg'd to be Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
or by them might be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Indecent.</p>
            <p>THE Matter of Fact is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
On the Thirtieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> Mr.
OFSPRING BLACKHALL, who
stiles himself <hi>Chaplain in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to His Majesty,</hi> Preacht a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
before the Honorable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62348:9"/>
House of Commons; wherein,
after exclaiming against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of MILTON's Life, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<hi>Icon Basilike</hi> to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of King CHARLES the
First, he pursues his Accusation
in these Terms. <q>We may cease
to wonder, says he, that he
should have the Boldness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Proof, and against Proof, to
deny the Authority of this Book,
who is such an Infidel as to
doubt, and is shameless and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
enough, even in Print,
and in a Christian Country, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly
to affront our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by declaring his Doubt,
that several Pieces under the
Name of Christ and his Apostles
(he must mean those now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the whole Christian
Church, for I know of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
are supposititious; tho'
thro' the remoteness of those
Ages, the Death of the Persons
concern'd, and the decay of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62348:9"/>
Monuments which might
give us true Information, the
Spuriousness thereof is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discover'd.</q>
Here is indeed a
Charge of a very high Nature, I
will not say in his own mean
Language, an impudent and a
shameless one; tho' if it be not
better prov'd, I cannot hinder
others from calling it what they
please, or the thing deserves. But
before I proceed to make Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
on it, I shall insert the
intire Passage of my Book, which
he has taken the liberty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging,
and so joining the
Words of two widely different
Assertions, as if they were but
one. About this little Artifice
however I shall make no difference
with him; for I can easily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
our Controversie, without
using all the Advantages I might
otherwise take.</p>
            <p>AFTER stating the Proofs
therefore that Dr. GAUDEN, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62348:10"/>
not King CHARLES, was the
true Author of <hi>Icon Basilike,</hi> I
added a very natural Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the following Words.
<q>When I seriously consider how
all this happen'd among our
selves within the Compass of
Forty Years, in a time of great
Learning and Politeness, when
both Parties so narrowly watch'd
over one anothers Actions,
and what a great Revolution in
Civil and Religious Affairs was
partly occasion'd by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of that Book, I cease to
wonder any longer how so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
supposititious Pieces under
the Name of CHRIST, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and other great Persons,
should be publish'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
in those Primitive times,
when it was of so much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to have 'em believ'd;
when the Cheats were too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
on all sides for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
one another, which yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62348:10"/>
they often did; when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
was not near so general
as now, and the whole Earth
entirely over-spread with the
Darkness of Superstition. I
doubt rather the spuriousness of
several more such Books is yet
undiscover'd, thro the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those Ages, the death
of the Persons concern'd, and
the decay of other Monuments,
which might give us true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</q>
Here then in the
first place it is plain, that, I say,
a great many spurious Books
were early father'd on CHRIST, his
Apostles, and other great Names,
part whereof are still acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to be genuin, and the rest
to be forg'd, in neither of which
Assertions I could be justly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to mean any Books of the N.
Testament, as I shall presently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
But Mr. BLACKHALL affirms.
That I must intend <hi>those now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the whole Christian
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62348:11"/>
Church, for he knows of no other.</hi>
A cogent Argument truly! and
clearly proves his Logic to be
just of a Piece with his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I admire what this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
has bin doing so long at
the University, that he should be
such a great Stranger to these
things. But now I find a Man
may be a very good Divine
without knowing any thing of
the Fathers, tho' a Layman is
always referr'd to 'em when he
starts any Difficulties, which
makes him sooner acquiesce and
swallow what he cannot chew
than get Information at so dear
a rate. But had Mr. BLACKHALL
been dispos'd to deal ingenuously
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> me, he might see, without
the help of the Fathers, that I did
not mean the Books of the New
Testament, when I mention'd
Supposititious Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ces under the
Name of CHRIST, since there is
none ascrib'd to him in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62348:11"/>
whole Bible; nor do we read there
that ever he wrote any thing,
except once with his Finger on the
Ground,<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 5.</note> when he acquitted the
Woman taken in Adultery: And,
for ought appears to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Mr. BLACKHALL may deny
that to be any Writing, because
he knows not what it was; yet
som <hi>German</hi> Divines, as well
read as himself, have presum'd to
tell us the Contents of it, and
came almost to excommunicating
one another in their solemn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
about this weighty Affair.
To this Negative Argument from
the Silence of the New Testament,
we may add the Positive Testimony
of St. AUGUSTIN and St. JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROM,
whereof the former affirms,
<q>That the Lord himself wrote
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dicit Augustinus (de Consensu Evangel. l. 1. c. 7.) quod ipse Dominus ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>NOW to convince all the World
that I did not intend by those Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Books of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as to shew the Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Uncharitableness of Mr.
BLACKHALL's Assertion, I shall
here insert a large Catalogue of
Books anciently ascrib'd to JESUS
CHRIST, his Apostles, their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
Companions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries.
Of these som remain
still entirely extant, which I shall
mark in their Places. We have
several Fragments of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by the Fathers; and all that
is left us of the rest are only their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62348:12"/>
bare Titles. I constantly refer to
the Books wherein they are quoted,
that every body may inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the Fact. And after the
Catalogue is ended, I shall distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the Books which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
alledg'd as the genuin
Works of the Apostles or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolic
Men, from those that
they rejected as the Forgeries
of Heretics; which is a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
however, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by som Party of Christians
to countenance their Opinions.
Next I design to name those Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of whose Spuriousness I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
tho' their Authority is still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
and so conclude this Point

HERE'S a long List for Mr.
BLACKHALL, who, 'tis probable, will
not think the more meanly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for being unacquainted with
these Pieces; nor, if that were all,
shoul'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I be forward to think the
worse of him on this Account: but
I think he is to blame for denying
that there were any such, because
he knew nothing of 'em; much
less should he infer from thence,
that I deny'd the Scriptures; which
Scandal however, because manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceeding from Ignorance, I
heartily forgive him, as every good
Christian ought to do.</p>
            <p>TO explain now therefore the
several Members of the Passage in
MILTON's Life; In the first place,
by the spurious Pieces I meant, tho'
not all, yet a good parcel of those
Books in the Catalogue, which I
am persuaded were partly forg'd by
som more zealous than discreet
Christians, to supply the brevity of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62348:24"/>
the Apostolic Memoirs; partly by
designing Men to support their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
Opinions, which they hop'd to
effect by virtue of such respected
Authorities: And som of 'em, I
doubt, were invented by Heathens
and Jews to impose on the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
of many wel-dipos'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who greedily swallow'd any
Book for Divine Revelation that
contain'd a great many Miracles,
mixt with a few good Morals, while
their Adversaries laught in their
Sleeves all the while, to see their
Tricks succeed, and were rivetted
in their ancient Prejudices by the
greater Superstition of such Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts.</p>
            <p>IN the second place, by the
Books of whose Spuriousness I said
the World was not yet convinc'd,
tho' in my privat Opinion I could
not think 'em genuin, I meant those
of the other great Persons, or the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Writings of certain Apostolic
Men (as they call 'em) which are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62348:25"/>
at this present, as well as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times, read with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Veneration. And they are the
Epistle of BARNABAS, the Pastor of
HERMAS, the Epistle of POLYCARPUS
to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the first Epistle
of CLEMENS ROMANUS to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and the seven Epistles of
IGNATIUS. These are generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
also by most Protestants; but those
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
signaliz'd themselves in
their Defence, and by publishing
the correctest Impressions of them.
The Ancients paid them the highest
Respect, and reckon'd the first four
of 'em especially, as good as any part
of the New Testament. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of BARNABAS is by<note n="*" place="bottom">Stromat. l. 2. &amp; 5. Contra Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nature;</hi> which, if believ'd, would
rob us of an Argument we draw
from their Integrity and Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
against Infidels, to say nothing
now of the many other ridiculous
Passages in BARNABAS. The Pastor,
or Visions, Precepts, and Similitudes
of HERMAS (who is suppos'd to be

read in the Epistle of IGNATIUS to
the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> Now these are the
Books of whose Genuinness and
Authority I took the Liberty to
doubt, notwithstanding the better
Opinion which is entertain'd of 'em
by others. My present Business is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62348:26"/>
not to insist on this Subject, but to
clear my self of an Imputation,
which I thought no body could
infer from my Words. Yet since
many were less knowing than I
imagin'd, tho' Mr. BLACKHALL alone
has the Candor of publishing his
Weakness to the World, I assure 'em
all that I alluded to these Books;
and I hope they will be just enough
in allowing me best to explain my
own meaning, and prove so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their own Reputation, as to
consider well of it, before they
censure me another time.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' I will not, as I said,
enter now into a particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
of these Writings, yet I
shall offer one thing to the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of their Defenders. Either
they really believe the Epistles of
BARNABAS and CLEMENS (for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
to be theirs, or to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious.
If not theirs, there's a
speedy end of the Dispute, and I
have attain'd my End without
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62348:27"/>
more Argumentation. But if they
think 'em genuin, why do they not
receive 'em into the Canon of
Scriptures, since they were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
and Fellow laborers of the
Apostles, as well as St. MARK or St.
LUKE? If this Quality was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to entitle the two last to Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
why should it not do as
much for the two first? And if this
be not all the Reason, pray let us
know the true one, having never
heard of any other. To say, that
tho' the Books are authentic, yet
they ought not to be receiv'd now
into the Canon, because the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
did not think fit to approve
'em, is but a mere Evasion: For
'tis well known, that till after EU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEBIUS'S
time, neither the second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of PETER, nor that of JAMES, or
JUDE, with som others, were
approv'd as Canonical; and yet
they were afterwards receiv'd by
the whole Church. Wherefore then
may not we as well at this time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62348:27"/>
the Epistles of CLEMENS and
BARNABAS, if they be undoubtedly
theirs, which I shall be persuaded their
Patrons believe, when they quote
'em as Scripture, and then I know
where to have them, and how to
deal with 'em. But of this enough.</p>
            <p>I SAID above, that by the spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Pieces I meant only a great
part of the Books which are recited
in the Catalogue; for others of
'em do not seem to deserve so
mean a Rank: and I am so far
from rejecting all those Books of the
New Testament which we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that I am rather solicitous
lest, as in the dark Ages of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
those we commonly call Apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Books, were added to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so at the same time, and in
as ignorant Ages before, several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might be taken away, for
not suiting all the Opinions of the
strongest Party. Nor is it unworthy
observation, that most of these
Books are condemn'd by the Decree
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62348:28"/>

this World wherein we live, with

            <p>SEVERAL of these Books where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I now treat, are quoted to prove
important Points of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by the most celebrated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as of equal Authority with
those we now receive; and the
Testimony of these Fathers was the
principal Reason of establishing
these in our present Cannon, and is

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62348:30"/>
TO these Considerations two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
may perhaps be made. First,
It is unlikely, they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll say, that EU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEBIUS
should not have read the
Ancients; nay, that the contrary
appears by his many Citations out
of them; and that consequently
those Works of the Fathers, which
we have now in our Hands, are
not the same which were read in
his time, or that at least they are
strangely adulterated, and full of
Interpolations. With all my Heart:
But then let us not be urg'd by their
Authority in other Points no
more than in this, since in one
thing they may as well be alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

and corrupted as in another; and
indeed, by a common Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of those Apostles whose Names
they bear, at certain times, and in
som Churches, yet they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
rejected by others. To this
I answer, That there is not one
single Book in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was not refus'd by
som of the Ancients as unjustly
father'd upon the Apostles, and
really forg'd by their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
which as no body thinks it
now a good Reason to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them, so I see not how it
should any more conclude against
my Opinion. But because the
various Sects of those early
Days did, like us, condemn one
another for damnable Heretics;
and the admitting or refusing, the
framing or corrupting of certain
Books, were som of the Crimes
which were mutually imputed, I
shall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w insist only on the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that of JAMES,
the second of PETER, the second
and third of JOHN, the Epistle
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62348:31"/>
of JUDE, and the Revelation.
These seven Pieces were a long
time plainly doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the<note n="*" place="margin">Let the third and twenty first Chapters of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical History of <hi>Eusebius</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, with what St. <hi>Ierome</hi> has written on the same Subject.</note> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
particularly

yet they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,

Now, I say, by more than a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

               </gap>mple)
were receiv'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and ought not therefore to
be rejected by the Moderns, if
the Approbation of the Fathers
be a proper Recommendation of
any Books.</p>
            <p>THE Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
which was held about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty Years after CHRIST,
and is the first Assembly wherein
the Canon of Scripture was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht,
could not among so great a

which were the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of the Apostles, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a particular Revelation
from Heaven, or by crediting the
Testimony of their Ancestors,
which was always better preserv'd
and convey'd by Writing than by
Oral Tradition, the most uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule in Nature, witness
the monstrous Fables of Papists,
Rabbins, Turks, and the Eastern
Nations both Christians and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
But of any extraordinary
Revelation made to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
we hear not a Word; and for
the Books I defend, I have the
same Testimony which is usually
alledg'd in the behalf of others.
However, I shall not be too hasty
to make a final Decision of this

to them what they wrote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

(who were the oldest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)
had a different Copy of
St. MATTHEW's Gospel, and the
<hi>Marcionites,</hi> had a very different

all the Epistles of St. PAUL were

               </gap>w of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Canon? A History of
the greatest Importance, as well

those now receiv'd by the

than was publish'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

not there mentioned, and other
Authorities for those which are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62348:36"/>
there: but I have already don
more than enough to prove a
thing, whereof, till the last thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> I thought few Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
wholly ignorant, much less
any one of the Clergy. Indeed I
never thought the History of our
Canon so impartially handled, or
so fully clear'd as a Matter of
such great Importance deserves;
and I despair of Mr. BLACKHALL's
giving the World any Satisfaction
in their Doubts concerning it. But
I hope som abler Person of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may particularly write on this
Subject; which, if I see neglected
also by them, I shall think it no
Intrusion on their Office to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it my self: and if I ever write
it, I promise it shall be the fairest
History, and the only one of that
kind that ever appear'd; For I
shall lay all the Matters of Fact
together in their natural Order,
without making the least Remark of
my own, or giving it a Color in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62348:37"/>
favor of any Sect or Opinion,
leaving all the Word to judge for
themselves, and to build what they
please with those Materials I shall
furnish 'em.</p>
            <p>I CONCLUDE this Point with
one Observation, to shew with what
Malice I am treated by some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
while others pass with them
for the most Orthodox Men in
the World, who have said infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more in plain and direct Words,
than they could infer with all their
Art from a few Expressions of mine,
and which the most ignorant of
my Adversaries could make no
more than Insinuation at the worst.
I talkt of spurious Pieces, and have
now as well shewn what those Pieces
were, as put a Distinction between
'em, and such as I thought genuin.
But let us hear what a Person says,
who, were he as much given to the
World as many of his Friends,
would make a more considerable
Figure, considering his great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62348:37"/>
to the National Church, and
the Respect he reciprocally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from it; I mean the famous
DODWELL, who alone, tho' a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
understands as much of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastic
History as the Divines
of all Churches put together. His

               <q>The Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Writings lay conceal'd in
the Coffers of privat Churches or
Persons, till the later Times of
TRAJAN; or rather perhaps of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRIAN;
so that they could not
com to the Knowledg of the
whole Church. For if they had
bin publish'd, they wou'd have
bin overwhelm'd under such a
Multitude as were then of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
and Supposititious Books,
that a new Examination and a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62348:38"/>
new Testimony would be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to distinguish 'em from these
false ones. And it is from this
New Testimony (whereby the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuin
Writings of the Apostles
were distinguish'd from the spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pieces which went under their
Names) that depends all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which the truly Apostolic
Writings have formerly obtain'd,
or which they have at present in
the Catholic Church. But this
fresh Attestation of the Canon is
subject to the same Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with those Traditions of
the Ancient Persons that I defend,
and whom IRENAEUS both heard
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62348:38"/>
and saw: for it is equally distant
from the Original, and could not
be made, except by such only as
had reacht those remote Times.
But 'tis very certain, that before
the Period I mention'd of TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JAN's
time, the Canon of the Sacred
Books was not yet fixt, nor any
certain number of Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the Catholic Church,
whose Authority must ever after
serve to determin Matters of
Faith; neither were the spurious
Pieces of Heretics yet rejected,
nor were the faithful admonisht
to beware of them for the future.
Likewise the true Writings of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62348:39"/>
Apostles us'd to be so bound up in
one Volum with the Apocryphal,
that it was not manifest by any
Mark or public Censure of the
Church, which of 'em should be
prefer'd to the other. We have at
this Day certain most authentic
Ecclesiastic Writers of those times,
as CLEMENS ROMANUS, BARNABAS,
HERMAS, IGNATIUS, and POLYCAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUS,
who wrote in this same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wherein I have nam'd 'em,
and after all the other Writers
of the New Testament, except
Iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and the two JOHNS. But in
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>RM<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>S you shall not meet with
one Passage, or any mention of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62348:39"/>
the New Testament: Nor in all
the rest is any one of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
call'd by his own Name.
And if somtimes they cite any
Passages like those we read in our
Gospels, yet you'll find 'em so
much chang'd, and for the most
part so interpolated, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known whether they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them out of ours, or som
Apocryphal Gospels: nay, they
somtimes cite Passages, which it
is most certain are not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Gospels. From hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is evident, that no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
was yet put by the
Church between the Apochryphal
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62348:40"/>
and Canonical Books of the
New Testament; especially if it
be consider'd, that they pass no
Censure on the Apochryphal, nor
leave any Mark whereby the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
might discern that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
less Authority to the
spurious than to the genuin Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels:
from whence it may
reasonably be suspected, that if
they cite somtimes any Passages
conformable to ours, it was not
don thro' any certain design, as if
dubious things were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
only by the Canonical
Books; so as it is very possible
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62348:40"/>
that both those and the like Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
may have bin borrow'd
from other Gospels besides these
we now have. But what need I
mention Books that were not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical?
when indeed it does not
appear from those of our Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Books which were last written,
that the Church knew any thing
of the Gospels, or that Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themselves made a common
use of 'em. The Writers of
those times do not chequer their
Works with Texts of the New
Testament, which yet is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the Moderns, and was
also theirs in such Books as they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62348:41"/>
acknowledg'd for Scripture; for
they most frequently cite the
Books of the Old Testament,
and would doubtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> have don
so by those of the New, if they
had then bin receiv'd as Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.
St. PAUL cites a Saying of
our Lord in the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;<note place="margin">Act. 20. 35.</note>
which, if he had it out
of any Writing, was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
out of these we now have.
The Gospels continu'd so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
in those Corners of the
World where they were written,
that the latter Evangelists knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what the Precedent wrote:
Otherwise there had not bin so
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62348:41"/>
many apparent Contradictions,
which, almost since the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Canon, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
the Wits of learned Men.
Surely if St. LUKE had seen that
Genealogy of our Lord which is
in St. MATTHEW, he would not
himself have produc'd one whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different from the other,
without giving the least Reason
for this Diversity. And when in
the Preface to his Gospel he tells
the occasion of his Writing;
which is, that he undertook it,
being furnisht with the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of such as were Eye-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of what he writes, he plainly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62348:42"/>
intimats, that the Authors of
the Gospels which he had seen,
were destitute of this Help: So
that neither having seen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
what they relate, nor
with any Care or Diligence
consulted such as had seen them,
their Credit was therefore dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and suspected; whence it
must necessarily follow, that the
Writers of those Gospels, which
LUKE had seen, were not at all
the same with our present Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</q>
So far Mr. DODWELL;
and (excepting the Genuinness
of the Epistles of CLEMENS, BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NABAS,
and the rest; for they are
incontestably ancient) I agree with
him that the Matters of Fact are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62348:42"/>
all true; tho' I am far from draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same Inference from 'em
as he has don, that there is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Proof for Episcopacy as for
the Canon of Scripture, which is
the Testimony of the Fathers of
the Second and Third Centuries;
and that the Disciplin was better
known, and preserv'd than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of the Apostles. Whoever
has an Inclination to write on
this Subject is furnisht from this
Passage with a great many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Disquisitions, wherein to shew
his Penetration and Judgment, as
how the immediat Successors and
Disciples of the Apostles could
so grossly confound the genuin
Writings of their Masters, with
such as were falsly attributed to
them; or since they were in the
dark about these Matters so early,
how came such as follow'd 'em by
a better Light; why all those Books
which are cited by CLEMENS and the
rest should not be counted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62348:43"/>
Authentic; and what stress
should be laid on the Testimony
of those Fathers, who not only
contradict one another, but are
often inconsistent with themselves
in their Relations of the very same
Facts; with a great many other
Difficulties, which deserve a clear
resolution from any capable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
tho' none may safely propose
'em but Mr. DODWELL, who I
heartily wish were always as free
and unprejudic'd as he is really
learned.</p>
            <p>THUS have I defended and
explain'd my self against Mr.
BLACHALL's Accusation: nor do I
question but I have given entire
Satisfaction to all impartial Men,
and lovers of Truth. But there's
another sort of People whom I
despair of ever contenting. These
never fail of finding in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of their Adversary, not
what is there, but what they have
a mind should be so, to represent
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62348:43"/>
him odious or dangerous. All the
Protestations in the World can
signifie nothing with them; nor
is it more safe than otherwise to
prove the contrary of what is laid
to one's Charge; for they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious
enough to discover the
hidden Poyson of every Word,
and will be sure to give loud
warning of the Danger, to shew
where the Snake lies in the Grass,
and to tell what's in the Belly of
the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse. But I shall not
be in great pain how such People
apprehend me, if I have the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to please the moderat and
discerning part of Mankind.</p>

HISTORY
OF

            <p>MR. BLACKHALL, who, by
a public Provocation,
would needs engage me
in a Controversie about spurious
Books, has not confin'd me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Impostures of Antiquity
alone, tho' it be pretty plain, that
this is Employment enough for
one body; but he likewise accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
me of not being more favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a Modern <hi>Saint,</hi> as he is
pleas'd to stile King CHARLES the
First. <q>That excellent Book,
which, he says, was compos'd by
himself in the time of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
will, he supposes, be an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62348:44"/>
everlasting Evidence of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
under his Sufferings to
after Ages, notwithstanding the
Endeavours that have bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
us'd to prove it spurious,
and the Confidence of a late
Writer (the Author of MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON's
Life) asserting it to be so,
without either producing any
new Evidence for the Proof of
his Assertion; or offering one
Word in answer to those just
and rational Exceptions that had
bin made before to those only
Testimonies which he insists up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to prove it a Forgery; or
making any Exceptions to those
later Evidences that have bin
produc'd to prove it Authentic.</q>
Whether this Book was compos'd
by himself is our Business at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to enquire, and shall be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determin'd: for as to his
improving by his Sufferings I will
not deny what I hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
commands me to believe.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62348:45"/>
The Reason why I produc'd no
new Evidence to prove the spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of <hi>Icon Basilike</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I thought the old ones suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
I vouchsaf'd no Answer to the
Exceptions made to those Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
because I neither thought 'em
just nor reasonable. And I would
not discuss the Facts that have bin
since alledg'd to prove the Book
Authentic, because I intended not
before to write a just Dissertation
on this Subject, and so was not
oblig'd to mention all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
relating to it. If Mr.
BLACKHALL does not think this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
satisfactory, I shall make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
now for all former Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and, being very desirous
to content him, will follow that
same Method he was pleas'd to
chalk me out in his Sermon.</p>
            <p>IN the first place therefore, to
make this Discourse complete, and
that the Evidence of the several
Parts whereof it consists, may the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62348:45"/>
better appear by laying 'em all to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether,
I shall here insert the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
which I made of Dr. WALK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER's
Book in MILTON's Life, with
ANGLESEY's <hi>Memorandum,</hi> and the
other Testimonies; I shall second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give particular Answers to the
Exceptions that have bin made to
all these Pieces: And lastly, shew
the invalidity of the Facts which
are alledg'd to prove King CHARLES
the First was the true Author of <hi>Icon
Basilike.</hi> I have not undertaken
this Work out of Affection or
Opposition to any Party, nor to
reflect on the Memory of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat
Prince, whose officious
Friends are much more concern'd;
but to clear my self from a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Charge, and to discover a
pious Fraud, which deserves not
to be exemted from Censure
for being the Contrivance of a
Modern Bishop, no more than
those of the ancient Fathers of the

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62348:46"/>
THE Relation of the whole
Fact in MILTON's Life is after this
manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p> In the Year 1686, Mr.
MILLINGTON hap'ning to sell the
late Lord ANGLESEY's Library by
Auction, put up an <hi>Ikon Basilike;</hi>
and a few bidding very low for it,
he had leisure to turn over the

he perceiv'd written with

               <p>This occasion'd the World to
talk; and several knowing the
Relation which the late Dr. AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THONY
WALKER, an <hi>Essex</hi> Divine,
had to Bishop GAUDEN, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of him what he knew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Subject, which he
then verbally communicated to
them: But being afterwards
highly provok'd by Dr. HOLLINGS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTH's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62348:47"/>
harsh and injurious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
he was oblig'd in his
own Defence to print an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that Book, wherein are
sufficient Answers to all the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or Objections that can be
made, and whereof I here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
an exact Epitome. He tells
us in the first place, that Dr.
GAUDEN was pleas'd to acquaint
him with the whole Design, and
shew'd him the Heads of divers
Chapters, with som others that
were quite finish'd: and that Dr.
GAUDEN asking his Opinion of the
thing and he declaring his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
that the World should
be so impos'd upon, GAUDEN bid
him look on the Title, which was
<hi>the King's Portraiture;</hi> for that no
Man is suppos'd to draw his
own Picture. A very nice Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
he further acquaints us,
that som time after this, being
both in <hi>London,</hi> and having din'd
together, Dr. GAUDEN took him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62348:47"/>
along with him to Dr. DUPPA the
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (whom he
made also privy to his Design)
to fetch what Papers he had left
before for his perusal, or to
shew him what he had since writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
and that upon their return
from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> place, after GAUDEN
and DUPPA were a while in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
together, the former told
him the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>
wish'd he had thought upon two
other Heads, the Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Common Pray'r Book,
and the denying his Majesty the
Attendance of his Chaplains;
but that DUPPA desir'd him to finish
the rest, and he would take upon
him to write two Chapters on
those Subjects, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did. The reason, it seems,
why Dr. GAUDEN himself would
not perform this, was, first, that
during the Troubles he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
the use of the Liturgy,
which he did not extraordinarily
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62348:48"/>
admire; and secondly, that he
had never bin the King's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
whereas Dr. DUPPA was
both his Chaplain, his Tutor,
and a Bishop, which made him
more concern'd about these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
Thirdly, Dr. WALKER
informs us that Dr. GAUDEN told
him he had sent a Copy of <hi>Icon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silike</hi>
by the Marquiss of <hi>Hartford</hi>
to the King in the <hi>Isle of Wight;</hi>
where it was, we may be sure, that
he made those Corrections and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
with his own Pen, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in my Lord ANGLESEY's
<hi>Memorandum:</hi> and which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to som then about him that
had accidentally seen, or to whom
he had shown the Book, to believe
the whole was his own. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Dr. GAUDEN, after the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
told Dr. WALKER, that the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> knew of his being
the real Author, and had own'd
it to be a great Service; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which, it may be,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62348:48"/>
the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> tho'
he was afterwards put off with
that of <hi>Worcester</hi> was promis'd
him. And, notwithstanding it
was then a Secret, we now know
that in expectation of this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
the great House on <hi>Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
Common was built indeed
in the Name of his Brother Sir
DENYS, but really to be a Mansion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>house
for the Bishops of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
Fifthly, Dr. WALKER, says,
that Mr. GAUDEN the Doctor's
Son, his Wife, himself, and Mr.
GIFFORD who transcrib'd it, did
believe it as firmly as any Fact
don in the place where they
were; and that in that Family
they always spoke of it among
themselves (whether in Dr. GAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN's
Presence or Absence) as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
written by him, which
he never contradicted. We learn,
Sixthly, that Dr. GAUDEN, after
part of it was printed, gave to
Dr. WALKER with his own Hand
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62348:49"/>
what was last sent to <hi>London;</hi>
and after shewing him what it
was, seal'd it, giving him cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Directions how to deliver
it, which he did on <hi>Saturday</hi> the
23d of <hi>December,</hi> 1648. for Mr.
ROYSTON the Printer, to Mr. PEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COCK
Brother to Dr. GAUDEN's
Steward, who, after the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was finish'd, gave him, for
his Trouble, six BOOKS, whereof
he always kept one by him. To
these Particulars Dr. WALKER
adds, that the Reason why the
Covenant is more favorably men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in <hi>Ikon Basilike,</hi> than the
King or any other of his Party
would do, was because Dr. GAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN
himself had taken it: That
in the Devotional part of this
Book there occur several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which were habitual to
GAUDEN in his Prayers, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in privat and public were
conceiv'd or extemporary; and
that to his Knowledge it was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62348:49"/>
Dr. GAUDEN, being best acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Beauty of his own
Sayings, who made that Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Sentences out of <hi>Ikon
Basilike,</hi> intitul'd, <hi>Apophthegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Caroliniana.</hi> These and som
Observations about the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Persons variation of Stile
on different Subjects, with the
facility and frequency of perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
others, may be futher
consider'd in Dr. WALKERS Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Account. In this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stood the Reputation of this
Book, till the last and finishing
discovery of the Imposture was
made after this manner. Mr.
ARTHUR NORTH, a Merchant now
living on <hi>Tower hill, London,</hi> a
Man of good Credit, and a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
marry'd the Sister of her that was
Wife to the Doctor's Son,
CHARLES GAUDEN, who dying, left
som Papers with his Widow, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which Mr. NORTH, being
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62348:50"/>
concern'd about his Sister in Law's
Affairs, found a whole Bundle
relating to <hi>Ikon Basilike:</hi> These
Papers old Mrs. GAUDEN left to
her darling Son JOHN, and he to
his Brother CHARLES. There is
first a Letter from Secretary
NICHOLAS to Dr. GAUDEN. 2. The
Copy of a Letter from Bishop
GAUDEN to Chancellor HYDE, where,
among his other Deserts, he pleads
that what was don like a King,
should have a Kinglike Retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that his design in it was
to comfort and incourage the
King's Friends, to expose his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and to convert, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
There is, 3. The Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Bishop to the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> wherin he strongly urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
his Services. 4. A Letter
under Chancellor HYDE's own
Hand, dated the 13th of <hi>March,</hi>
1661. wherein he expresses his
uneasiness under the Bishop's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and excuses his inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62348:50"/>
yet to serve him: but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Conclusion it contains
these remarkable Words: <hi>The
Particular you mention has indeed
bin imparted to me as a Secret; I
am sorry I ever knew it: and when
it ceases to be a Secret, it will please
none but Mr. MILTON.</hi> There are
other Papers in this Bundle, but
particularly a long Narrative of
Mrs. GAUDEN's own writing, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
shewing her Husband to
be Author of <hi>Ikon Basilike.</hi> It
intirely confirms Dr. WALKER's
Account, and contains most of
the Facts we have hitherto rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with many other curious
Circumstances too long to be
here inserted, yet too extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
not to be known; wherfore
I refer the Reader to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Paper, or to the faithful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
made out of it before se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
learned and worthy Persons,
and which is printed in a Paper
intitul'd, <hi>Truth brought to Light</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62348:51"/>
Thus came all the World to be
convinc'd of this notorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture;
which as it was dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
contriv'd, and most cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
improv'd by a Party
whose Interest oblig'd 'em to
keep the Secret, so it happen'd to
be discover'd by very nice and
unforeseen Accidents. Had not
GAUDEN bin disappointed of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
he had never pleaded his
Merit in this Affair; nor would
his Wife have written her Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
had King CHARLES the
Second bestow'd one half Years
Rent on her after her Husband's
decease; which, upon her Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and considering her nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Family, none could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
should be refus'd. It was a
slighter Accident that begot a
a Confession from two Kings,
and CHARLES's own Sons. And I
doubt if any other than one of
Mr. MILLINGTON's great Curiosity,
and no Bigotry, had the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62348:51"/>
of my Lord ANGLESEY's Books,
we should never have heard of
the <hi>Memorandum.</hi> Had not Dr.
HOLLINGWORTH's indiscreet Zeal
provok'd the only Man then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
who had any personal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of this Business, Dr. WALKER
had never publish'd his Account;
nor would the whole Discovery
be so complete, without the least
Intricacy or Question, without
Mr. NORTH's Papers.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THIS is the complete History of
<hi>Ikon Basilike,</hi> as it is suppos'd to
be a Forgery; and we must next
proceed to examin the Exceptions
made to it, as they are collected
by Mr. WAGSTAF in his <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
King</hi> CHARLES <hi>the Martyr.</hi> To
begin with my Lord ANGLESEY's
<hi>Memorandum,</hi> 'tis urg'd, that it does
not particularly express by the
Date whether it meant the last
Session of Parliament before the
writing of it, or the last Session of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62348:52"/>
the Year 75. when it is plain
that he meant the last or Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Session; and that it was
therefore the immediat Session
preceding the writing of this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum.</hi>
To say that there is
no Witness to it is a very singular
sort of Objection, when his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Relations, and all that have
seen this and his other Writings,
own it to be his Hand. It is not
likely that there were any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the Royal Brother's tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him their Opinion of <hi>Icon Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:</hi>
Nor is there any thing more
common than for learned or great
Men to leave such <hi>Memorandums</hi>
in a Book concerning the Author
of it when it was a Question, or
about any other Secret relating to
it, which they thought they had
discover'd; and yet 'tis a thing
unheard till now, that they were
deny'd to be theirs whose Names
they bear, because the Day of the
Month was not mention'd, nor the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62348:52"/>
Names of any Witnesses added,
when the Hand was confest to be
the same with their other Writings.
Many instances of this kind appear
in the Books of Mr. HAMDEN late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sold, and whereof I have som
to shew, as in the Book intitul'd,
<hi>Apollonii Grallae,</hi> he writes, that
LANSBERGIUS was the Author of
it, of whom he there gives a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>IT is no just Exception to this
<hi>Memorandum,</hi> that my Lord AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLESEY
did not communicat the
Contents of it to any of his Friends
or Relations: for tho' the Two
Royal Brothers imparted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to him, it does by no means
follow, that they intended he should
publish it to the World. And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
they did not oblige him to
silence, yet 'tis probable that his
Lordship was not very fond of
being disturb'd by the Clamors of
som Churchmen, who carry'd
things so high at that time, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62348:53"/>
I do not believe they would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
such a Discovery to either of
the Brothers themselves. There
was never any poor Prince more
notoriously abus'd by many of those
he took for his best Friends than
CHARLES the First. They put him
on all those unhappy Measures
which prov'd his Ruin in the end.
And as they made use of his
Temper to serve their own Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
when he was alive, so they
did of his Name for the same
Reason after his Death. They were
not concern'd so much for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
as their own Interest; and
having contriv'd this Forgery to
carry their Cause, they thought
themselves afterwards oblig'd to
support it. Mr. WAGSTAF affirms
that there is no presumtion that
the Royal Brothers communicated
this Affair to any other Person besides
my Lord ANGELSEY, which is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Argument, and proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
'Tis possible enough that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62348:53"/>
my Lord ANGLESEY himself told of
this to others, tho' they may be
since dead, or are not willing to
tell it again. If the Royal Brothers
had spoke of it to no body else, it
follows not that a Secret was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
committed to one, because it
was not to more; as if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for a Man to call Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that he imparted a Secret to his
Friend. But we shall presently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
more than a Presumtion,
that both King CHARLES the Second
and the late King JAMES declar'd
thier Opinion to other People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
my Lord ANGLESEY, that <hi>Icon
Basilike</hi> was not their Father's
Book.</p>
            <p>By such nice Cavils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Memorandum</hi> we can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
judg of the Exceptions we
may expect to Dr. WALKER's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
That GAUDEN hop'd o
make a Fortune by this Book, as
well as to promote the Cause of
the Church, ought by no means
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62348:54"/>
to be counted strange; for who is
it, pray, that serves the King any
more than God, for nought?
Have not most of the Bishops and
other Clergymen of those times,
that either liv'd depriv'd here in
<hi>England,</hi> or that accompany'd
CHARLES the Second in his Exile,
pleaded their Loyalty, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
their Services at the Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as many others would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
do, if King JAMES should
ever return again? Were not great
Persons employ'd to solicit and
make an Interest for them? And,
in a Word, are not Divines ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to make the same Steps, and
take the same Measures that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sorts of Men do to get Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.
I should rather doubt
that Dr. GAUDEN was not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this Forgery, if he had not
expected a Reward for it from
CHARLES the Second; for 'tis
certain, that the Credit of <hi>Icon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silike</hi>
contributed more to his Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62348:54"/>
than any other single
Motive whatsoever. But 'tis well
known that this Prince was not the
kindest in the World to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Friends, who would too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
forget his own; and that it
was not the Interest of som People
to have this business unravell'd,
tho' their impolitic Conduct has
bin since the occasion of divulging
what every body suspected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>THE Immorality of this
Forgery is urg'd as an Argument
against it; and, if it could by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
means hold Water, is indeed
an Argument worth a Million.
Then it would clearly follow
that because it was a most immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
thing to ly for God, and to
forge Books, Epistles, or the
like, under the Names of CHRIST
and his Apostles, there were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never any such Pieces; and
that because it was an ill thing to
feign Miracles, or to destroy Mens
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62348:55"/>
Lives for the Advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
there never was therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Priestcraft, nor any of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Practices known in the
World. But if the contrary be as
clear as the Day, I believe Men
might be found that would make
as bold with the Name of King
CHARLES, as others have don with
that of King JESUS. Mr. WAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAF
knows, tho' Mr. BLACKHALL
does not, that TERTULLIAN<note n="*" place="bottom">De Baptismo, c. 17. etiam Hiero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ym. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogo Scriptor. Eccles.</note> tells
us of a certain Presbyter of <hi>Asia,</hi>
who when he was accus'd of having
forg'd a Book containing the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of PAUL and THECLA, confest
the Fact, and alledg'd that he did
it for the love of PAUL, and I
say, that Dr. GAUDEN wrote <hi>Icon
Basilike</hi> for the Church's sake, the
King's, and his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:62348:55"/>
AS for the plausible Accounts
given in that Book of the King's
Secret Intentions, his particular
Trobles, his Remorses of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and the like, it is very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to alledge 'em as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the Genuinness of it,
when the Book was written for that
very end. For the Design of the
Author was to give such a Color
to all the King's Actions, and to tell
such fine things of his gracious
Purposes, as would beget a better
Opinion of him in the Readers
Mind, and move his Indignation
against the Parliament, or Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Misfortunes. But that
Dr. GAUDEN has frequently made
the King's Thoughts to contradict
his Actions, is evident to any Man
that has both read <hi>Icon Basilike,</hi>
and the History of those times:
And this Subject is thro'ly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by JOHN MILTON in his <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clastes,</hi>
to which I refer those who
want Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62348:56"/>
BUT there is an Objection still
behind, and as strong, be sure, as
any of the rest, which is that Dr.
WALKER did not see Dr. GAUDEN
write this Book, nor tells us that
it was in his own Hand. But I
believe Mr. WAGSTAF is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Man living that questions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dr. WALKER meant Dr. GAUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EN's
own Writing, when he says,
that before the whole was finisht
Dr. GAUDEN was pleas'd to acquaint
him with his Design, and
shew him the Heads of diverse
Chapters, with som of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
written of them, and that
Mr. GIFFORD transcrib'd a Copy of
it. This is all that can be said of
any Author in the World: and if
Dr. WALKER had said more expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or rather superfluously, that it
was likewise D. GAUDEN's Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
we should then have bin
told, that it was a Transcript from
the King's Copy in the Hands of
Mr. SYMMONDS, of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62348:56"/>
WE proceed now to those
Pieces commonly call'd <hi>Mr.</hi>
NORTH's <hi>Papers,</hi> he being the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer.
Chancellor HYDE in his
Letter to Dr. GAUDEN, tells him, as
was said before, <q>That the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
he mention'd had indeed bin
imparted to him as a Secret,
which he was sorry he ever knew;
and that when it ceast to be a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
it would please none but
Mr. MILTON.</q> Was there no other
Secret in the World but this, says
Mr. WAGSTAF, that the divulging
of it would gratify Mr. MILTON?
Yes doubtless; but I believe not
one that would please none but
Mr. MILTON, as the Chancellor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it: For he having particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
question'd the Genuinness of
this Book, and offer'd a fair Proof
of the Spuriousness thereof from
intrinsic Evidence only, without any
further Light; would be extreamly
pleas'd to find his Reasonings and
Judgment confirm'd by undeniable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62348:57"/>
Matters of Fact. Nor does any
indifferent Person in the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this Passage otherwise that
weighs Dr. GAUDEN's Pretences with
Mr. MILTON's Concern, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that Mrs. GAUDEN put this and
the other Papers relating to <hi>Icon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silike</hi>
in one Bundle, together with
her own Narrative, for the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Son. Besides that all
those who ever saw other Writings
of the Chancellor own this to be
his Hand, and particularly his eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Son, the present Farl of CLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENDON,
as Mr. WAGSTAF himself
acknowledges.</p>
            <p>BUT he says, <q>That my Lord
CLARENDON, (from whom he had
it in a Letter) by leave of the
King and Queen preparing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Father in <hi>France</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Summer, 1674. his
Lordship went first to <hi>Farnham</hi> to
the late Bishop of <hi>Winton</hi> the 14th
of <hi>May,</hi> and among several
things he had in Charge from the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62348:57"/>
Bishop to his Father, he bad him
tell him, that the King had very
ill People about him, who turn'd
all things into Ridicule; that they
endeavor'd to bring him to
have a mean Opinion of the King
his Father, and to persuade him
that he was not the Author of
the Book which goes under his
Name. And (when after his
Lordship's Arrival in <hi>France,</hi> the
30th. of the same Month, he had
deliver'd his Father these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
among others) to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Book, his Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<hi>Good God! I thought the
Marquiss of</hi> Hartford <hi>had satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
the King in that Matter.</hi>
               </q>
From hence Mr. WAGSTAF would
infer, that my Lord Chancellor did
not believe any other besides
CHARLES the First to be the Author
of <hi>Icon Basilike,</hi> and that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
any should go about to induce
CHARLES the Second to question it.
But for my part I think it very plain
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62348:58"/>
on the contrary, that he believ'd
King CHARLES the First not to be
the Author of that Book, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
that King CHARLES the Second
should not understand so much
from the Marquiss of <hi>Hartford,</hi>
who, as Dr. WALKER, and Mrs.
GAUDEN inform us, was the Person
that carry'd the Manuscript to the
King in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and so
next to Dr. GAUDEN himself, was
best able to convince his Son of
the Truth. Moreover, how could
the Bishop of <hi>Winton</hi> imagin that
the ill People about CHARLES the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
could bring him to doubt
of his Father's being the Author of
<hi>Icon Basilike,</hi> if he really knew it
to be written by him? when upon
this Supposition he was rather ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of satisfying all those who
had any Scruples in this Affair.</p>
            <p>AS for Dr. GAUDEN'S great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and his saying in a Letter
to the Chancellor, <q>That what was
don like a King, should have a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62348:58"/>
Kinglike Retribution,</q> Mr. WAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAF
says that those are Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Expressions, and that by them
he might probably mean a Book
he wrote against the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and
a <hi>Protestation</hi> he publisht against the
King's Death, neither of which
could be term'd such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Services, when many others had
don the same, and more: much
less could it be said that either of
these Books was <hi>don like a King,</hi>
or <hi>deserv'd a Kinglike Retribution;</hi>
whereas Mr. WAGSTAF, and those
who are of his Opinion, maintain
that the the Stile and Matter of <hi>Icon
Basilike</hi> are so like a King's, that no
Subject could possibly write it: but
a Multtiude of others agree with
me, that the Stile is infinitely liker
that of a Doctor than a King.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, It is objected that
Dr. WALKER's and Mrs. GAUDEN's
Testimonies contradict one another.
But how? Dr. WALKER says, that Dr.
GAUDEN told him he did not know
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62348:59"/>
if CHARLES the First had seen the
Book: but Mrs. GAUDEN affirms,
that the Marquiss of <hi>Hartford</hi> told
her Husband the King had seen and
approv'd it, both which Assertions
are consistent enough together.
For Dr. GAUDEN might be ignorant
that the King had seen it, when Dr.
WALKER askt him that Question,
who perhaps never mention'd it to
him again in their Discourses about
this Matter, or might easily forget it,
as he says he did several other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
little foreseeing he should
ever be oblig'd to make this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery:
and besides we must up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Accounts allow his Wife to
know more Circumstances of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
Business, as of most others, than
his Friend. The next suppos'd
Contradiction is, that Dr. WALKER
says Dr. GAUDEN once told him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Restoration, that he did not
positively and certainly know if
King CHARLES the Second knew he
wrote <hi>Icon Basilike,</hi> tho' he believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62348:59"/>
he might, because the Duke of
<hi>York</hi> did, who own'd it to have
bin a seasonable and acceptable
Service. But Mrs. GAUDEN af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that her Husband acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the King with it himself, which
is very true. But pray let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
at what time. After his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with Dr. WALKER most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly:
For does she not in clear
and direct Terms say, that it was
in his last Sickness, which prov'd
Mortal to him; and that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it was, because he saw som
Persons who were privy to it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
nothing more than to have it
conceal'd, which he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it should be in consideration
of his numerous Family, to whom
it might somtime or other do sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Service?</p>
            <p>NOW that no Mistakes
may be occasion'd hereafter by
imperfect Fragments of Mrs. GAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN's
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62348:60"/>
Narrative, and that this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
may be set in the clearest
Light, I shall, before I proceed to
the Examination of the positive
Testimonies produc'd for the King,
insert the Narrative here at large,
as it was exactly copy'd from the

NARRATIVE.</head>
               <q>
                  <p>MY Husband understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Value and
Esteem the People had
of CROMWELL and of others
in the Army, occasion'd by the
high Opinion which they had of
their Parts, and Piety; he being
also well assur'd, that one of the
main Designs of those wicked Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
was to Eclipse his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
that then was, as much as
might be, and to give a false
Misrepresentation of him to the
World; he, that he might do his
Majesty right, did pen that Book
which goes by the Name of the
King's<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Book. The Title which
he gave it then was <hi>Suspiria
Regalia;</hi> and the Design was
to have it put forth as by som
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62348:61"/>
Person who had found the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in his Majesty's Chambers at
<hi>Holmeby,</hi> being by chance left or
scatter'd there. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he had prefix'd an Epistle,
which might be suppos'd to be
written by that Person, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found them by that Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
thought it not fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
them. His Design also in
the Book, was to give such a
Character of her Majesty to
the World, as her great Worth,
extream Merits, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Endowments deserv'd.
when my Husband had writ it,
he shew'd it to my Lord CAPEL,
who did very highly approve of
it; and though he thought it
would do very well to have it
printed, yet he said it was not fit
to do so without his Majesty's
Approbation; and to come to
speak to his Majesty in private
was then impossible, in regard
of the strict Guard which they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62348:61"/>
kept about him. Immediately
after this there was a Treaty with
his Majesty at the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi>
whereupon my Husband went to
my Lord Marquiss of <hi>Hartf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rd</hi>
that then was, and to him
deliver'd the Manuscript, and
he deliver'd it to the King at the
<hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and likewise told
him who the Author was. When
my Lord Marquiss return'd; my
Husband went to him, to whom
my Lord said, That his Majesty
having had some of those Essays
read to him by Bishop DUPPA, did
exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edingly approve of them,
and asked whether they could not
be put out in some other Name.
The Bishop reply'd, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was, that the World should
take them to be his Majesty's.
Whereupon his Majesty desir'd
time to consider of it; and this
(says my Lord) is all the Account
I can give of it: What is become
of the Manuscript I know not,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62348:62"/>
and what will become of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
God knows. Upon this my
Husband told my Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss,
That, in his Opinion, there
was no way so probable to
save his Majesty's Life, as by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to move the Hearts
and Affections of the People as
much as might be towards him;
and that he also thought that
that Book would be very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for that purpose. Then my
Lord bad my Husband to do
what he would, in regard the
Case was desperate. Then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
my Husband resolv'd
to print it with all speed that
might be, he having a Copy of
that which he sent to the King,
and that he printed was just the
same, only he then added, the
<hi>Essay</hi> upon their denying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
the Attendance of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
and the <hi>Meditation of Death,</hi>
after the Votes of the Non-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
and his Majesty's close
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62348:62"/>
Imprisonment at <hi>Carisbrook Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</hi>
Now the Instrument which
my Husband employ'd to get it
printed, was one Mr. SIMMONDS,
a Divine, and a great Sufferer
for his Majesty; and he got one
Mr. ROYSTON to print it; which
ROYSTON never knew any thing
but that it was of his Majesty's
own penning: my Husband did
then alter the Title of it, and
call'd it <hi>Icon Basilike.</hi> Now
when it was about half printed,
they, who were in power, found
the Press where it was printing,
and likewise a Letter of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
which he sent up to the
Press; whereupon they destroy'd
all that they then found printed,
but could not find out from
whence the Letter came, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it had no Name to it. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
attempted the printing
of it again, but could by no
means get it finish'd till som few
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62348:63"/>
Days after his Majesty was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
When it was com out,
they who were then in Power
were not only extremely displeas'd
at it, but also infinitely solicitous
to find out the Author of it,
thinking it very improbable that
his Majesty should write it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the great Disturbances
and Troubles which for many
Years he had suffer'd: or at least
impossible that he should have writ
it all; for after the Attendance of
his Chaplains was deny'd him and
he a close Prisoner, they well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that he could not write
any thing without their Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
They also took that very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
which my Husband had
sent his Majesty, and saw that it
was none of his Majesty's Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing.
Upon this they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Committee to examin
the Business; of which my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
having notice, he went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly
in the Night away from his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62348:63"/>
own House to Sir JOHN WENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTH'S,
who liv'd near <hi>Yarmouth,</hi>
and him he acquainted with the
Business, and the great Danger
he was then in: when Sir JOHN
did not only promise to conceal
him, but also to convey him out
of <hi>England,</hi> it being in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to give Passes to go beyond
Sea. About this time Mr. SYM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONDS
was taken in a Disguise;
but God in his Providence so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it, that he sickned immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly,
and dy'd before h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> came
to his Examination: nor could
the Committee find out any
thing by any means whatever;
which alter'd my Husband's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of going out of <hi>England.</hi>
Now, besides these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

I say, I can produce som Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which, I am sure, will put

of his Majesty King CHARLES the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62348:64"/>
Second; and upon his Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
knowing his Princely
Disposition, did not unjustly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a suitable Reward for his
Endeavors to serve his Majesty's
Father and himself in that Book.
And meeting with Dr. MORLEY,
he fell into Discourse how sensible
he was of the great Service which
he had don his present Majesty
and the Royal Family, in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and setting forth that excellent
Piece, call'd <hi>the King's Book;</hi> and
also assur'd him, that it had bin
very effectual not only at home,
but abroad, to move the Hearts
and Affections of People towards
his Majesty, instancing in several
Persons who were most exceedingly
affected with it; and so advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
he said it had bin to his
Majesty, that according to his
great Merit, he might have what
Preferment he desir'd. Dr. MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY
also told him, That he had
acquainted Sir EDWARD HYDE with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62348:64"/>
the Business, and that he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much commend and admire
it: but we have not (said he) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his Majesty with it, but
did assure him, that his Majesty
did set a high Value upon the
Book, and had commanded Dr.
EARL to translate into <hi>Latin;</hi>
som having taken the Pains to
put it into other Languages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
My Husband being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by this Discourse of Dr.
MORLEY'S, and shortly after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Dr. SHELDON (who he
knew was not ignorant that he was
the only Author of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Book) he told Dr. SHEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON,
that since he had bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that his Majesty, out of
his Princely Disposition, would
(without doubt) when once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, reward that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which he had endeavor'd to
do his Father and himself; he
thought it most convenient for
himself, and also that he might
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62348:65"/>
be serviceable to his Majesty in the
Diocess of <hi>London</hi> (a Place where
he was well known) if it would
please his Majesty to make him
Bishop of that See. Dr. SHELDON
was pleas'd, with a great deal of
Gravity to tell him that was a great
Leap at first. Whereupon my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
desisted, and was resolv'd to
leave his Preferment to God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Soon after this, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still ignorant of what he had
done, he was by the Mediation of
a Person perfectly ignorant of his
Merit as to this Matter, made Bishop
of <hi>Exeter;</hi> all the considerable Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
being otherwise dispos'd
of. Not long after this it pleas'd.
God to visit my Husband with
an Infirmity, which he had
great cause to fear would (as it
did) prove mortal to him. This
made him resolve to acquaint the
King with the whole Matter,
and the rather, because he saw
som Persons who were privy to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62348:65"/>
it, desir'd nothing more than to
have it conceal'd, and bury'd in
Oblivion: but my Husband was
not willing it should be so, in
regard he had at that time four
Sons living; and they (he
thought) if he should die, might
be capable of his Majesty's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Besides, the Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
was dead, and the Bishop
of <hi>Winchester</hi> (the Person who
was best able to attest it) was
very ill. These Considerations
made him go to his Majesty;
and having the Opportunity of
discoursing privatly with him,
he told him the whole Matter as
I have related it, and for the
Truth of it, appeal'd to Dr. DUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PA,
then Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
and formerly his Majesty's Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
The King then was pleas'd
to entertain som Discourse with
my Husband about it, and said
that he did often wonder how
his Father should have gotten
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62348:66"/>
Time and Privacy enough in his
Troubles to compose so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Piece, and written with so
much Learning.</p>
               </q>
               <p>BY the Extract that was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
of this Narrative it would
seem as if it were somwhat long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
but this is all that came to
my Hands, two Witnesses attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
that as far as it goes, it is
exactly conformable to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
What Accident hinder'd
the rest (if there be any) from
being copy'd, I cannot certainly
tell; tho', when ever I com by a
true Information, I shall (if Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
be) publish my Knowledg
of that Particular, in an Appendix
to this Book. The Substance of
what remains in the Abstract, is,
<q>That when King CHARLES the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
(as we saw but now) was
made acquainted with this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
he gave a Promise to Dr.
GAUDEN of the Bishoprick of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester;</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62348:66"/>
and that the Duke of
<hi>York</hi> had also assur'd him of his
Favor: That upon Dr. DUPPA'S
Death, tho' Dr. GAUDEN put the
King in mind of his Promise, he
was only made Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
Dr. MORLEY having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
the See of <hi>Winchester:</hi>
That her Husband dying soon
after, Mrs. GAUDEN petition'd the
King, shewing that she was left
a Widow, with four Sons and a
Daughter; that it cost her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
200l. to remove from <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to <hi>Worcester;</hi> and pray'd his
Majesty to bestow the half years
Rents upon her, which he deny'd,
and gave then to another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WE learn further from Dr.
WALKER, that immediatly upon
Dr. GAUDEN'S Nomination to the
Bishoprick of <hi>Worcester,</hi> he told him,
that waiting upon the King the
next Morning after the Bishop of
<hi>Winchester</hi>'s Death, he found a
remarkable Alteration in him, his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62348:67"/>
Majesty being pensive and out
of Humor; in which Temper he
still found him for two Mornings
after: But having learnt the third
Day that my Lord Chancellor had
by all his Interest press'd the King
to bestow <hi>Winchester</hi> on Dr. MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY,
he presum'd to tell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
how uneasie he perceiv'd
him to be between the Honor
of his Word that he shou'd suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
his Friend Dr. DUPPA, and
the Importunity of those who
sollicited for Dr. MORL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Y; and
that therfore he most willingly
releas'd his Majesty of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
Here, continues Dr. GAUDEN,
the King stopt me, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saf'd
to embrace me in his Arms,
with these Expressions; <hi>My Lord, I
thank you; and it may not be long
ere I have Opportunity to shew you
how kindly I take it. And in the
mean time you shall have</hi> Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
<hi>and, to make it to you as
good as I can, all the Dignities
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62348:67"/>
of that Church (I know not how it
comes to pass) being in my Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
I give you the diposing of them
all during your time, that you may
prefer your Friends, and have them
near about you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was an ordinary thing with
King CHARLES the Second thus to
forget his Promises, which made
him frequently uneasie, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE (whom
he had serv'd after this manner) to
fay of him in his incomparable
Memoirs, <q>That this Temper
made him apt to fall into the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions
of whoever had his
Kindness and Confidence for the
time, how different soever from
the Opinions he was of before:
and that he was very easie to
change Hands, when those he
imploy'd seem'd to have engag'd
him in any Difficulties; so as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lookt steddy in the Conduct
of his Affairs, nor aim'd at any
certain end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:62348:68"/>
THUS we have don with the
Narrative of Mrs. GAUDEN, who
was often heard to relate the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it to her Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and who, when Dr. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHOLSON,
then Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
did, on her receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
put the Question to her,
affirm'd, that her Husband wrote
that Book, which several now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in that City do very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>WE come at length to the last
Period of our Labor, and that is
to shew the Invalidity of the Facts
which are alledg'd to prove CHARLES
the First was the true Author of
<hi>Icon Basilike.</hi> And the first Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we shall hear is his own Son
and Successor, CHARLES II. who grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Letters Patents to Mr. ROY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STON
for printing all his Father's
Works, and particularly this Piece,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62348:68"/>
which, says Mr. WACSTAF, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
what he's believ'd to have
said to my Lord ANGLES<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Y. But
with his good leave the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
does not follow: for these
Letters were issu'd out in the Year
60, before Dr. GAUDEN gave the
King true Information; and it was
in 75, that he told his Opinion to
my Lord ANGLESEY long after he
was convinc'd that his Father had
not written the Book. But if King
CHARLES the Second had dissembled
his Knowledge of this Affair, it had
not bin at all a thing inconsistent
with this Character, but a Piece of
his Grandfather's boasted Kingcraft,
and which he practic'd on many less
pardonable Occasions. Have not
Princes in all Ages, as well as other
Men, bin allow'd to keep things
secret which it was not their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
should be known, and which
are commonly call'd by the Name
of State Mysteries? How many
Juggles are us'd by the Eastern Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62348:69"/>
to beget an extraordinary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Persons in the Minds
of their Subjects, who, by the force
of such fantastical Stories, carry
their Respect even to Adoration?
But what need I go out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for Examples? When our
own Kings have for so many Ages
pretended to cure the King's Evil,
by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erly touching the affected
Part; and this Power of Healing
is said to be communicated to
them by the Blessing of King ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD
<hi>the Confessor,</hi> one of the
weakest and most Priest ridden
Princes that ever wore a Crown.
All the Monkish Historians, and
particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly the Abbot of <hi>Rievalle,</hi>
who wrote his Life, have given us
a large Catalogue of his Miracles:
but I wonder why our Princes have
not also pretended to restore Sight
to the Blind; for this is also
affirm'd of King EDWARD'S
Wonder working Touch. 'Tis
strange, that a Protestant Bishop,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62348:69"/>
should compose a Form of Divine
Service to be read on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
when he might as warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
believe all the other Legends
of those dark and ignorant times.
If I did persuade my self that King
CHARLES the Second (who is said
to have cur'd very many) was a
Saint, it should be the greatest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
I could believe. But King
WILLIAM, who came to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us

                  </gap>lisht this Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Popery: For it is not, as his
Enemies suggest, because he thinks
his Title, which is the best in the
World, defective, that he abstains
from Touching; but because he
laughs at the Folly, and scorns to take
the Advantage of the Fraud. So
much for the Letters Patents of
CHARLES II. and we shall consider
those of the late King JAMES
in their due order.</p>
               <p>THE next Witness shall be
Major HUNTINGTON, who (as Sir
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62348:70"/>
WILLIAM DUGDALE relates in his<note n="*" place="margin">P. 380.</note>
                  <hi>short View of the Troubles of</hi> England)
did, thro' the Favor of General
FAIRFAX, restore to King CHARLES
the First, after he was brought to
<hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the Manuscript of
<hi>Icon Basilike</hi> written with the said
King's own Hand, and found in
his Cabinet at <hi>Naseby</hi> Fight. By
the way, they should have said, for
the Grace of the Story, <hi>part of
the Manuscript;</hi> for a good deal
of the Book was written after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
be the Author who you
please. And they should have told
us likewise how General FAIRFAX
durst send one part of his Papers
to the King, when he sent the rest
to the Parliament; or, since they
would make us believe he was so
kind to the King, why he did not
restore him all the Papers, when
'tis very evident, that those which
the Parliament order'd to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
were infinitely of greater
consequence, and made him a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62348:70"/>
world of Enemies, which oblig'd
the Author of <hi>Icon Basilike</hi> to
write a Chapter on this very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
whereas the Papers in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
would probably mollify som
of his Opposers. But now when
all is don, tho' General FAIRFAX
was afterwards against putting the
King to death, yet he was not at
that time dispos'd to grant him any
Favors, and acted with as hearty
Zeal against him as any in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which appears by all the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of those times, as well
as by his own and the Memoirs of
the Lord HOLLIS. As for Major
HUNTINGTON Dr. WALKER assures
us, <q>That he told him, when he
heard such a Book was publish'd
and confidently reported to be the
Kings, all he said was that he sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believ'd those were the Papers
he saw him so usually take out of
his Cabinet, and that he never
read one Line or Word of them.</q>
This and Sir WILLIAM DUGDAIE'S
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62348:71"/>
Testimony are diverse from that of
Mr. RICHARD DUKE, of <hi>Otterton</hi> in
<hi>Devon,</hi> who writes the following
Letter to Dr. GOODAL, famous for
his Zeal on the behalf of <hi>Icon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silike.</hi>
                  <q>Sir, I confess that I heard
Major HUNTINGTON to say more
than once, that whilst he guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
CHARLES the First at <hi>Holmby-House</hi>
(as I remember) he saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Chapters or Leaves of that
great King's Meditations lying on
the Table several Mornings, with
a Pen and Ink with which the
King scratch'd out or blotted som
Lines or Words of som of them.
Upon which I must also confess
that I concluded they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
from the King; but others
have drawn a contrary Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the King's correcting
the Papers. Yet I put this under
my Hand, that the Major told
me, that he did suppose them
originally from that learned
Prince, which is the <hi>Totum</hi> that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62348:71"/>
can be intimated from, Sir, your
humble Servant RICHARD DUKE.</q>
Then one Mr. CAVE BECK writes
to Dr. HOLLINGWORTH <q>That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
HUNTINGTON at <hi>Ipswich</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
him that so much of the
sa'd Book as contain'd his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
Mediations before <hi>Naseby</hi>-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight
was taken in the King's
Cabinet; and that Sir THOMAS
FAIRFAX deliver'd the said Papers
to him, and order'd him to
carry them to the King; and
also told him, that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
them to the King, his
Majesty appear'd very joyful, and
said he esteem'd 'em more than
all the Jewels he had lost in the
Cabinet.</q> This Major HUNTING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON
was a strange Man to vary so
often in his Story, and to tell so
much more or less to every body
that enq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r'd of him; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
'tis no great Wonder that these
Gentlemen should so widely differ
from one another, both as to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62348:72"/>
Time and Place, as well as to
Matters of Fact, when Sir WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM
DUGDALE has printed under
Major HUNTINGTON's Name quite
another Story from the written
Memorial out of which he had
it. In his <hi>short View</hi> he positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
says, as we read before, that the
Manuscript was written with the
King's own Hand: But in his
Warrant for this, it is only said,
as Mr. WAGSTAF himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that all the Chapters in it
were written by the Hand of Sir
EDWARD WALKER, but much corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with Interlineations of the
King's Hand, and that the Prayers
were all so.</p>
               <p>NOW, to shew further how
cautiously People should rely on
Sir WILLIAM DUGDALE, and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
like him, we shall produce
another remarkable Instance. In
the Book before-quoted, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
writes, That Mr. HERBERT
did often see the <hi>Icon Basilike</hi> while
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62348:72"/>
he waited on the King in the <hi>Isle
of Wight;</hi> wheras all that Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS
(for he was Knighted after
the Restoration) has said in the
Manuscript which Sir WILLIAM
perus'd, and wherof Mr. WAGSTAF
has printed an Abstract, is, <q>that he
had there the Charge of the King's
Books; and that those he most read,
after the Sacred Scriptures, were
Bishop ANDREWS's Sermons, HOOK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER's
Ecclesiastical Policy, VILLALPAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DUS
on EZEKIEL, SANDY's Paraphrase
on the <hi>Psalms,</hi> HERBERT's Poems,
the Translation of GODFREY of
<hi>Bulloign</hi> by Mr. FAIRFAX, of OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANDO
FURIOSO by Sir JOHN HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON,
and SPENCER's Fairy
Queen (to which he might have
added PEMBROKE's <hi>Arcadia.</hi>) And
at this time it was, as is presum'd,
(continues Sir THOMAS) that he
compos'd his Book, call'd <hi>Suspiria
Regalia,</hi> publish'd soon after his
Death, and entitul'd, <hi>The King's
Portraiture in his Solitudes and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:62348:73"/>
which Manuscript Mr.
HERBERT found among those
Books his Majesty was pleas'd to
give him, those excepted which he
bequeath'd to his Children here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
mention'd. In regard Mr.
HERBERT, tho' he did not see
the King write that Book, his
Majesty being always privat when
he writ; and those his Servants
never coming into the Bed Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when the King was privat,
til he call'd; yet comparing
it with his Hand-writing in other
things, he found it so very like as
induces his Belief that it was his
own, having seen much of the
King's Writings before.</q> Here
Sir THOMAS only presumes the King
might write the Book in the <hi>Isle of
Wight,</hi> and directly says he never
saw the King write it, nor the
Book it self till after his Death;
but Sir WILLIAM affirms from these
very Papers (for they are said to be
written at his Request by Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62348:73"/>
that he often saw it in the
<hi>Isle of Wight</hi> when he waited on the
King in his Bed-Chamber. 'Tis
to be observ'd, that the Title of
<hi>Suspiria Regalia</hi> is as agreeable to
Mrs. GAUDEN's Narrative, as the rest
of the Particulars are different from
Sir WILLIAM's Relation.</p>
               <p>BEFORE we examin the
Force of Sir THOMAS's Testimony,
we must first consider what is said
by Mr. LEVET, who attended the
King at the same Time and Place.
In short, he says, <q>That of his
own certain Knowledg he can
depose the Book was truly the
Kings, having observ'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
oftentimes writing his Royal
Resentments of the bold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Behavior of his Soldiers
when they had him in their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody:
That being nominated by
his Majesty to be one of his
Servants during the Treaty in the
<hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> he had the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to read the same oftentimes
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:62348:74"/>
in Manuscript under his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
own Hand, being pleas'd
to leave it in the Window
of his Bed-Chamber: And
that when the King was remov'd
to <hi>Hurst-Castle,</hi> he had the Charge
of this Book, and a Cabinet of
other Papers, which at the said
Castle he deliver'd again to his
Majesty;</q> where, by the way,
he does not inform us if the Book
was distinctly given him from the
Cabinet, or that he only conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it was in it. Here are several
very observable Circumstances:
As, First, that altho' Mr. HERBERT
who was of the King's Bed Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
never saw him write a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this Book, his (Majesty,
he says, being always in privat,
when he wrote, and his Servants
never coming into his Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
till he call'd;) yet Mr. LEVET,
a Page of the Back Stairs, often
saw him write, knew what he wrote,
and could read the Book when he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62348:74"/>
pleas'd. Then that the King, who
is said to value this Book more
than all his Jewels, should so careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave it in his Bed-chamber when
he was abroad, and where Mr.
HERBERT and others, nay the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soldiers might see it as well
as Mr. LEVET, is not very likely.
And lastly, that the King should
have so much leisure to mind this
Book during a Treaty with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or would lose any time in
writing of it, when the Business
in agitation concern'd no less than
his re-establishment or Abdication,
is not credible; besides, that there
is nothing particularly written
concerning the Insolence of the
Soldiers in all <hi>Icon Basilike.</hi> And
I have talk'd with Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and good Reputation now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
who had much more of his
Majesty's Company and Confidence
in the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi> than Mr. LEVET
either shar'd, or could reasonably
expect; but yet they neither
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62348:75"/>
dreamt of this Business then, nor
believ'd a jot of it afterwards, as
well knowing how the King spent
his time in that place. But
now supposing Mr. LEVET's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to be all true, yet it is
very from amounting to a Proof,
that King CHARLES the First was
was the real Author of <hi>Icon Basilike,</hi>
which is the Point in question; and
not whether he interlin'd or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
it, which he ought to have
don, if he had a mind it should
pass for his own: besides that Dr.
GAUDEN sent it to him for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
purpose, to be corrected, allow'd,
or laid aside, as his Majesty should
think fit. But tho' the King in all
reason might, and I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
did, correct or interline a
part, and perhaps transcribe the
whole Book; yet I can by
no means be persuaded that he
could find Leisure enough to
write so many Copies of it in his
Solitudes and Sufferings, in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62348:75"/>
midst of Treaties, in the Hurry
of Removals, while he meditated
his Escape, and was strictly observ'd
by his Guards. But these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
tell us of as many Copies, as
the Papists shew Heads of St. JOHN
BAPTIST, or Quarts of the Virgin
MARY's Milk. Mr. HERBERT had
one left him by the King for a
Legacy; CHARLES the Second (as
Dr. CANARIFS writes to Mr. WAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAF)
shew'd another to Mr. WOOD,
a Commishoner from the <hi>Scotish
Kirk</hi> at <hi>Breda;</hi> and who knows
which of these, or whether it was
either of them, that Mr. LEVET de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
to the King at <hi>Hurst-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle?</hi>
But why, in the Name of
God, is none of these ever since
produc'd? How came this Prince's
Autographs to be thus neglected,
when his Day is so strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd?
This is a Piece of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that's usually paid to less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Persons; and I believe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Universities, would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62348:76"/>
give Five Hundred Pounds
to have such a Copy plac'd in their
Library, tho' if they had the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,
it would make nothing
at all for their Purpose.</p>
               <p>NOW let us consider the
the Force of all those Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
join'd together, which is, that
one saw the King write he knew
not what, but believ'd it might be
this Book; another observ'd him
writing his Resentments against
the rude Behavior of the Soldiers,
and so was ready to depose of
his certain Knowledge, that <hi>Icon
Basilike</hi> was his own; a third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
the King might write it,
because he read a great many
Books; and they unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he was the genuin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
because the Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with his own Hand; all which
Testimonies, considering the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
prove no more nor less than
that the King could write and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62348:76"/>
read, which was never deny'd by
any that I know.</p>
               <p>IT is further urg'd by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
of this famous Book, that
Mr. ROYSTON had it to print as from
the King, in which all sides are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
and signifies nothing to the
Merits of the Cause; for, be sure,
the Bookseller was not made privy
to the Secret. And as for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous
Authors of two Books
which are alledg'd by Mr. WAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAF,
we shall hear and examin them
when they'll please to tell us their
Names, tho' all they have to say is
answer'd already. When Dr. HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINGWORTH
tells us who are his
sufficient Witnesses, we shall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
consider their Evidence; for
such Affirmations must go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in proving a Fact of this
Nature, and may well serve for
a Flourish, but not for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
no more than several more
Assertions of his concerning this
Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, which were exploded by
other Hands, and not defended by
Mr. WAGSTAF.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62348:77"/>
MR. LE PLA Minister of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chingfield</hi>
writes to Dr. GOODAL, that
one WILLIAM ALLEN, who collected
his Tythes for two Years, and was
formerly a Servant to Dr. GAUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EN,
affirm'd to him, <q>That the
Doctor told him he had borrow'd
the Book, and was oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
it by such a time; that
(besides what other time he might
imploy in it) he sat up one whole
Night to transcribe it; that he
sat up in the Chamber with him,
to wait upon him, to make his
Fires, and snuff his Candles:
and Mr. LE PLA thinks (for he's
not positive) it was from Mr.
SYMMONDS of <hi>Rayne</hi> that he said the
Doctor had borrow'd the Book.</q>
Dr. HOLLINGWORTH has formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
this Story of SYMMONDS's,
who indeed assisted afterwards in
printing the Book at <hi>London;</hi> but
was so far at this time from liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Rayne</hi> in the Neighborhood
of <hi>Bocking</hi> where Dr. GAUDEN
dwelt, that as Dr. WALKER shews,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62348:77"/>
Mr. SYMMONDS was long before
sequestred for his Loyalty, fled to
the King's Quarters, and one Mr.
ATKINS plac'd in his room by the
Parliament. Nor is it credible that
Dr. GAUDEN, whether he meant a
a Fraud or not, should give an
Account of his Studies, much less
discover the Secret of this Book
for no Reason in the World, to
never so trusty a Servant, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to one that was to look after
his Fire and snuff his Candles.</p>
               <p>NOW we com to the late
King JAMES's Letters Patents to
Mr. CHISWEL for Liberty to print
his Father<hi>'s</hi> Works; for they are
urg'd as an Argument that he
thought <hi>Icon Basilike</hi> genuin, tho'
this Book be not specially menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in these Letters, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and refer not to those of his
Brother in 60. But here I must
beg Leave to relate a Story that
will give som Light to this Matter.
In the Year 1677, the House of
Commons having voted two
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62348:78"/>
Months Tax for the more dccent
Interment of CHARLES I. and to
raise a Monument for him, Mr.
CHISWEL, being Mr. ROYSION's Son
in law, thought of a Project that
would answer the End of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and not be unserviceable to
his Father, with whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in Trade: and it was, that a
Part of that Sum might be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
towards bearing the Charge
of an Impression of the King's
Works, wherof every Parish in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
should be oblig'd to have a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and to chain it in the Church;
which, in his Opinion, would prove
a more glorious and lasting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than any could be fram'd of
Brass or Marble. This Thought was
very well lik'd by several great Men
of the Church and State, who shew'd
themselves ready to promote it;
and he did not, we may imagin,
spare any Cost or Labor to have
it succeed, tho' 'tis well known
how little CHARLES the Second
himself encourag'd it. But the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62348:78"/>
Distrusts arising afterwards between
the King and People, the Heats
in Parliament, and particularly the
Popish Plot, broke this, and all
such Designs to Pieces: So that
there was no farther Mention
of any Monument for his Father.
But when the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
mounted the Throne, and had
given Assurances of his Favor to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Mr.
CHISWEL thought again of rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>
how agreeable this would seem
to the King's Design (if it were
real) of bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing a Confidence
of himself in the Church. This
Request the King Icon, giving
for his Reason, that <hi>

                  </hi>
was not his Father's Book, and
he could not therefore in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
recommend it as his.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62348:79"/>
Mr. CHISWEL being inform'd of
this Resolution by Sir ROGER, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that he thought he could
accommodat the Matter: For
since the publishing of the rest
would signifie nothing without
the Addition of <hi>Icon Basilike,</hi> he
would remove it from the Front
where it stood in the former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and place it in the Rear
after <hi>Finis,</hi> as Books of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Authority use to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
To this the King consented, on
condition som Expressions which
he thought injurious to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
should be left out: with
which Mr. CHISWEL said he could
by no means comply, as being a
disingenuous Practice towards any
Author, and a great Abuse on the
Public; but propos'd, as another
Expedient, that those Words should
be put within Crotchets. And
thus <hi>Icon Basilike</hi> stands now prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after the End of the second
Part of the King's Works of the
Edition of 86, by Mr. CHIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEL,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62348:79"/>
who told me this Story
himself, not to gratifie or injure
any side, but as a Matter of Fact,
wherein he was personally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
and from whence he draws
no manner of Inference. The Royal
Brothers said the same to several
others besides my Lord ANGLESEY,
and particularly to som eminent
Persons now living, who told me
so much themselves, with a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mentioning their Names,
which, after all that has bin offer'd,
I see no Necessity of doing.</p>
               <p>THAT nothing may be wanting
I shall in the last place consider
what is objected to the Prayer
us'd by the King as his own in
the time of his Captivity; but is,
with very small Variation, the same
that is said by PAMELA to a Heathen
Deity in Sir PHILIP SYDNEY's <hi>Arcadia.</hi>
This Discovery, as we said before,
was first made by MILTON in his <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conoclastes.</hi>
But Dr. GILL affirms,
<q>That his Patient HENRY HILL the
Printer said it was put in by a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62348:80"/>
Contrivance of MILTON, who
catching his Friend Mr. Du
GARD printing an Edition of <hi>Icon Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,</hi>
got his Pardon by BRADSHAW's
Interest, on Condition he would
insert PAMELA's Prayer to bring
Discredit on the Book and the
Author of it.</q> I wonder at the
Easiness of Dr. GILL and Dr. BER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARD
to believe so gross a Fable,
when it does not appear that Du
GARD, who was Printer to the
Parliament, ever printed this Book,
and that the Prayer is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Edition publish'd by Mr.
ROYSTON, whose Evidence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to prove the Genuinness of
the Book. And if the King's
Friends thought it not his own,
what made them print it in the
first Impression of his Works in
Folio, by ROYSTON in 62, when
MILTON could not tamper with the
Press? Or why did they let it pass
in the last Impression in Folio by
Mr. CHISWEL in the Year 86, when
all the World knew that it was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62348:80"/>
long before expos'd in <hi>Iconocla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes?</hi>
After this I need not go
about to shew that Dr. GILL had
no Reason for the great Opinion
he entertain'd of HENRY HILL,
and how little he consulted his
own Reputation by asserting that
no Man was better vers'd in the
secret History of those times; that
he was intrusted with Intrigues
by the great ones of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
who, as all the World
knows, manag'd their Affairs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another rate. Nor will I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon his turning Papist in
King JAMES's time to becom his
Printer, as he was OLIVER's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or any other Circumstance
to lessen his Credit, since it
appears that what he averr'd is
inconsistent with Matter of Fact,
Mr. ROYSTON, and not Du GARD,
having publish'd the Celebrated
Prayer which I add in this Place
laid Parallel with the Original.</p>

                           <p>O Powerful and Eternal God,
to whom nothing is so great
that it may resist, or so small that
it is contemn'd, look upon my
Misery with thine Eye of Mercy, and
let thine infinite Power vouchsafe to
limit out som proportion of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
unto me, as to thee shall seem
most convenient. Let not Injury, O
Lord, triumph over me, and let my
Fault by thy Hand be corrected;
and make not my unjust Enemies

this be the aptest Chastisement for

Pride of my (not-enough humble)
Heart be thus to be broken, O Lord,
I yield unto thy Will, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
embrace what Sorrow thou wilt
have me suffer; only thus much
let me crave of thee (let my
Craving, O Lord be accepted of,
since it even proceeds from thee)
that by thy Goodness, which is thy
self, thou wilt suffer some Beam of
thy Majesty so to shine in my Mind,
that I, who in my greatest Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
acknowledg it my noblest
Title to be thy Creature, may still
depend considently on thee: Let Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
be the Exercise, but not the
Overthrow of my Virtue. O let not their
prevailing Power be to my Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and if it be thy Will that they
more and more vex me with Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet, O Lord, never let their
Wickedness have such a Hand,
but that I may still carry a pure
Mind and sledfast Resolution e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:62348:83"/>
to serve thee without Fear
or Presumtion, yet with that hum-Confidence
which may best please
thee; so that at the last I may com
to thy Eternal Kingdom, through
the Merits of thy Son, our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
Savior, JESUS CHRIST.
Amen.</p>

whom nothing is either so great

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>I HOPE by this time I have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
Mr. BLACKHALL, since I
have not only laid together the first
Testimonies concerning this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but also answer'd the Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were made to those Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
and disprov'd the fresh
Evidence which was produc'd no
the behalf of <hi>Icon Basilike.</hi> But if
he's offended at my Performance
he may thank himself; seeing
without his causeless Provocation I
had never written a Word more
on this Subject, as I shall not do
hereafter, unless for as justifiable a
Reason: For notwithstanding I
may not answer every Scribler, yet
I'll be misrepresented and abus'd by
no body worth my notice.</p>
               <p>INDEED Mr. BLACKHALL is not
the first who has occasion'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
by a Thirtieth of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
Segmon. Every body knows how
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62348:84"/>
much the Observation of that
Day was abus'd in the two
last Reigns by servil Flatterers,
who, not content to run shameful
Parallels between the Sufferings
of our Savior and the King
(wherein the latter was often made
to exceed) they taught the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the ridiculous Doctrin of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Obedience,</hi> as they allow'd the
Prince an Unlimited and Despotic
Power. This render'd those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
justly odious to the Nation,
and made sober Men frequently
wish that such an Opportunity of
doing Mischief might be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from those who fail'd not
to improve it to the utmost. It
was likewise observ'd how much
these Sermons contributed to raise
Animosities and Feuds in the
Kingdom, and to continue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Distinctions of Names and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which every good Man should
desire might be abolish'd, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
in eternal Oblivion. Besides
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62348:85"/>
that for many weighty Reasons
such Days ought not to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
or otherwise in a little time
ours will be as full as the <hi>Roman
Calendar:</hi> wherfore I readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of the learned Bishop of
<hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Opinion, That our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
should wear out the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of such tragical Accidents,
which no body pretends to justify;
and indeed I think it very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(if our Legislators be of the
same Opinion) that the Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of his present Majesty's
Landing to deliver us from Slavery
on the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> should
hereafter take place of the Thirtieth
of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> Other Holydays have
bin recommended to a constant
Observation, tho' they are since
grown into disuse, or are legally
abolish'd, which the best Friends of
the Clergy desire may be the Fate
of that Day out of their respect
to the Church: For these Sermons
do constantly put the People in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62348:85"/>
mind of that Set of Men who
preach'd 'em out of their Liberties
in former times; and the honest
Clergy themselves are still under an
unhappy Necessity of saying many
things, that (let 'em think what they
will) are not extremely pleasing to
the Body of the Nation. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants
of those concern'd in that
Act, and many of 'em far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
it, conceive themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
us'd in most of those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
nor are the Posterity of
the greatest Royalists in a better
Condition, if that be a National
Guilt that's never to be expiated, tho'
neither they nor their Ancestors
consented to it; to say nothing of
the frequent Intermarriages and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tyes between both the Parties.</p>
               <p>IF the Extravagancies of those
Sermons had terminated with the
late Reign, few People, perhaps,
would trouble themselves now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
what's past, unless constrain'd
to it by som officious Chaplain: But
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62348:86"/>
they cannot endure to hear the
Members of the Parliament of 40
so infamously branded, considering
how lately they were oblig'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to assert their Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
against the Martyrs Son,
who violated and broke them at his
Pleasure: And in this Sense ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were of Opinion that King
CHARLES's Blood lay heavy on the
Nation, which made them for the
ease of the same to shake off the
Burden of King JAMES.</p>
               <p>SOM, who otherwise Honor the
Memory of King CHARLES the First,
are angry to hear him, in Mr. BLACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HALL's
Language, call'd <hi>the best of
Kings, and the best of Men;</hi> when
they consider especially, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were Men, and that several
Persons among the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Heathens,</hi> did infinitly excel
him in all Moral and Heroic Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
As for Princes, if good
Manners could not make Mr. BLACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HALL
except the present King, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62348:86"/>
at least might well oblige him
to do it. King WILLIAM has never
dispens'd with express Laws in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of Popish Recusants. He never
protected any of his Chaplains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament for preaching
up Arbitrary Power. He never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
Soldiers to be try'd by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Law in time of Peace; nor
levy'd Loans or Ship mony contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Law, much less imprison'd,
fin'd or banish'd such as refus'd to
pay those illegal Taxes. He does not
countenance any SIBTHORPS, MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARINGS,
or MOUNTAGUES to teach
his Subjects Non-Resistance, or to
compliment himself with Arbitrary
Power. He is so far from sending
for Foren Troops to enslave
the Nation, that he readily sent
those away which he kept here by
Law, as soon as he understood
the Kingdom had no further need
of their Service. He does not
use to imprison Members of the
House of Commons for using
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62348:87"/>
that Freedom of Debate which is
Essential to their Constitution.
He never threaten'd to betake
himself to other Councils than his
Parliament (as CHARLES the First
did) saying that <hi>Parliaments were
in his Power,</hi> and that <hi>he might
grow out of Love with them.</hi>
Nor is it known that he went
into the House of Commons to
demand any of their Members;
no more than he has seiz'd the
Customs without any Act to impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
him. He never promis'd (as
King CHARLES did in a Letter to
his Queen) that he would take
away all the Penal Laws against
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks as soon as he
should be able, nor any thing
else of this nature: For these are
only a few Instances, not to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
that Prince, but to shew how
little som sort of People seem to
value his present Majesty for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
restoring the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for so willingly passing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62348:87"/>
many excellent Laws for enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or securing the Liberty of
his Subjects; as well as for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
paying such a Deference to
Parliaments, which he not only
assembles willingly, but likewise,
according to ancient Custom, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.
In short, if King CHARLES
the First was the best of Kings,
the late King JAMES is not half so
bad as I think him: Nor is there
any Doubt, if a second Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which God and all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
forbid) should ever happen,
but that the Abdication-Day
would be appointed as a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Fast. What Mr. BLACKHALL
thinks of dispensing with the Laws
and acting without, or contrary
to them, we may guess, when he
says, <hi>That King</hi> CHARLES's <hi>greatest
Enemies could not charge him with
any Vice or Immorality;</hi> as if only
Whoring, Drinking, or Swearing
were immoral Practices.</p>
               <p>SINCE this King (who truly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62348:88"/>
was not the worst) must needs be
counted the best of Men, I do
not much wonder that Mr. LONG
of <hi>Exeter</hi> was for having som
Portions of his pretended Book
read in the Church for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enlightning of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
Nor that Dr. PERINCHIFF
should tell us in his Life how som
purchas'd Chips of the Block on
which he was beheaded, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of the Sands discolor'd with
his Blood, as also som of his Hair,
<hi>Hoping,</hi> continues he, <hi>they would
be a means of Cure for that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
which our</hi> English <hi>Kings,
through the Indulgence of kind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by their Touch did usually
heal: And it was reported that these
Reliques, experienc'd, fail'd not of
the Effect.</hi> Now who can laugh
at the Popish Legends, and be
serious when he reads this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage?
Wheras, if there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver
any Power in <hi>England</hi> of curing
the King's Evil, it was plainly
lodg'd in the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:62348:88"/>
BEFORE I conclude, I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that tho his pretended Friends
were so ready to father such Books
on CHARLES the First wherein he
had no Hand, yet they industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
left out of his Works a Letter
to Pope GREGORY XV, whereof I
can prove him as evidently to be
the Author as CICERO or VIRGIL
may be entitul'd to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi>
and the <hi>Aeneids.</hi> There is
an interpolated Copy of it in the
first Volum of RUSHWORTH's Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections:
It is rightly inserted in
the <hi>Quarto</hi> Edition of a Book
call'd <hi>Cabala,</hi> or Mysteries of
State: It is also in the <hi>Italian Mercury</hi>
of VITTORIO SIRI: in Du CHESNE's
<hi>French</hi> History of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland:</hi> and in several
<hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Authors. Pope
URBAN VIII mentions it in the
Letter which he likewise sent this
Prince, with another to his Father
King JAMES; both which may be
read in RUSHWORTH's Collections.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62348:89"/>
Now was not the omitting of this
Letter a notorious Fraud, since
that it alone, with those Letters
which the Parliament publish'd
to disgrace him, and a few
Pieces besides, make up all his
genuin Writings; For as to those
Messages, Propositions, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Treaties, and other public
Papers, which fill that bulky Folio
they call his Works, whoever takes
them to be his, is likewise capable
of believing he was the true Author
of <hi>Icon Basilike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is all I had to write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this famous Book, not to
reflect on the Memory of CHARLES
the First, but in my own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
being a Liberty not deny'd
me by Equity or Law, and which,
if I neglected to improve, I should
be more unjust to my self than my
Adversaries, whose Malice I shall
readily forget, and heartily pray
God to forgive.</p>
