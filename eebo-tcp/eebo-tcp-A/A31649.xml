            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the whole writing, both Articles and hands, might bee all forged, as indeed they were; ſo that mee thinks, the Dr. hath very much over-ſhot himſelf in point of diſcretion, for hee looks upon the Articles the more, becauſe ſubſcribed with ſuch and ſo many names, and yet hee acknowledgeth all the names to bee written with one hand, which would have made any ſober man the more to have ſuſpected it.</hi>

may ſee what hee is to apply his proofs unto; I will here briefly relate, according to truth, how far I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in this buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Buſhnel.</hi> At the firſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Articles by <hi>Trevers,</hi> I was diſquieted, and much unſatisfied, and expreſſed my apprehenſion therein, as before appeareth: Afterwards, when <hi>William Pinchin,</hi> and <hi>Obadiah Cheltnam</hi> (altogether without any thought or knowledge of mine) tendred Articles againſt Mr. <hi>Buſhnel,</hi>
which were read to him, I did then (if hee call himſelf to remembrance) go from the table to Mr. <hi>Buſhnel,</hi> as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97947:7"/>
owning his acquaintance, and hee and I exchanged ſome friendly words, hee expreſſing a great defiance of the Articles, and ſenſe of the vileneſs of them (if they could bee proved) and then and there it was that I ſaid to him, (hee calling for witneſſes to prove the Articles) <hi>That the ſeveral parties ſhould bee brought face to face,</hi> as hee truly reports, pag. 4. At that time I looked on Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> as a friend, from whom I ſhould have expected, and who might have expected from mee, any common friendly courteſie, there having never been any unfriendly paſſage between Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> and my ſelf all our daies. After this <hi>William Pinchin,</hi> and <hi>Obadiah Cheltnam</hi> came to mee, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both known to mee, to ſpeak with mee about Mr. <hi>Buſhnels</hi> buſineſs; They well know with what earneſtneſs I preſſed them both, to take heed what they did, and to look carefully to it, upon what grounds, and to what end they moved therein, telling them, that if from private diſcontents, malice, covetouſneſs, or any ſuch wretched grounds they did proſecute this Charge againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Buſhnel,</hi> the Lord would ſurely require it of them; Whereupon they did with extraordinary earneſtneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to mee, that they had no enmity againſt Mr. <hi>Buſhnel,</hi>
nor deſire or thought of making advantage by his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but that they did minde the good of their own (and others) ſouls in what they were doing, ſaying, that hee preached in ſuch a Scholar-like way, that his Pariſhioners were little profited by him, and that the ſcandalous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages charged in the Articles would bee fully proved againſt him; Upon this (being prevailed upon by their often and earneſt proteſtations.) I left them to do what they thought fit, onely I did take knowledge of them when they appeared before the Commiſſioners, as perſons known to mee, but never opened my mouth in their commendation, nor to further them, or any witneſs which they brought to prove the Articles againſt Mr. <hi>Buſhnel:</hi>
The Articles of ſcandal (as Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> often and truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth)
I had nothing to do with, being no Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Neither did I take upon mee to ſtickle about them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97947:7"/>
one way or other; And as for Mr. <hi>Buſhnels</hi> laſt appearance at <hi>Lavington,</hi> when the Order was drawn up againſt him for his ejectment, as hee tells us, pag. 223. I was not then preſent, nor know I what was paſſed againſt him.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Sarum,</hi> when the order of Ejection was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Mr. <hi>Buſhnel,</hi> how very unwilling I was to have had any thing to do in the examination of him, they who were preſent know, and with what fair reſpect I managed that part of his examination which fell to my ſhare, Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> may, and if hee do not, others do very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. Thus having made a true Relation how far I was concerned in Mr. <hi>Buſhnels</hi> buſineſs; That which reſts upon him to prove in the former Charge, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That I did know that <hi>Pinchin</hi> and <hi>Powel</hi> (the <hi>two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes)
did act from baſe principles, and to baſe ends,</hi> which I utterly deny.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That I afforded unto them furtherance in what they did, whereas <hi>Powel</hi> I knew not, nor ſpake I any thing (that I know) to the furtherance of <hi>Pinchins</hi> teſtimony, but left it according to my place, to the Commiſſioners to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>But now having related how able and ready hee was to prove horrid and barbarous crimes acted by <hi>Pinchin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Father,<note place="margin">Pag. 71.</note> and other his neareſt Relations (to take off the force of his teſtimony) <hi>None, ſaith Mr.</hi> Buſhnel, <hi>was more forward to withſtand and oppoſe this, than Dr.</hi> Chambers, <hi>who knew much of it to bee true, but was not willing ('tis like)

ſpeak thoſe words, wherein the main weight of this Charge lieth, <hi>viz.</hi> That there had been ſome <hi>ſmall differences</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>William Pinchin</hi> and his Father: for though I never knew ſo much of the difference between them, as Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> hath here expreſſed, yet by what I had heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>William Pinchins</hi> wicked and horrid carriage towards his Father, I did in my heart greatly loathe it, and could never mince it under the name of <hi>ſmall differences,</hi> poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I might (though I do not now remember it) upon <hi>William Pinchins</hi> earneſt proteſtation which hee made to mee, of his deſire of becoming a new man, ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that buſineſs as a matter that was then paſt, but that I did colour it over with the name of <hi>ſmall differences,</hi>
or words <hi>to any ſuch purpoſe,</hi> I aſſuredly beleeve is not true, nor will ever bee proved, and ſhall gladly imbrace Mr. <hi>Buſhnels</hi> counſel laid down, pag. 73. In theſe words, I could adviſe Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> to admoniſh <hi>William Pinchin,</hi>
that hee would ſadly conſider of it in this his day.</p>

That I was <hi>bound in conſcience</hi> to beleeve what ſhee teſtified: And therefore it is not onely improbable, but utterly impoſſible that my words ſhould bee a foregoing <hi>cauſe,</hi> and <hi>invitation</hi> to her Oath.

of ſuch who delight in aſperſing pamphlets, and are too ready to beleeve the ſame, wee thought fit to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the vindication of our ſelves from the odious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> endeavours to faſten on us.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place wee ſhall only take notice of one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in his Epiſtle dedicatory, where, in a Vaunting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hee uſhers in his Narrative with plenty of reviling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage againſt the Commiſſioners, thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſhall finde mee charging them with ſuch Crimes which are not onely odious in men as Chriſtians, but with ſuch which were looked upon as vild and odious by the moſt civil ſort of Heathens, and yet I have not charged them with a ſyllable which I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by proofs to make good upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Tis very obvious that Mr. <hi>Buſhnels</hi> deſign herein is to prepoſſeſs thoſe honourable Perſons to whom hee dedicates his book, with prejudice againſt us, and to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97947:19"/>
beget in them a beleef of what he ſaies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon hee hath to bee ſo confident, will appear when wee come to the tryal of his proofs, <hi>Parturiunt montes naſcetur ridiculus mus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Epiſtle to the Readers hee ſaith? <hi>VVent hey meet with the word Commisſioners, they are not to underſtand mee, as intending thereby all thoſe Gent. whoſe names were put into the Ordinance, as charging them with thoſe unworthy and unjuſt proceedings, many whereof (as to my buſineſs) never acted:
But the Commisſioners which I here ſpeak of, are thoſe that made ejecting of Miniſters a kind of Trade, and unqueſtionably to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves it was a beneficial one, ſuch who were conſtant, and frequent, and furious in the buſineſs, and were theſe, Mr.</hi> Bliſſet, <hi>Mr.</hi> Thomas Baily, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Hunt <hi>of</hi> Marlborough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is to bee noted again, how Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> doth anticipate the Reader, having not ſo much modeſty or patience as to give him Liberty to judge upon the whole matter as hee finds it, but hee will bee (as our Accuſer, ſo) our judge in paſſing ſentence: The charge which hee brings againſt us is complicated, or made up of theſe two parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That wee made the ejecting of Miniſters a <hi>Trade,</hi>
and queſtionleſs a beneficial one.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That wee were conſtant, frequent, and furious in the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe wee have five ſeveral things to ſay by way of anſwer for our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Tis ſufficiently known that wee of <hi>Marlborough</hi> have ever had an indignation againſt that generation of men that have vilified the Miniſters, as if they made a Trade of Preaching (though hapily ſome have been too guilty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
But the Vicar of <hi>Box</hi> is the firſt that hath made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the world of a new Trade of ejecting Miniſters; But how unlikely it is that this ſhould prove beneficial to us (whoſe Commiſſion was only to remove ſcandalous and inſufficient Perſons from their livings, but had no power to ſettle any into either Parſonage or Vicaridge) we leave to the indifferent Reader to judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> may conceit what hee pleaſeth to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97947:20"/>
wee cannot hinder that, nevertheleſs wee challenge him or any other whatſoever to make proof of the leaſt Emolument which ever did redound to us, and this from the hand of any perſon that either was brought before the Commisſioners on a charge exhibited, and not ejected, or upon a charge proved, was ejected, or any one perſon that was preſented and approved by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of approbation in <hi>London,</hi> to the living of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as by us was removed; yea (as well knowing our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency)
wee do conjure Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which hee makes in his Epiſtle, that hee would not charge us with a <hi>ſyllable</hi> which hee was not able by proof to make good, and let the impartial reader judge whether Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> who would bee taken for a faithfull Miniſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 Wee were ſo far from making this work of ejection, a <hi>beneficial Trade</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> terms it) that in carrying on the ſame, wee all along, from firſt to laſt, acted upon our own private charge to the expence of above twenty pound apeece, to ſeveral of us, which monyes wee can prove (if occaſion require) was ſpent in our ſeveral jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſittings, the which was never reimburſed by any perſons, nor yet out of the monies raiſed for incident charges.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Wee appeal to the great God, the ſearcher of all hearts, to whom all our actions and waies are fully known, that wee are cleer and guiltleſs of the charge which Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> hath laid upon us, as to the value of one penny in Plate or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or in any other kinde whatſoever: yea further for our vindication,</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97947:20"/>
5 Wee do freely offer (if ever required thereunto) to take our oaths before any Judge of Asſiſe, or Juſtice of the peace; that wee have not either directly or indirectly taken any ſuch <hi>Bribe, Gift, or reward,</hi> or ever knew that in the work ejection wee lay under ſuch a temptation from any perſon whatſoever, and therefore wee do again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> to produce any perſon within our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any other part of the Kingdome, that can teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Giving,</hi> or our <hi>receiving</hi> any ſuch <hi>Bribe or Gift,</hi> to us, or by us, in relation to this ejection work, and wee are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (as who is not) that at this day men will not bee ſhy or backward to make out any ſuch thing (if they could do it)
as Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> in his Narrative doth accuſe us of.</p>

and <hi>Commons:</hi> Moreover, ſeveral of the Commiſſioners dwelt neer <hi>Marlborough,</hi> who did as frequently attend the meetings (for ſome of them) as wee our ſelves; and here wee would have Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> know that as wee can with boldneſs appeal unto God as to our ends and aimes, in our diligent attendance upon that imployment, that they were worthy and becoming the truſt repoſed in us, ſo to this very day (notwithſtanding all his aſperſions) wee do not in the leaſt repent of being inſtrumental in the removal of any ſcandalous perſon, nor are wee conſcious to our ſelves of being <hi>furiouſly tranſported</hi> at any time in the management of that work, againſt Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> or any other, but <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly</hi>

            <p>In the ſame Epiſtle to the Reader hee ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners <hi>did often violate that</hi> Ordinance <hi>by which they ſate, and according to which they were to act, and that in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. As in admitting and countenancing</hi> ſuch <hi>to ſwear (if they appeared againſt mee) which their</hi> Ordinance <hi>excepted againſt, in excluding ſuch witneſſes, if appearing for mee (yea after they had been ſworn) which by their</hi> Ordinance <hi>they were to admit of; and at laſt making a</hi> peremptory Order, <hi>that</hi> ſuch as would, <hi>might appear againſt mee, but no more in my behalf; and I charge them for diſcountenancing, interrupting, and thwarting with many witneſſes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a long Chain of Calumnies that hath not one link of truth in it, and doubtleſs hee did on purpoſe ſet his invention on work, how to aſperſe us, and wee muſt needs acknowledge his ſigular dexterity herein; But let Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> prove that wee did ever knowingly admit or countenance any perſon (by our Ordinance excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt)
to ſwear, or refuſe witneſſes produced by him, then wee are contented to undergo his cenſure; if hee means, that, of our admitting <hi>Pinchin</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> to ſwear, hee cannot but remember they had given in their Depoſitions againſt him before the Crimes hee charges them with were proved unto us, and as to the making that <hi>Peremptory</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what rational man will beleeve it? it's as falſe a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, as thoſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> our diſcountenancing, interrupting and thwarting his witneſſes.</p>
            <p>It follows in the Epiſtle, <hi>And I charge them all,</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, Miniſters, <hi>and</hi> Clerk, <hi>for</hi> countenancing <hi>and</hi> incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging infamous perſons, <hi>ſuch who had</hi> forſworn <hi>themſelves, and</hi> touching ſome of themſelves, <hi>in their hearing, ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared out of</hi> malice, <hi>by their own confeſſion, and were proved guilty of ſuborning, and of being ſuborned, to their faces; yea, and ſuch as we ſhould have proved guilty of forgery likewiſe, had not theſe Commiſſioners and Miniſters by a notorious peace of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice prevented it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> doth exactly obſerve the Rule

to <hi>Machiavel,</hi> hee hopes that by <hi>calumniating luſtily,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will <hi>ſtick:</hi> To this horrid and unjuſt Charge the Dr. hath ſufficiently (ſo far as it concerns himſelf eſpecially)
replied, and ſhewed the <hi>impertinency</hi> and <hi>invalidity</hi> of the ſeveral proofs, whereby Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> hath indeavoured to faſten this accuſation on him, and 'twill bee evident to any one who hath the patience to peruſe his Book, that hee makes no conſcience of what hee ſaies, for throughout his whole Narrative there is not one <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Proof ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
to ground this charge upon the Commiſſioners. We do therefore once more deſire Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> to be ſo ingenuous, as to inſtance and declare which of the Commiſſioners did ever countenance ſuch kind of perſons as here mentions, and to ſhew wherein the Commiſſioners were ſo unjuſt as to prevent the diſcovery of any who were guilty (as hee ſaies) of Forgery: Wee do acknowledge that (amongſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſubſtantial witneſſes produced againſt him) there were ſome few whoſe teſtimonies (after ſome crimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt them) were not ſo authentick as others, and doubtleſs Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> means theſe: to conclude this, if the Articles offered by <hi>Trevers</hi> bee that which hee intends for forgery, it is well known, and Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> cannot but remember, that they were diſowned and rejected, and hee not proſecuted thereupon, but upon others; and if this bee not it which hee ſtrikes at, wee cannot gueſs at what hee means.</p>
            <p>Page 212. <hi>But ſince I have heard that ſome body hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht one of the</hi> Marlborough <hi>Commisſioners with a horſe, yea, and that ſome body hath preſented him with a parcel of hay ſince that, ſo that it may bee that the horſe or the hay made the ſpeech and not the maſter.</hi>

to diſcover the perſons (if hee can) according to what hee declares in his Epiſtle dedicatory, who ſaith that hee hath not charg'd us with a ſyllable which hee is not able by proof to make good upon us.</p>

In pag. 249. <hi>Mr.</hi> Buſhnel <hi>ſaies (as Mr.</hi> Stern <hi>reported it)
that the Commisſioners demanded fifteen pound of him for their incident charges in thruſting mee out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How true this is that Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> reported it, wee know not, nor do wee beleeve Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> will juſtifie it, nay, we are ſure, hee cannot, for Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> well knows that there was never more than ten pound demanded from him for incident charges for the Vicaridge of <hi>Box,</hi> but upon what ground Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> doth impute this demand to bee meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thruſting <hi>him out,</hi> wee cannot imagine: Reader, ſee the <hi>Ordinance</hi> by which wee acted, and thou wilt perceive for <hi>what incident charges</hi> (at which Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> ſo often ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils)
was demanded.</p>
            <p>In pag. <hi>252. I have not yet done with this fifteen pound charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es incident (and when I have done with that I have done with all)
for let mee now obſerve unto thee, what a beneficial Trade theſe</hi> Marlborough <hi>men made of it, Let the winde ſit which way it would: I think in this particular out-doing the Jews themſelves, for they would ſo far improve their opportunities, that fall out what could, they would turn it to their advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What cauſeleſs <hi>Outcry</hi> doth this man make? the relation it ſelf being falſe, as wee have ſhewed, and what was paid came from Mr. <hi>Stern,</hi> not Mr. <hi>Buſhnel;</hi> Hee tels us, having done with this, hee hath done with all, and if this bee all that hee can bring by way of charge againſt the <hi>Marlborough</hi> Commisſioners, let the Reader judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it amounts to any thing? No doubt Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it his deſign (as it appears) to render the Commisſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners odious, conſulted with the reſt of his brethren that had been in the ſame praedicament with him, to finde out what other ſums came to our hands. But hee could hear of none, therefore makes the ten pound incident charges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of Mr. <hi>Stern</hi> (to which himſelf invents and adds five more) as it were his Text, upon which hee raiſeth an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
what a beneficial Trade the <hi>Marlborough</hi> men made of it; this is as natural as ſome of thoſe Reaſons by which hee proved his doctrine at his examination before the Commisſioners and Miniſters.</p>

Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> having not yet ſufficiently diſgorged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wee finde him again at the fifteen pound, pag. <hi>255. And</hi> (ſaies hee) <hi>fifteen pound they demanded for thruſting mee out; 'tis good being a hang-man upon ſuch terms; and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs this was enough to make mee ſcandalous, becauſe I would not daub, and they were reſolved to get by mee, one way or other.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This as to the matter of Fact is before anſwered, wee ſhall not (with Mr. <hi>Buſhnel.)</hi> reiterate, as to what follows, 'tis very unſavoury and unbecoming the mouth of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and truly the Commiſſioners need not bee ſuſpected of injuſtice, in outing Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> for a ſcandalous perſon, when the very language which comes from his Pen for the vindication of himſelf, ſpeaks him <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and wee doubt not but the Reader will judge him ſo, if hee caſts his eye onely upon thee 154 page of his Book, where hee diſcovers the froth and filth of his ſpirit, in comparing the Commiſſioners to <hi>Hang-men, Sheep-ſtealers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> makes ſport for his Reader, in relating a ſtory which hee heard of a theeviſh Miller, to whom hee compares the Commiſſioners, his words are theſe; <hi>And now one would think that they had undone mee, as much as poſſible, and yet Mr.</hi> Sterne <hi>hath told mee, that hee is a greater loſer than myſelf, that I am four hundred pound the worſe, but that hee is five hundred pound the worſe: ſo that to mee hee ſeems to have met with ſome of ſuch a diſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof I have heard a Miller to bee, who ſtole five pecks out of a buſhel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſhews that Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> in the want of truth hath a minde to make himſelf merry with his own lyes, for hee was removed from <hi>Box</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> 1656. and this Vicaridge reputed worth but ninety pound, <hi>per annum,</hi> and hee entring to it again before harveſt 1660. So that hee was deprived of the profits of the ſame, not full four years, the which Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> took fully to his own uſe (excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tend pound <hi>incident charges)</hi> ſo that what Mr. <hi>Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>

            <p>Herein Mr. <hi>Buſhnell</hi> doth imitate thoſe who by often telling incredible ſtories come at length to believe them to be truthes; And were it true, yet it muſt be a lye in him, ſince here he affirms that to be true on his <hi>own knowledge,</hi>
which in ſeveral pages before he confeſſeth he took up onely on the bare <hi>Report</hi> of Mr. <hi>Sterne:</hi> But however Reader for thy ſatisfaction, I ſhall farther add, for the clearing my ſelf in this particular,</p>
            <p>That I never ſaw one penny of Mr. <hi>Sternes</hi> mony in all my life, nor did I (or any other to my uſe) ever receive one penny, much leſſe ſuch a ſum from him, or from any other by his appointment; nor was I ever under that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from him, nor did I know or was I made acquainted with what contracts Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> made with any perſon in order to his coming into <hi>Box:</hi> Though (I believe) Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> will acknowledge he received from me as many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities as he could in reaſon expect (being a ſtranger to me)
which he hath often acknowledged to many perſons, and fully expreſſed the ſame in a letter long ſince unto me. Therefore knowing my own innocency as to this charge, I do <hi>appeal</hi> to Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> to Juſtifie the truth of this my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, who is quoted by Mr. <hi>Buſhnell</hi> to be the Authour of this ſcandalous Report.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 254.</note> Again in page 254. Mr. <hi>Buſhnell</hi> adds, <hi>And if it be as Mr.</hi> Sterne <hi>hath reported it, Mr.</hi> Bliſſet <hi>hath not been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himſelf in this buſineſs; for he hath not onely made the Vicaridge of Box bring him in plentifull returns to his Treaſury for the preſent, but alſo he hath ſo providently provided it, that it ſhall yield him a crop after we are dead and gone, for as Mr.</hi> Sterne <hi>told me, he hath got the next Preſentation to the place, ſo that it is not to be wondred, that he ruined me firſt, and (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had received his largeſs from him) cared not how ſoon Mr.</hi> Sterne <hi>were gone from the place, in order whereunto, it was indeavoured that he ſhould be made weary of it, becauſe his turn was next, and ſo upon Mr.</hi> Sternes <hi>avoidance, he might make uſe and benefit of his preſentation.</hi>

iſſue, It conſiſts of two parts, The one (though expreſſed in other termes) I have already anſwered, <hi>viz. Box</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caridge bringing in plentifull returns to my Treaſury (<hi>I</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hee means the twenty pound) I ſhall ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no more to this. The ſecond is as falſe a ſuggeſtion as the firſt; Let this bee the iſſue between us: I appeal to that honourable perſon Sir <hi>Hugh Speak,</hi> Knight and Baronet, who is the undoubted Patron thereof; I ſay, I have nothing to do in the next Preſentation, nor had I in the laſt, more than in telling Sir <hi>Hugh Speak</hi> that I thought Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> to bee an able &amp; honeſt man, &amp; one that might deſerve his favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that theſe premiſes having no foundation, I doubt not but the impartial Reader will adjudge his Concluſion, pag. 255. as rotten. I abhor that ſaying of his, that I ruined him, hee may very well remember my inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him were otherwiſe<note n="*" place="margin">I appeal to <hi>Edw. Carter</hi> Eſq; his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</note>. I require Mr. <hi>Buſhnel</hi> to make good (if hee can) that I indeavoured to weary Mr. <hi>Sterne</hi> of <hi>Box,</hi> that I might make my advantage upon the next Preſentation<note n="*" place="margin">Enquire of Mr. <hi>Sterne.</hi>
               </note>. Theſe, Mr. <hi>Buſhnel,</hi> of all aſſertions in your Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the moſt diabolical: I challenge you, or any perſon whatſoever, to make good theſe, or any other paſſages of the like nature upon mee throughout all the Actions of my whole Life (having been in publick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment neer fourteen years laſt paſt.)</p>
            <p>Reader, wee thought fit to tell thee, that wee have had no greater allowance of time, than ſome forty eight hours, both for the reading of Mr. <hi>Buſhnels</hi> Book, and compoſing an Anſwer to thoſe Paſſages that ſeem to reflect upon us; for till within this two daies wee had no thoughts of entring upon this ungrateful work, neither did wee know of any Reply that the Doctor intended, which might give us an opportunity to annex ſomething thereunto for our vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and if wee miſtake not, wee do not finde any thing in his Narrative, ſave what the Dr. and our ſelves have fully anſwered to, that carries any matter of Reflection with it. As for his oblique charges, ſcurrilous expreſſions, and quibbles, and Mr. <hi>Bliſſets Circumſtance</hi> ſo often itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſported with, wee are reſolved not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

of them: But if in this undertaking of his hee had had ſo mnch modeſty and ingenuity as to have forborn his invective and ſatyrical language both againſt Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners and Miniſters, and had fairly ſet before the Reader the whole proceedings in the buſineſs of his Ejection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch monſtrous Comments and Inferences, and not put the ſtreſs of the Truth of what hee <hi>principally</hi> chargeth on us, upon <hi>[As I conjecture] [as I think] [as I beleeve] [as I was told by ſome body] [as it hath been reported] [and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability]

               <hi>Riſum teneatis amici?</hi> wee ſhould have thought the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Ejection (as to the Matters charged on him, and the proofs thereof made by <hi>ſuch</hi> witneſſes (as hee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them) and the defence made by himſelf, and his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for him) would have lain with the more clearneſs before the Reader, as to the Sentence of his Ejection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was juſt or unjuſt.</p>
