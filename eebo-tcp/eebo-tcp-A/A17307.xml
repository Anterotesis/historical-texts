         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea though I was told Your <hi>Majesty</hi> was lately offended with me. But I answered, No; J had no reason to belieue it. For first, J knew well the gentle disposition of your royall breast, guided by such a dextrous iudgment, is not easily incensed, where there is no iust cawse. And J am sure I daily inioy the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your favour, though not the gratious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your face; for even the feet doe liue, &amp; moue, though remote, by the Heads breathing. You are the breath of our Nostrills. And as J told my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> at my first examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about <hi>Israels Fast,</hi> All that I had done, was for Gods glory, the service of my King &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof wee were members; and for which I was ready (if need were) to lay downe my life.</p>
            <p>And now gratious Soveraine, J am bold to present Your Maiesty with such a peece, as no Prince in Christendome, but Your selfe, can iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge the dedication of it, if the meannesse of the Presenter doe not extenuate the worth of the Present.

               <hi>16:</hi> which, according to that ability vouchsafed me of Christ, the least and last of all his servants, J haue indeavoured to open. Jt pertaineth to Your Maiesty by a proper right. The full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this Prophecy is like to fall in Your gratious Raigne (which God prolong) to make it glorious to posterity. And surely when J com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the fulfilling of this Prophecy with those many Princely indowments, which Your God hath inriched Your Royall Person with, J am so much the more confirmed in this my perswasion. Such a zeale, such loue of the truth, such a peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and Princely wisdome, such a magnanimous spirit, were not planted in Your noble breast for nothing. So as I dare boldly conclude, as was said to <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Your Maiesty shal do great things, and prosper. Nor speake J by coniecture. This Prophecy will clearly evidence the same. Cleare it is, (though for the present it seeme cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) that the destruction of Antichrist, with his whole power and confederacy is now neere at hand. And for proofe and perswasion thereof, J wish it stood with Your Maiesties good pleasure and leisure to read over this Prophecy. It is but the expense of a few howers, but may exercise Your best meditations and noblest thoughts for

Of it Christ pronounceth, <hi>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that heare the words of this Prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein; for the time is at hand.</hi> How much more is this verified of this last and most famous Prophecy in this booke, towards the full consummation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of these our present and last times draw on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Your Royall Father, of blessed memory, even in his youth, wrote a most exquisite Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of this whole booke; from whose bright torch all along I haue beene bold to borrow light for my dimme candle.</p>
            <p>But me thinks I heare some suggest, O Sir, this booke is not licensed. But whose fault is that? The Authors? Or the Licensers? I could wish, that such suggesters would confesse the true cawse, why Orthodox bookes are so borne downe, as they may not be licensed. For <hi>Popish</hi> &amp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> bookes are licensed; but the contrary, such as are writen in confutation of them, &amp; are according to Gods word, &amp; the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> may not be allowed. So that I humbly submit it to your Maiesties vnpartiall


<pb facs="tcp:7467:4"/>
iudgement to determine, whether the Printer, for printing such a booke as this without license, or he that should license such Orthodox bookes, &amp; will not, according to authority in that behalf, be more worthy of censure. And certainly they that suppresse Orthodox bookes, would they not also stop Preachers mouthes, that they should not speake the truth? Yes certainly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> For, may it please your <hi>Majesty</hi> to vnderstand, how even your <hi>Majesties</hi> honour suffers in this case. For whereas vpon a Proclamation published in your Highnesse name, <hi>Iune 14.</hi> in the second of your Raigne, expressely forbidding any preaching, or printing of such Doctrines, as were repugnant to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, we all hoped, that all <hi>Arminian</hi> &amp; <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrines would be husht, &amp; silenced; wee by experience find it quite contrary: for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> shamelesly alledging that all their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> vnder this pretence they wold suppresse all truth, as forbidden by your Royall Proclamation. Which if it were true, it should not be lawfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to preach the Gospell, then to print books in defence of it. So that some are neither affraid, nor ashamed to say, in plaine termes, that they


<pb facs="tcp:7467:5"/>
must license no bookes against <hi>Arminius.</hi> Good God, what pittifull times doe we liue in, &amp; how different from former, as I was bold to tell my Lord of <hi>London</hi>? But I trust your <hi>Maiesty</hi> will vindicate your honour herein. Gods truth exprest in Scripture is no changeling. This is that, which wee call <hi>the Doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> and no other. This hath beene sealed by the blood of so many Martyrs, witnessed by so many Worthies of our Church, for almost this fourescore yeares without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, whose writings no time shall blot out, &amp; ratified by so many Acts of Parliament, as not all the Devills in hell, nor all the <hi>Arminians</hi> on earth, shall be able to disanull it. The Gospell shall flourish maugre all opposites, even vntill all the seven Vialls be poured out, which shall be in the vtter destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as is cleare by this Prophecy. In vaine doe they attempt to discountenance the truth, by branding &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming it as Puritanicall, rebellious, &amp; the like. This truth which we professe, makes your Royall Diademe both firme &amp; glorious. Herein we appeale to your owne clearest iudgement, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those who professe themselues <hi>Arminians,</hi> or those, whom they reprochfully call Puritans,

This plainly sheweth, that at the great restauration of the Church of Christ, begun at the first Vials powring out, the Church of Christ shalbe, as it were anew dedicated in a most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and magnificent state.

Thus we see who they bee, vpon whom the pouring out of this first <hi>Viall</hi> hath its proper operation &amp; effect; which is, there fell vpon them a noysome and grievous sore?

Whereas if you did but nourish the light of reason and of Gods word in your soules, you should never sinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dead lake, being sustained by the heavenly light. This is that light, which preserveth Gods elect fishes from the mortall and mortiferous Sea of <hi>Rome</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on though perforce they be cast, yet are they not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of it?</p>
               <p>But you will object, or some for you, Is there no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no spirituall life to be found in the Sea of <hi>Romes</hi> doctrines? No salvation within the verge and bosome of that Church?</p>
               <p>For answere, ye may beeliue the Scripture here. It plainly saith, that that Sea is become as the blood of a dead man; so that every living soule therein dieth. And what is more plaine, then that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conclusions and Canons of <hi>Trent,</hi> is this bloody corrupt sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Iesuites indeed are clamarous in your eares, No salvation out of the Church. And herewith they dazle your eyes, while you want iudgment to put a difference betweene the Church of Christ, and the now Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Out of the Church of Christ there is no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That is most true. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now no true Church of Christ. Why so? She denieth the faith of Christ: she denieth salvation and iustification by the faith of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Now that Church, which denieth the only meanes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ, is no true Church of Christ, but such, as wherein salvation is not to be expected.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denieth the only meanes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ, yea accurse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:7467:19"/>Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no true Church of Christ, but such as wherein no salvation is to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

               <p>But you obiect againe; As for vs, we doe not know, or are acquainted with the particular doctrines of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> we are not learned to define, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betweene Faith &amp; Faith, it suffiseth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, as the Church beleiveth: and if we erre through ignorance, we hope that will not altogether preiudice or hinder our salvation. And some of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and those no small ones, haue said, that they doe not deny salvation at least, to some ignorant silly soules, whose humble, peaceable obedience makes them safe among any part of men, that professe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> You belieue you wot not what, &amp; yet you hope, that will not hinder your salvation. But you belieue as the Church belieueth. You meane, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believeth. Well. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tells you in her Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that <hi>she belieueth no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, she admitteth of no other faith, then that which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and damned in Hell haue.</hi> If any dare deny this, he will but bewray his shamelesse ignorance in this point. But being ignorant, silly soules, whose humble peaceable condition makes them safe among any part of men, that professe the foundation <hi>Christ,</hi> are they not in the state of salvation? This indeed may seeme a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Doctrine to nuzzle silly Papists in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and blind religion, while they cary themselues like humble and peaceable men. But they professe the foundation <hi>Christ.</hi> What is it generally to professe <hi>Christ</hi> and particularly to haue no interest in him? What is it to professe the foundation, and not to be built vpon it? And who can be built vpon <hi>Christ,</hi> but he that hath a liuely faith in <hi>Christ</hi>? To belieue as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> belieueth, is only to haue a generall historicall faith, that Christ is the Redeemer of mankind, the Saviour of


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7467:20"/>
the world. Thus farre the very Devils belieue. But that Church forbiddeth any man to believe in particular, that Christ is his Redeemer, his Saviour; that hee is iustified from his sinnes by Christ alone, and that his sins are forgiven onely for his name sake. This no Devill can belieue, no Papists may belieue vpon paine of <hi>Anathema,</hi> and damnation. Therefore though they professe the foundation <hi>Christ,</hi> in the generall, yet wanting a speciall faith in Christ to apply his merits for the remission of their owne sinnes in particular, how are they safe in any part of men professing the foundation, <hi>Christ</hi>? May a man then bee saved, nay is he safe, to witt actually saved, living in any part of men professing the foundation, <hi>Christ</hi>? No matter then, what religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man be off, so in generall it professe the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Christ,</hi> and a man be humble and peaceable, though a silly ignorant. Thus all Hereticks are in the state of salvation, if humble and peaceable men; for they hold commonly and generally the foundation, <hi>Christ.</hi> But know, O all ye silly ignorant Papists, that living here, where the Gospell, the only meanes of saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of saving faith is preached, all your silly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, all your pretended humble peaceablenesse sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7467:22"/>
Peace is; wee must not make an Idoll of it. Wee must keepe Christs Peace. And in these perillous dayes, it being almost as dangerous to bee ignorant of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Iniquity,</hi> (sith it is the next way to be led into it) as of the <hi>Mystery of Godlinesse</hi>: (and hee that is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the former, may well suspect his knowledge in the latter:) let no man thinke it labour superfluous, or presumptuous, to search out the true Mystery of Popery. But (I say) in this place a kind of Necessity hath imposed this taske vpon me.</p>
               <p>Now the first maine Argument, which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (say they) <hi>A man in that Church may bee saved.</hi> For, <hi>Out of the Church no salvation</hi>: Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must bee a <hi>true Church.</hi> But who are they that may be saved in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>? My Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expresseth, <hi>An honest ignorant Papist</hi>; or, <hi>some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant silly soules, &amp;c.</hi> Yea and this is delivered in the name of our Church, or at least, of all those, that being affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in some good measure, would seeme to be the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Take we the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors words: <hi>We acknowledge, an honest ignorant Papist may be saved.</hi> And, <hi>we haue not so learned Christ, as to deny salvation to some ignorant silly soules, whose humble peaceable obedience makes them safe among any part of men, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the foundation Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> This makes well for Popish Ignorance when all failes. This also giues liberty to any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so it professe the foundation Christ, that therein a man may be saved. And surely if a <hi>silly, ignorant,</hi> idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Papist may in this his religion bee saved, in what religion may not any <hi>silly, ignorant soule</hi> find salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>But here two Questions would be resolved. 1. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Papist, by his religion may be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For resolution, the Author rankes all Papists into two sorts, either <hi>Learned,</hi> or <hi>silly Ignorants:</hi> for the


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7467:22"/>
Learned he confesseth, it is very hard for them to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but if ignorant, more eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. So then if a Papist be saved, he may thanke his ignorance. And indeede the Doctrine of Popery, conferring nothing to a mans salvation, but altogether against it, it is safest to be ignorant of that religion. But Christ the Foundation is there professed. Well. But how will Popish igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance teach a man to bee saved by Christ? <hi>Faith comes by hearing.</hi> And without faith, no salvation by Christ. But all Papists, though never so silly, yet are taught this lesson at their fingers ends, even to hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the Preaching of the word of God, whereby they should belieue in Christ. They call it <hi>Heresie.</hi> How then is it possible for such to bee saved, bee they never so <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>peaceable men</hi>? Or as if a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, though never so simple, could be humble. There can be no greater pride, then that which hee takes in his ignorance: (as his Ghostly Fathers teach him,) preferring it before all the knowledge of Christ. And can he be peaceable, whose chiefe Article of his Creed is, to belieue and hold the Pope to bee supreme over all Kings and Princes, whom he must rather obey, then them? This is the <hi>Beasts marke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 14: 9.</note> which who so recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, (saith the Holy Ghost) <hi>shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God.</hi> No Papist then, as a Papist, can be saved. And of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (saith God) <hi>Come out of her my people, least yee be partakers of her sinnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> is the Dominion and Religion of the Beast, of Antichrist. Nothing then therein to bee expected, but the punishment of <hi>Babells</hi> sinnes.</p>
               <p>The second Question: May not a simple Papist,<note place="margin">In the same booke. pag. 72. It is the saying of another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, like to the former, in the same booke.</note> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by education, or long custome, or over-valuing the soverainty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and so in the simplicity of his heart imbracing them, finde mercy at Gods hand, by a generall repentance, and faith in the merit of Christ, attended with charity and other vertues?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:7467:23"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here the state of the former question is quite altered. By faith and repentance, no doubt, not onely an ignorant, silly idolatrous <hi>Papist, professing the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Christ</hi>; but even an <hi>Infidell, Turke,</hi> or <hi>Iew,</hi> opposing Christ, (though no such Idolaters, as Papists be) may find mercy at Gods hand, and so be saved. But withall, this ignorant silly Papist believing and repenting, must necessarily thereupon repent him of all his Idolatries, as well as of all his other sinnes. <hi>Yes,</hi> (saith the Author) <hi>by a generall repentance and faith.</hi> VVhat a strange doctrine is this for a learned Doctor (and more then so) of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to teach?

               <p>My conclusion is (to be briefe) <hi>No Papist, as a Papist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether learned or ignorant, can be saued.</hi> My reason is, because Popery denyeth the <hi>sauing Faith</hi> of Christ, as in the <hi>Councell of Trent.</hi> Againe, they want the meanes of Faith, as the Preaching of the Gospell. Therefore Ordinarily they are not within the compasse or verge of salvation· If they bee saved then, while they abide in the midst of Babilon, it must be extraordinarliy, by Gods speciall mercy, and worke of his spirit, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not tyed necessarily to the meanes, though or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily it be· This Spirit then working saving Faith in the soule (without which faith no salvation) this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

accurseth. Therefore such a one is saved, not as a Papist, but one so beleiving, as he is accursed, and by <hi>Anathama</hi> shut out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that by the solemne and definitiue sentence of the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> If then, by the peremptory doctrine of <hi>Trent,</hi> or of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> no Papist, as a Papist, can be saved: If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot yeld salvation to any in it, but altogether denyeth, yea accurseth the very meanes: it followeth as a conclusion vndeniable, that, <hi>the Church of Rome is no true visible Church of Christ.</hi> For only in the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is salvation to bee found.</p>
               <p>But sayes some, this is a hard sentence. Yea and our first Authour for one, <hi>It is malicious and rash.</hi> Is it mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rash, or vncharitable to speake the truth?

Church. And yet, vnder correction, I see no such difference betweene these two, but that if we yeeld the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true, or truely visible Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may as well call it a true Church. For how can wee call that a true Church, which is not truely visible? And if a Church be truely visible, what letts, that it should not be a true Church of God, at least in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For that which demonstrates it a true or truely visible Church, must also evince it to be a true Church. As also the same author calls the Church of <hi>Rome a true Church,</hi> as well as, <hi>a true visible Church.</hi>

True it is, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudaea</hi> is still called the <hi>Holy Land</hi>; but is it therefore still <hi>sacred,</hi> because so called, or because so adored of superstitious Pilgrimes? <hi>Bethel</hi> was once a Holy place, when <hi>Iacob</hi> erected there his Altar for Gods worship: was it therefore holy still, when <hi>Ierob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and not for any holinesse infused into it, or affixed to it by any solemne Act of Consecration.

Thirdly, as Rivers are of an incessant, and indefatigable motion, <hi>Labituret labetur in omne volubilis aevum</hi>: so are the most industrious, actiue, and vnwearied Iesuites.

Fifthly, Rivers vsually run along the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test soyles, and fairest meadowes: and do not Iesuites so?

               <p>But herein vnlike to Rivers. For first, Rivers, though they come from the Sea, yet passing through the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row veines, and secret pores of the earth, they put off all their brackishnesse: but these, as they come from a Sea of blood, so they run blood.

First, in that they cause and procure infinite blood-sheds in the world, not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sacred blood of Kings and Princes, and of all Gods Saints and servants. Secondly, in a spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, by killing the soules of those, that drinke in these bloody waters, in stead of the pure fountain-water of the word of God. And this is specially that blood here meant. It is no lesse mortiferous, then that of the Sea, in the former Viall, whereof every living soule therein, dieth.

Or, how may this Viall be poured on Papists as a vengeance, that they should be found worthy to drinke such blood?

It is shamelesse impudency to deny those to be Martyrs of Christ, who were then put to death for religion.

But it is a fundamentall Principle vndeniable, <hi>Deus, ordine naturae, nihil praevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit creatum, antequam voluit creandum: God, in order of nature, foresaw nothing created, before hee first willed it to bee created.</hi> In the Creation God first gaue vnto the Creature its Beeing, and then <hi>hee saw, that it was good.</hi> He did not first <hi>see</hi> them to be good, and after gaue them their Beeing. But, as <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4.11. <hi>For his wils sake they are, and were created.</hi> So that Gods will, in order of Nature and of causes, is before the Creatures beeing or goodnesse; his will first makes them the subiect of goodnesse, before they become the obiect of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. For nothing can be foreseene, before it first bee conceiued to haue a beeing: and a beeing of it selfe it cannot haue, but from the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> the prime efficient cause thereof.</p>

               <p>But pardon my digression. I proceed.

Againe, is there not great difference betweene Gods loue to man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the first Adam in the state of innocencie: and betweene Gods loue to man after the fall, as considered in Christ the second Adam? yet our Author puts none at all.</p>

And this he will also proue from the doctrine of the Church of England. Which is answered, as before. The Scripture saith [in matter of censure] heare the Church: but in matter of faith and doctrine, heare him, that is, Christ. The Church must euer submit her doctrines to the touchstone of the Scripture. And so the Church of England doth I am sure. And what saith the Scripture of the redemption by Christ, and for whom.

but Christ tooke even that vpon him also. Indeed if a man runne on in sinne, with a high hand, hating to bee reformed, contemning the Ministry of the word, and so persist and dye in his impenitency, it is euident that Christ the Lambe of God hath not taken away the sin of that man.</p>

Surely, God doth not impose a necessity vpon Reprobates to continue and make vp the measure of their sin, because of his <hi>eternall Decree:</hi> but they being thereby justly left to the swing of their owne will, and to the tyranny of Satan, are by Satan and their own seruile lust necessitated, yea by him as their rider whipt and spurd a gallop, till they become to the end of sins race, <hi>the wages</hi> whereof <hi>is death.</hi> And as we say, <hi>They must needs goe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Diuell driues.</hi> And saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">2.

Now out of this stubborne infidelity the Lord by his Prophet labours to pull them, as it were by the threefold cable of his Oath.

But the Lambe shall certainly overcome them. <hi>Magna est ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, et praevalet.</hi>

               <p>And againe, because ever, where false doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to venditate themselues (specially such as strike at the very root of the Gospell, Gods free grace, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith) they draw after them a traine of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and daring sinnes at their heele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the text, we may safely imbrace all. Only two are most pregnant, and may seeme to challenge the most certaine credit afore all the rest. First, that this great battell shall be vpon the Hill of Gods delight, to wit, his Church, and especially there, where the Gospell is most conspicuous, and shineth most clearely, against which, the envy of the Antichristian army, shall advance the Standard. Paralell hereunto is that battell of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> (chapter 20) the secret and open enemies of Gods Church, wherein they shall <hi>compasse the tents of the Saints about, and the holy City,</hi> even the Church of Christ. And we haue a notable type hereof in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniell</hi>; where the great <hi>Antiochus</hi> (a liuely type of Antichrist) is said, in that his fatall battaile to his owne confusion, to <hi>pitch the Tents of his Pallace between the Seas, in the glorious holy Mountaine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45.</note> This may prefigure Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs assaulting the people of God in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> to wit, the glorious holy Mountaine, the Church. And doth not the glorious Church in <hi>England</hi> stand betweene the Seas? The second is, that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> royall Paraphrast, though no way second, but rather may challenge precedency before all the rest, for the singular allusion of it, <hi>Destruction by deceit.</hi> Which doth highly make for the honour of that Lord of Hosts, who by his wisdome and power shall wind and turne all the wiles and stratagems of the old Dragon, and false Prophet, all the power and puissance of the Beast to their owne destruction. And for this cause it is said here, <hi>He,</hi> to wit, God <hi>shall gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a place, called Harmageddon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this may seeme strange, that God should lead this potent and proud army even to his owne Mountaine of Delights, his Church. No, not strange. Did not the Holy spirit lead Christ into the wildernesse, to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Devill? And hath not God power over all these plagues? And was it not he, that brought that daring <hi>Assyrian</hi> Host against the holy Citty in <hi>Ezechia's</hi> raigne, as even that blasphemous <hi>Rabsache</hi> seemed to

Can an enemy, though never so powerfull, looke to prosper in any great attempt, when his adversary hath a secret disposing hand to direct and sway all his designes which way himselfe pleaseth? The King of <hi>Syria's</hi> Counsells, and his words spoken in his bed chamber against <hi>Israel,</hi> could they take place, when both there was a faithfull <hi>Elisha,</hi> to warne the King of Israell of them, and a prudent King, willing to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his good counsell?

               <p>Nor can the time of this Vialls full accomplishment, for the bringing of this maine battell to a head, be farre off from the first pouring out.

And this seemeth to be spoken not so much in regard of outward pressures, and persecutions of the Church, as of intestine false doctrines, very potent and prevalent in this Viall.

Who seeth not with what confidence they haue beene puffed vp, as if already they had won the field? What a high hand had they gotten over the Church of Christ, in suppressing the truth (in as much as in them lay) that it might not be maintained either in Print, or in Pulpitts? How began all kind of wicked heresy, opposing and impugning Gods Grace, and Mans Salvation, to strout and vaunt it selfe, both by Printing, and Preaching, bidding open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the truth, and the Professors of it? Insomuch as it was (in mans eye) whether for a penny should get the conquest, couragious Truth, or outrageous Errour. The conflict was so eagre, as I said to my friends for their comfort, it was the Devills last heaue. But blessed be God, we haue seene his head already broken; and his whole body will follow after.

Chapter. The third, is the spirit of false doctrines, and lying Prophets, and Ministers; which is signified by the spirits coming out of the mouth of the false Prophet. Now, when ever we find a time, wherein the spirit of craft, of lawlesse vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped power, and of false doctrines are most predominant, and arrived to as great a height, as is possible, without
