            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu Surpriſe me with the <hi>Baroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Manuſcript,</hi> but much more with the Account of the Credit it has gotten. Its Admirers, I preſume, take it to be an <hi>excellent Tract</hi> upon <hi>R. B</hi>'s word, and fancy (<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Baroccian MSS</hi> in that <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in which Book there are ſome Hiſtorical Treatiſes, and particularly a Catalogue of the Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under <hi>Niaphorus</hi>'s name. This is all true, but the <hi>Editor</hi> ſhould have obſerved that that Book is a bundle of ſeveral Treatiſes of ſeveral Authors, and particularly that this Tract is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a different hand from thoſe to which the name of <hi>Niaphorus</hi> is affixt. So that from the Book it ſelf there is not the leaſt reaſon to conjecture that <hi>Niaphorus</hi> compiled this piece.</p>

The Compiler of it ſeems to be a <hi>Latiniz'd Greek,</hi> and at the time when he wrote it he was a kind of a Tutor, and this piece was a reading to his <hi>Boys,</hi> ſo injudiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compos'd, and in ſo mean a ſtile, that nothing but the Barbarity of the Age, and the meanneſs of the Auditory can make any tolerable excuſe for it. To think it a <hi>Homily,</hi> and pronounced in a Council of Biſhops (as the <hi>Editor</hi> ſeems willing to opine) is to libel a Century; for how can a Man diſgrace an <note place="margin">

He tells them (Sect. 1.) their <hi>defection was impious,</hi> and <hi>deſtable fomented by bold impudent Men,</hi> and <hi>a great Scandal to Religion.</hi> He admoniſheth them to right their injured Miniſters, and tells them they had been diligent in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and were great Ornaments of the Church. (Sect. 44.) he adds that they lay under a great Sin. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. (Sect. 44.) Nor is that venerable <hi>Father</hi> leſs Zealous in his Addreſs to the <hi>People</hi> to adhere, (even after he had given this advice to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> Sect. 57.) than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65453:2"/>
to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to recede from an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Generation. Yet I ſhall freely own the direction is excellent; and who would more freely follow it then the pteſent <hi>Biſhops,</hi> were the caſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> like that of <hi>Corinth?</hi> But let us ſuppoſe that by ſuch a receſs the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> had been violated, the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Church, for which they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Perſecution, the mockings of the wordly, and the railing of the Proud, expoſed; and that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> which Chriſt ſettled on the Apoſtles, and they delivered to their Succeſſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed; and then would St. <hi>Clemens</hi> have adviſed them to with-draw? Any man may anſwer that he was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and therefore doubtleſs of his opinion who would not give place to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders</hi> ('tis the <hi>Editor's</hi> word) ſo much as for one hour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>The next advice comes from <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> and almoſt three hundred <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Biſhops, who offer'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign <note place="margin">Pref. p. 6.</note> their Biſhopricks to preſerve the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the Church: and no doubt they had made a very good purchaſe. But is there no way, to preſerve the Unity of the Church but the Reſignation of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd?</hi> Will not their Reſtoration do as well? and would it not be a more <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> application to addreſs the <hi>Intruders</hi> to make reparation, and do right to God and Man at once? the <hi>Injur'd</hi> may with-draw, but the <hi>Injurious</hi> I am ſure, are bound to do it by greater and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger obligations, than thoſe that come from <hi>African,</hi> however venerable Examples.</p>
            <p>But here, <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt beg leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate a little, and deſire to know what grievous offence I committed, that I muſt be enjoyned the ungrateful pennance of examining a piece, in which I can meet with nothing but <hi>confidence, diſingenuity</hi> and <hi>ſhuffle.</hi> For I have reaſon to believe the <hi>Editor</hi> never lookt into St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nor the <hi>Conference at Carthage</hi> which he quotes; had he ſeen the Books, he would not have given <hi>Marcellinus</hi> another title then that he meets with in them: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi> is called <hi>Tribunus Notarius</hi> and <hi>Cognitor,</hi> but <note place="margin">Paſſim in Coll.
