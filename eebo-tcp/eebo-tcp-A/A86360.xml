         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>prima, God himſelf,</hi> no creature can compaſſe ſo great a <hi>purchaſe,</hi> if God were willing to ſell it, but <hi>veritas</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>prima,</hi> derived from that firſt Truth, this may, and muſt be bought. This is <hi>veritas objectiva,</hi> as it lyes in the Scriptures, both in the <hi>principles</hi> of it, and <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> deduced from it; Truth <hi>Originall</hi> and Truth <hi>Derived.</hi> And <hi>veritas ſubjectiva</hi> ſeated <hi>in us,</hi> which we ſucke from the word of Truth. Indeed Truth of Religion <hi>in us,</hi> grounded upon the Holy Scriptures the Rule of Truth; which comprizeth Truth in our <hi>Iudgements,</hi> when ſoundly <hi>informed;</hi> Truth in our <hi>wils</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> when obedientially <hi>conformed;</hi> Truth in our <hi>converſation,</hi> when ſeriouſly <hi>reformed</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word of Truth.</p>
            <p>There are things in <hi>Truth</hi> well worth our <hi>Buying, firſt libertie of Truth,</hi> that the <hi>True Religion</hi> may have <note place="margin">1.

Truth bluſheth at nothing ſo much as to be concealed. Paul</hi> deſireth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to pray for him, <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> that the word of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:126012:6"/>
God <hi>may run and be glorified.</hi> It is a diſparagement <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 1.</note> to Chriſt and his Goſpel, when that hath ſo much adoe to <hi>creepe,</hi> which ſhould <hi>run</hi> and ride in triumph from congregation to congregation, from kingdome to kingdome. But a moſt beautifull and honourable ſight to ſee Chriſt at the opening of the <hi>firſt Seale,</hi>

What though a river be full of good water, yet if frozen, if not an open paſſage, men may die for thirſt.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteouſneſſe, that diſperſes both light and heat. Libertie of the Goſpel makes it a Goſpel to us. The Church in the <hi>Acts</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5.</note> knew how to value this libertie of Truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Peter</hi> was impriſoned <hi>inſtant and earneſt prayer was made;</hi> the anſwer was as effectuall. <hi>Peter</hi> releaſed, <hi>Herod</hi> confounded, and truth ſet at libertie. Of all famines, the Soul-famine, Goſpel-famine is the moſt grievous, threatned as an heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11, 12. But a moſt ſweet mercy to feel and taſte the accompliſhment of that promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 20. <hi>Though the Lord give you the bread of adverſitie, and the water of affliction, yet ſhall not thy teachers be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into a corner any more, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers.</hi>

            <p>The firſt uſe of Wiſdome is to diſcerne the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities</hi> themſelves. Religion muſt not be taken <note place="margin">1.</note> upon truſt.

            <p>Firſt, Put in caveats againſt <hi>Arminian</hi> errours, <note place="margin">1.</note> which doe ſo extenuate originall ſinne, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the power of nature, that they feed our heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>diſeaſe of pride,</hi> and eclipſe the <hi>glory of Gods grace.</hi> Oh trade for the doctrine of free grace. Maintaine the King of Heavens Prerogative. In the ſpirituall building, grace laid the firſt foundation, in Gods free, eternall purpoſe. Grace erecteth the wals, yea and addeth the top-ſtone. Eternity will be little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to admire, to adore, to cry grace, grace; Therefore carefully poſſeſſe your ſelves of this truth againſt <hi>the enemies of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Minde the promoting of thoſe Truthes which juſtifie <hi>The purity of Divine Worſhip,</hi> according <note place="margin">2.</note> to Gods owne will, againſt Popiſh and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous innovators. There is a bewitching pompe in the out ſide of popery, which intangleth ſome. Ancient Writers uſed many wanton Metaphors, and ſuch a liberty of expreſſion, before the myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was diſcovered, which deluded others. There is a diſpoſition in all corrupt natures, no leſſe to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall then bodily fornication. Vindicate therefore the ſecond Commandement, which Papiſts have expunged, and others ſo much clouded. Where
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:126012:17"/>
God hath profeſſed himſelfe jealous, let us be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, of trading for ſuch Truthes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Put a value upon ſuch Truthes as diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the dangerous errours of <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> which is <note place="margin">3.</note> no better then a <hi>Complication of many antient hereſies,</hi> condemned by ancient Councels. A Doctrine that undermineth the merit and ſatisfaction of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours death; that will ſcarce allow faith to ſwimme, where reaſon cannot wade; that will ſo farre bring downe Religion to reaſon, that we muſt beleeve lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more in Divinity, then we can ſee in reaſon. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme</hi> gratifieth the <hi>pride of will; Popery</hi> the <hi>pride of outward ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> the <hi>pride of carnall reaſon.</hi>

Then we expect to enjoy the richeſt influence from him. And if men could diſpute away our <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> we ſhould ſoone loſe the vigour of our <hi>practicall Religion.</hi> God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 10.</note> made it holy by Inſtitution, by Ordination, let us keepe it holy by Obſervation.</p>
