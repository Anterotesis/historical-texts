            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleased GOD, in His most
wyse and admirable providence, to
make troubles and afflictions in this
lyfe common to the godlie and the
wicked; to let the world see, that the
godlie doe wyselie seeke and expect
happinesse in another place; and, that wicked men
are fooles, to seeke for it here, where it is not to bee
found. But these temporall calamities, as they
haue diverse effects in the evill, and in the good;
so they come not to them with one and the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
commission or direction from divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
For GOD, when Hee sendeth out great
afflictions and calamities agaynst the wicked, such
as povertie, disgrace, sicknesse, and death, Hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them a full commission, to hurt and destroy;
<pb facs="tcp:13504:17"/>
lyke that commission which Hee gaue to king
<hi>Saul</hi> agaynst the <hi>Amalekites;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Goe, and vtterlie destroy
the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight agaynst them,
vntill they bee consumed.</hi> But when Hee sendeth
afflictions to His owne Children, Hee giveth them
a limited commission; or rather a loving charge,
lyke that which <hi>David</hi> gaue to <hi>Ioab,</hi> and the rest of
his Captayns, concerning <hi>Absalom,</hi> agaynst whom
they were to fight; <hi>Deale gentlie</hi> (sayd hee) <hi>for my
sake, with the young man, even with Absalom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 18. 5</note> For
Hee hath ordayned the afflictions of the godlie,
how sharpe and grievous soever they bee, to hurt
little, and for a moment; but to profit much, and
to all aeternitie. And for this effect, as Hee giveth
to His owne, in their troubles, that great <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
whose secret operation vpon their heartes, is
most powerfull, and wonderfull; so also Hee hath
appoynted others, who, for the tyme, are not alyke
visited,<note place="margin">Amos 6. 6.</note> or afflicted, to bee <hi>grieved for their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
to <hi>mourne with them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 15.</note> to <hi>speake wordes in season
vnto them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 50. 4</note> and to <hi>comfort them, by that comfort,
wherewith themselues haue beene comforted of GOD.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 4.</note>
The performance of this duetie, as it is incumbent
to all, so especiallie to those whom Hee hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to preach that Word, which is the Store-house
of Comfort. And therefore I, who although
most vnworthie, am, by GODS singular Mercie,
adjoyned to that number, hearing of your great
heavinesse, and sorrow, for the departure of your
sonne; and knowing you to be one of those, whom
<hi>GOD</hi> hath ordayned to bee <hi>gentlie dealt with,</hi> and
comforted in all their tribulations, I thought my
selfe bound, to wryte something vnto you at this
<pb facs="tcp:13504:17"/>
tyme, for your comfort; especiallie, seeing I know
more of that young Man his secret walking with
<hi>GOD,</hi> than anie other: and consequentlie, am
able to giue you most particular and credible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
of the holinesse of his lyfe, where from you
may easily collect the happines of his death. Of this
he himselfe gaue some signification vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
to those who were then present with him.
For when that last houre (to him a moste happie
houre) approached, hee, after the example of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
comforting himselfe with this,<note place="margin">2. Kings. 20. 3.</note> that hee had
<hi>walked before GOD in trueth, and with a perfect
heart,</hi> did, for confirmation of that, which he sayd,
take himselfe to two witnesses: to <hi>GOD,</hi> the onlie
Eye-witnesse of the secret counsels of his heart;
and to mee, then absent from him, as to the onelie
Eare-witnesse on earth, vnto whom hee had revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his most private carriage. Wherefore I thought
my selfe oblieged, to declare to the world, but in
speciall vnto you, in tyme of this your heavinesse,
how earnest and effectuall a desire that young man
had to encrease in grace, to overcome temptations,
and to liue an Angelicall lyfe vpon earth: that you
being informed thereof, may rejoyce for the grace
hee had then, and for the glorie hee hath now.</p>
            <p>Then, for your comfort, consider, I pray you,
with mee, onelie these two particulars: First, what
hath beene <hi>GODS</hi> dealing towards you in this
matter: Secondlie, what hath beene <hi>GODS</hi> dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
towards him. For is His dealing bee towards
you both in mercie, I can not see what reason you
haue to entertayne such excessiue sorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13504:18"/>
As for His dealing towards you, and others in
the lyke case,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> expresseth it in these two short
sentences: <hi>The LORD gaue, and the Lord hath taken
away;</hi> or, as others interpret the wordes, <hi>hath taken
backe to Himselfe:</hi> which, at the first hearing, I
confesse, seeme to afford small argument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
For the first seemeth not to importe anie
matter of joye, because it looketh to the tyme by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
and onelie signifieth, that once we were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.
The other seemeth to importe reall miserie,
because it is meerlie privatiue, and signifieth, that
the happinesse wee once had, is nowe removed.
But if we shall duelie weygh these words, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venientlie
apply them to the present purpose, wee
shall finde, that much matter of joye and comfort
lyeth hidden in them. Wherefore marke, howe
<hi>Iob</hi> beginneth at <hi>giving; The LORD</hi> (sayeth hee)
<hi>gaue.</hi> If hee had not begun so, perhaps hee would
not haue ended so as hee did; that is, with blessing
<hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MISTRESSE, here begin with <hi>Iob,</hi> and say, <hi>The
LORD gaue.</hi> Remember the <hi>LORDS</hi> favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, in giving you such a sonne, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
him with you manie years; to the effect, that
yee may joyfullie prayse and blesse His Name.
<hi>David</hi> putteth these two well together;<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Blesse the
LORD, O my soule, and forget not all His benefites.</hi>
For if wee would blesseth <hi>LORD,</hi> wee must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
remember His benefites. Lest therefore
your melancholie make you deficient in paying
this tribute to <hi>GOD,</hi> remember, with a thankfull
heart, howe <hi>GOD</hi> made you to rejoyce at his
birth,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 21.</note> when yee sawe, that, by you, <hi>a man-chylde
<pb facs="tcp:13504:18"/>
was borne into the worlde:</hi> and, that <hi>GOD</hi> had given
you a sonne, (according to our <hi>Scottish</hi> phrase)
<hi>world-lyke.</hi> But, shortlie thereafter, Hee gaue
you a farre greater argument of joye, when Hee
made him to bee borne agayne, of <hi>water, and the
Spirit,</hi> into another World, which shall never haue
an end. And wheras before he was onlie <hi>world-lyke,</hi>
or lyke to men, He made him <hi>God-lyke,</hi> or lyke to
Himselfe; drawing, by His own finger, that portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Himselfe, according to the which, Man was
first created. Yet this tyme of his infancie, was to
him and you both, but as it were the seed-tyme;
and that both in respect of Nature, and also of
GRACE. For hee had then a reasonable Soule,
which is the seede, and the originall of a humane
or reasonable and morall conversation: But, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that tyme, hee could not come to the vse of
it; neyther could anie then perceaue, whether hee
would proue a wyse man, or a foole. Lykewyse,
hee had then receaved Baptismall grace, which is
the seede, and the originall, of a Christian, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and heavenlie conversation. But no vse, or
exercyse, could hee then haue of it: neyther could
anie man perceaue, whether hee would thereafter
walke in the way of Pietie, and Christianitie, or
not. But <hi>GOD,</hi> who is the sower of both these
seedes, and maketh them to spring vp, where Hee
pleaseth, and when Hee pleaseth, did make them
verie soone to spring vp both together in him;
yea, also to bring foorth aboundant fruit: so that
even from his bairnlie age, hee had the wit of a
Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the knowledge of a Scholler, &amp; the carriage of
a Christian: and, consequentlie, was to you, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:13504:19"/>
all these yeares, which interveaned betwixt
his chyldhood, and his deatth, an argument, or
ground, of great expectation, and a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
joye. Now, when GOD hath removed
him, and taken him to Himselfe, shall all these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of GOD towardes you bee buried in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,
as his bones are buried in the earth? Or, if
they remayne in the Register of your memorie,
shall they bee remembred without thankfulnesse?
Or,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 46. 47. 49.</note> if your soule <hi>magnifie the LORD for them,</hi>
ought not also <hi>your spirit to rejoyce in GOD your
Saviour; seeing Hee that is Mightie hath done great
things to you, &amp; Holie is His Name.</hi> It is a grosse and
fond errour, that onelie such good thinges, as wee
doe actuallie enjoye, or looke to enjoye, are the
matter or cause of rejoycing. The verie <hi>Paganes</hi>
sawe the absurditie of this errour: and therefore
<hi>Seneca,</hi> comforting <hi>Polybius,</hi> agaynst the death of
his brother, telleth him, <hi>that hee ought not to thinke
himselfe injured,</hi> by losing such a brother;<note place="margin">Consol. ad Polyb. c. 29.</note> 
               <hi>but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much benefited, by vsing and enjoying his pietie so
long.</hi> And hee addeth, <hi>that a man is vnjust, and
vnreasonable, who is not content, that hee who is the
bestower of a benefite, dispose of it according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
That hee is too greedie, who thinketh it not gayne,
that hee once receaved such a benefite; but rather losse,
that hee hath restored it, or that hee now wanteth it:
That hee is vngrate, who thinketh the ende of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
delight, an injurie:</hi> And, <hi>that hee is a foole, who
thinketh that hee hath no fruit of good thinges, except
when they are present.</hi> And if an <hi>Ethnicke</hi> sayde
so, wee, who are Christians, ought, much more, to
say, and thinke so; seeing wee know, that all good
<pb facs="tcp:13504:19"/>
thinges, which doe befall vs, as well by-past, as
present, and to come, doe flowe from one Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
even that Fountayne wich is the sourse of
all our happinesse; that is, from the loue of GOD.
Those who haue fared well at a Feast, are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
when the dishes are removed; because they
know that they were appoynted for the vse of the
guests onelie for a tyme. And, if dishes bee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before the Feast bee ended, farre lesse are men
grieved, because they expect a newe service, and
other moe dayntie dishes to bee presented in their
rowme. So ought wee not to bee grieved, when
temporall benefites are removed: First, because
wee knowe, those thinges were onelie lent vs, for a
tyme. Secondlie, because wee knowe, those are
not the best thinges, which GOD hath appoynted
for vs: but wee looke for better, even for such as
<hi>eye hath not seene, and eare hath not heard, neyther
haue entered into the heart of man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The other sentence, to wit, <hi>The LORD hath
taken away,</hi> seemeth, as I sayde before, to importe
reall miserie: for, the sweeter a benefite is, the
more bitter &amp; grievous is the removing therof: and
it is accounted worse, to lose former happinesse,
than never to haue beene happie at all. But first,
I know, yee never placed your happinesse in anie
worldlie thing; but in the light of GODS Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
who is onelie able to put singular joye in
mens hearts, even then when al worldly things do
fayle. GOD would never haue bidden vs <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
evermore,</hi> if Hee had not given vs a permanent
and vnchangeable cause of joye. And therefore
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> marketh well, that whereas all men in
<pb facs="tcp:13504:20"/>
their particular Trades,<note place="margin">Serm. 18. ad <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

solide and permanent joye; those onelie attayne to
it, who feare GOD: because those onlie <hi>haue gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the true roote of pleasure, and the</hi> source, or
<hi>Fountayne of joye.</hi> This Fountayne, hee telleth
vs, is lyke the Ocean, from whence all waters haue
their originall; and that because of the greatnesse
thereof. For, sayeth hee, as a sparke of fyre, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the Sea, is easilie extinguished; so, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
evill commeth vpon vs, it falling into a
great Ocean of gladnesse, is soone extinguished,
and evanisheth.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, that degree of temporall happinesse,
which yee had by your sonne, stoode not so much
in having a sonne, as in having a good, pious, and
vertuous sonne. And this degree of happinesse is
not removed, but much augmented: and so setled,
and established, that nowe vnto all aeternitie yee
shall haue such a sonne. For his knowledge is now
perfected; Fayth beeing changed into Sight; and
Hope, into Fruition: and it is fred from all doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
inquyring, searching, &amp; from all that trouble
and sorrow, which here is encreased, whyle know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is encreased.<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 18</note> Such lyke, his holinesse is
now perfected: for all the defectes of charitie, or
the loue of GOD, which were in him, yea, are in
the best of GODS Sainctes, whyle they liue
heere, are nowe removed, together with all his
temptations, feares, sorrowes, blottes, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
So that, that crying for mercie, which whyle
hee lived was in his mouth continuallie, is nowe
chaunged into a perpetuall <hi>Hallelujah.</hi> And the
Angels, who before were delighted with his poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall
<pb facs="tcp:13504:20"/>
teares, and groanes, are nowe rejoyced,
to heare his Songes of Prayse and Thanks-giving,
which with the rest of those Heavenlie Quiristers,
hee singeth to the honour of his Maker.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ye will say, I know my son to be so
as yee say; but how shall I thinke that I haue nowe
such a sonne,<note place="margin">Non amisi mus, sed pramisimus.</note> seeing hee is separated from mee by
Death? I aunswere; Your separation is but for

               <hi>Wee haue sent them
away; yea, beeing shortlie to follow, wee haue sent them
before vs.</hi> Indeede, it is true, they who are dead,
<hi>shall never returne to vs.</hi> If wee knewe no more
but this, wee might justlie giue way, even to the
verie excesse of griefe: But blessed bee GOD,
who hath given vs this comfort,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 23.</note> that although
they can not returne vnto vs, yet <hi>wee shall goe to
them.</hi> Wherefore, as when men are a-flitting from
one place of habitation, to another, some persons
of the familie goe before the rest, to that newe
dwelling place, and others stay behinde, intending
shortlie to come thither also: and therefore, are
not grieved for the separation from them, whom
they sent before them. So wee, and our families,
are vpon our flitting,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 10.</note> to that Citie, <hi>having founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whose builder and maker, is GOD.</hi> It is not
<pb facs="tcp:13504:21"/>
GODS will, that all should flit at once; but Hee
will haue whyles the Husband to goe before the
Wyfe, and whyles the Wyfe to goe before the
Husband; whyles the Parentes to goe before the
Children, and whyles the Children to prevent the
Parentes. What cause of great sorrow is there
here, if men and women would rightlie consider
this, and firmlie belieue it?</p>
            <p>Thirdlie; seeing the happinesse of Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
much in the happinesse of their Children,
if death was to your sonne <hi>Advantage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 1.</note> or <hi>Gayne,</hi>
(as vndoubtedlie it is to all those who die in the
LORD) howe can yee thinke it so great a losse to
you? If hee hath gayned so much by the change,
howe can yee thinke your selfe so much hurt by
it? If an earthlie king had sent for your sonne,
promising to adopt him, and make him his
Heyre, the sorrow which you would haue had for
wanting his company, would easily haue bene swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp of the joye which yee would haue had
for his advancement, although yee had never loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to haue seene him agayne. The application
is easie, and the comfort vnspeakeable; if yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that GOD, who hath sent His Messenger
[<hi>Death.</hi>] for your sonne, hath given him that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible

            <p>Nowe, to come to GOD'S dealing towardes
him; I hope it shall afford you great matter of joy,
if yee consider it, as yee ought. I will not speake
of GOD'S dealing towardes him, in bestowing
<pb facs="tcp:13504:21"/>
naturall and morall giftes vpon him; as desire of
knowledge, paynfull diligence, in stryving to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
thervnto, sharpnesse of wit, soliditie of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and an happie progresse, farre aboue all his
Condisciples, in humane literature, Philosophie,
and Theologie. These were, indeede, great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of GOD: But it was not the remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of these thinges, which vphelde him at the
tyme of his death: Nor yet can the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these thinges now afford you that joyfull
assurance of the happinesse of his death, and of
his estate nowe after death, which yee desire to
haue. Wherefore, let vs consider GOD'S dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
towardes him, in the <hi>worke of his Salvation:</hi>
And let all those who are exercysed with such
Tryalls, and Conflicts of Conscience, as hee was,
learne at him, to wayte patientlie vpon GOD,
vntill they get the victorie. It is well knowne
vnto you who are his Parentes, howe carefullie
hee <hi>remembered his Creator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 18. 1</note> 
               <hi>in the dayes of his
youth:</hi> and howe, whyle hee was yet a Chylde,
GOD, by His Spirit, possessed his heart, making
him to finde heavenlie delight, in all spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyses,
whereof hee was then capable: vvhich
appeared by his ordinarie, and almost perpetuall
frequenting of them, to the great admiration of
all who knewe him, and to the great benefite of
his Brethren and Sisters, whom, at all tymes, hee
was carefull, partlie by his example, and partlie
by his pious conference, to aedifie, &amp; to draw with
himselfe into the way of Godlinesse. Hee found
nothing, then, but sweetnesse, and delight, and
<pb facs="tcp:13504:22"/>
heavenlie ravishmentes in serving of GOD;
(for it pleaseth GOD, often tymes, so to allure
young ones to His service) but, afterwardes,
GOD having furnished him with greater strength
of Grace, called him to harder, and more vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
but yet more glorious service; that is, to
wrastle with manie temptations, doubtinges, and
feares; and for overcomming of these, to seeke
the LORD'S Face, with extraordinarie humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations,
prayers, and fastinges; which by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exercyse became so ordinarie vnto him, that
it was harder to him to desist from them, than to
abstayne from his bodilie and naturall food.</p>
            <p>By these exercyses of devotion, hee made sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
progresse in that <hi>strayt way, that leadeth to
Lyfe:</hi> yea, I may boldlie say, that hee did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne
manie who had begun to runne therein long
before him. Yet, so vnsatiable was his <hi>hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Righteousnesse,</hi> that whereas others thought
hee did too much,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 27.</note> especiallie in <hi>keeping his bodie
vnder,</hi> that his Soule might the more and
more bee lifted vp vnto GOD, hee himselfe
thought hee did nothing: ever most humblie estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
himselfe an <hi>vnprofitable servant;</hi> and, with
PAVL,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>fortgeting the thinges that were behinde.</hi>
And because hee intended, and moste vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
desired, to serue GOD, in the holie Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
GOD having fitted and furnished him with
manie singular graces for that Calling; to his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exercyses of devotion, Hee added extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
and invincible diligence in the studie of
DIVINITIE; especiallie in meditating vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:13504:22"/>
holie SCRIPTVRES, and reading the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
that he could get therevpon.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. which hee calleth <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potian</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaph.</note> So that as
<hi>Ierome</hi> sayd of his friend <hi>Nepotian,</hi> (who also died
young) hee made his breast <hi>CHRIST'S Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thece.</hi>
In a word, then, hee desired <hi>to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but CHRIST, and Him crucified:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 2.</note> neyther
laboured hee for anie thing earnestlie, but onelie
to bee <hi>crucified with CHRIST,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galat. 2. 20 6. 14.</note> and <hi>vnto the
worlde.</hi> This his earnest and industrious care, <hi>to
seeke GOD'S</hi> Face, as it was to mee, whom hee
oft acquaynted with the secret estate of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
a matter of great joye; so, at last, it procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to himselfe vnspeakeable contentment, and
tranquillitie of mynde, together with a confident
relying vpon the mercie of GOD, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
intercession of IESUS CHRIST.
Happie, yea, thryse happie was his <hi>wrastling with
GOD;</hi> for thereby hee obtayned and <hi>inherited
the Blessing.</hi> Happie was his <hi>hungering and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
for Righteousnesse;</hi> for in due tyme hee was
<hi>satisfied, and filled.</hi> Happie was his seeking of
GOD;<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 4. 5. 6.</note> for <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>heard him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him from all his feares.</hi> And, therefore, let
all those, who seeke the LORD with the lyke
earnestnesse, and diligence, <hi>looke vnto</hi> him, and to
their owne comfort and encowragement, saye, as
DAVID willed others to saye of himselfe; <hi>This
poore man cryed, and the LORD heard him, and
saved him out of all his troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, then, GOD'S dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
him, was as it vseth ordinarilie to bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
His owne Elect. For, as GREGORIE the
<pb facs="tcp:13504:23"/>
great,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. cap. 7.</note> and ISIDORE following him, telleth vs,
GOD, after Hee hath converted a man vnto
Himselfe,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Sent. cap. 8.</note> first maketh him to finde heavenlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and joye: or, as GREGORIE himselfe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">Blandimen ta dulcedinis</note>
               <hi>the allurementes of sweetnesse,</hi> in His service,
to the effect hee may be the more enamoured with
it, and that hee may the more easilie with-drawe
his heart from those carnall pleasures, with which
before his conversion, hee was bewitched. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when through continuance, and encrease of
grace, hee is enabled, and fitted, to <hi>endure hardnesse,
as the good Souldier of IESVS CHRIST,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 3.</note> the LORD,
partly to keepe him from presumptuous confidence
in his owne strength, and partlie to exercyse his
fayth, patience, and Christian fortitude, withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
from him often tymes the sense or feeling of
His gracious presence; and so exposeth him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
sorrowes, feares, and doubtinges: yea, often
tymes Hee suffereth him to bee vexed with dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
motions, and strong inclinations, to great and
grievous sinnes, all which GREGORIE comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in one generall, calling them <hi>Conflictes,</hi> or
<hi>Fightinges with Temptations.</hi> But, in the ende,
that gracious and kynde LORD,<note place="margin">Certamina tentationu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
               <hi>who will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>but with
the temptation, also maketh a way to escape:</hi> He, I say,
giveth to the man whom Hee hath so exercysed,
inward rest, and refreshment; mitigating his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
pacifying his troubled thoughts, and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his heart with heavenlie &amp; vnspeakeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations:
Upon the which (sayeth GREGORIE)
