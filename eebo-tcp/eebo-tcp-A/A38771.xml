         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my self with that, which by authority and testimony of the
learned, and the experiments of my worthy friends, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practice and experience shall be (by Gods grace) invincibly
confirmed. The first corner-stone of my building, shall be that of
<hi>Duncanus,</hi> confirmed also by laborious and learned <hi>Milius: Hic
Regulus est summum auri examen, ac vera omnium florum, &amp; tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturarum
medicinalium, in Antimonio existentium materia,</hi> that is,
This <hi>Regulus</hi> is the chiefest examination of gold, and the true subject
and matter of all medicinall Virtues, contained within the Body of
Antimony. To this agreeth the testimony of <hi>Basilius Valentinus
Monachus,</hi> calling it <hi>Regulus, sive Dominus medicinae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine Authority, Nature, and Experience confirmeth this truth;
for as life is hid in man, so in all things, whether Animal, Vegitable,
or Minerall, it is invisibly incentred, and so punctually indiscerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that according to the learned Philosopher <hi>Mich. Sengivodius
Polonus,</hi> the living spark is only the 8200. part of any subject: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
then the effectuall power of that spark of life mentioned in the

may give some touch, both for the universality, penetration, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation
of this divine Medicine.</p>
               <p>And now having discovered my <hi>Materia prima,</hi> I will produce
such workmen for the erection of this little Fabrick, so well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
in their profound knowledge, that though by malice and
ignorance, they have been often blamed, they could never be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
nor justly reproved, and the first shall be that Orientall Star
of Naturall, Spagiticall, and Magneticall light and knowledge
<hi>Theophrastus Paracelsus.</hi> He in the sixth book. <hi>Tit. De vita Longa
<pb facs="tcp:54910:5"/>
pag.</hi> 167. saith as followeth. <hi>Quemadmodum Antimonium purgat
Aurum, ita purgat etiam corpus, continet enim essentiam eam quae nihil
impuri relinquit in puro, nec ullus est usque adeò, in scriptis Archidoxeos
peritus, aut tam insignis Spagyrus, qui vires &amp; facultates Antimonii,
plenè indagare queat. In prima enim Yle, Antimonium adeo exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
&amp; inter Mineras Elementi aquae praedestinatum est, ut facultas, &amp;
virtus ejus nullo diluvio, instar caeterorum aquaearum crescentium immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuta
aut absorpta sit, adeóque his omnibus Antimonium longè praestat.
In praedestinatione illud ita se habet, ut se influentiae accommodet, nulla
facultate, aut dote ejus diminuta, aut infirmata, itaque ex omnibus
mineralibus summi Arcani laudem optinet, hoc seipsum purgat, &amp; unà
secum etiam alia, quod si nihil boni in subjecto reperitur, impurum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
transmutat in purum, sicut de Lepra notum est, &amp;c. Paracels. lib. 6.
De vita longa, pag.</hi> 167. Like as Antimony purifieth Gold, so doth
it also cleanse or purifie the body of man, it conteineth that essence
which will permit no uncleannesse to remain in that which is pure:
neither is there any one found so skillfull in the chiefe secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or so excellent a Spagyrick, that can finde out fully the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and medicinall properties of Antimony: it is so much exalted
in his first Being, and appointed from the beginning to excell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Minerals that are of the Element of water, that his virtues
should be, and remain, without waste, or diminution for ever: and
that it should sympathize and apply to the celestiall influence, so to
be perpetually susteined in full efficacy, virtue, and effect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of all Mineralls it obteineth the praise of the greatest secret, It
purgeth it self, and together with him all other bodies, and although
it findeth but little which is clean or pure: it purifieth cleanseth,
and changeth that unclean body to be most pure and clean, as
it is well known by practice and experience made upon leprous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>And again in the sixth book, pag. 22. <hi>Quinta essentia Antimonii ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenum
adimit, pulmonem enim &amp; cor &amp; membra laeprae subjecta mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat
autem &amp; corpus totum purificat &amp; renovat mirum in modum:</hi> The
essence of Antimony expelleth poyson, comforteth the heart, and
wonderfully restoreth &amp; purifieth the Lights and other parts of the
body apt to be infected with Leprosie. Moreover the 7. book p. 73.</p>
               <p>Tanta vis &amp; virtus est in Antimonio, ut restaurat enim &amp; renovat
universas in corpore vires, ac facultates mirificè: <hi>Such, and so great, is
<pb facs="tcp:54910:6"/>
the virtue of Antimony that it wonderfully restoreth and reneweth
all the strength and vigour of the whole body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the eight book he declareth at large the severall virtues
and medicinall operations of many other excellent Vegitables and
Minerals, and in the end concludeth, <hi>Haec junctim uno in Antimonio
latent;</hi> These that we have severally spoken of are all inclusively
contained in Antimony alone.</p>
               <p>In the sixth book, pag. 22. He teacheth how, by their excellency
in virtue and operation, to distinguish of the preheminence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of dignities of Simples, the one above the other; saying, That
those that perform the more difficult and desperate cures, ought to
bear away the glory of their excelling virtues; concluding thus: <hi>Hoc videmus accidere Antimonio, curat Leprosos, Morpheam, Alopeciam &amp;
similia, Scabies omnes, &amp; Cicatrices, Leoninam, Elephantiam, Tiriam,
&amp;c. Et iterum, Antimonium lepram expellit, magis quam de ipso cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibile
sit, non secus etiam de aliis intelligendum.</hi> This we see to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in Antimony, it cureth Leprosie, cleareth the Complexion,
stayeth the falling of the Hair, cureth Ring-worms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tetters, and scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness
of the Skin, all Scabs and spreading Sores, and all contagious
and infectious Diseases. And again afterwards, Antimony expelleth
the Leprosie more effectually than would be believed, the like ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it hath against other desperate Diseases.</p>
               <p>And in the third book, pag. 343. <hi>Antimonium nihil sinit putrescere:</hi>
Antimony suffereth nothing to corrupt or putrifie within the body
of man. And in the fourth book, pag. 265. <hi>Antimonium per trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutationes
rerum preparatum est, eoque reductum ut in dulcedinem
abjerit, haec ab infantibus lincta, Caeducum sanavit, in Antimonio vis ac
tam potens Arcanum latet, ut paroxysmum etiam vehementissimum
tollit:</hi> Antimony is so to be prepared, and brought to that sweetness
that it may be taken of Infants, and have been thereby cured of the
falling sicknesse; there is so great virtue and power in Antimony,
that it taketh away, and preventeth the most extremest fits of the
Falling-sickness, <hi>Paracels. lib. 4. pag.</hi> 265.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore, he in the sixth book, pag. 146. saith,</hi> Sic ut Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
finit Aurum, sic eadem ratione ac forma finit corpus: In illo enim
est essentia, quae nihil impuri cum puro confundi sinit, atquo adeò vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
permanserit, ita ut sese ex influentia semper dirigat, neque aliquid
de vi; ac virtute nativa unquam decesserit. Merito igitur omnia, quae
<pb facs="tcp:54910:6"/>
mineralium sunt, quorum summum ac potissimum Arcanum in se clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
Antimonium, huic uni tribuimus, mundat seipsum una eum reliquis
quae immunda sunt, porro si nihil omninò sani adest, immundum corpus
in mundum transformat: Lib. 6. De vita longa, pag. 146.</p>
               <p>Like as Antimony refineth Gold, so also by the same reason and
manner it purifieth the body of man: In it there is that essence that
suffereth no impurity nor uncleanesse to remaine confusedly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
amongst the pure and good, and his virtues so constantly
remaineth, directing himselfe alwayes according to the heavenly
influence, that of his naturall virtue and power, he shall at no
time suffer losse or diminution thereof. Worthily therefore doe
we attribute to this alone, the power and virtue of all Minerals,
whose chiefe and most powerfull secret effects, Antimony compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
in it selfe alone, he refineth himself, and purifieth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with it selfe, what he findeth unclean: moreover, though
he finde nothing sound he altereth and changeth that impure body
to a clean and sound constitution: <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. And to conclude, <hi>Essentia
Antimonii est purgatio vera, quae purgat hominem excellentissimè super
alia quaevis Arcana, radicitus evellit auferendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ac omne quod immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
est: humanum corpus in supremum usque sanationis gradum pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
efficit, ac ab omnibus aegritudinibus mundat, etiam illis ex quibus
oriuntur ulcera; quicquid penes hominem fuerint impuri delet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The essence of Antimony is a true and naturall purge, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
a man most excellently above all other secrets, it utterly taketh
away by the root whatsoever is foule, unwholsome, and ought to be
removed, and reduceth the body of man to the highest degree of
perfect health, and cleanseth from all manner infirmities and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
even from those that are the originall and fountain of ulcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and dangerous diseases, it fully and freely removeth all corrupt
and impure humours, that might lye lurking within any part of
the body of man. Thus farre <hi>Paracelsus</hi> in his lesser Chyrurgery,
<hi>pag.</hi> 323.</p>
               <p>My second testimony shall be <hi>Martinus Rulandus,</hi> a man of sound
judgement, great practice and experience, he called the infusion of
this Cup his <hi>Aqua benedicta,</hi> in the 5. Cent. and the 95. Cure he
saith thus.</p>

               <p>It is received by the consent and common opinion of all Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Philosophers, that the <hi>Magnesia</hi> of <hi>Saturne,</hi> which they call

the infusion or tincture thereof purgeth black blood and choller,
and every corrupt humour, and that both by manifest evacuation
and correction of evill humours: It helpeth against all obstructions
of the Liver, and of the Spleen; disperseth the Dropsie; cureth the
Jaundise; procureth cheerfulnesse and gladnesse of the heart; resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Leprous to perfect health, and is the best preservative of the
lungs: It is a perfect and effectuall cure for <hi>Morbus Gallicus;</hi> and
the chiefest secret against Leprosie, for that nothing is found to be
more excellent against that foule disease: It rectifieth the Spleen;
asswageth the griefes of the Mother; procureth the monthly tearms;
preserveth and increaseth Nature in strength; cureth the Morphew;
healeth the Scurvy; expelleth both black and yellow choller out of
the body; breaketh and expelleth the stone: purgeth the head and
brain; helpeth against the falling sicknesse, and al convulsions:
and, to conclude; It is a chief and an excellent Medicine against all
desperate and dangerous diseases. Thus far <hi>Duncanus.</hi>

                           <p>MAster <hi>Evans,</hi> that you may see that I am not unmindfull of
my Promise made unto you, touching my knowledge of the
Virtues of the Magneticall or Antimoniall Cup, I have sent these
few lines unto you, not taking upon me to set forth the full and
true worth and excellent Virtues of the same, lest by seeking to
set them forth to the life, I should by my unskillfull handling of an
unaccustomed pencill, deface the same, neither can I, neither am I
willing to certifie the parties names that I have cured therewith,
both because they are so many, and also because I will not wrong
those grave and learned Doctors that had them in hand before they
came to me and failed to cure them, only I will impart unto you
my opinion of the Magneticall or Antimoniall Cup, and what
Cures I have done with it. The liquor of the Cup I call that, the wine
in which it hath been infused, if it be duely prepared observing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
times will work incredible cures, working either upwards or
downwards according to the constitution &amp; time it is made, &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is a secret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of great use to them that will practice that
<pb facs="tcp:54910:11"/>
kinde of Physick; It expels all noysome and superabounding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
it strengthneth Nature, and whether it work or work not,
it never hurts (which is contrary to all other Physick) for if that
other materiall substantiall feculent Physick remain and lye within
the body, it will indanger it. It is the most precious thing that any
man can have, whether hee be rich or poor, for by it a man shall
preserve Health, procure Health, and prevent Sicknesse, both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and Family, both old and young, and cost him but a little, the
fourtieth part of a Doctors fee, the value of 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and if there were no
other Virtues in it than hath been spoken, this were sufficient to
commend it: The cures that I have done with it, are truly more than
I can recall to memory; for I have not refused any (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Disease he or they were troubled or infected with) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Ulcers and running Soars, which require also the Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
help as well as the Physitian, and often times both are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make a perfect Cure. Some of those Soars have passed my
hands, not many: I have cured all manner of Head-aches, Frensies,
and Madness, the Pestilentiall and the Spotted Fever, the Quotidian
Tertian, and Intermittent Agues, the Falling-sicknesse, the foul (or
French) Disease, the Convulsions, which were thought to be witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the Mother, the yellow and the black Jaundice, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
that is not too far gone, given ease and prevented the
Stone, given ease and prevented the Gout: I have cured divers
of Impostumes, I bless God for his goodnesse and great mercy
vouchsafed to me; I have given it to more than a thousand (since
I began to practice with it) and I never heard of any that miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
nor of ten in all that number that I failed to cure; I have
given it to men and women of fourscore years old, to sucking
Children, to women with Child, and never any miscarried, but all
have received benefit by it, blessed be God that gives such varieties
of virtues to so slender a means; I am verily perswaded that there
is no Disease that this will not cure, being rightly prepared, given,
and followed, I must confesse I cannot sufficiently praise it, nor give
it any fit value or estimable rate, it exceeding the Gold of Ophire
as much as Health doth Sickness; with this I will conclude: It pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
and purifieth the Body from all superfluous and praeternaturall
Blood, Phlegme, Choler, and Melancholy, and maketh the body
vigorous, strong, and lusty. What I have written is not by relation
<pb facs="tcp:54910:11"/>
from others, but from my own experience, and to give satisfaction
to your desires, that have taken so much pains, both in the making
of the Magneticall Cup, and in setting forth the Virtues thereof
most truly, yet short, in truth, of what it hath; <hi>So I conclude, and
rest your well wishing friend,</hi>

done by your Magneticall Cup, and the more perfect use of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by daily experience: And now giving God the Glory, and
you many thanks for the Cures wrought by my Cup (the Childe
of your happy Invention, I thought good to acquaint you that
there came to my house a poor begger woman of the parish of S.
<hi>Paul</hi> about the age of 44. years, and at my doore fell into a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fit of the falling sicknes and continued long in that fit: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fit was past, and she began to recollect her sences; by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
with her, I found that her disease had continued on her
three or four years, and that she much desired to take any thing
that would ease her, and that her fits sometimes took her twice in
<pb facs="tcp:54910:13"/>
one day, here upon I gave her the next morning white Wine orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
according to your direction, and it wrought effectually with
her, and neither that day nor the day following wherein shee
took not the Cup had she any fit or the least symptome of it, the
third day I gave it her again, but then it wrought not with her
neither upwards nor downwards, but onely by sweat, but sithence
the first time of the taking of it, she hath not had any one fit, which
is now a quarter of a year past, and now she goes to her daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as she was wont to doe; once of late I caused her to take it
againe to prevent a relapsing into the former griefe, but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that she is perfectly cured. Another young man aged 28
or 30 years, of mine own parish being much troubled with that
griefe hath by the use of your Cup (God blessing the means) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered his wonted health: And now lately one <hi>John
Heckes</hi> a Souldier at <hi>Pendinas</hi> Castle neer <hi>Penrynne,</hi> who for three
or foure, or more years was taken so ill, as he had a continuall
hysking and stopping of his breath, &amp; was not able to goe without a
staffe and that to his great pain, and was by as many as daily saw him
thought to be in a deep Consumption and not to be recovered by
Physick, intreated me to send him Wine prepared in this Cup,
which I did, and he took it twice according to your direction, and
within two or three dayes after the taking of it, recovered his
health, used no more his staffe, but grew to such jollity of strength
as that he was able to cary and mannage his Musket, and doth now
serve in his armes, and doe his duty as ably as any Souldier in that
Castle: Many other helpes this Cup hath done to divers that have
made use of it, I pray God to blesse you in the well composing of
many more such Cups, and to continue his blessings upon those
you doe compose, to the health of such his servants as shall make use
of them; thus tendering unto you my hartiest love, thanks and
well wishes, I rest your assured loving friend.</p>

the Medicinall Virtues I have, upon experience, found to be in
your Antimoniall Cup, which I doe most willingly, in regard of
the great good I, and mine, have found by the benefit of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I desire the generall good of others also; it being great pitty
that so precious a Medicine should be kept secret, that may doe so
much good, with so little Cost: I have made great use of it upon
my self, my wife, children and servants, I have given of the Wine
or Liquor prepared to many of my friends, and at their intreaty to
divers other strangers; And I did never know by my own observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or experience, or hear from any other that did take it, but
that they using it (and themselves, after the taking of it) as was and
is prescribed; found very much good by it, let their Disease
or Grief be what it would: so that I doe verily believe that it doth
truly deserve that title, <hi>The Vniversall Medicine,</hi> or a Medicine
for all Diseases, neither can I in Words give it the due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it deserveth. A Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> a friend of mine came to
me and told me he had a daughter of twelve years of age, which
was very much troubled with a Disease called the Scurvy, insomuch
that some of her teeth were fallen out, her leggs and other parts
of her body were exceedingly swelled, neither did they after
<pb facs="tcp:54910:15"/>
much Physick find any amendment in her, unto whom the prepared
Liquor of this Cup was given twice, resting one day between; it
wrought well with her, and a wonderfull effect immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereupon; for within four dayes she was perfectly Cured: her
loose teeth were all fastened; her legs and other parts of her body
were restored to their naturall proportion again; and she was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
freed from her Scurvy Disease. Another friend that had been
for a long time troubled with an Ague and the Green sicknesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which was grown so faint with it, that she was not able to
goe; it helped perfectly at once taking. Some speciall properties I
have observed in it, which makes me to esteem of it very much, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the safety and gentlenesse of the Medicine in its operation; for it
may be given to young Children without danger, as I have my self
often times proved upon my own Children of three and four yeers
of age; from whose Stomacks it hath brought such foul corrupt
matter, that I could not have believed them to have been troubled
withall, had I not seen it; It never straineth the body with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
violence that other vomits doe: for this worketh his effects
with great facility, gentleness, and safety, and also with incredibl ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
commonly upon the first or second taking: I have seen won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
good effects done by it, and Diseases that have been of long
continuance speedily and perfectly Cured therewith.</p>

                           <p>AT my first bringing down of this Cup, having a friend of mine
about 15. years of age, who had for four or five years before
<pb facs="tcp:54910:16"/>
been fore troubled with the Falling-sicknesse, and could not by any
means of Physick or otherwise be Cured: My wife made tryall of
this Cup, and gave to this young man the infusion thereof in white
Wine; and he was perfectly Cured without ever having any one fit
sithence: which I conceive to be a Cure beyond all the ordinary
practice of Physick, for although we used the opinion and help
of divers Doctors and others professing skill in that cure, yet the
Child was never the better untill he had this cup. Secondly, my
wife finds by continuall experience, that it is a present cure for the
Head-ache, the temples of the Head being bathed with the Liquor
of this Cup warm. Thirdly, there was a violent Disease in the
Countrey and Town where I dwell, which to many proved mortall
(a pestilent Fever or the like) but my wife hath given the infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Cup in white Wine to many of her neighbours that have
been sick of the same Disease, and none of them that had taken it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perished but recovered perfectly. Fourthly, at my comming
home, after Ester Tearm, I finde my wife dressing a poor Servants
Foot in the Town, one of his Toes having a foul Fistula in it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
for a whole yeer before; and it was so corrupted, that all her
Salves and Powders could doe no good at all; in so much that she
said, She was now out of hope to cure it, and therefore would now
give him over: but I advised her first to try the Liquor of the Cup,
which she had not before tryed in Chyrurgerie, and upon my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
and intreaty, she did so; doing nothing at all to it, but wash it
with the Infusion made with white Wine, and squirt the ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

cured. Fifthly, after this, she cured a Gyrl of two Fistulaes in
her Elbows, which had continued for four or five years before, and
had much weakned and wasted her arms: this Maid was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cured only with washing and cleansing the sores, and Syring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Liquor of this Cup warm, without applying any thing
else to the Sores, having used all other common means before, but
could get no help. Sixthly, another poor man came to my
house with a sore hand mightily swelled, and infinitely painfull to
<pb facs="tcp:54910:16"/>
him, so that he could doe no manner of labor, and his wife and
children were ready to starve, or to goe abroad on begging, living
before only upon the poore mans labor: my wife taking pitty and
compassion upon the poore man, bathed his hand with hot liquor
of white-Wine prepared in this Cup, a good while together about
half an hour, and a wet cloath being laid upon it, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it broke, and within one fortnight was perfectly cured. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
again another poore woman being strucken with a Cows
horn as she was in milking, and her cheek sore wounded, was with
the water of this Cup perfectly cured within one moneth at the
most. Eightly, I have heard my Lady <hi>Jackson</hi> affirme that she
having one of these Cups bought of Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> used it to a poore
woman that was brought to her, so drawn up with Convulsions,
that she had the use neither of her Legs nor Armes, neverthelesse
within short time she was perfectly cured by taking the Liquor
of the Cup inwardly, and bathing with it outwardly: these I doe
affirm as remarkable cures of my own observation, but I verily
believe that a quire of Paper will not containe the cures and helps
that my Wife hath performed unto, and upon poore people, and
to other in the Country since she had it, with the alone prepared
Liquor of this Cup. I may truly affirm that there hath not been
a day or night this twelve moneths sithence the Virtues of this
Cup was known in the Country, but it hath been still neere unto
the fire with Liquor in it both night and day, and the Strength and
Virtues of it still continues without any abatement at all: Thus
much I have written in my thankfulnesse to God for the help this
young man hath received by your happy Invention, and for your
better incouragement to proceed in the well compounding and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these Antimoniall Cups, verily believing that the true use of it
is more available for the health of mens bodies than all the Drugs in
London, so I conclude and rest your assured friend.</p>

            <head>A true Relation of one hundred Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Experiments and Rare Cures, performed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
severall Persons, of severall Constitutions, Infirmed
with divers and severall Infirmities and diseases, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to perfect health, by the alone Vse and Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Virtues thereof; faithfully collected
for the confirmation of this Truth.</head>
            <p>A Noble Lady descended of (and married into) an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
family, that for a long time had been dangerously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with the obstructions of the Spleen, terrible fits and suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Mother, and withall deeply plunged with Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and by the judgements of many Doctors of Physick, not to be
recovered by Physicall helps, was afterwards within a short time
recovered to perfect health by drinking the alone prepared infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Cup, and is yet praise be to God, living in good health,
and will affirme this for an approved and certain truth.</p>
            <p>2. In the Cittie of <hi>London</hi> a certain Gentleman of good quality,
that was far spent with a languishing and health-destroying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and after much Physick taken, forsaken and left reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse
by the Physitians, was within a few daies restored to his
health, and strength, and naturall vigour, by drinking the infusion
of this Cup, prepared and administred in Ale.</p>
            <p>3. A certain young Gentlewoman living in the Citty of <hi>Chester,</hi>
being strangly taken with violent Convulsion fits, that she could
hardly by the strength of four Assistants, at the time of her extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
be kept in her bed, so that many (mistakingly) apprehended
her miserable distemperature to have been occasioned through
witchcraft, and to be remedilesse by Physick, was notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by the speciall blessing of God upon this Medicine, restored to
temperate constitution and good health, by drinking the infusion
of this Cup.</p>
            <p>4. A Countrey woman mightily swelled with Hydropicall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
and her legs of such incredible bignesse; that by reason of the
extraordinary repletion and fulnesse of humors continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in such great aboundance, that being brought into a fair Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb facs="tcp:54910:18"/>
the moisture that ran from her legs wet the boarded floore,
as if water had been there spilled in good quantity, neverthelesse
taking the infusion of this Cup: within four daies she was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured and restored to her former health.</p>
            <p>5. A poore man living within twelve miles of <hi>Chyrke Castle</hi> in
<hi>Denbigh-shire,</hi> that for six moneths, together had not after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
manner performed the duties of Nature, being sore troubled
with a grieveous Infirmity called <hi>Miserere</hi> or <hi>Iliaca passio:</hi> whereby
the excrementitious impurities of the body were loathsomly eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at the mouth, contrary to the naturall order, was perfectly
cured by drinking three or four times the prepared infusion of this
Cup without any other help.</p>
            <p>6. A Certain Gentlewoman, that for many years had continued
Remedilesse and comfortlesse, extreamly afflicted with violent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
frenzie, and madnes, through the goodnesse of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the medicinall virtues of this Cup, by drinking the Infusion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
was speedily restored to health, perfect sences, memory and
understanding: these six receited Experiments and rare Cures with
many hundreds more, were performed by my much honored wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
friend the Right worshipfull Sir <hi>Thomas Mydelton</hi> Knight.</p>
            <p>7. A young Gentleman about 15 years of age that had for four
or five years before, been sore troubled with the Falling sicknesse,
and could not by any meanes of common Phisick or otherwise be
Cured, was perfectly Cured, and freed from the violence of that
cruell disease by drinking the Infusion of this Cup: without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
help.</p>
            <p>8. It is found by continuall Experience; that it is a present cure
for the Head-ache, the temples of the head being bathed with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of the Cup warme.</p>
            <p>9. At <hi>Knottingley</hi> in the County of <hi>York</hi> in the year 1636.
there was a generall raging and cruell sicknesse, a pestilentiall Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or the like, whereof very many died: the infusion of this Cup
rightly prepared and adminstred to many severall deseased persons,
not any one that ever took it perished or miscarried, but recovered
perfectly.</p>
            <p>10. In the same Town of <hi>Knottingley,</hi> avirtuous godly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
cured a poore servants foot, having in one of his toes
a foule fistula, of a whole years continuance wherein there was 5
<pb facs="tcp:54910:18"/>
holes, five tents put therein continually, and one of the holes quite
through: which Fistulated sore foot could not be cured by the best
skill, Salves and Powders of the common Chyrurgeons, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one moneth perfectly cured with the alone prepared Liquor of
this Cup.</p>
            <p>11. The same right worshipfull Gentlewoman, cured a young
maiden of two Fistulaes, one in either of her elbows, which had
continued four or five yeers before, which had much weakned and
wasted her arms; she was perfectly and speedily cured, by using the
alone infusion of this Cup; having used all means before, and could
get no help.</p>
            <p>12. In the same Town a poor man came to this Gentlewoman
with a sore hand mightily swelled, and infinitely painfull to him, so
that he could doe no manner of labor: His hand being bathed with
the infusion of this Cup, the next morning it broke and run abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
and within one fortnight, by the use of this infusion alone,
his hand was perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>13. A certain poor woman was brought to the right honoured
Ladie, the Ladie <hi>Jackson,</hi> so drawn up and her sinews contracted
with Convulsions, that she had not the use either of Legs, Arms, Feet,
or Hands, notwithstanding she was by the said Lady perfectly cured
and restored to strength, health, and able use of her former benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
limbs, by the alone infusion of this Cup.</p>
            <p>14. Another poor woman being struck with a Cows horn as
she was in milking, and her cheek sore wounded; was, by only wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sores with the Liquor of the Cup, perfectly and speedily
cured. These eight last recited experiments are certified to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
truth, by the right worshipfull M. <hi>John Grymsdych</hi> of <hi>Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingley,</hi>
Esquire.</p>
            <p>15. A certain man about 30 years of age, troubled for 9 years
before with the Disease called the Kings evill, and much consumed
and weakned therewith, was perfectly cured of that Disease, by the
use of the infusion of this Cup. M. <hi>Humfrey Guntur,</hi> Esquire, living
neer <hi>Newberry,</hi> performed this with many other very rare cures.</p>
            <p>16. In <hi>Wallingford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> Daughter of the <hi>George,</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured of the Kings-Evill with the infusion thereof, although
it was broken out into very many dangerous and Ulcerous sores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her neck and face. Mr. <hi>William Mollins,</hi> Esq; who lent them
<pb facs="tcp:54910:19"/>
his Cup wherewith they cured this patient, of that sore disease,
testifieth this.</p>
            <p>17. In <hi>Mortelake</hi> neer <hi>Richmond</hi> a Gentleman of good worth
and reputation now liveth, spent very far with a long continued
languishing Consumption: and at length left remedilesse, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
by many Doctors and Physitians, was afterwards perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to good health, appetite, digestion, and healthfull constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of body, by drinking the infusion of this Cup three times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prepared in Ale: witnesse hereunto M. <hi>Humfrey Benet,</hi> Esquire.</p>
            <p>18. In <hi>Barnet</hi> ten miles from <hi>London,</hi> a certain poor man distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with extream Frensie and Madness, to whom M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Baker</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Town, administred in good and sufficient quantity of the
Liquor of this Cup, a pinte (of Ale) at a time, for three times: It
caused him to vomit, and to purge plentifully, and fell a bleeding at
the nostrills and bled well, stayed of it self; the patient slept, and
perfectly recovered, and remaineth well, praise to God.</p>
            <p>19. In the same Town upon a Market day, a poor Country man
was strucken very deep into the leg by a raging Boar, and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his crooked tushes, rented, tore, and bruised the flesh very sore;
neverthelesse being dressed with the infusion of this Cup, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and speedily healed up without any other help.</p>
            <p>20. Also in the same Town, a certain young maiden being all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the body full of loathsome Biles, Botches, and scabbed Blains
from the Crown to the foot, by taking the infusion of this Cup she
was speedily cured, and her body perfectly purged and cleansed and
she avoided at her mouth divers worms, whereof one was of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creedible
bignesse, proportion, and form: and now she is in good
health and fair of complexion.</p>
            <p>21. Another Gentlewoman in the same Town, having many
swelling or rising kernels of sanguine blew and other variable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
as big as Nutmegs arising upon her cheek and neck: With the
application and drinking of this infusion they speedily consumed
and vanished away, and the Gentlewoman remaineth perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>22. Another woman living not far from the same Town being
lame of her hands, knees, and feet, and not able to stand or goe, and
brought into Mrs. <hi>Kings</hi> house in a chair by the strength of men, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the infusion of this Cup, within four dayes she was perfectly
<pb facs="tcp:54910:19"/>
recovered so that she was able to goe home to her own house on
foot, being two or three miles distant off. These five last experiments
were don with many more, by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>King, alias Barker</hi> living in <hi>Barnet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. A Merchants Daughter in <hi>London</hi> very much troubled with
a Disease called the Scurvy, whereby some of her teeth were fallen
out, her legs and body exceedingly swelled, and she in great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of pain; and finding no amendment by all the former means
they had used; by taking the infusion of this Cup three times she
was perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>24. An ancient Gentlewoman living neer <hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> having for
many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeers complained of an intollerable pain of the head, fell sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
dangerous sick and deaf, and all her face and nose mightily
swelled. By externall bathing the temples and other parts of her
head and face grieved, an Impostume broke in her head and purged
through her nostrils in such great abundance, that it was much to be
admired, that so much corrupt yellow thick matter could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in such a continent, her body also throughly purged by the
externall bathing, and she is now perfectly recoverd, and liveth in
good health, able to justifie this to be true.</p>
            <p>25. At <hi>Wildertop,</hi> in the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> in the house of Mr.
<hi>Francis Smalman,</hi> Esquire, a young Gentlewoman being much
troubled with oppilations and obstructions and suffocations of the
Matrix, whereby she fell into many dangerous &amp; desperate swound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fits, and at length grew to that weaknesse, that she had many
signes of apparent and imminent death; upon whom the infusion of
this Cup was inforced in small quantity, which wrought well and
gave some hopes: and after administred twice more; recovered the
said Gentlewoman to such perfect health, that within eight dayes
she travelled safely to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. An ancient Gentlewoman, that for many years was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled with such intollerable painfullnesse of the Gout in the
joynts of the Back-bone, in the Huckle-bone, and in the Knees, and
Feet, that she could neither stand nor stir her self any way; nor
scarcely suffer to be removed from her Bed to her Chair. By exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
bathing the grieved parts with (and drinking) the prepared Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of this Cup, she was perfectly cured; and able within four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
dayes to go up &amp; down the stairs and the house, and to doe any
necessary businesse with as much agility and nimblenesse as any in the
<pb facs="tcp:54910:20"/>
same Town of her years; and hath so continued perfectly well for
eight years past.</p>
            <p>27. In the same Town a certain young woman much troubled
with inflamations of the Lungs, and with foul Impostumations full
of rotten corrupt putrifactions; with drinking the prepared liquor
of this Cup thrice, was perfectly recovered and restored to sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of health.</p>
            <p>28. Another young woman that for a long time had been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with a Quartan Ague, and a species of the Fever Hectick, and
remaining, after much and long use of many Medicines, without
help or hope; was perfectly cured by drinking three or four times
the prepared Liquor of this Cup. These eight last recited experiments
were done by Mrs. <hi>King, allas Barker,</hi> living in <hi>Barnet</hi> ready to
confirm this to be true.</p>
            <p>29. A certain young woman living in <hi>Leicester,</hi> very far spent
with a Fever Hectick, or rather a consuming Marasmos; her body
so foul, and full of rotten and corrupt putrifractions, that her breath
and spittle was so noysome and offensive, that none would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indure to be in the same room with her: Was neverthelesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and speedily cured, by drinking the prepared Liquor of this
Cup, without any other help.</p>
            <p>30. An ancient Gentleman living in or neer <hi>Leicester,</hi> for many
yeers was extreamly tormented with the Stone in the Kidnies, with
excoriations and exulcerations of the bladder, sharp distillations of
Urine, and impostumations of the Lungs, after much Physick taken
without help, ease, or comfort; was perfectly and speedily cured
by the alone drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup: and such
great store of foul corrupt matter diuretically expelled that would
not be credited, should the very truth be delivered.</p>
            <p>31. Another young maiden living within two miles of <hi>Leceister,</hi>
much troubled with oppilations and obstructions of the Spleen, and
inflamations of her Liver, her complexion utterly impaired with
foul Morphew and yellownesse; was perfectly and speedily restored
to fair complexion and healthfull constitution, by drinking three
times the prepared Liquor of this Cup.</p>
            <p>32. A certain Gentlewoman, that for many years together was
taken often times with the Apoplexy, or Paraplegia, which is a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
retention and losse of motion and speech for many hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:54910:20"/>
whereby her health was much impaired, her Stomack, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
and digestion lost, her naturall constitution heat and vigor of
body impaired, having many years followed the chargable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
of professed Doctors, without helpe, hope, or comfort;
neverthelesse praised be to God was firmly and perfectly recovered
by the alone use of the prepared liquor of this Cup.</p>
            <p>33. The Minister of great <hi>Peately</hi> in <hi>Leicester</hi> shire, being farr
spent with a deep health-destroying Consumption, and so much
stopped with Astmaticall Oppillations, Stuffings and Whiskings of
the Lungs that he could not officiate his Cure, and so certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
for a dead man, that another procured a presentation to
the same Church; having also used all the common and usuall
course of Physick, without help or benefit, was speedily and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered to perfect health, and sufficient ability to discharge
his Ministeriall function, by the alone use of the prepared Liquor
of this Cup.</p>
            <p>34. In the same Citty and County of <hi>Leicester</hi> another man that
for many years had been mnch oppressed with repletions, of corrupt
humors, tough flegme, languishing putrifactions, which wasted and
consumed away his body and estate by long use of Physick, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
restored to health and avoided more than 40. worms of most
strange, almost incredible, bignesse by the alone prepared liquor
of this Cup.</p>
            <p>35. A certain young maiden that was wholly affected to feed
upon unhealthfull trash, as Earth, Clay of the wall, Chalk and the
like, and therewith had destroyed the good estate and Constitution
of her body, and could not be withdrawn from her unhealthfull and
unnaturall longings, was neverthelesse speedily weined from her
desires, and perfectly restored to naturall and kindly appetite, to due
digestion, and to a healthfull Constitution and fair complection by
drinking the Liquor of this Cup.</p>
            <p>36. A certain grosse fat woman, whose body was much swelled
with Hydropicall humors, and full of impure and corrupt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
repletions and her bones, sinews and arteries continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with restles and intollerable painfulnesse, and having used
the chargefull but unprofitable prescriptions of professed Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
without either help or any mittigation of her intollerable
painfulnesse: was speedily recovered to perfect health, and
<pb facs="tcp:54910:21"/>
freed from all grossnesse and painfullnesse, by the use of this Cup.</p>
            <p>37. A certain Gentleman in the County of <hi>Leicester</hi> afflicted in
every particular as the precedent Patient; was speedily &amp; perfectly
restored, by 3 or 4 times drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup.</p>
            <p>38. A certain Gentleman, living also in, or neer, the City of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
having been a great company keeper with Gentlemen of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and therefore brought to much grossnesse of body, inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and plentitude of foul hot and corrupt blood, fell suddainly
into a dangerous Plurisie: and taking the Liquor of this Cup, it
wrought immediately and sensibly upon that side principally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
purified and allayed the heat, and dispersed the blood; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
much blood by the Nostrils; and expelled by siedge much
clotted and corrupt blood, and other foul excrementitious impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the whole body; and was speedily and perfectly restored to
his health with this help alone.</p>
            <p>39. Another Gentleman of the same County, that had been for
certain years grievously infected with <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> being a most
foul and dangerous Disease, having many Ulcerous sores running
upon severall parts of his body, and many hard scirrhus Bubones, and
swelling kernels in the severall emunctories of his body; and his
Bones, Arteries, and inward parts full of continuall aches, dolors,
and intollerable painfullnesse, and utterly forsaken as remedilesse by
the common Physitians: Neverthelesse by bathing the hard places
and drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, he was speedily and
perfectly restored to health and sound constitution of Body.</p>
            <p>40. A certain woman also living neer the City of <hi>Leicester</hi> that
had received hurt through the neglect or unskillfullness of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
at the time of her Childing, and therewith brought to much
weakness and Consumption of her whole body, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the common course of Physick, she remained a long time cureless,
drinking the prepared Liquor of the Cup, she was perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>41. Another woman that was house-keeper to a Gentleman of
good estimation in the City of <hi>Leicester</hi> mightily afflicted with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and strong Convulsions, that she was drawn or plucked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in two fold, and sometimes extorted or plucked awry towards
the one side, and her face set nigh back, by the strength and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this strange Convulsion; it was commonly taken for the work
of Witchcraft, and after much practice of Physians she was left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medilesse:
<pb facs="tcp:54910:21"/>
by externall bathing and drinking the prepared Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of this Cup she was perfectly Cured.</p>
            <p>42. A certain young Gentlewoman, receiving upon her breast a
most violent stroak by the elbow of a passionate displeased Father,
by the suddain bursting or wrongfull contusion of certain veines, the
naturall course of the blood became stopped, and flowed in great
abundance both at the Mouth, at the Nostrils, and at the Eares, and
so continued bleeding more or lesse (and at the Monthly times in
greater abundance) for a whole year or more, and neither the
Chyrurgeons blood-letting, nor the best experiments of the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
could any thing at all prevaile or profit, to stop or remedy this
continuall and daily flux of blood; it much weakned the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
her strength and naturall vigor failed, her Stomack, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
and digestion became lost, the fair Constitution and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body was changed to a deadly paleness, the whol body to a
manifest desperate hastening Consumption: when all other charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and costly means failed, the Lord made it his own proper work
to restore this Gentlewoman to perfect health, and her whol body
to naturall order and good constitution, by alone drinking, (and
externall application) the prepared Liquor of this Cup: these 14
last recited wonderfull and admirable Cures were all accordingly
effectually performed in Christian piety and friendly neighborhood
by my much esteemed dear friend Mr. <hi>William Palmer</hi> dwelling
within two miles of the Citty of <hi>Leicester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>43. A certain maiden through want of her naturall monethly
purgations, became extreamly swelled all the body over, and had
also in the right breast, neck and arm-pit, certain kernels and hard
tumors, and all her left arme was altogether benummed and conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in such sort that she had not any use or strength thereof, and
had also followed the prescriptions of many Physitians, with the
applications of many seare-cloths emplaisters and unguents; but all
without any benefit. By the externall bathing and drinking the
prepared Liquor of this Cup, her monethly terms came orderly and
her whole body in every particular was perfectly and speedily Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Witnesse Mrs. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Barnet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>44. In the Citty of <hi>London</hi> neer Algate, a certain young woman
extreamly taken with the dead Palsie, in all the parts of her body,
that she could neither stand, nor stirr, nor move any one finger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:54910:22"/>
helping of her self, and so had continued for 18. monthes.
And although no means was neglected that the practice and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Doctors and Apothecaries could prescribe, yet she was
still helpless: But by bathing and drinking the prepared Liquor of
this Cup, she was perfectly restored to her limbs, that within 14.
daies she came to the Church on foot without help or supportment
of any, to the great admiration and wonder of all the neighbours,
that knew well how she had been taken, and how recovered.</p>
            <p>46. A certain Gentlewoman that for eight or ten years had been
continually tormented with most violent and intollerable fits of the
Mother, and retention of the menstruous, accompanied also with
most cruell Convulsions, and extortments of the severall parts of
the body, in such miserable and intollerable manner that all that saw
her (as well Physitians, whose costly prescriptions she fully and
punctually experienced without any help, ease, or comfort, as also
many others) conceived that her intollerable excruciaments and
extream violent fits were beyond the common effects of naturall
causes, and that they were done by Witch-craft and by the malice
of the Devill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some were wrongfully suspected to have practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
witch-craft and inchantment upon the same Gentlewoman:
neverthelesse by drinking and bathing with the prepared Liquor
of this Cup, she was perfectly recovered, and her body brought to
naturall purgations, and healthfull Constitution in every commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
respect, and so remaineth perfectly well praise be to God.</p>
            <p>47. Within 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miles of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> an ancient man that had been
for seven or eight years grievously troubled with a foul invetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Cough of the Lungs, and much spitting of noysome corrupt
matter, and so much infeebled therewith that he was scarce able
to walk about with the help of a staffe, having also upon him many
ulcerous sores and foul Scabs, the remains of a confirmed <hi>Morbus
Gallicus,</hi> which wasted and consumed his body: By bathing and
cleansing the foul sores to the bottome, and by drinking the Liquor
of this Cup prepared, he was perfectly Cured.</p>
            <p>48. In <hi>Barke</hi> shire neer <hi>Sherefield</hi> Court, a certain woman being
taken with Congelation or sudden lameness of her whole body, and
constrained thereby to keep her bed continually for two years or
more without any help or remedy, although she experimented
the skill of many, as well Physitians as others: by drinking the
<pb facs="tcp:54910:22"/>
prepared Liquor of this Cup, and bathing all the grieved parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
She speedily and perfectly recovered her health, strength and
agility of her congealed limbs, that within fourteen dayes she came
on foot seven miles, to render thanks, and to acknowledge the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
she had received.</p>
            <p>49. Another ancient Gentleman that for ten years found himself
continually clogged with some heavy and cold oppression about
the Stomack; but being of strong constitution, and withall full of
Law-Suits, did forbear all Physicall helps, till he was suddainly so ill
taken, that he was constrained to take and keep his bed: And then
drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, it brought up abundance
of clottered bruised blood, and other foul stuff, which having stood
but a little space became all a hard jelly, much like to a bruised Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and as thick; and the Gentleman immediately recovered perfect
health.</p>
            <p>50. A certain man bleeding abundantly at the nostrills both night
and day without any or very little intermission, for four or five dayes
together, and could not be stanched by any means that could be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that it was generally thought of all about him, that he would
bleed to death: To whom there was administred of the prepared
Liquor of this Cup, a good draught; the blood immediately stayed,
and although it wrought by vomits and other waies 7. or 8. times,
the blood remained stanched, and the man perfectly recovered:
and this is a wonderfull property and operation that it should thus
stanch blood, whereas in cause of Lunacy, Madness, Frensie, and the
Plurisie, it is confirmed by much experience, that it openeth the
Veins, and causeth to bleed abundantly, both by the Nostrils, at the
mouth and ears, and downwards naturally, both by the menstruall
and hemerodiall Veins. These seven last recited admirable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Cures, are confirmed to be most certain and true by the right
worshipfull <hi>Willam Mollins,</hi> Esquire.</p>
            <p>51. A certain young Gentlewoman having a Fistulated sore leg,
with eight holes of great deepness therein, and much proud flesh
spongy and evill coloured, mounting and swelling up in an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hie and deformed disproportion about the sores; out of all
which eight holes came continually great store of foul thin undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
matter, as also many splints of corrupt and putrified bones came
forth: This sore leg was under the hands of very many Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:54910:23"/>
for three years continually, without hope of cure, and at length
resolved upon to be cut off: Notwithstanding, by bathing, cleansing,
syrindging and drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
humors were purged, the body was cleansed, the bones were
scarified and purified, the dead flesh consumed, and the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Leg perfectly healed sound, without any blemish or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as perfect and as strong as the other: This was done four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years past; and the Gentlewoman hath continued perfect well
ever since, and is in <hi>London</hi> ready to affirm this truth.</p>
            <p>52. A certain Merchants daughter in <hi>London,</hi> troubled with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of the Spleen, and retentions of the Menstrues, taking too
much and over-violent Physick, brought a continuall Flux of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
and diureticall infirmities upon her, which continued three
years, and cast the young Gentlewoman into a deep Consumption.
Shee was perfectly cured by drinking three times the prepared Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of this Cup, having been before two or three years in the course
of Physick, without any help or comfort.</p>
            <p>53. A certain Gentleman troubled with Astmaticall Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Obstructions of the Liver, and of the Spleen, and being full
of tough flegme and other crude corrupt humors, utterly lost the
use of his speech, and following the prescriptions of severall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
neverthelesse remained dumb and speechless for three, if not
four years together, without help or hope of recovery; by alone
drinking the prepared Liquor of my Magneticall Cup, he recovered
his speech and perfect health within fourteen dayes.</p>
            <p>54. In the same Coutrey a certain young married Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
without any deservings of her own, had <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> and
a cruell sore canker in her mouth that had eaten away the <hi>uvula</hi> and
corroded away a great hole in the palate or roof of the mouth, so
that whensoever she drank, it came flowing forth at both her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills,
and her speech was so impaired, that it was well nigh lost: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
by bathing her head, gargasing and cleansing her mouth
with this Liquor, and drinking the same inwardly, the Disease was
overcome, the malignant humor was purged, the blood and Liver
purified and cleansed, the canker in the mouth was healed; and
which I doe admire; new flesh grew and covered all over the palate,
her speech became perfect, and she was throughly cured.</p>
            <p>55. The same course was willingly taken by the Gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:54910:23"/>
her husband, and in few daies he was throughly purged and cleansed
from that foul Disease; and they have both continued perfect well
more than fourteen years past, and the Gentlewoman hath brought
forth six Children sithence, of as fair complexion and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
as any be in that Countrey; a manifest assurance of their
own perfect recovery and freedome from that foul Disease.</p>
            <p>56. A certain Gentlewoman that was most miserably troubled
with that uncomfortable and loathsome infirmity, called <hi>Illiaca pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi>
or <hi>Miserere mei,</hi> so that she could not for many months expell &amp;
purge downward the excrementitious impurities of the body after
the naturall order, but came up at her mouth; to whom the liquor
of this Cup was administred twice without any observable benefit;
but at the third time there was given to her a full pinte of prepared
Ale; and then the Gentlewoman sensibly perceived her bowels
as it were to unrowl and unbinde within her, as though, before,
they had been either twisted about, or cast upon some knot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
she purged plentifully; and with once more drinking of this
prepared Liquor, she perfectly recoverd her former health, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
order and constitution of her body, and hath so remained ever
since.</p>
            <p>57. A certain young man extreamly tormented with most
strange and violent Convulsion fits, that the Physitians not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to remedy the same, gave him over for a bewitched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whose cruell tormenting fits they ascribed to the malice of
the Devill, and to witches, his wicked Agents; was neverthelesse
perfectly cured of his strong and violent fits, by alone drinking the
prepared Liquor of this Cup. These five last recited wonderfull and
rare Cures were performed in Christian and Godly charity, by Mr.
<hi>Chancy</hi> a Reverend and Learned Divine, a Godly Religious pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Preacher.</p>
            <p>58. The Right Honorable, the Countesse of <hi>Leicester,</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
the prepared Liquor of this Cup with safety and good successe
to an Infant of three moneths old (the like hath been done to many
sucking Infants and tender children) against the small Pox, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and spotted Fever; and never any one miscarried, but recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
perfectly of every one of these Diseases.</p>
            <p>59. A certain Gentlewoman being somewhat troubled with the
Strangury, and painfull sharp Distillations (and often times long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb facs="tcp:54910:24"/>
of Urine) took Physick from an ignorant and wicked Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturer,
that gave her poysonfull pills of ill prepared Mercury subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
whereby her body was much swelled, her teeth fell to be loose
and some fell out, all her bowells and internall parts were cruelly
tormented with excrutiations and burning Inflamations; To whom
the Liquor of this Cup was speedily administred; it wrought upon
her gently fourteen dayes; expelled the poyson, purged the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and evill symptomes occasioned by the poyson received, and
perfectly recovered the Gentlewoman, who is very well, and ready
to affirm this truth.</p>
            <p>60. A certain ancient Gentleman prisoner in the Kings Bench.
that for many years together had been grievously troubled with an
inveterate cough, astmaticall stoppings of the Lungs, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isick, tough Flegme, and other foul putrifactive humours;
was speedily and perfectly cured and freed from all the recited evill
affects, by three times drinking the prepared Liquor of this my Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall
Cup, without any other help. These two last recited experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were performed by Mr. <hi>Francis Taylor,</hi> who then was Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the Kings Bench.</p>
            <p>61. An ancient Gentlewoman that for three years together was
continually troubled with a great Flux of the Menstrues, and also of
the whites in great abundance; was by drinking the prepared Liquor
of this Magneticall Cup (and another secret manner of application)
speedily and perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>62. Another ancient Gentlewoman that had for a long time
languished with the Fever Hectick and yellow Jaundice, and other
infirmities, which might (indeed) be esteemed incurable in one of
her years, and was forsaken of the Doctors of Physick, and esteemed
of her neighbours, and of her own husband, to be irrecoverable; who
therefore made then preparation for her Funerall: Neverthelesse
taking but thrice only the prepared Liquor of this Cup, she was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered to health, this was eight years past, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
liveth not far from <hi>Bow-lane</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> ready to confirm
this approved truth.</p>
            <p>63. Another woman aged 66. or thereabouts, being far gone
with the black Jaudice and deep Consumption, and also at the
same time taken with a most violent spotted Fever, and in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all her neighbours esteemed to be past all hope of life, and
<pb facs="tcp:54910:24"/>
also forsaken of the Physitians, neverthelesse by drinking the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Liquor of this Cup, she was recovered, and is yet living in
perfect health, this was also six years past.</p>
            <p>64 In the same house a young Gentlewoman that was much
troubled with the yellow Jaundise, Obstructions both of the Spleen,
and also of the Lungs; was perfectly cured by three times drinking
the prepared Liquor of this Cup. These foure last Experiments,
were Experimentally approved by Mrs. <hi>Goffe</hi> dwelling neer the
Church in <hi>Trinity-lane</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>65. A certain Gentlewoman, having for many years continued
languishing in a deep Consumption, was mightily swelled with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropicall
humors and notwithstanding the best helps of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
esteemed incurable (as all in such an estate are falsly deemed
to be) and so left remedies, was neverthelesse speedily restored
to perfect health, all the Hydropicall corrupt humors quite purged
away, and her liver rectified, good appetite, and a kindly digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
regained, and the naturall vigor and strength of the whole body
effectually restored, by drinking 3. or 4. times the prepared Liquor
of this Cup, without any other help.</p>
            <p>66. Moreover in the Citty of <hi>Worcester</hi> a certain corpulent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
much given to the company of great drinkers was suddainly
caught with a dangerous surfeit, and dead Palsie, lameness of all the
left side; and this Gentleman for many years before had been much
tormented with the painfulness of the Gout, this surfeit brought
also upon him a fierce and a violent burning Fever: this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
used the best helps of the Physitians, but all in vain: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by drinking the prepared Liquor of my Magneticall Cup:
and by bathing the head, back, sides and all the parts troubled with
lameness and painfulness of the Gout, he was recovered to perfect
health and Strength of the whole body. These two last recited expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
with many hundreths more for Agues, Green sickness, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and the like, were performed by my worthy friend Mr.
<hi>Walter Childe,</hi> Esquire.</p>
            <p>67. A certain woman that for 7. or 8. years together had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
suppression of the Menstrues and a very sore Fistula or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ulcer upon her leg, having many sore orifices where from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
came forth much corrupt matter, and her body was also
much swelled with Hydropicall humours, with drinking inwardly
<pb facs="tcp:54910:25"/>
the prepared Liquor of this Cup, and cleansing the ulcerous sores
therewith, the monthly courses brake down kindly upon her, and
purged well, all the swelling was abated, the Ulcerous or Fistulated
leg was perfectly healed: witnesse Mrs. <hi>Alliston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>68. A certain poor man a Brick-layer, living about <hi>Bedford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exceedingly swelled with corrupt and hydropicall humors, and
brought to exceeding weaknesse by a long languishing Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who after much practice made by common Physitians, was left
remedilesse and incurable; notwithstanding by the blessings of God,
drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, he was perfectly restored
to health. Mr. <hi>Thomas Litton,</hi> Esquire, performed this admirable Cure
with many others.</p>
            <p>69. A certain Gentleman of good worth and esteem living

by many judged to be incurable: Neverthelesse by the blessings
of God, and drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, within a

still for five years past. This is testified by Mr. <hi>John Lathum,</hi> Esquire
to be an approved truth.</p>

therein eight holes, wherein eight tents of great length were put in
at times of dressing, and much foul corrupt matter issued therefrom
continually; in began to mortifie, and to look black and dangerous;
and the common Chyrurgeons advised the woman to have that
Breast cut off, for other cure thereof they knew none: Neverthelesse
by syrindging and cleansing the Ulcerous sores to the bottome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tents, and by drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, and
applying externally hot wet clothes to the sore Breast, the swelling
abated, the corrupt matter expurged, and the woman was speedily

the legs and feet, and also with great swelling and painfulnesse in

            <p>81. A poor Mayden living in the same Town, the Daughter of
a poor Widow, having lost the benefit of her sight, occasioned by
<pb facs="tcp:54910:26"/>
over-much coldnesse of the brain, and much buffeting and beating
about the head, but principally caused by long retention of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
(howsoever caused) she was esteemed to be sightless &amp; reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse:
Neverthelesse, by drinking the prepared Liquor of the Cup,
and droping some into the eyes, and bathing the temples, her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
tearms brake down kindly, her head and brain received warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and in lesse than fourteen dayes she recovered both her health
and perfect sight.</p>
            <p>82. Another Gentleman that from his Childhood had much
complained of dimnesse and weaknesse of his sight, especially at any
remote distance, and hardly able to endure the light of a candle, and
continually had such a shuting and pricking in his eyes, as though
sticks had been rowled in them: By drinking three or four times the
prepared Liquor of this Cup, and dropping in his eyes some, allayed
with fountain water; it hath so cleared and strengthned the sight
that this Gentleman being fifty two years of age, can now read and
write by candlelight, without any glasses for six or twelve hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without any trouble or wrong to his sight, which he could
not doe at any time before.</p>

Neverthelesse by drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, he
was speedily and perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>84. In <hi>Walsall</hi> in the same County one <hi>William Day</hi> was so far
spent with a languishing Consumption, and had taken very much
Physick without help or any benefit, and esteemed to be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable;
By drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, he was spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
and perfectly cured. These eight last recited experiments, and,
as it is affirmed, 800. more of severall Diseases, were performed by
one <hi>Benedict Laurence,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Wolverhampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>85. In the same County, and neer unto <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> another
Gentleman was in a desperate Consumption, and extreamly swelled
with hydropicall humors, that no apparell could be had big enough
for him, and his miserable swellings and painfullnesse so great, and
such, that himself and his friends heartily wished his life to be at an
<pb facs="tcp:54910:27"/>
end: Neverthelesse by drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, he

               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
finding his man comming from <hi>London</hi> in the time of Plague, to
have faln sick very suddainly, suspected that he might be infected
with the Pestilence, and therefore speedily prepared the Cup, and
caused his man and himself, and every one of his Family with all
possible expedition, to drink good quantities of the prepared Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
and it wrought effectually upon every one of them, and not
any one of his Houshold miscarried. His man had a great tumor in
his Groin, which by bathing was brought to suppuration, and broke,
and was cleansed with the prepared Liquor, and thereby was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
healed. Thus by his carefull and heedfull prevention, the said
Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> preserved himself and all his Family from the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Infections of the Plague: This Gentleman hath cured also very
many Kentish Agues; and above 100. severall persons infirmed
with severall infirmities and Diseases, with the alone Liquor of the
Cup.</p>
            <p>87. The Lady <hi>Middleton</hi> of <hi>Burshby</hi> Hill in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> having
the same accident as the last recited, befaln to her Coachman, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from <hi>London</hi> in the time of greatest infection, with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gave to him to drink the prepared Liquor of the Cup, and also
to her self and to every particular person of her Family; it wrought
well upon every one, by vomits and otherwise, cured the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Plague sore, and prevented the infection from the rest.
These I doe publish to excite all to glorifie God for his mercifull
goodness, and to stir them to the like Christian and Godly care and
usefull practice, for the better prevention of all such dangerous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</p>
            <p>88. A certain Country man being a Warrener, having in charge
to walk about his ground betwixt one and two in the morning,
finding himself addicted to sleep, having spent the former part
of the night in unmeasurable drinking, laid himself down upon
the ground and slept, afterwards rowsing himself up, found his
limbs mightily stiffned and benummed; neverthelesse got home to
his house being neer, and threw himself on his back in all his
clothes upon his Bed, where he continued five weeks in that very
same posture, not being able to suffer himself any way to be holpen,
<pb facs="tcp:54910:27"/>
for the ease of naturall necessity; at which time I was come into the
Country and earnestly requested to visit him: he was the most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
spectacle, and the most foulsome to come neer unto, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I saw in all my life: Neverthelesse, with bathing his benummed
arms, thighs, legs, and feet, with (and by drinking) the prepared
Liquor of this Cup, recovered his feet, and after, his perfect health.
Mr. <hi>Thomas Brooks,</hi> Esquire, and Mr. <hi>John Dickons,</hi> with many others
doe know this to be a certain truth.</p>
            <p>89. A certain young woman of a fair and healthfull constitution,
undertaking the nourishing of two strong children, the monethly
purgations became stopped, and stayed for six moneths; and in the
seventh moneth clear blood ran forth abundantly at both her breasts,
to the great amazement and astonishment of the woman her self,
and of many others. There was speedily applyed to both her breasts,
soft folded clothes, well soaked in the hot prepared Liquor of this
Magneticall Cup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And likewise the prepared, Liquor with two or
three spoonfulls of the Sirup of Mugwort, was given to this woman
to drink two or three times; and the Menstrues came in order, and
purged naturally; and in eight dayes the woman became to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
well, and her breast milk became fair and healthfull; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she nor her Nursing children had any manner of harm at all.</p>
            <p>90. A certain woman that for many years had been extreamly
troubled with Obstructions and Oppilations of the Spleen, and
such Astmaticall stuffings, that she could hardly draw her breath, and
had also a foul Impostumation in the Lungs; she had spent all her
state upon Physitians and Physick, without any help or comfort:
Neverthelesse she was perfectly cured by drinking the prepared Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of this Magneticall Cup. These two last recited admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
were done, with many more, by the Right Worshipfull
Mrs. <hi>Abigaile Smalman</hi> of <hi>Wildertop,</hi> in the County of <hi>Salop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>91. In <hi>Warwick</hi> an ancient Gentleman liveth, that hath been
for many years much troubled with the dead Palsie, both in his
hands, knees, and feet, so that at certain times he had no use of
either; and for five years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his help and remedy, he resorted to the
Bathe, to his great charges and painfull travell: and although he
recovered some help at the present times, and for sometimes after;
Neverthelesse his former Palsie returned again at the accustomed
times, and so he remained without any constant help: Neverthelesse
<pb facs="tcp:54910:28"/>
by bathing and drinking of the prepared Liquor of this Cup. This
Gentleman is absolutely and perfectly cured. Mrs. <hi>Roe</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi>
knoweth this to be true.</p>
            <p>92. A certain Gentlewoman falling upon her back and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
upon a pair of stairs, her left shoulder and arm swelled very
much, and grew to be exceeding painfull; they feared much the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location
of the shoulder bone; but being resolved otherwise, the
shoulder and all the arm was bathed with the hot prepared Liquor
of the Cup; the swelling brake in the small of the arm, and much
contused blood and quitture came forth; and by this only help, it
was perfectly healed.</p>
            <p>93. A certain Gentlewoman having a little Wart under the left
Eye, on the bottome of the nether lid, being accidentally rubbed
off, grew to a sore; for the cure whereof she made use of severall
Chyrurgeons, but in vain; for the sore grew to be worse and worse;
yea, to such excrescens of proud flesh, as exceeded an inch in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and her face swelled very much, and continued very hard, and
the sight of her eye was quite lost for the time; and in this exteamity
she was left, and judged to be incurable, and thought it would be
the cause of her speedy death: Neverthelesse, by bathing with, and
drinking the prepared Liquor of this Cup, the swelling became aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the proud flesh became mortified and fell off, in such sort, that
being rooted where the sore was foulest, it left a hole under her eye,
an inch deep; the sound flesh became soft, her face well coloured,
and her sight was perfectly regained; and with washing the sore
and applying wet clothes unto the orifice of the sore, without any
tenting, it filled up with good and sound flesh, and she is hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured. Mr. <hi>Lemuell Allen,</hi> a Minister, performed this rare
cure.</p>
            <p>94. A certain Gentleman extreamly taken with a Quartan A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
which continued upon him 18. Moneths, and although he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no cost upon Physick and Physitians, yet remained he still cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and helplesse; the long continuance and violence of this Fever
cast him into a deep Consumption, his Stomack and Appetite to
meat was quite lost; his strength and naturall vigor failed, so that
for many weeks together he could take no manner of sustenance,
but only a little weak Cullice given him by a spoonfull or two at a
time: He was in this extreamity admonished to take some of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb facs="tcp:54910:28"/>
of my Cup, aromatised with comfortable things to please his
palate; which he did once, and it wrought gently by vomit; he
tooke the common and plaine prepared liquor of the Cup twise
more, and perfectly recovered his health. Mr. <hi>Hunnyman</hi> one of
his Majesties servants knoweth and justifieth this to be true.</p>
            <p>95. A certaine ancient man, 84 yeeres of age, became all the
body over to be full of dry crusty scabbs, which would common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scale and rub off for a certaine season, but would come again:
at length they came all his body over dry and hard like the bark of
a tree: In this perplexity, his age and noysomenesse considered,
his wife and friends were put to many experiments, but none pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
him any thing at all, untill they bathed all his body over with
the hot liquor of this Cup, and administred the same inwardly; and
by this practise within a few dayes this old man, being throughly
purged and bathed with this hot liquor prepared, his hard crusty
scabbedness scaled off, and his flesh and skin was restored and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
both white and cleare like a young mans: This I saw done,
and doe publish for an experimented truth.</p>
            <p>95. A certain woman that lived by her painfull labour, by some
accidentall distemperature fell to be most grievevously afflicted with
often and terrible fits of the Falling-sickness, whereby her health
was impaired, and that cruell sickness continuing upon her many
years, brought her to extream poverty, to whom the Liquor of this
Cup prepared, was 3 times administred, and she was perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>97. A certain young man also tormented with the same cruell
disease to whome the prepared Liquor of my Cup being in good
quantities, three times administred, he was thereby perfectly
cured: There hath been cured of the Falling-sickness by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
drinking of the prepared Liquor of my Magneticall Cup in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
parts of the Kingdome, whereof I have been informed, more
than 200. persons</p>
            <p>98. A certain Gentleman in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> having been for many
years much troubled with the tough flegme and stoppings, and Ast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
oppilations and obstructions of the Lungs, and thereby
brought to a languishing Consumption, that he could hardly walk
with a staffe, to whom the prepared Liquor of my Cup was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
three times, and thereby was speedily restored to perfect
health; this Gentleman I have seen since healthfull and well in this
<pb facs="tcp:54910:29"/>
Citty of <hi>London:</hi> These three last recited experiments were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by my truly honoured worthy friend, the right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Mr. <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> Esquire.</p>
            <p>99. A certain Gentleman having unlawfully and unfortunately
accompanied with an unhealthfull and corrupt creature, had his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
parts mightily swelled and exulcerated, so that his Urine came
from him with intollerable scorching and burning, and also issued
forth at six severall places, not one of them being the proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
passage; for that was quite stopped up: the Gentleman being
in this perplexed and well deserved misery; was neverthelesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured and healed of all these foul scorchings, swellings, and
ulcerated holes, and all the painfullnesse mittigated and asswaged by
washing, cleansing, syrindging with (and drinking) the prepared
Liquor of this Magneticall Cup; and by this practice, he was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purged from the contagious infection of that foul Disease, and
was restored unto perfect health, and the naturall passage was
cleansed and opened, and became serviceable and officious to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as before. This rare and admirable cure, although of a foul
Disease, I publish and testifie for an approved and an experimented
truth.</p>
            <p>100. A certain Gentleman, an especiall good friend of mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a strong corpulent constitution, having many Suits of great
importance depending in Law, for many years continuance, although
the state of his body required some help for naturall purifying of the
blood and evacuation of foul corrupt humors, yet could not this
Gentleman take any fit oportunity for that purpose; at length he
was suddainly cast down, and constrained to take knowledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
complaint, &amp; thereupon took a good draught of the prepared
Liquor of my Magneticall Cup; it wrought all that day and all the
night following, without any offence or violence, and gave him many
vomits, and eight or ten siedges; the second time it was taken in
a greater proportion, and it wrought three or four dayes together,
and expurged away abundance of foul and corrupt matter: and the
vomits standing three or four hours after the operation, grew all to
be of one entire consistence of Jelly, like a great firm Liver with
various streaks of rotten blood, and other corrupt matter, that had
for more then ten years before oppressed this Gentlemans body;
and certainly unlesse by this, or some other good help, this had been
<pb facs="tcp:54910:29"/>
removed, the Gentleman could not have lived but a short time Mr.
<hi>William Mollins,</hi> Esquire will affirm this to be an aproved truth.</p>
            <p>101. A certain loving friend of mine finding his stomack to be
over charged with foule grosse and corrupt humors, and his stomack
and appetite unto meat quite gone, his digestion weak, his whole
body growing more faint, and his spirits more dull and lesse cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
than accustomed, having one of my Magneticall Cups,
prepared therewith a pint of Hy-Countrey White-wine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the directions by me prescribed, and drank the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
by me presribed, it wrought well and gave 6. or 8. vomits,
and so many siedges: this Gentleman being willing to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Experiment than was prescribed, and finding this former
operation to be most gentle and easie, takes of the best sweet hie-Country
White-wine 3. pintes or 2. quarts boiles all to a pint or
thereabouts, and drank it up all at one potion, it wrought with
him continually night and day with easie vomits and gentle siedges
for 14. daies together, sometimes 30. or 40. siedges with some
gentle vomits betwixt, in the space of 24. hours: This Gentleman
sent unto me to have it staied: I advised him that he would patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
permit nature to have her full course, for I observed that neither
the vomits, neither the siedges did any way violently constrain the
body, neither brought any thing away but digested corruptions,
that the body was surcharged withall, and could better bee
spared and expurged than healthfully kept, and that withall, his
appetite to meat and stomack amended upon it, during the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
operations, and that I knew upon former Experience, that
it would cease when the obnoxious humors were expurged. And
afterwards when the Operations ceased, this Gentleman grew to
be exceedingly hungry, and to have a good stomack with good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
and recovered perfect health. And within a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my friend took it againe, but it wrought not at all with him, for
when it had purged the body &amp; found no corrupt humors to work
upon, it passed through the body in Urine without any other
apparent operation; I would not advise any to follow this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
practice (although I have known many that have done the
like with good successe) forasmuch as all constitutions are not alike,
and that the safest way is to practice according to the most common
approved and Experimentally prescribed Orders and Rules.</p>

            <head>The Manner and Order how to make Vse
of my Magneticall or Antimoniall Cup.</head>
            <p>TAke a well glased earthen pot or Pipkin with a fit cover, then
put this Cup therein, and powre within and round about it
as much White-wine, Claret wine, Muskadine, or Malmesie if it
may be gotten for it is best of all, or else Ale or Beer, a sufficient
quantity to fill and plentifully to cover, and to be above the Cup,
an Inch or two or more, that it may stand in full infusion; then set
the Pipkin upon or by a gentle fire, and let it boile gently for two
houres, and afterwards remain in the same order covered in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
digesting heat, such as you might endure your finger in, the
residue and remainder of 12 hours from the time you began; yet
admonishing you to spare the curiosity of some that sit up to attend
the same all night; place it neer the hot hearth, where fire hath been
kept all day, &amp; it is sufficient, for a small heat will serve to keep it in
good digestion; being thus used before &amp; standing covered, then one
hour or two before you doe take it, or administer it to another,
remove it from the fire, and set it to coole if need be, not taking off
the cover whereby the spirits might evaporate away; Afterwards
a Cupfull or more taken fasting cold, purgeth the body from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is offensive to Nature, the operation is safe and gentle, and
without any violence or danger, as hath been oftentimes proved:
Let them about four, or five hours after sleep, if their Constitution
require it, and then use or take any convenient diet, or what they
are commonly accustomed unto, and govern themselves as after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Physick. By the quantity and proportion of Wine or Ale,
allowing a pint of Wine, or a quart of Ale to be prepared for
two, you may prepare for as many as you please at one time;
and here note, that the greater the quantity of Liquor, and
the weaker it is, the more heat of fire and the longer time of digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:54910:30"/>
and preparation it requireth: You my also keep of this prepared
Liquor in close glasses or earthen bottles a fortnight or a moneth,
and send it, or carry it where, and to what distant place you will, for
it loseth not his Virtue: one Cupfull is an ordinary and common
Dose for Children, Women, and for other weak and delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
Neverthelesse, it worketh best in strong constitutions,
when two or three Cupfulls are taken and drunk out of a black
pot or glasse, and not so effectuall out of silver: You may
begin with one Cupfull, and so increase the Dose and quantity of
Potion as you finde cause; for herein discretion and experience must
be your guide. For the manner of the operation, it is somewhat
difficult and doubtfull to foreknow and presage; for it operateth
according as it is most convenint for the present estate and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the body: Sometimes, and in some constitutions, it opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
by Vomit alone; in some others, by siedge alone; in others by
Urine and Sweat; but most commonly it worketh all these wayes,
and ever without any violence or danger. To prescribe a time for
the use of this Medicine, is needlesse; it may be safely taken any time
of the year, even in the time of the extreamest heat of Summer, or
coldest of Winter; neverthelesse, the Spring and fall are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for all Physicall operations. To prevent sicknesse or when
any convenient occasion is offered, it should be taken three times,
leaving a day or two between, and every time take more than the
former: but for confirmed Diseases it should be taken three times
in the week, if occasions permit, as long as it will work; for when
it hath cleansed and purified the body from all impurities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
humors, it worketh no more; and then you may be sure the
Patient is perfect well; and this is a noble quality of this Medicine.
I have known it administred twenty nine times to a Gentlewoman
that had the Falling-sicknesse of nine years continuance, leaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedian
dayes 1, 2, or 3. betwixt, as occasion required, and the
thirtieth time it wrought not at all, although administred in a
greater quantity; and then it was apparent that her whole body was
cleansed, and she perfectly cured, and delivered from the violence
of that miserable Disease: For it is most certain, that so long as there
is any preternaturall humors, or offensive malignant matter, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within the body, it will work. I have known it in some consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and also against some foul and dangerous Diseases, upon
<pb facs="tcp:54910:31"/>
thrice taking, to have wrought three or four dayes after by Siedge,
yea sometimes with purging and sweating to the 12, 13, or 15. day
after the taking thereof, and alwaies proved to be without any
harm, violence, or danger. And some being timerous, have request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have it staid; but I ever advised the contrary, and desired them
to permit nature to have her course, and to perfect her intended
work, for this Medicine is not to be feared, and will eject nothing
but that which well may, and ought to be spared (whatsoever mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
adversaries to experienced truth say to the contrary.) Against
the pains of the Gout, or any other pain, ache, tumor, or swelling,
make the Infusion strong with White wine, and bathe the grieved
places half an hour long, as hot as the Patient may endure it, the
night before you take it inwardly: And by alone bathing the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Head, the Legs, and the Feet, it taketh away all manner of
inveterated pains of the Head, and purgeth the Body also, although
you take it not inwardly at all: and this is an approved truth. For
swellings, wounds, fistulaes, and ulcerous sores, wash them well with
the hot infusion made with White wine, and Syrindge in the Liquor
into the bottome, and cleanse the sores well, apply wet clothes three
or four fould hot, to the sore orifices: take care you doe not Tent,
neither binde too hard. And by using this means, you may perfectly
cure any Disease or Infirmity that may be cured by any other Means,
Skill, or Art.</p>
            <p>Beware of <hi>Counterfeit, Pernitious, Dangerous, and Violent Cups:</hi>
Howsoever use them not according to my directions; and if you
doe, and receive harm or miscarry, blame your own willfullnesse
and let your blood bee required at their hands that have abused you:
this my Premonition shall plead my Innocency before the Lord.</p>
