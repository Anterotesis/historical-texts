            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SOre sick deare friends, long time I was</l>
               <l>and weakely laid in bed;</l>
               <l>And for five houres in all mens sight,</l>
               <l>at length I lay as dead:</l>
               <l>The bel rung out, my friends came in,</l>
               <l>and I key cold was found,</l>
               <l>Then was my carkasse brought from bed,</l>
               <l>and cast upon the ground:</l>
               <l>My loving wife did w√©epe full sore,</l>
               <l>and children loud did cry,</l>
               <l>My friends did mourne, yet thus they said</l>
               <l>all flesh is borne to dye:</l>
               <l>My winding sheet prepared was,</l>
               <l>my grave was also made,</l>
               <l>And five long houres by iust report,</l>
               <l>in this same case I laid:</l>
               <l>During which time my soule did see</l>
               <l>such strange and fearefull sights,</l>
               <l>That for to heare the same disclos'd,</l>
               <l>would banish all delights.</l>
               <l>Yet sith the Lord restor'd my life,</l>
               <l>which from my body fled,</l>
               <l>I will declare what sights I saw,</l>
               <l>that time that I was dead.</l>
               <l>Me thought along a gallant greene,</l>
               <l>where pleasant flowers sprung,</l>
               <l>I tooke my way, whereas I thought,</l>
               <l>the Muses sweetely sung,</l>
               <l>The grasse was sw√©et the tr√©es ful fair,</l>
               <l>and lovely to behold,</l>
               <l>And full of fruit was every twig,</l>
               <l>which shin'd like glistering gold,</l>
               <l>My cheerefull heart desired much</l>
               <l>to taste the fruit so faire:</l>
               <l>But as I reacht a faire young man,</l>
               <l>to me did fast repaire.</l>
               <l>Touch not (qd. he) that's none of thine,</l>
               <l>but wend and walke with me,</l>
               <l>And see thou marke each severall thing</l>
               <l>which I shall show to th√©e:</l>
               <l>I wondred greatly at his words,</l>
               <l>yet went with him away:</l>
               <l>Till on a goodly pleasant banke,</l>
               <l>with him he had me stay.</l>
               <l>With branches then of Lillies white,</l>
               <l>mine eyes there wiped he.</l>
               <l>When this was done he bad me look,</l>
               <l>what I farre off could see.</l>
               <l>I looked up and loe at last,</l>
               <l>I did a City see,</l>
               <l>So faire a thing did never man</l>
               <l>behold with mortall eye;</l>
               <l>Of Diamonds, pearles, and precious stones</l>
               <l>it seem'd the wals were made:</l>
               <l>The houses all with beaten gold,</l>
               <l>were til'd and overlaid.</l>
               <l>More brighter than the morning Sun,</l>
               <l>the light thereof did show,</l>
               <l>And every creature in the same,</l>
               <l>like crowned Kings did goe.</l>
               <l>The fields about this City faire,</l>
               <l>were all with Roses set:</l>
               <l>Gilly-flowers, and Carnation faire,</l>
               <l>which canker could not fret:</l>
               <l>And from these fields there did proc√©ed</l>
               <l>the sw√©et'st and pleasant'st smell,</l>
               <l>That ever living creature felt,</l>
               <l>the scent did so excell:</l>
               <l>Besides such sweet triumphant mirth,</l>
               <l>did from the City sound,</l>
               <l>That I there with was ravished,</l>
               <l>my ioy did so abound.</l>
               <l>With musick, mirth, and melody,</l>
               <l>Princes did there embrace,</l>
               <l>And in my heart I long'd to be,</l>
               <l>within that ioyfull place.</l>
               <l>The more I gaz'd, the more I might,</l>
               <l>the sight pleas'd me so well.</l>
               <l>For what I saw in every thing,</l>
               <l>my tongue can no way tell:</l>
               <l>Then of the man I did demand,</l>
               <l>what place the same might be,</l>
               <l>Whereas so many Kings do dwell</l>
               <l>in ioy and melody?</l>
               <l>Quoth he, that blessed place is heaven,</l>
               <l>where yet thou must not rest,</l>
               <l>And those that do like Princes walke,</l>
               <l>are men whom God hath blest.</l>
               <l>Then did he turne me round about,</l>
               <l>and on the other side,</l>
               <l>He bad me view and marke as much,</l>
               <l>what things are to be spide.</l>
               <l>With that I saw a cole-blacke den,</l>
               <l>all tand with soot and smoake</l>
               <l>Where stinking Brimstone burning was</l>
               <l>which made me like to choake,</l>
               <l>An ugly creature there I saw,</l>
               <l>whose face with knives was slash<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <l>About his necke were fiery ruffes,</l>

               <l>A Spotted person by each one,</l>

               <l>These were no sooner out of sight,</l>

               <l>And these men were for murther plagu'd,</l>
               <l>from which they could not shrinke.</l>
               <l>I saw when these were gone away,</l>
               <l>the Swearer and the Lier,</l>
               <l>And these were hung up by the tongues,</l>
               <l>right over a flaming fire.</l>
               <l>From eyes, from eares, from Navell &amp; nose</l>
               <l>and from the lower parts,</l>
               <l>The blood me thought did gushing runne,</l>
               <l>and clodded like mens hearts.</l>
               <l>I asked why that punishment,</l>
               <l>was upon swearers laid:</l>
               <l>Because, quoth one, wounds, blood &amp; heart,</l>
               <l>was still the oath they made.</l>
               <l>And there withall from ugly Hell,</l>
               <l>such shriekes and cryes I heard,</l>
               <l>As though some greater griefe and plague</l>
               <l>had vext them afterward.</l>
               <l>So that my soule was sore afraid,</l>
               <l>such terrour on me fell:</l>
               <l>A way then went the young man quite,</l>
               <l>and bad me not farewell.</l>
               <l>Wherefore unto my body straight,</l>
               <l>my spirit return'd againe,</l>
               <l>And lively blood did after wards</l>
               <l>stretch forth in every veine.</l>
               <l>My closed eyes I opened,</l>
               <l>and raised from my swound,</l>
               <l>I wondred much to see my selfe</l>
               <l>laid so upon the ground:</l>
               <l>Which when my neighbours did behold,</l>
               <l>great feare upon them fell,</l>
               <l>To whom soone after I did tell,</l>
               <l>the newes from heaven and hell.</l>
