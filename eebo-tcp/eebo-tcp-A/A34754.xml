         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Countrey-Miniſter's
REFLECTIONS,
ON THE
<hi>City-Miniſters Letter</hi>
To his FRIEND;
<hi>Shewing the Reaſons why We cannot Read the</hi> King's
<hi>Declaration in Our Churches.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UNleſs you had told me in what
manner your <hi>Friend was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,</hi>
when he met with His
Majeſties Order to Read His
Declaration; I cannot tell whether he
had any ground to <hi>wonder</hi> or not: It looks
like Ingenuity in you, to tell your Friend
<hi>your thoughts freely;</hi> but if you mean by
<hi>freely,</hi> the liberty you take to tell the
World plainly, how much you Claſh with
your Prince, which ſeems to be your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by your ſaying, <hi>It is not a time to
be Reſerved:</hi> Such a Freedom taken, might
not long ſince have met with ſuch a Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
of ſomething being Reſerved in
this preſumed Freedom, which might
have been Accompanied with a dangerous
<hi>Inuendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Paragraph Owns, You are
intirely Out-witted; which does as little
Credit your Prudence, as your following
Diſcourſe, does your Cauſe: But if you
fall for want of Fore-caſt, who can help
it? You would not abate your Violence
one jott, when ſeaſonably prompted to
conſider what the Fruit of your Rigorous,
and more then Legal Proſecution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
upon Penal Laws would produce;
Nor will you ſtand to your Old and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
Principles.</p>
            <p>There is indeed an <hi>Honourable way of
Falling:</hi> When a Chriſtian is called to
Suffer for ſuch things as will bear him out
in Suffering, and whereof he will never
have occaſion to be Aſhamed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.
16. But it may deſerve a Clergy-mans
Conſideration, Whether a Sturdy Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs
not to part with ſuch things, as
have oft occaſioned uncommendable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
may not have ſome Affinity with
that Evil-Doing, and as a Buſy-Body in
other Mens matters, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>In the next place, You ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That to
take away the Teſt and Penal Laws at this
time, is but one ſtep from Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why did you not then Conſent, and
Preſs to have them taken away, when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97382:2"/>
there was no ſuch Danger, yea, when the
Taking them away, might have rendred
the Introducing of Popery inconceivably
Difficult, if not Impoſſible?</p>
            <p>But how do you know, that you judge
Right in this Caſe now? Why ſay you,
<hi>We have the Concurring Opinion of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry with us, who have already
Suffered in this Cauſe:</hi> But is this the
proof of an Opinion, to ſay, That ſome
of Honour and Wealth, have Embraced
and Adhere to it, though with ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to themſelves? It would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
tempt a man to think a Reaſoner is
at a great Loſs, when inſtead of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he inſiſts for proof on the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
Grandeur of ſuch as are of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he pleads for.</p>
            <p>When the Prince, and many of the
People were averſe to the Crucifying of
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> what a Clamour did the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
make, <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or the
Phariſees believed on him? But this People
who know not the Law, are Accurſed:</hi> John
7. 48, 49.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe you are right in this point,
What Efficacy hath the Clergy's Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's Declaration, to take off the
Teſts and Penal Laws? If the Clergy's
Breath can ſhake, or throw them away,
Either the Laws are of little worth, and
have a very ſorry foundation, or the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
are Men of an Admirable Character.</p>
            <p>But ſay you, <hi>Though our Reading, do not
immediately bring in Popery, yet it ſets open
our Church Doors for it:</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
Why our Church Doors may not be
Shutt and Lock'd as faſt after Reading, as
before; But if the Clergy pretend to ſuch
Power with their breath (as to break the
Strongeſt Barrs, ſet Open our Church-Doors
ſo Wide, as that they can never be
Shut again) They may well allow their
Prince a Diſpenſing Power; or how can
He be Safe, as long as they can breathe?</p>
            <p>Say you, <hi>If we comply with this Order,
all good Proteſtants will Deſpiſe and Hate
us:</hi> To Hate any Perſon, is againſt an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
part of a good Proteſtants Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if the Order be not Sinful, they will
have no cauſe to Deſpiſe you, becauſe
you read it, and Act therein according to
your Avowed Doctrine.</p>
            <p>If the Order be in your Opinion Sinful,
Why do you not ſhew, what Law of God
is Broken by it? This is that you ſhould
have done, and not have inſiſted on ſuch
poor low conſiderations, as Perſonal
Danger, Diſhonour, and falling without
Pity.</p>
            <p>He that Suffers on a Good Account,
hath Honour and Comfort enough in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and from his God; He that Suffers
in a bad Cauſe, falls Diſhonourably,
though he have never ſo many Great Men
to pity him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Great Difficulty,</hi> You ſay, of your
Caſe is this, <hi>That fall you muſt, Sooner or
Later;</hi> And therefore like Prudent Men,
you think the Wiſeſt Courſe is, to be Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
preſently; But it is not the firſt time
I have heard of that Wiſe ſort of People,
who are for a ſhort Life, and a Merry:
But what Neceſſity is there of your latter
Falling? This is certainly like a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Mans cheriſhing ſuch a reſolved Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of wanting Bread at Laſt, as makes
him Pine himſelf to Death in the midſt of
Plenty. But what is the ground of this
Jealouſie? <hi>If we fall after Reading, this
is the way never to Riſe more:</hi> And what
mean you by that? Is it that after Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Declaration, if Penal Laws be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, you ſhall never be truſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with ſuch a Power to miſchief your
Fellow Subjects? If this be all, it may be
all for the better; for neither the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church of Chriſt, nor the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Welfare of the Kingdom, do at all
depend on One Parties having it in their
Power to Impoveriſh or Ruine all the
Reſt of the Nation for Meer Matters of
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>You now come to <hi>Examine the Matter,</hi>
as you ſay, Impartially; And firſt, <hi>Yo<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Suppoſe, That no Miniſter of the Church of</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97382:2"/>
               <hi>England can give his conſent to the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
This is juſt as much as to beg the
Queſtion you ſhould prove, and ſo all
you Write ſignifies nothing with thoſe
who do not Suppoſe what you Suppoſe.</p>
            <p>If you had indeed impartially Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and Proved the matter of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be Sinful; you would have had no
occaſion to have diſcovered your Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in pretending an Authority againſt the
Command of your Prince, nor of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
(as if you had lately peruſed the
Old Hiſtory of the Barons Wars) that
you have the Nobility and Gentry on your
Side.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Reading the Declaration would
be no fault at all, but our duty, when the
King Commands it, did we approve of the
Matter of it.</hi> This is not Expreſs'd after
the uſual manner of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
when treating with the Diſſenters;
They would not then yield that Orders
might be Suſpended from a Publication,
till thoſe who were required to publiſh
them did approve the matter; but it was
then conſtantly Affirmed, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
muſt be Obeyed, if the matter of it
were not plainly Sinful; and of this, you
Aſſerted, Authority was to judge: Was
not this the loweſt, you would ever ſtoop,
when Scruples were raiſed, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
pretended againſt your Orders?
Where does the Scriptures forbid it? If
it be not Forbidden, the Command is
plain (and the ſafeſt way muſt be taken,
which is) to Obey. It is certain, ſome
parts of the Declaration, contain very
plain and neceſſary Truths, which Church-of-England-Miniſters
ought to Approve;
If there be any thing in it which you think
you may not Approve, that ſhould have
been Specified; it would have been more
modeſt, humbly to have Applyed to the
King for a convenient Explication in that
part, then preſently in Print, to Cry the
whole is Sinful, and a device to ruine that
you call the beſt Church in the World.</p>
            <p>Next, You endeavour to prove, <hi>That
Reading the Declaration in our Churches,
is an Interpretative Conſent:</hi> Becauſe, ſay
you, <hi>By Our Law, Miniſterial Officers,
are accountable, for their Actions; and the
Authority of Superiours, though of the King
himſelf, cannot juſtifie Inferiours in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
any Illegal Command: With reference
to the Command of Superiours, we are to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
our own Judgment and Reaſon; and we
may not obey a Prince againſt the Laws of the
Land, or the Laws of God, becauſe what we
do, let the Authority be what it will that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it, becomes our own Act, and we are
reſponſible for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſort of Arguing (whatever may be
in it) would not a few years ſince be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome ſort of People ſufficiently
known in this Kingdom, when urg'd in
oppoſition to their Inclinations: Then
the Prince was ſet above Law, and it was
His Command, and the Notification of His
Pleaſure, made any thing (which was not
<hi>Malum in ſe)</hi> Obliging; Private Judgment
might by no means be admitted, when once
the Governours had intereſſed themſelves
in it, and made a Determination. Is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Diſ-ingenuous for any Men, eſpecially for
Miniſters, to have recourſe to a Principle
of their Adverſaries, (which they have for
many years decried) onely becauſe they
would ſerve themſelves with it upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Occaſion, and to forſake their
own Doctrine, which they Avowed ſo
long as it would gratifie their Revenge and
Ambition, tho now they think it may do
them ſome Diskindneſs? This is to fetch
Weapons out of their Adverſaries Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
not to Fight againſt them, but to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
their Prince, and batter that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of which they formerly boaſted, They
were the only Supporters: The moſt
Unjuſtifiable, and Shameful Inconſtancy,
is that of Altering, and Changing, and
Cloſing with any thing, to ſerve a preſent
Turn; Why may you not tell the People
in his Majeſties words, That none of His
Subjects ſhall be Forced by Fines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Penalties, to Submit their Judgment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97382:3"/>
to others in the weightieſt matters, as
well as to tell the Nation this in Print,
That Clergy-men muſt follow their own
Judgment, not only in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but of Law alſo? If Inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are not ſatisfied that their Superiours
Command is not Lawful, Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for them to deſiſt from Obeying it,
without making Clamours againſt it in
Print? Can they not comfort themſelves
(in Silence) with that Doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Paſſive-Obedience, which they,
when in the height of their Eaſe and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Preached to others as Orthodox
and Sound; and thought they thereby
Signalized their Loyalty above all other
Societies of People in the World? If a
Prince Declares, That there are ſome
Laws in being, which are greatly Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to many of His Subjects, and that He
is willing, That theſe Inconveniences
ſhall be redreſſed in a Legal Way: Can
any thing be more Condeſcending and
Gracious, then for him to Certifie this to
his People, who are to Chooſe thoſe that
are to Repeal ſuch Laws as are Prejudicial,
and make ſuch Others, as may be for the
Publick Good? What hurt can there be
in making known the Princes Pleaſure in
this, as particularly as he ſhall think
meet, that His People may have time to
Conſider and weigh Matters, that nothing
be done Unadviſedly in ſuch Important
Concerns?</p>
            <p>But ſay you, <hi>Miniſters of Religion have
the Care and Conduct of Souls, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are bound to take Care, that what they
publiſh in their Churches be neither contrary
to the Laws of the Land, or the good of
the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you would keep cloſe to your own
Argument, you ſhould have ſaid, That
Miniſters who have the Care of Souls,
are bound to take Care, that what they
publiſh in their Churches, be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>But Since you Speak of the Laws of
the Land, I can ſee no reaſon from
thence, Why ſuch Orders as are given,
by thoſe that are under His Majeſt<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſhould be Enjoyned to be Obſerved,
(though Conſcience be really concerned
in the Matter) and His Majeſties Orders,
which have far greater Authority be, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied:
It may be when People are well
acquainted with the Kings Declaration,
it may have this good Effect, That the
Miniſters of Religion, ſhall not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to Publiſh other Peoples Pleaſures
in their Churches; at leaſt, not under
ſuch ſevere Temporal Penalties, as have
been heretofore inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Miniſters of Religion are not
looked upon as common Cryers; but what
they Read they are ſuppoſed to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they have not been looked upon as
common Cryers, I think they have been
looked upon as Worſe; When Biſhops
ſent Orders made Arbitrarily by Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Seſſions, to be Publiſhed by
them in time of Divine Service: B<gap reason="illegible: broken type" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
doth not the Rubrick appoint, That
what the King Enjoyns, as well as what
the Biſhops Enjoyn<gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſhall be Publiſhed
in the Churches? The Clergy of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> have loudly Taught,
and ſolemnly Owned, That the King
of <hi>England,</hi> as Head of the Church, has
Power to make Injunctions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
and are not Miniſters every
jot as much obliged to be His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Cryers, as to be Inſtruments through
which the Biſhop's Eccho may ſound more
Audibly to the People?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what they Read, they Recommend
too.</hi> Miniſters are not to be conſidered
alike, in every thing they Publiſh in the
Church. A difference ariſes from the
Nature of the things we Publiſh: Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Chapter in the Bible, and Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Banns of Matrimony, or Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are differently to be Conſidered;
when you Publiſh the Banns, what do
you Recommend, unleſs it be to know,
Whether any of the People have any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97382:3"/>
thing to Object, againſt ſuch Perſons
Marrying? But ſeeing you ſay, That <hi>for
a Miniſter to Read any thing in the Church
which he does not conſent to, or approve,
is to Miſguide the People:</hi> I would ask
you this one Queſtion, Whether you do
really think, that the Worſhip which
His Majeſty doth Celebrate, be the
true, and right Way of Worſhipping
God, which Proteſtants ought to Pray
He may be kept and ſtrengthened in?
If you are for the Negative, Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what you Recommend to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when you Read theſe Words in the
Litany; <hi>That it may pleaſe Thee to keep
and ſtrengthen, in the true Worſhipping of
Thee, Thy Servant</hi> James, <hi>Our moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King and Governour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Reading is Teaching:</hi> Very good;
What then? <hi>I may not Read any thing
in the Church, but what I approve.</hi> But,
are not the People Judges for themſelves
of what you Read? It is not your
Reading a thing in the Church, that
Determines the People, unleſs they pay
the Clergy a greater Deference than
they deſerve; After all your Reading,
and Teaching too, be it in a Sermon of
your own making, (which no doubt,
you prefer much above His Majeſty's
Declaration) Proteſtants will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
your Conduct any farther, than they
are Convinced it is good: A Man is not
Determined by what he hears, otherwiſe
than by the Evidence he hath concerning
it: Now it would almoſt tempt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to believe the Declaration hath ſo
much Reaſon and Light accompanying
it, as Our Clergy cannot well Anſwer;
and that therefore they are afraid to read
it, leaſt the People ſhould be Convinced,
and not follow their Conduct ſo ſervile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they would have them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, Why may I not then Read a Homily
for Tranſubſtantiation, or Invocation of
Saints, if the King ſends me ſuch?</hi> Let the
Queſtion be, <hi>Whether every thing Read in
the Church, be a part of Divine Service?</hi>
And then if you Conſider, and Anſwer it
ſedately, you will find your own Queſtion
Reſolved.</p>
            <p>If you can prove the Declaration to be
contrary to the Word of God, I will have
no further Conteſt with you about Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in the Church: I wiſh no humane
Orders were impoſed upon Miniſters, to
be Read in the Church: But if any
Perſons have right to enjoyn them to Read
ſuch Orders there, certainly the KING
has much more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King intends, Our Reading this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
ſhould ſignifie to the Nation, Our
Conſent and Approbation of it:</hi> What have
Clergy-men to do, to pry into the King's
ſecret Intentions? The Declaration ſpeaks
plainly for it ſelf. But <hi>the D<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>claration does
not want Publiſhing.</hi> How can you tell
that? Muſt the Clergy, or His Majeſty
judge when His Declaration is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made known? But <hi>this is deſigned to
ſerve inſtead of Addreſſes of Thanks, which
the Clergy generally refuſed, though it was
only to thank the King for His Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
Renewed to the Church of</hi> England:
Many of the Clergy have been looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a great while, as Perſons Addicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Meaſure to flatter their Prince; and
behold, all on a ſudden, they are become
Rude towards him, or worſe; if they may
not have leave to Miſchief their Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Neighbours, they will not thank
their Prince for renewed Promiſes to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and Maintain them: Was ever ill
Manners and Ingratitude towards a Prince,
thus rudely and diſingeniouſly boaſted of?
Who can think theſe Perſons apprehend
themſelves to be in danger of falling
without Pity, who brag thus openly of
their Stoutneſs, that they would not ſo
much as give their Prince Thanks, for the
moſt Gracious Promiſe he could make
them?</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>It does not become a Miniſter
of Religion to do any thing, which in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97382:4"/>
               <hi>of the most Charitable Man, can only
be Excuſed.</hi> In this, I think you are very
much in the Right; I wiſh the Multitude
to whom your Letters are ſent, may fix
their Hearts on this pertinent Paſſage:
No Charity can Excuſe at preſent, a great
many of your former Practiſes, nor will
they find any Excuſe at laſt, if not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repented of: If you had hitherto Acted
by this Rule, you would never have need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fear your Fall with Contempt, or
without Pity.</p>
            <p>You mention the <hi>Book of Sports,</hi> which
w<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ordered to be read in Churches. I
will not ſay, how ſtrict the greateſt
Church-men were for Reading of it, nor
how well it did Comport with the Fourth
Command; I only enquire, whether the
preſent KING, has not as much Right
and Power, to Order his Declaration to be
Read in Churches, as King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi>
had, to order the <hi>Book of Sports</hi> to be
Read there? And which of theſe two did
Thwart the Holy Scriptures moſt?</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>It is against the Conſtitution of
the Church of</hi> England; <hi>It is to teach an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Toleration, which
was Declared in Parliament Illegal, in</hi> 1672,
<hi>and has been condemned by the Christian
Church in all Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King's Authority to make Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Orders, has been heretofore cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, as a main part of the Conſtitution
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> How comes
this Change all on a ſudden? But, what
is this Univerſal Toleration? No more
but this, That no one Party of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Subjects, ſhall be truſted with a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to deſtroy all the Reſt: Will nothing
ſerve your turn, unleſs you may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
render your ſelves grievous to your
Fellow Subjects? Muſt none live and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the comfortable Influences of Society
and Government, but thoſe who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſurrender themſelves blindly to
your Dictates? Methinks, Sober, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and good Clergy-men, ſhould be
afraid, leſt any of that which was <hi>Levi</hi>'s
Reproach, ſhould be a Brand upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Inſtruments of Cruelty are in their
Habitation; Oh! My Soul, come not thou
into their Secret,</hi> Gen. 49. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>I will not intermeddle with Parliaments,
but only ſay, <hi>They are not always of one
and the ſame mind;</hi> and Time was, when
many of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
talked very contemptibly of ſome
of them. But in that you ſay, <hi>It has been
Condemned by the Chriſtian Church in all
Ages;</hi> this wants Proof: If it be well
conſidered, the Chriſtian Church will be
found to thrive beſt, under ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Toleration as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did grant,
before Eaſe, Pleaſure and Wealth, had
Corrupted the Biſhops. Hence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Golden Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Wooden Chalices,
Golden Chalices, Wooden Prieſts;</hi> till the
Clergy grew Negligent and Haughty
under <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Reign: It is certain,
the Orthodox had no Humane Penal Laws
whereby to puniſh Hereticks.</p>
            <p>Say you, (1.) <hi>It is to Teach my People,
they need never come to Church more:</hi> To
what an Extravagant Indecency, towards
both their Prince and their Church, will
the Affection of Tyrannizing over others,
Tranſport ſome Church-men? Could any
Enemy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
any thing more to Her Diſcredit,
than to ſay, <hi>Her Members are under no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to attend on Her Miniſtry, but what
ariſes from Force and Penal Laws?</hi> Why
may not People have your leave, as well
as their KING's, to go, not only to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
but to the Maſs, till they are
convinc'd, that they do ill in going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
It is much better becoming a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of Religion, to Convince ſuch by
Scripture and Reaſon, that their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is falſe, then to Contend to have
them caſt into Priſon, and by Fines and
Confiſcations, to Compel them againſt
their Conſcience to come to Church;
for their Preſence there, is no more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97382:4"/>
to God, nor Beneficial to their own
Souls, whilſt their Minds are elſewhere,
than it would be, if they were at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
or at Maſs.</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>It is to teach the Diſpenſing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which alters what has been formerly
thought the whole Conſtitution of this Church
and Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who are they that thus thought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly?
Surely, none of thoſe who Taught
loudly, and in Prints ſolemnly Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
That <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> were <hi>Acts
of Grace,</hi> that the Princes Power could
not be bounded; if there be any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who were always of another Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they may pretend the ſame things
now as heretofore: But for ſuch Perſons
as have been Inſtruments of Wrong and
Miſchief, to borrow ſuch Notions from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
before they have Renounced their
former Avowed Principles, and ſatisfied
for their Injuries they have done, They
can have nothing to Alledge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which can juſtifie them in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Affair.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>It is to Recommend to Our People
the Choice of ſuch Perſons to ſit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as ſhall take away the Teſt and
Penal Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this to Recommend the Clergy,
as Perſons of great Tenderneſs toward
the People? You would never permit
them to be Quiet, as long as it was in
your Power to make them Uneaſy: You
would now perſwade them, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry are as much againſt
the People's Eaſe, as you are; (for
which, I ſuppoſe, ſome of them will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
you no Thanks) and now you will
not Read the King's Declaration to your
People, becauſe it teacheth them how
they may provide for their own Eaſe, ſo
as to live peaceably among themſelves,
and ſecurely, under His Majeſty's Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Equal Care for them all.</p>
            <p>(4.) <hi>It is to Condemn all thoſe great
and Worthy Patriots of their Countrey,
who forfeited the deareſt thing in the World
to them, next a good Conſcience;</hi> viz. <hi>The
Favour of their Prince, and a great many
Honourable and Profitable Employments
with it, rather than conſent to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
of taking away the Teſt and PenalLaws,
which they apprehend Deſtructive
to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion: And he who can in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
do all this, I think, need ſcruple
nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Reading the Declaration, doth
no more condemn thoſe who approve not
of the King's Intentions therein Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than your refuſing to Read it, doth
Condemn the KING: A good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhould be very Dear to every Man;
I think no Man ſhould Act in direct Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to an Erring Conſcience, till
he can be better Inſtructed. Thoſe that
do really Apprehend, that taking away
Penal Laws will be Deſtructive to the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
ought not to Intereſt themſelves
for the taking them away: But I do
not underſtand, why both theſe may
not be ſufficiently ſecured by other
means, than by putting a Power in the
Hands of one Party of His Majeſty's
Subjects, to ruine all the reſt; whether
ſuch a Security may not be found out,
will be beſt Determined, when conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Wiſdom of the Nation,
when met; and in a Capacity to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
ſome Old, and make other New
Laws, as Emergencies may require.</p>
            <p>Now let any Rational Man judge, Whether,
notwithſtanding all your Arguments, a Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Man, who does not ſcruple to Read the
King's Declaration, may not ſcruple at many things
which you have done formerly, and at your ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to keep your ſelves ſtill in a Capacity, to do
the like for the future.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Reading the Declaration, will Render
your Perſons and Miniſtry, infinitely Contemptible.</hi>
Infinite Contempt, is huge Contempt indeed; I
acknowledge, Miniſters ought to behave themſelves
ſo, as that they be neither Blamed nor Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
There is ſcarce any thing makes a Miniſter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97382:5"/>
more juſtly contemptible, than Encouraging Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,
Flattering and Soothing great Men,
and ſhewing a Domineering Temper, and Inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cruelty, where they can have an Opportunity
to Exerciſe it: Let ſuch as have been Guilty of
theſe or the like Crimes, reflect on themſelves
and Repent, and they need not fear Contempt for
Reading the Declaration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nothing will ſo Effectually tend to the Final Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>becauſe Our Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will diſcourage, or provoke, or miſguide all the
Churches Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that You except not one of her Friends,
you horridly affront them all, by the Character
you give them; for you herein ſuppoſe them all
to be either very Timerous, very Teſty, or very
Ignorant Perſons; But I think you are greatly
out, and lay abundantly more Weight on the
Clergies Reading the Declaration, than it will
bear: For whether you Read or no, ſuch as are
judicious and good Friends to the Church, will
be firm to Her, and to their Religion; and till
you prove, that nothing can ſecure the Religion
of our Church, but theſe <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi>
your diſmal Conſequence vaniſhes into Nothing:
The Church of <hi>England</hi> may be kept upon Her
true Foundation, (and I hope Penal Laws have
not much to do there) and be by Law ſecured
in all Her Rights, from being hurt by any other
Parties, (if theſe LAWS and TESTS be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.)
And ſhe will be never the leſs Beautiful
and Proſperous, becauſe the Power which ſhe
has uſed to hurt others, is taken out of her hands:
But how does your Reading Contribute ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to a Repeal, when all that hear it, are at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to judge for themſelves? Your Way of
Diſcourſing as you do, about Reading the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
would tempt one to think, that you are
of Opinion, either, that the Declaration is At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſuch convincing Reaſon, as will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſatisfie People as ſoon as they hear it; or
elſe, that nothing is neceſſary in any Point to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
and fix People's Minds and Judgments,
but only to have ſuch a thing Read by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in the Church.</p>
            <p>Your Anſwer to the Objection you raiſe
touching Diſſenters, is very Faint: Say you,
<hi>When there is an Opportunity of ſhewing Our
Inclinations without Danger, they may find We
are not ſuch Perſecutors as we are Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though they are not to be Compared with the
Nobility and Gentry; yet one would think, one
Poſitive Promiſe might have been by you, on this
Occaſion afforded them; What ſignifies, <hi>They
may find,</hi> that which they could never yet find?
For as oft as you have been Tryed hitherto, you
have as ſoon as ever you were in a Capacity,
proved Unfaithful to them; They have felt the
Weight of your Fingers: There neither has been,
nor is any need of others to Repreſent to them
what Perſecutors you have been, and may be found
again, if you have Opportunity of ſhewing your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
without Danger, for ought that you have
hitherto Manifeſted to the contrary: For here is
not a Word of any poſitive Reſpect or Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
towards them: Is there a Change wrought
in your Inclinations, without any Sence of the
Wrong you have done? Here is not a Syllable of
any Relenting at your former Severities; your
Letter abounds with Flattery towards the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Gentry, Repeated many times over, but
not a tittle of any Care you have taken, that the
Diſſenters may have their Liberty: As oft as it
hath been granted by Royal Diſpenſations, you
have been angry at it; as oft as it has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in Parliament, you have Oppos'd it: So
that you might have Omitted this Objection you
have raiſed concerning the Diſſenters, and have
paſſed them over in Silence, as a People, whoſe
Anger or Friendſhip you have no regard to; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
after you made the Objection, you had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
to have Anſwered it alſo, more to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>You Conclude with a very honeſt Propoſal of
Prayer, with which I heartily Concur; and Pray,
That every Party of Profeſſed Chriſtians, may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occaſions, approve themſelve Perſons of
True Piety, Moderation, and Real Fidelity.</p>
