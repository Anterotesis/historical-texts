         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> contract Chriſt was

therfore I paſſe from contracts to ſpeake
of marriage, which is nothing elſe but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

ioyned together according to the ordinance
of God.</p>

then the inſtitution of it; then the cauſes

            <p>Well might Paule ſay, <hi>Marriage is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note>
for God hath honoured it himſelfe. It
is honorable for the author,<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lencie of mariage.</note> honorable for the
time, and honorable for the place. Whereas
all other ordinances were appointed of God
by the hands of men, or the hands of Angels,
mariage was ordained by God himſelf,<note place="margin">Act. 7. 53.</note> which
cannot erre.<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 2.</note> No man, nor Angell, brought
the wife to the husband,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> but God him ſelfe:
ſo marriage hath more honor of God in this,
then all other ordinances of God beſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſolemnized it himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Then it is honourable for the time, for it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17992:9"/>
was the firſt ordinance that God inſtituted,<note place="margin">Mariage the firſt ordinance of God.</note>
euen the firſt thing which he did after man
and woman were created, and that in the
ſtate of innocencie, before either had ſinned,
like the fineſt flower, which will not thriue
but in a cleane ground. Before man had anie
other calling, he was called to be a husband,
therefore it hath the honour of antiquitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other ordinances, becauſe it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
firſt, and is the auncienteſt calling of
men.</p>
            <p>Then it is honourable for the place: For
whereas all other ordinances were inſtituted
out of Paradiſe, mariage was inſtituted in
Paradiſe, in the happieſt place, to ſignifie how
happie they are that marrie in the Lord, they
do not onely marrie one another, but Chriſt
is married vnto them: and ſo marriage hath
the honour of the place aboue all other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
becauſe it was ordained in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
            <p>As God the Father honoured marriage, ſo
did God the Sonne,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> which is called <hi>the ſeed of
the woman:</hi> and therfore Marriage was ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
amongſt women becauſe of this ſeed,
that when Elizabeth brought foorth a ſonne,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 25.</note>
ſhe ſayd, that God had taken away her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke:
counting it the honour of women to
beare children, and by conſequence, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17992:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of women to be married; for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which are borne out of mariage, are the
diſhonor of women, and called by the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
name of Baſtards.<note place="margin">Deu 32. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As Chriſt honoured Mariage with his
birth, ſo he honoured it with his miracles:
for the firſt miracle which Chriſt did,<note place="margin">Chriſtes firſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle at a Mariage.</note> he
wrought at a mariage in Canaan, where he
turned their water into wine: ſo, if Chriſt be
at your mariage, that is, if you marie in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 8.</note>
your water ſhalbe turned into wine, that is,
your peace, and your reſt, and your ioy, and
your happineſſe ſhall begin with your Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
but if you marie not in Chriſt, then your
wine ſhall be turned into water, that is, you
ſhall liue woorſe hereafter then you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>As hee honoured it with miracles, ſo hee
honoured it with praiſes:<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 2.</note> for he compareth
the kingdome of God to a Wedding,<note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> and he
compareth holineſſe to a wedding Garment.
And in the fifth of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticles,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 9.</note> he is wedded him
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>We reade in Scripture of three Mariages
of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of Chriſt.</note> The firſt was, when Chriſt and our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nature met together. The ſecond is, when
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt and our ſoule ioyne together. The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> third is, the vnion of Chriſt and his Chruch.
Theſe are Chriſts three wiues. As Chriſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17992:10"/>
Mariage, ſo do Chriſts Diſciples: for
Iohn calleth the coniunction of Chriſt and
the faithfull,<note place="margin">Reue. 19. 7.</note> a Mariage. And in the one and
twentith of the Reuelation and ninth verſe,<note place="margin">Reu. 21. 9.</note>
the Church hath the name of a Bride,<note place="margin">Reu. 17. 1.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Hereſie is called an harlot.<note place="margin">By mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the womans curſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into two bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> Further, for the
honour of Mariage, Paul ſheweth how by it,
the curſe of the woman was turned into a
bleſsing, for the womans curſe was the paines
which ſhe ſhould ſuffer in her trauaile. Now
by mariage this curſe is turned into a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 16.</note>
for children are the firſt bleſſing in all
the Scripture.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> And therefore Chriſt ſaith, that
ſo ſoone as the mother ſeeth a manchilde
borne into the world,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 11.</note> ſhee forgetteth all her
ſorowes, as though her curſe were turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And further Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 15</note> that by bearing of
children, if ſhe continue<note n="*" place="margin">For thoſe paines wil trie her faith.</note> in faith &amp; patience,
ſhe ſhall be ſaued: as though one curſe were
turned into two bleſſings. For firſt, ſhe ſhall
haue children, and after, ſhe ſhall haue ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What a mercifull God haue we, whoſe
curſes are bleſſings?<note place="margin">Note.</note> So he loued our Parents,
when he puniſhed them, that he could ſcarce
puniſh them for loue, and therfore a comfort
was folded in his iudgement.</p>
            <p>To honour mariage more, it is ſayd, that
God tooke a rib out of Adams ſide,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17992:11"/>
built the woman. He is not ſaid to make
man a wife, but to builde him a wife: ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that man and wife make (as it were) one
houſe together, &amp; that the building was not
perfect, vntill the woman was made as well
as the man, therefore if the building bee not
perfect now, it muſt be deſtroyed againe.</p>
            <p>Before God made the woman: it is ſayd,
that he caſt the man into a ſleepe,<note place="margin">A note of Adams ſleepe.</note> and in his
ſleepe he tooke a rib out of his ſide, and as he
made man of earth, ſo hee made the woman
of bone,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 21.</note> while Adam was a ſleepe.</p>
            <p>This doth teach vs two things: as the firſt
Adam was a figure of the ſecond Adam, ſo
the firſt Adams ſleepe, was a figure of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Adams ſleepe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 22. &amp; 45.</note> and the firſt Adams
ſpouſe, was a figure of the ſecond Adams
ſpouſe. That is, as in the ſleepe of Adam, Eue
was borne, ſo in the ſleep of Chriſt the church
was borne; as a bone came out of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
ſide, ſo blood came out of the ſecond
Adams ſide. As Adams ſpouſe receiued life in
his ſleepe, ſo Chriſts ſpouſe receiued life in
his ſleepe: that is, the death of Chriſt is the
life of the Chruch,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> for the Apoſtle calleth
death a ſleepe:<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> but Chriſt which died is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
life,<note place="margin">A note of Adams ſleepe.</note> ſhewing that in his death we liue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
this ſleep which the man was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
while his wife was created, doth teach vs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17992:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that our affections, our luſtes, and our concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences,
ſhould ſleepe while we goe about
this action. As the man ſlept while his wife
was making, ſo our fleſh ſhould ſleepe while
our wife is chooſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 3.</note> leaſt as the loue of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
wanne Iſaack to bleſſe one for another,
ſo the loue of gentrie, or riches, or beautie,
make vs take one for another.</p>
            <p>To honour mariage more yet, or rather to
teach the married how to honour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">A note of Adams rib</note>
it is ſaid, that the wife was made of the
husbands rib, not of his head, for Paul calleth
the husband the wiues head:<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> nor of the foote,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 23.</note>
for hee muſt not ſet her at his foote: the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
is appointed to ſerue,<note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</note> and the wife to
helpe. If ſhee muſt not matche with the
head, not ſtoupe at the foote, where ſhall he
ſet her then? Hee muſt ſet her at his hart, and
therefore ſhe which ſhould lie in his boſome,
was made in his boſome, and ſhould be as
cloſe to him as his rib, of which ſhe was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned.</p>
            <p>Laſtlie, in all Nations the day of mariage
was reputed the ioyfulleſt day in all their life,
and is reputed ſtill of all, as though the ſunne
of happineſſe began that day to ſhine vppon
vs, when a good wife is brought vnto vs.
Therefore one ſaith: that mariage doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
merrie-age, becauſe a play-fellow is come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17992:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make our age merrie, as Iſaac and Rebecca
ſported together.</p>
            <p>Salomon conſidering all theſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as though we were more indebted vnto
God for this, then other temporall gifts, ſaith,
<hi>Houſe and riches are the inheritance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 14. 14.</note>
               <hi>but a prudent wife commeth of the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Houſe and riches are giuen of God, and
all things elſe, and yet hee ſaith, houſe and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are giuen of parents, but a good wife is
giuen of God: as though a good wife were
ſuch a gift, as we ſhould account from God
alone,<note place="margin">Thus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam doth.</note> and accept it as if he ſhould ſend vs a
preſent from heauen, with this name written
on it,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beaſtes are ordeined for food, and cloathes
for warmth, and flowers for pleaſure, but the
wife is ordeined for man,<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 20.</note> like litle Zoar, a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of refuge to flie to in all his troubles, and
there is no peace comparable vnto her, but
the peace of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Now it muſt needes bee, that Mariage,
which was ordeined of ſuch an excellent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and in ſuch a happie place, and of ſuch
an auncient time, and after ſuch a notable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
muſt likewiſe haue ſpeciall cauſes for the
ordinance of it. Therefore the holy Ghoſt doth
ſhew vs three cauſes of this vnion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17992:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
One is,<note place="margin">Three cauſes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> the propagation of children, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in that when Moſes ſaith; <hi>He created
them male and female:</hi> not both male, nor
both female,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> but one male, and the other fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
as if he created them fit to propagate
other. And therefore when he had created
them ſo, to ſhewe that propagation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
is one ende of mariage, he ſayd vnto
them;<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Encreaſe and multiplie.</hi> That is, Bring
forth children, as other creatures bring forth

            <p>For this cauſe Mariage is called Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,<note place="margin">Why mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note>
which ſignifieth mothers, becauſe it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

and in the ſeminarie of the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which all things ſhould be in vaine, for
want of men to vſe them, for God reſerueth
the great Citie to himſelfe, and this Suburbes

            <p>If children be ſuch a chiefe ende of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
then it ſeemes, that where there can be
no hope of children, for age and other cauſes,
there mariage is not ſo lawfull,<note place="margin">This is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in</note> becauſe it is
maimed of one of his endes, and ſeemes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be ſought for wealth,<note place="margin">Deu. 23. 1.</note> or for luſt, then

grudgingly.</p>
            <p>Twiſe the wife is called <hi>The wife of thy
youth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 5. 18.</note> as though when men are olde,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> the time
of marying were paſt. Therefore God makes
ſuch vnequall matches ſo ridiculous euerie

themſelues.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe is to auoyd fornication;<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe</note>
this Paul signifieth when he ſaith;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>For the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
of fornication, let euerie man haue his

but for auoiding of fornication: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that fornication is vnlawfull too, which
the Papiſts make lawful,<note place="margin">Papiſts ſtewes.</note> in maintaining their
ſtewes, as a ſtage for fornicators to play vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a ſanctuarie to defend them, like to
Abſaloms tent,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 16. 22</note> which was ſpread vpon the
top of the houſe, that all Iſrael might ſee how
he defiled his fathers concubines.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe Malachie ſaith,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> that God
did create but one woman for the man, hee
had power to create moe, but to ſhew that he
would haue him ſtick to one, therfore he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
of one ribbe, but one wife for one huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
And in the Arke there were no mo wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
then men: but foure wiues for foure huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
although it was in the beginning of
the world, when many wiues might ſeeme
neceſſarie to multiplie mankinde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17992:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If any might haue a diſpenſation herein,
it ſeemes that Kinges might bee priuiledged
before any other, becauſe of their ſucceſſion
to the Crowne, if his wife ſhould happen to
be barren: and yet the King is forbidden to
take many wiues,<note place="margin">Deu. 17. 17.</note> in Deut. 17. 17. as well as
the miniſter in 1. Tim. 3. 2. ſhewing,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note> that the
danger of the ſtate doth not counteruaile the
danger of fornication.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe wee reade of none but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Lamech before the floud,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 23.</note> that had more
wiues then one, whome Iouinian calleth a
monſter, becauſe he made two ribbes of one.
And another ſaith, that the name of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
wife doth ſignifie a ſhadowe, becauſe
ſhe was not a wife, but the ſhadow of a wife:
For this cauſe the Scripture neuer biddeth
man to loue his wiues, but to loue his wife,
and ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 5.</note> 
               <hi>They ſhall be two in one fleſh,</hi> not
three, nor foure, but onely two. For this cauſe
king Salomon calleth the whoriſh woman a
ſtrange woman,<note place="margin">Prou. 2. 16.</note> to ſhew that ſhe ſhould be a
ſtranger vnto vs, and we ſhould be ſtrange to
her.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe children which are borne in
mariage are called <hi>Liberi,</hi> which ſignifieth
free borne: and they which are borne out of
mariage are called Baſtardes, that is, baſe
borne,<note place="margin">Gen. 36. 25.</note> like the Mule which is ingendred of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17992:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Aſſe and a Mare.<note place="margin">Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors like the diuell.</note> Therefore adulterers are
likened to the diuell, which ſowed another
mans ground,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 22.</note> other ſowe for a harueſt, but
they ſowe that which they dare not reape.
Therefore children borne in wedlocke are
counted Gods bleſſing, becauſe they come
by vertue of that bleſſing,<note place="margin">Pſa. 128. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note>
But before Adam and Eue were maried,
God neuer ſayd, <hi>Increaſe,</hi> ſhewing that he
did curſe, and not bleſſe ſuch increaſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we reade not in all the Scripture of one
Baſtard that cam to any good,<note place="margin">Baſtards.</note> but only Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah,<note place="margin">Iudg. 11. 1.</note>
and to ſhewe that no inheritance did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them in heauen,<note place="margin">They might be ſaued, but they had the marke of the curſe.</note> they had no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in earth, neither were counted of the
congregation as other were. Deut. Chap. 23.

            <p>Now becauſe Mariage was appointed for
a remedie againſt fornication, therefore the
law of God inflicted a ſorer puniſhment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him which did commit vncleannes after
mariage,<note place="margin">Leu. 20. 10.</note> then vpon him which was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,<note place="margin">Deu. 22. 22.</note>
becauſe he ſinned,<note place="margin">Maried fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> although he had the
remedie of ſinne, like a rich theefe which

            <p>Now if mariage be a remedie againſt the
ſinne of fornication, then vnleſſe Miniſters
may committe the ſinne of fornication,<note place="margin">Mariage of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> it
ſeemes that they may vſe the remedie as well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17992:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as other: for as it is better for one man to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
then to burne, ſo it is better for all men to
marie then to burne: and therfore Paul ſaith,
<hi>Mariage is honourable amongſt all men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 9.</note> And
againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> 
               <hi>For the auoiding of fornication let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man haue his wife.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> And as though he did
foreſee that ſome would except the Miniſter
in time to come; in the firſt Epiſtle of Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
the third Chapter and ſecond verſe, he
ſpeaketh more preciſely of the Miniſters
wife then of any other,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note> ſaying; <hi>Let him be the
husband of one wife.</hi> And leaſt ye ſhould ſay
that by one wife he meaneth one Benefice,
like the Papiſts; he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth himſelfe in the
fourth verſe, and ſaith, that hee muſt bee
one that can rule his houſe well, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Sure God would not haue theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be baſtardes, and therefore it is like
that he alloweth the Miniſter a wife. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paul ſaid well,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 6.</note> that he had no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
for Virginitie: for Virginitie cannot
be commaunded, becauſe it is a ſpeciall gift,
but not a ſpeciall gift to Miniſters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are not to be bound more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A peculiar gift may not be made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rule, becauſe none can vſe it but they
which haue it. And therefore in 1. Cor. 7. 17.
he ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 17.</note> 
               <hi>As God hath diſtributed to euery man,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17992:15"/>
ſo let him walke.</hi> That is, if he haue not the gift
of continencie he is bound to marrie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paule commandeth in the ſeuenth verſe,
whether he be miniſter or other, <hi>If they can
not abſtaine, let them marrie,</hi> as though they
tempted God if they married not.</p>
            <p>The Lawe was generall, <hi>It is not good for
man to be alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> exempting one order of men
no more then another.<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 11.</note> And againe, Chriſt
ſpeaking of chaſtitie, ſaith; <hi>All men cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
this thing.</hi> Therefore, vnleſſe we knowe
that this order of men can receiue this thing,
Chriſt forbids to bynde them more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and therefore as the Prieſts were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that taught the Law, ſo Chriſt choſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
that were married, to preach the Goſpel.
Therefore the doctrine of Papiſts is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of deuils:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 3.</note> for Paul calleth the forbidding
of marriage, the doctrine of deuils, a fit title
for all their bookes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if marriage be a remedie againſt
ſinne, then Marriage it ſelfe is no ſinne: for if
marriage it ſelfe were a ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> we might not
marrie for anie cauſe, becauſe we muſt not do
the leaſt euill, that the greateſt good may
come of it: and if marriage be not a ſin, then
the<note n="*" place="margin">Be not thou vain, and theſe words will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue.</note> duties of marriage are not ſinne, that is,
the ſecret of marriage is not euill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> not onely <hi>Marriage is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:17992:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the bed is honourable, that is, euen
the action of marriage is as lawfull as marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 8.</note> Paule ſaith, <hi>Let the huſband giue
vnto the wise due beneuolence.</hi> Here is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
to yeeld this dutie: that which
is commaunded, is lawfull; and not to do it,
is a breach of the commaundement. Therfore
marriage was inſtituted before any ſinne was,
to ſhew that there is no ſinne in it, if it be not
abuſed: but becauſe this is rare, therefore after
women were deliuered,<note place="margin">Leuit. 12. 4. 5. &amp;c.</note> God appoynted
them to be purified, ſhewing that ſome ſtaine
or other doth creepe into this action, which
had need to be repented,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 5.</note> and therefore when
they praied, Paul would not haue them come
together, leaſt their prayers ſhould be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>The third cauſe is to auoyd the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſolitarineſſe ſignified in theſe words,<note place="margin">The third cauſe.</note>
               <hi>It is not good for man to be alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> as though he
had ſaid; this life would be miſerable and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and vnpleaſant to man, if the Lord had
not giuen him a wife to companie his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
If it be not good for man to be alone,
then it is good for man to haue a fellow: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as God created a paire of all other kinds,
ſo he created a paire of this kinde.</p>
            <p>We ſay that one is none, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17992:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be fewer then one, he cannot be leſſer
then one, he cannot be weaker then one: and
therfore the wiſe man ſaith;<note place="margin">Eccl. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Woe to him which
is alone,</hi> that is, he which is alone ſhall haue
woe. Thoughts, and cares, and feares, will
come to him, becauſe he hath none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him, as theeues ſteale in when the houſe
is emptie; like a Turtle, which hath loſt his
mate, like one legge when the other is cutte
off, like one wing when the other is clipte,
ſo had the man bene if the woman had not
bene ioyned to him: therefore for mutuall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
God coupled two together, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
troubles which lie vppon vs in this
world, might be eaſed with the comfort and
help one of another, and that the poore in the
worlde might haue ſome comfort as well as
the rich,<note place="margin">Pro. 19. 6.</note> for <hi>The poore man</hi> (ſaith Salomon)
<hi>is forſaken of his owne brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 27. 10.</note> yet God hath
prouided one comforter for him, like Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
armour-bearer,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14. 7</note> that ſhall neuer forſake
him, that is another ſelfe, which is the onely
commoditie (as I may tearme it) wherein the

ſome perſons ſhould haue no helper, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
no friend at all.</p>
            <p>But as it is not good to be alone, ſo Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſheweth,<note place="margin">Prou. 21. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That it is better to be alone,
then to dwell with a froward wife,</hi> which is like

which ſome call the way to good wiues

and ſtriuing, a man ſhould take counſell
of all the world,<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 23. 4.</note> leaſt he light vpon a curſe,
while hee ſeekes for a bleſſing. As Moſes
conſidered what ſpies he ſent into Chanaan,
ſo thou muſt regarde whom thou ſendeſt to
ſpie out a wife for thee.<note place="margin">Two ſpies for a wife.</note> Diſcretion is a warie
ſpie, but fancie is a raſh ſpie, and liketh whom

            <p>In the Reuelation Antichriſt is deſcribed
by a woman, and in Zacharie ſinne is called
a woman, which ſheweth, that women haue
many faultes,<note place="margin">Zach. 5. 7.</note> therefore hee which chuſeth of
them, had need haue iudgement, and make
an Anatomie of their hearts and mindes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſay, This ſhalbe mine. For the wiſeſt
man ſaith; <hi>I haue found one man of a thouſand,

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:17992:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Although this may be vnderſtoode of his
Concubines, yet it implyeth that generally
there is a greater infirmitie in women, than
in men, becauſe hee compareth them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as though there were a dearth of good
women ouer the world.</p>
            <p>For helpe hereof, in 1. Cor. 7. 39. we are
taught to marrie in the Lord, then we muſt
chuſe in the Lord too: therefore we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne

an vnderſtanding wife.<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 12.</note> If Abrahams ſeruant
praied vnto the Lord to proſper his buſines,
when he went about to chuſe a wife for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how ſhouldſt thou pray when thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
about a wife for thy ſelfe, that thou mayſt
ſay after, <hi>My lot is fallen in a pleaſant ground?</hi>
To direct thee to a right choiſe herein, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt giues thee two rules in the choiſe
of a wife,<note place="margin">Godly, &amp; fitte.</note> Godlineſſe and fitneſſe: Godlines,
becauſe our Spouſe muſt bee like Chriſtes
Spouſe, that is, graced with gifts, and imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with vertues, as if we married holineſſe
her ſelfe. For the marriage of man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is reſembled of the Apoſtle to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Chriſt and the Church.<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 29.</note> Now the
Church is called holie, becauſe ſhee is holie.
In the ſixt of the Canticles ſhe is called vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,<note place="margin">Cant. 6. 8.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:17992:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becauſe ſhe is vndefiled.<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 9.</note> In the 45. Pſal.
ſhe is called faire within, becauſe her beautie
is inward;<note place="margin">1. Sa. 16. 7.</note> So our Spouſe ſhould be holie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,
and faire within. As God reſpecteth
the heart, ſo we muſt reſpect the heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that muſt loue, and not the face. Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
hath euer bene a ſuiter to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt,
and pride to the higheſt, and lightneſſe
to the faireſt: and for reuenge hereof, his ioy
hath euer ended with his wiues youth, which
tooke her beautie with it. The goods of the
world are good, and the goods of the bodie
are good, but the goods of the minde are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 13.</note>
As Paul commendeth Faith, Hope, and
Charitie, but ſaith the greateſt of theſe is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
ſo may I commend beautie, and riches
and godlineſſe, but the beſt of theſe is godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
becauſe it hath the things which it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and makes euery ſtate alike with her gift of
contentation.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">A fit wife.</note> the mate muſt be fitte: It is not
inough to be vertuous, but to be ſutable, for
diuers women haue many vertues, and yet do
not fitte with ſome men; &amp; diuers men haue
many vertues, and yet doe not fit to ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
and therefore we ſee many times, euen
the godly couples to iar when they are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
becauſe there is ſome vnfitneſſe between
them, which makes oddes. What is oddes, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17992:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the contrary to euen?<note place="margin">The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is not appro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, but the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</note> therefore make them
euen (ſaith one) and there will be no oddes.
From hence came the firſt vſe of the Ring in
weddings, to repreſent this euenneſſe: for if
it be ſtraiter then the finger, it will pinch, and
if it be wider then the finger it will fall off;
but if it be fitte, it neither pincheth nor ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth:
So they which are like, ſtriue not, but
they which are vnlike, as fire and water. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one obſerueth, that concorde is nothing
but likeneſſe, &amp; all that ſtrife is for vnfitneſſe:
as in thinges when they fitte not together,
and in perſons, when they ſuite not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>How was God pleaſed when he had found
a King according to his owne hart?<note place="margin">1. Sa. 2. 35.</note> So ſhall
that man be pleaſed that findes a wife accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne heart, whether he be rich
or poore, his peace ſhall affoord him a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life,<note place="margin">The ſaying of a godly man.</note> and teach him to ſing, <hi>In loue is no
lack.</hi> Therfore a godly man in our time than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Lord that he had not onely giuen
him a godly wife, but a fitte wife: for he ſayd
not that ſhe was the wiſeſt, nor the holieſt,
nor the humbleſt, nor the modeſteſt wife in
the world, but the fitteſt wife for him in the
world, which euery man ſhould thinke when
that knot is tied, or elſe ſo often as he ſeeth a
better, hee will wiſh that his choice were to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17992:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make againe. As he did thanke God for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him a fit wife, ſo the vnmarried ſhould
pray God to ſend him a fit wife: for if they
be not like, they will not like.</p>
            <p>The fitneſſe is commended by the holy
Ghoſt in two words: one is in the ſecond of
Geneſis,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> and the other is in 2. Cor. 6. 14. that
in Geneſis is,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Meet,</hi> God ſaith, <hi>I will make man
a helpe Meet for him.</hi> Shewing that a wife can
not helpe wel, vnleſſe ſhe be meet. Further, it
ſheweth that man is ſuch an excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that no creature was like vnto him, or
meet for him, till the woman was made.</p>

Father, and brought his daughter vnto her

            <p>Beſide, there is a law, that if a man defloure

of the virgin do not like of the marriage, then
he ſhall pay vnto her the dowrie of virgins,
that is, ſo much as her virginitie is eſteemed,
ſo that the father might allow the mariage, or

            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Num. 30. 6.</note> there is a law, that if any free

be kept, vnleſſe her father approue it, becauſe
ſhe is not free: therefore if ſhee did vow to

to breake it. Againe, our Sauiour ſaith, that in

            <p>Wil you take your fathers money, and wil

This vnequall mariage,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 4.</note> was the chiefe cauſe
that brought the floud, and the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Giants, and monſtrous births, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by their monſtrous children what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous

            <p>In Matth. 22. Chriſt ſheweth, that before
parties married, they were woont to put on
faire and new garments,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 11</note> which were called
VVedding garmentes, a warning vnto all
which put on wedding garments,<note place="margin">Wedding garment.</note> to put on
truth and holineſſe too, which ſo preciſely is
reſembled by that garment more then other.
It is noted in the fourteenth of Luke, that of
all them which were inuited to the Lordes
banquet,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and came not onely hee which had
married a wife,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 21.</note> did not deſire to be excuſed,
but ſaid ſtoutly, <hi>I cannot come.</hi> Shewing how
this ſtate dooth occupie a man moſt, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17992:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
draw him often from the ſeruice of God:
and therefore we had not neede to take the

In the ſecond of Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 2. 9. &amp; 3. 1.</note> it is obſerued of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
man, that he did not curſe the day of his
birth, vntill his wife brake foorth into blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie,
ſhewing, that wicked women are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to change the ſtedfaſteſt man, more then
all temptations beſide. Sampſon would take
a Philiſtian to wife,<note place="margin">Iudg. 14.</note> but he loſt his honor, his
ſtrength, and his life by her, leaſt any ſhould
do the like.</p>
            <p>But what a notable warning is that in the
2. Chro. 21. 6. where the holy Ghoſt ſayth:<note place="margin">2. Chro. 21. 6</note>
               <hi>Iehoram walked in the waies of Ahad,</hi> for he
had the daughter of Ahad to wife, as though
it were a miracle if hee had bene better then
he was, becauſe his wife was a temptation.
Miſerable is that man which is fettered with
a woman that liketh not his Religion, ſhee
will be nibling at his praier, and at his ſtudie,
and at his meditations, till ſhe haue tyred his
deuotions, and turned the edge of his ſoule,
as Dauid was tired of his malapert Michol,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 6. 16.</note>
ſhe mocked him for his zeale, and liked her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in her follie. Many haue fallen at this
ſtone:<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 32.</note> Therefore as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Remember
Lots wife;</hi> ſo when thou marrieſt, remember
Iehorams wife, and bee not wedded to her
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17992:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which hath not the Wedding garment: but
let vnitie goe firſt, and let vnion follow after,
and hope not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert her, but feare that ſhe
will peruert thee, leaſt thou ſaie after like him
which ſhould come to the Lordes banquette,
<hi>I haue married a wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 20.</note>

            <p>Yet the chiefeſt point is behinde,<note place="margin">The duties of mariage</note> that is,
our duties. The dueties of marriage may be
reduced to the dueties of man and wife one
towarde another, and their dueties towarde
their children, and their duetie toward their
ſeruants. For themſelues, ſaith one, they muſt
thinke themſelues like two birdes,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 26.</note> the one is
the cocke,<note place="margin">The man and wife like Cock and dam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and the other is the dam: the cocke
flieth abroad to bring in, and the dam ſitteth
vpon the neſt to keepe all at home. So God
hath made the man to trauell abroad, and the
woman to keepe home: and ſo their nature,
and their witte, and their ſtrength, are fitted
accordingly; for the mans pleaſure is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and the womans within.</p>
            <p>In euerie State there is ſome one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which belongeth to that calling more
than other: as Iuſtice vnto Magiſtrates,
and Knowledge vnto Preachers, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
vnto Souldiers: ſo Loue is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
vertue, which ſignes Muſicke to their
whole life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:17992:26"/>
Wedlocke is made of two loues, which I
may call the firſt loue,<note place="margin">Mariage compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of two loues.</note> and the after loue. As
euerie man is taught to loue God before hee
be bid to loue his neighbour; ſo they muſt
loue GOD before they can loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>To ſhewe the loue which ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
man and wife, Mariage is called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugium,</hi>
which ſignifieth a knitting or ioyning
together: ſhewing, that vnleſſe there be a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of hearts, and a knitting of affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it is not Mariage in deede, but in
ſhew and name, and they ſhal dwel in a houſe
like two poyſons in a ſtomacke, and one ſhall
euer be ſicke of another.</p>
            <p>Therefore, firſt that they may loue, and
keepe loue one with another, it is neceſſarie
that they both loue God, and as their loue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
toward him, ſo it ſhall increaſe each
to other. But the man muſt take heede that
his loue toward his wife be not greater than
his loue toward God,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> as Adam &amp; Sampſons
were,<note place="margin">Iudg 16. 17</note> for all vnlawfull loue will turne to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as the loue of Amon did toward Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 13. 15</note>
and becauſe Chriſt hath forbidden it,
therefore hee will croſſe it. This made Vriah
ſo fearful,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 36</note> leaſt the pleaſure of his wife ſhould
withdraw his heart from God, that he would
not goe to his owne houſe, ſo long as he had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17992:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſe to mourne and pray, although he had a
wife which feared God like himſelfe: &amp; that
you may ſee it is no cheape dalliance for the
husband to make the wife, or the wife to
make the husband leſſe zealous then they
were. In Deut. 13. the wife which did draw
her husband from God is condemned to die:
therefore good wiues, when their husbands
purpoſe any good, ſhould incourage them
like Iacobs wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 16.</note> which bade him do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word of God, and if they ſee them
minded to doe any euill, they ſhould ſtay
them,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 19</note> like the wife of Pylate, which counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her husband not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne Chriſt. For
ſeeing holineſſe is called the Wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 11</note>
who ſhall weare this wedding garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
if they weare it not which are wedded? When
one holy hath found another, then the holieſt
ſeemeth to make the Mariage, and his angels
come to the feaſt.</p>
            <p>To paſſe ouer ſleights which ſeldome

The beſt pollicie in mariage is to begin well,<note place="margin">Beſt polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to begin wel.</note>
for as boords well ioined at the firſt, ſit cloſe
euer after, but if they ſquare at the firſt, they
warpe more and more: So they which are
well ioined, are well maried, but they which
offend their loue before it be ſetled, fade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
day like a Marigold, which cloſeth her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17992:27"/>
flower as the ſunne goeth down, til they hate
one another more then they loued at firſt.</p>
            <p>To begin this concord well,<note place="margin">They muſt learn one anothers nature.</note> it is neceſſarie
to learne one anothers nature, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affections, and one anothers infirmities,
becauſe ye muſt be helpers, and ye cannot
helpe vnleſſe you know the diſeaſe. All the
iarres almoſt which doe trouble this band,
doe riſe of this, that one dooth not hit the
meaſure of the others heart, to applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to eithers nature, whereby it commeth
to paſſe, that neyther can refrain when either
is offended; but one ſharpeneth another,
when they had neede to be calmed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt learn of Paul to faſhion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
one to the other,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 20.</note> if they would win
one another, and if any iarre doe ariſe, one
ſayth; in no wiſe deuide beds for it, for then
the ſunne goeth-down vpon their wrath,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 25.</note> and
the meanes of reconcilement is taken away.
Giue paſſions no times, for if ſome mans an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſtand but at night, it turneth to malice
which is vncurable.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 19</note> that there will bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
in the church: ſo ſure there wilbe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
offenſes in mariage: but as he ſaith, theſe
are trials who haue faith, ſo theſe are but try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
who are good husbands, &amp; who are good
wiues. His anger muſt be ſuch a mood, as if he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17992:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did chide with himſelfe, and their ſtrife as it
were a ſauce made of purpoſe to ſharpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
loue when it waxeth vnpleaſaunt: like Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
arrowes which were not ſhot to hurt,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 20. 20</note>
but to giue warning.<note place="margin">A ſweet example teaching how cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhall neuer fall out.</note> Knowing once a couple
which were both cholerick, and yet neuer fel
out, I asked the man how they did order the
matter, that their infirmitie did not make
them diſcord. He anſwered me, when her fit
is vpon her I yeeld to her, as Abraham did to
Sara;<note place="margin">Gen. 16. 6.</note> and when my fit is vpon me, ſhe yeelds
to me, and ſo we neuer ſtriue together, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.
Me thought it was a good example
to commend vnto all married folkes: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one hath his frenzie and loueth them that
can beare his infirmitie. Whom will a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſuffer, if ſhe will not ſuffer her husband?
and whoſe defects will a man beare, if he will
not beare hers which beareth his? Thus much
of their duties in generall, now to their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
offices.</p>
            <p>The man may ſpell his dutie out of his
name,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 23.</note> for he is called <hi>the Head:</hi> to ſhew, that
as the eye, and the tongue, and the eare, are in
the head, to direct the whole body: ſo the
man ſhould be ſtored with wiſdome, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
&amp; knowledge, and diſcretion, to
direct his whole family: for it is not right that
the worſe ſhould rule the better, but the better
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17992:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould rule the worſe, as the beſt rules all.
The husband ſaith, that his wife muſt obey
him becauſe he is her better, therefore if hee
let her bee better than himſelfe, he ſeemes to
free her from her obedience, and binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to obey her.</p>
            <p>His firſt duetie is called <hi>Harting,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands firſt dutie.</note> that is,
hartie affection. As they are hand, faſted, ſo
they muſt be heart-faſted, for the eye, and the
tongue, and the hand, will be her enemies, if
the heart be not her friend. As Chriſt draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all the commaundements to loue, ſo I
may drawe all their dueties to loue, which is
the hearts gift to the bride at her marriage.
Firſt, he muſt chooſe his loue, &amp; then he muſt
loue his choiſe: this is the oyle which maketh
all things eaſie. In Salomons ſong, which is
nothing elſe but a deſcription of Chriſt the
Bridegrome, and the Church his ſpouſe, one
calleth the other Loue, to ſhew, that though
both doe not honour alike, yet both ſhould
loue alike, which the man may doe without
ſubiection.</p>
            <p>The man is to his wife in the place of
Chriſt to his Church:<note place="margin">Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in his Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age only.</note> therefore the Apoſtle
requireth ſuch an affection of him towardes
his Spouſe, as Chriſt beareth towarde his
Spouſe:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 25.</note> for he ſaith; <hi>Husbandes loue your
wiues, as Chriſt loued his Congregation,</hi> that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17992:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is, with a holie loue, and with a heartie loue,
and with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant loue, as the Church would
be loued of Chriſt. Will not a man loue his
glorie?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 7.</note> Why Paul calleth the woman <hi>the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the man,</hi> for her reuerence makes him to
be reuerenced, and her praiſe makes him to
be praiſed. Therefore hee which loueth not
his wife, loueth his ſhame, becauſe ſhe is his
glorie.<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 28.</note> Eph. 5. 28. Paul ſaith, <hi>Hee which loueth
his wife, loueth himſelfe,</hi> for thereby he enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
peace and comfort, and helpe to himſelfe
in all his affaires: therefore in the ſame verſe
Paul counſelleth husbands to loue their wiues
as their bodies. And after in the 33. verſe, as
though it were too litle to loue them as their
bodies,<note place="margin">Leui. 19. 18</note> he ſaith: <hi>Let euerie one loue his wife
as himſelfe,</hi> that is, as his bodie and ſoule too.
For if God commaunded men to loue their
neighbours as themſelues, much more are
they bound to loue their wiues as themſelues
which are their next neighbors. As Elkanah
did not loue his wife leſſe for her barrenneſſe,
but ſaid,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Am not I better vnto thee then tenne
ſonnes?</hi> as though hee fauoured her more, for
that which ſhe thought her ſelfe deſpiſed. So
a good husband will not take occaſion to
loue his wife leſſe for her infirmities, but
comfort her more for them, as this man did,
that ſhe may beare with his infirmities too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17992:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 7.</note> that <hi>a man ſhould leaue
father and mother, and cleaue to his wife,</hi> hee
ſignifieth how Chriſt left his father for his
ſpouſe, and that man doth not loue his wife
ſo much as he ſhould, vntil he affect her more
then euer he did his father or mother. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when God bad Abraham forſake all his
kinred,<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 1.</note> yet he bad him not forſake his wife:
as though the other ſometime might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
for God, but the wife muſt be kept for
God, like a charge which bindeth for tearme
of life.</p>
            <p>His next dutie to loue,<note place="margin">The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dutie.</note> is a fruit of his loue:
that is, to let all things be common betweene
them, which were priuat before. The man &amp;
wife are partners,<note place="margin">Man and wife are two part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> like two oares in a boate,
therefore he muſt diuide offices and affaires,
and goods with her, cauſing her to be feared
and reuerenced, and obeyed of her children
and ſeruants like himſelfe, for ſhe is an vnder
officer in his Commonweale, and therefore
ſhee muſt bee aſſiſted and borne out like his
deputie, as the Prince ſtandeth with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
for his owne quiet, becauſe they are
the legs which beare him vp. To ſhew this
communitie betweene husband and wife,
he is to maintaine her as he dooth himſelfe,
becauſe Chriſt ſayth,<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 8.</note> 
               <hi>They are no more two
but one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:17992:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore when hee mayntaineth her, hee
muſt thinke it but one charge, becauſe hee
mayntaineth no more but himſelfe, for they
two are one. He may not ſay as husbands are
woont to ſay, That which is thine is mine,
and that which is mine is mine owne; but
that which is mine is thine and my ſelfe too.
For as it is ſayde,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 32.</note> 
               <hi>Hee which hath giuen vs
his ſonne, can hee denie vs any thing?</hi> So
ſhee may ſay, hee which hath giuen mee
himſelfe, can hee denie mee any thing? The
bodie is better then the goods, therefore
if the bodie bee mine, the goods are mine
too.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands laſt dutie.</note> hee muſt tender her as much as all
her friends, becauſe he hath taken her from
her friends, and couenaunted to tender her
for them all. To ſhew how he ſhould ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 7.</note> Peter ſayth, <hi>Honour the woman as the
weaker veſſell.</hi> As wee doe not handle glaſſes
like pots, becauſe they are weaker veſſels,
but touch them nicely and ſoftly, for feare
of crackes, ſo a man muſt intreat his wife
with gentleneſſe and ſoftneſſe, not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that wiſedome, nor that fayth, nor that
patience, nor that ſtrength in the weaker veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
which ſhould be in the ſtronger; but think
when he takes a wife, he takes a vineyard, not
grapes, but a vineyard to beare him grapes:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17992:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore he muſt ſowe it, and dreſſe it, and
water it, and fence it, and thinke it a good
vineyard, if at laſt it bring foorth grapes.
So hee muſt not looke to find a wife with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a fault, but thinke that ſhe is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him to reclaime her from her faults;
for all are defectiues: and if he find the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
true, That in ſpace commeth grace, hee
muſt reioice as much at his wife when ſhee
amendeth, as the Husbandman reioiceth
when his Vineyarde beginneth to fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie.</p>
            <p>This is farre from ciuile warres betweene
man and wife;<note place="margin">Husbands muſt hold their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and wiues their tongues.</note> in all his offices is found no
office to fight. If hee cannot reforme his
wife without beating he is woorthie to bee
beaten for chuſing no better: when he hath
vſed all meanes that hee may, and yet ſhee is
like her ſelfe, hee muſt take her for his croſſe,
and ſay with Ieremie, <hi>This is my croſſe, and I
will beare it.</hi> But if he ſtrike her, he takes away
his hand from her, which was the firſt part he
gaue her to ioine them together: and ſhee
may put vp her complaint againſt him, that
hee hath taken away part of her goods. Her
cheekes are made for thy lippes, and not for
thy fiſts.</p>
            <p>The verie name of a wife is like the Angel

Then weigh and iudge how harſh and bitter

God would not haue the husband goe

he haue him warre with his wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God gaue him that yeare to ſtay at home

            <p>Beſide a yoke-fellow,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> ſhe is called a <hi>helper,</hi>

be the reioycing of their husbandes, euen like
Dauids harpe to comfort Saule.<note place="margin">1. Sa. 16. 23</note> Therefore it
is ſaide of Rebeccah, that ſhe prepared meate

wife is knowne when her wordes, and deedes,
and countenances are ſuch as her husband
loueth ſhe muſt not examine whether hee be
wiſe or ſimple, but that ſhee is his wife: and
therefore they which are bound muſt obey,
as Abigail loued her husband though hee
were a foole:<note place="margin">1. Sa. 25. 3.</note> for the wife is as much deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for taking rule ouer her husband, as he
for yeelding it vnto her. Therefore one ſaith,
that a mankinde woman is a monſter, that is,
halfe a woman, and halfe a man. It becomes
not the miſtreſſe to be maiſter, no more than
it beſeemeth the maiſter to be miſtreſſe, but
both to ſaile with their owne winde.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we call the wife Huſwife: that is,
house-wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 38. 14.</note> not a ſtreete wife, like Thamar,
nor a field-wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 34. 2.</note> like Dinah:<note place="margin">Whye wiues are called huſwies.</note> but a houſe-wife,

a praie: if her husband be from her, vntill he

that is, ſeparate from man; for <hi>Vidua</hi>
doth ſignifie, <hi>A viro diuiſa:</hi> that is, widowe

now ſhe muſt haue no fellowſhip, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie

            <p>As it becommeth her to keepe home, ſo it
becommeth her to keepe ſilence, and alway
ſpeake the beſt of her head. Other ſeeke their
honour in triumph, but ſhe muſt ſeek her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

woman to ſet light by her husband, nor to

vſe the wife? Becauſe this is the qualitie
of that ſexe, to ouerthwart, and vpbraide, and
ſue the preheminence of their husbandes,
therfore the Philoſophers could not tell how
to define a wife,<note place="margin">A wife the contrarie to a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> but called her, <hi>The contrarie
to a husband,</hi> as though nothing were ſo croſſe
and contrarie to a man, as a wife. This is not
ſcripture, but no ſlaunder to many.</p>
            <p>As Dauid exalted the loue of women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other loues,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 1. 26.</note> ſo Salomon mounteth

ſtubborn, ſullen, taunting, gainſaying, outfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17992:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with ſuch a bitter humor, that one
would think they were molten out of the ſalt

            <p>Though a woman be wiſe, and painefull,
and haue many good parts, yet if ſhe bee a

               <hi>Not anſwering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi>
and hold her peace, to keepe the peace.
Therefore they which keepe ſilence, are well
ſaid to hold their peace, becauſe ſilence often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
dooth keepe the peace, when wordes
would breake it.</p>
            <p>To her ſilence and patience, ſhe muſt adde
<hi>The acceptable obedience,</hi> which makes a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
rule while ſhe is ruled. This is the wiues
tribute to her husband: for ſhee is not called
his head, but he is called her head. Great
cauſe hath man to make much of his wife, for
great and many are her duties to him, for
Paul ſaith;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 23</note>

The firſt ſubiection of woman began at

And therefore as the man named all other

to him, as a ſeruant which commeth when

            <p>After their duties one to another,<note place="margin">Their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note> they

Another ſayth,<note place="margin">Reuel. 5. 10.</note> that a maiſter in his familie

            <p>As Peter being conuerted,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 23.</note> muſt conuert
his brethren; ſo the maiſter being conuerted,
muſt conuert his ſeruants. For therfore God
ſaid, that he would not hide his counſel from
Abraham, because he would teach his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and ſurely all dutie which is not done of
conſcience, is but ey-ſeruice, and fayleth
at moſt need. as Ziba betrayed his mayſter,
when he ſhould haue defended him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17992:36"/>
before Oneſimus was conuerted, Paul

hee was conuerted, he calleth him more then
ſeruant, becauſe ſuch a ſeruant is better then
many ſeruants.</p>
            <p>Therfore though Laban was wicked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 27.</note>
yet hee reioyced that Iacob his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt

better for him.<note place="margin">Ioſh. 14. 55</note> Ioſhua ſayth: <hi>I and my houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

ſhould receiue none into their houſes,
but whome they can gouerne, as Ioſhua did:
and if any haue crept into their doores, then
they muſt put him foorth againe, for Dauid

him out of my doores before he be a ſwearer,
and a theefe, for a lyer will grow to a ſwearer
and a theefe in a daye, as a Dicer groweth

of Cornelius,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 2.</note> that all his houſhold ſerued

            <p>By this we ſee, as Dauid did limit Ioab that

an error: for there is difference betweene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
ſeruants, and infidell ſeruants: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
were made ſlaues to the Iewes, becauſe
God hated them, and would humble them;
but their brethren did ſerue them like hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which ſhould be trained by them.</p>
            <p>It is not a baſe nor vile thing to bee called
a ſeruaunt,<note place="margin">Eſay. 42. 1.</note> for our Lord is called a ſeruaunt:<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 18</note>
which teacheth Chriſtians, to vſe their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts
well for Chriſtes ſake, ſeeing they are
ſeruants too, and haue one maiſter Chriſt. As
Dauid ſpeaketh of man, ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſa. 8. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Thou haſt
made him a little lower then the Angels;</hi> ſo I
may ſay of ſeruaunts, that God hath made
them a little lower then children, not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but the next to children, as one would
ſay inferior children, or ſonnes in law.</p>
            <p>And therefore the houſholder is called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
familias:</hi> which ſignifieth, a Father of his
familie, becauſe he ſhould haue a fatherly care
ouer his ſeruants, as if they were his children:
and not vſe them onely for their labour, like
beaſts.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the name of a ſeruaunt, dooth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17992:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not ſignifie ſuffering, but doing; therfore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
muſt not exerciſe their hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them
but ſet their hands to worke,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 13</note> and yet as God
layeth no more vpon his ſeruaunts then hee
makes them able to beare, ſo men ſhould
laie no more vpon their ſeruaunts then they
are able to beare.<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 10.</note> For a good man (ſaith Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
will be mercifull to his beaſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee will bee more mercifull to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>That ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not worthie to be ſerued which
cannot affoord that his ſeruants ſhould ſerue
God as well as himſelfe. Giue vnto God that
which is Gods, and then thou maiſt take that
which is thine. <hi>He that careth not for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie</hi>
(ſaith Paul) <hi>is worſe then an infidell:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <hi>Giue me not too much nor too litle,

or elſe they are worſe then infidels to,
becauſe couetouſnes is called Idolatry,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 5.</note> which
is worſe then infidelitie, for it is leſſe rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not to honor the king then to ſet vp ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
king againſt him, as the Idolatrous do
againſt the king of heauen.</p>
            <p>Next vnto ſeruants inſtruction and labors,
muſt bee conſidered their corrections. As
Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Fathers prouoke not your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17992:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wrath:</hi> So may I ſay, Maiſters prouoke not
your ſeruants to wrath: that is, vſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes,
and ſuch corrections, that you do not
prouoke them, but moue them, that you do
not exaſperate them, but winne them, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiling
wordes and vnreaſonable fierceneſſe,
doth more hurt then good. And therefore the
law of God did charge the maiſter, that he
ſhould not inflict aboue fortie ſtripes vpon
his ſeruant,<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 2.</note> leaſt he ſhould ſeeme deſpiſed in
his eyes For while a childe, or ſcholler, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
doth thinke that he is reproued for loue,
or beaten with reaſon, it makes him thinke of
his fault and is aſhamed: but when hee ſeeth
that he is rebuked with curſes, &amp; beaten with
ſtaues, as though they were hated like a dog,
his heart is hardned againſt the man which
correcteth him, and the fault for the which he
is corrected, and after he becommeth deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
like a horſe which turneth vpon the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
and therfore thinke that God euen then
chides you whenſoeuer you chide in ſuch
rage. For though there be a fault, yet ſome
thinges muſt be winkt at, and ſome thinges
muſt be forgiuen, and ſome puniſhed with
a looke, for hee which takes the forfeite
of euerie offence, ſhall neuer bee in anie
reſt, but vexe himſelfe more then his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:17992:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Further I haue heard experience ſay,<note place="margin">The mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt correct his men, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe her maides.</note> that
in theſe puniſhments it is moſt meet and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the offender, that the man ſhould
correct his men, and the woman her maides:
for a mans nature ſcorneth to be beaten of a
woman, and a maides nature is corrupted
with the ſtripes of a man. Therefore wee
reade, that Abraham would not meddle with
his mayd, but committed her to his wife, and
ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 16. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Doe with her as it pleaſeth thee:</hi> as if hee
ſhould ſay, It belongeth not to mee but to
thee.</p>
            <p>Laſtly we put the dutie toward children,<note place="margin">Their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their children.</note>
becauſe they come laſt to their handes. In
Latin children are called <hi>pignora,</hi> that is, <hi>pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
as if I ſhould ſay, a pledge of the husbands
loue to the wife, and a pledge of the wiues
loue toward the husband: for there is nothing
which doth ſo knit loue between the man and
the wife, as the frute of the wombe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when Leah began to conceiue, ſhe ſayd,
now my husband will loue me;<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 31.</note> as though the
husband did loue for children. If a woman
haue many defects (as Leah had) yet this is
the mendes which ſhe makes her husband, to
bring him children, which is the right wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Ring, that ſealeth and maketh vp the
marriage. When their father and mother fall
out, they perke vp betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like litle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17992:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and with many pretie ſportes make
truce when other dare not ſpeake to them.
Therefore now let vs conſider what theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones may challenge of their parents, that
ſtand them in ſtead of Lawyers. Before we
teach parents to loue their children, they had
need be taught not to loue them too much,
for Dauids darling, was Dauids traitor: and
this is the manner of God, when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to ſet any thing in Gods roome, and loue
it aboue him which gaue it, either to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
it, or to take away him, before hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
him too much; therefore if parentes
wold haue their children liue, they muſt take
heed to loue them too much: for the giuer is
offended, when the gift is more eſteemed
than he.</p>
            <p>The firſt duetie is the mothers,<note place="margin">Mothers ſhould nurſe their children.</note> that is,
to nurſe her childe at her own breſtes, as Sara
did Iſaac, and therefore Eſay ioyneth the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
name and the mothers name both in one:
&amp; calleth them <hi>nurſing mothers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 7.</note> ſhewing, that
mothers ſhould be the nurſes. So when God
thoſe a nurſe for Moſes,<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 8.</note> he led the hand maid
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Pharaos daughter to his mother, as though
God would haue none nurſe him but his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
After, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſon of God was born, his
father thoght none fit to be his nurſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 14.</note> but the
virgin his mother. The earths fountaines are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17992:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made to giue water, and the breſtes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are made to giue ſuck. Euery beaſt, and
euery foule is bred of the ſame that did beare
it, onely women loue to be mothers, but not
nurſes.</p>
            <p>Therefore if their Children proue vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
they may ſay, thou followeſt thy mother,
for ſhe was vnnaturall firſt, in locking vp her
breſts from thee, and committing thee forth
like a Cuckow to be hatched in a Sparrowes
neſt. Hereof it comes that we ſay, <hi>He ſuckt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
from the dug,</hi> that is, as the Nurſe is affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in her bodie, or in her minde, commonly
the childe draweth the like infirmitie from
her, as the egges of a Henne are altered vnder
the Hauke; yet they which haue no milke,
can giue no milke. But whoſe breaſtes haue
this perpetuall drought? Forſooth it is lyke
the goute, no beggers may haue it, but Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
or Gentlewomen. In the ninth chapter
of Hoſea, thy breſtes are named for a curſe:
what lamentable happe haue Gentlewomen,
to light vpon this curſe more then other? ſure
if their breaſts be drie as they ſay, they ſhould
faſt and pray together, that this curſe migro
be remoued from them.</p>
            <p>The next dutie is,<note place="margin">Prou. 22. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Catechize a childe in his
youth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhuld be broght vp.</note> 
               <hi>and he will remember it when he is olde:</hi>
This is the right bleſſing which fathers and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17992:40"/>
mothers giue to their children, when they
cauſe God to bleſſe them too.<note place="margin">1. Re. 3. 26.</note> The wrong
mother cared not though the childe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
but the right mother would not haue
it deuided: ſo wicked Parents care not though
their children be deſtroied, but godly parents
would not haue them deſtroyed but ſaued,
that when they haue dwelt together in earth,
they may dwell together in heauen. As the
Midwife frameth the bodie when it is young
and tender, ſo the parents muſt frame the
minde while it is greene and flexible, for
youth is the ſeed time of vertue.<note place="margin">Luke 11. 2.</note> They which
are called fathers, are called by the name of
God, to warne them that they are in ſtead of
God to their children, which teacheth all his
ſons. What example haue children but their
parents? and ſure the prouidence of God
doth eaſe their charge more than they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware;
for a childe will learne better of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than of anie other.<note place="margin">Except of kings ſons.</note> And therefore wee
read of no Schoolemaiſters in the ſcripture
but the Parents: for when Chriſt ſaith to the
Iewes,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 38.</note> 
               <hi>If yee be the ſonnes of Abraham, yee
will doe the workes of your Father Abraham:</hi>
he ſheweth, that ſonnes vſe to walke in their
Fathers ſteppes, whether they bee good or
bad.</p>
            <p>It is a maruellous delight to the father
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17992:41"/>
and mother, when people ſay that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are like them: but if they be like them
in godlineſſe, it is as great delight to other as
to the parents: or elſe we ſay that they are ſo
like, that they are the worſe for it. Well doth
Dauid call children <hi>arrowes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 127. 4</note> for if they be wel
bred, they ſhoote at their parents enemies, and
if they be euill bred they ſhoote at their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Therefore many fathers want a ſtaffe
to ſtay them in their age, becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
none before, like olde Eli, which was
corrected himſelfe,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 2. 29.</note> for not correcting his
ſonnes. Are not children called the fruite of
their parents?<note place="margin">Pſ. 132. 11.</note> Therefore as a good tree is
knowne by bringing foorth good fruite,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33</note> ſo
parents ſhould ſhewe their godlineſſe in the
education of their children, which are their
fruite.<note place="margin">1. Sa. 1. 20.</note> For this cauſe the Iewes were wont to
name their children ſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were borne,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 13. 24.</note>
that euer after, if they did but thinke vppon
their names, they would put them in mind of
that religion which they ſhould profeſſe: for
they did ſignifie ſome thing that they ſhould
learne.</p>
            <p>An admonition to ſuch as call their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at all aduentures,<note place="margin">Three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> ſomtime by the names
of dogs, euen as they proue after. In 1. Kings
2. 2. we haue Dauid inſtructing his ſonnes. In
Gen. 39. Iacob correcting his ſonnes: and in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17992:41"/>
Iob. 1. Iob praying for his ſonnes. Theſe three
put together, inſtructing, correcting &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
make good children, and happie parents.</p>
            <p>Once Chriſt tooke a childe, and ſet him in
the midſt of his diſciples,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 17</note> and ſayd, <hi>He which
will receiue the kingdome of heauen, muſt receiue
it as a little childe:</hi> ſhewing, that our children
ſhould be ſo innocent, ſo humble, and voide
of euill, that they may be taken for examples
of the children of God. Therefore in Pſalme
127. 4. children are called <hi>the heritage of the
Lord,</hi> to ſhew that they ſhould be trained, as
though they were not mens children, but
Gods, that they may haue Gods heritage
after.<note place="margin">Col. 4. 15.</note> Thus if you doo, your ſeruants ſhall be
Gods ſeruants,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 8.</note> and your children ſhall be
Gods children, and your houſe ſhall be Gods
houſe, like a little Church, when others are
like a denne of theeues.</p>
            <p>Now I ſpeake to one which is a mother ſo
ſoone as ſhe is married:<note place="margin">The name of ſtepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and their dutie.</note> therefore peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you looke that I ſhould ſhewe the dutie
of ſtepmothers. Their name dooth ſhewe
them their duetie too, for a ſtepmother doth
ſignifie a ſtedmother, that is, one mother di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and another commeth in her ſtead: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that your loue may ſettle to thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones as it ought, you muſt remember that
ye are their ſtedmother, that is in ſted of their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17992:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mother, and therefore to loue them, and tender
them, and cheriſh them as their mother did.
She muſt not looke vpon them like Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
who tolde his people that hee would be
worſe vnto them then his predeceſſour; for
then they will turne from her, as his ſubiects
did from him: but ſhe muſt come to them as
Dauid came to the people after Saules death,
and ſayd,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Though your maſter Saul be dead, yet
I will raigne ouer you:</hi> ſo ſhe muſt ſay to them,
though your mother be dead, yet will I be a
mother: ſo the children will loue her aſmuch
as their father. Further, theſe children are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,
and therefore you muſt not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
them as children, but as orphane chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.<note place="margin">Iere. 22. 2.</note>
Now God requireth a greater care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
widowes and Orphanes,<note place="margin">Deu. 14. 17. &amp; 24. 17. &amp; 26. 12.</note> than ouer anie
other women or children.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, you muſt remember that ſaying,
<hi>As you meaſure vnto other,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſo it ſhall be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto you againe:</hi> that is, as you intreate
theſe children ſo another may come after and
intreat your children; for he which hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the firſt mother and ſent you, can
take away the ſeconde mother and ſende a
third, which ſhall not be like a ſtepmother to
yours, vnleſſe you be like a ſtepmother to
theſe.</p>
            <p>If theſe duties bee performed in marriage,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17992:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then I neede not ſpeake of Diuorcement,<note place="margin">Diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the phiſick of mariage.</note>
which is the rod of mariage, and diuideth
them which were one fleſh, as if the bodie
and ſoule were parted aſunder. But becauſe
all performe not their wedlocke vowes, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee which appointed mariage, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
diuorcement, as it were taking our
priuilege from vs,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 19</note> when we abuſe it. As God
hath ordained remedies for euery diſeaſe, ſo
he hath ordained a remedie for the diſeaſe of
mariage.<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 8.</note> The diſeaſe of marriage is adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt would haue no diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but for forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>
and the medicine hereof is diuorcement.
Moſes licenſed them to depart for hardneſſe
of heart, but Chriſt licenſeth them to depart
for no cauſe but adulterie. If they might be
ſeparated for diſcord, ſome would make a
commoditie of ſtrife: but now they are not
beſt to be contentious, for this law will hold
their noſes together, till wearines make them
leaue ſtrugling: like two ſpaniels which are
coupled in a chaine, at laſt they learne to goe
together, becauſe they may not go aſunder.
As nothing might part friends,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 32.</note> but <hi>If thine
eye offend thee, pull it out,</hi> that is, if thy friend
be a tempter: ſo nothing may diſſolue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
but fornication,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 9.</note> which is the breach of
marriage, for marriage is ordained to auoide
fornication,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 10</note> and therefore if the condition be
broken, the obligation is void.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:17992:43"/>
And beſide, ſo long as all her children, are
his children, ſhe muſt needs be his wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the father and mother are man &amp; wife:
but when her children are not his children,
ſhe ſeemes no more to be his wife, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whoſe children ſhe beares, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be diuorced from him. In all the old
Teſtament,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we read of no diuorce betweene
any, which ſheweth that they liued chaſter
then wee: yet no doubt this law was better
executed amongſt them, then amongeſt vs.
Such a care God hath had in all ages and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
to prouide for them which liue honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for diuorcement is not inſtituted for the
carnall, but for the chaſt, leaſt they ſhould be
tied to a plague while they liue. As for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
&amp; adultreſſe,<note place="margin">Leu. 20. 10.</note> he hath aſſigned death
to cut them off, leaſt their breath ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
others. Thus hee which made mariage,
did not make it vnſeparable, for then mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
were a ſeruitude. But as Chriſt ſayth of
the Sabboth,<note place="margin">Mar. 2. 27.</note> 
               <hi>The Sabboth was made for man,</hi>
that is, for the benefit of man, and not for
the hindrance of man: ſo mariage was made
for man, that is, for the honour of man, &amp; not
for the diſhonor of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:<note place="margin">Leu. 20. 10.</note> but if mariage ſhould
turne to fornication, and when it is turned to
fornication, there might be no ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then
mariage were not for the honor of man, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17992:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the trouble, &amp; greefe, &amp; diſhonor of man.
Therfore now ye haue heard how diuorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

               </p>
               <p>Now theſe two Sacraments are fulfilled,

               <p>Touching the time,<note place="margin">Reu. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>In the night</hi> (ſaith
Paul,<note place="margin">Re. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note>) therefore this Sacrament is called the
<hi>Lordes Supper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Time.</note> becauſe it was inſtituted at
night when they vſed to ſup. But what night?
<hi>Euen that night</hi> (ſaith Paule) <hi>when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 23.</note>
that night which he ſhould haue cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">Iob. 3. 3.</note>
as Iob did the day of his birth, if hee had
ſuffered againſt his will: that night when he
ſhould haue thought to deſtroy men, as men
conſpired to deſtroy him. That night (ſaith
Paul) this Sacrament of grace, and peace, and
life began: <hi>Euen that night when we betraied
him.</hi> Many nights did he ſpend in watching,
and praying for vs; and is there a night now
for vs to kill and betraie him? That was a
darke night, when men went about to put
out the Sunne which brought them light.
Who can but wonder, to ſee how Chriſt and
they for whom Chriſt came, were occupied
at one time? when they deuiſed miſchiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and ſought all meanes to deſtroy
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17992:47"/>
him, then hee conſulted how to ſaue them,
and inſtituted the ſame night this bleſſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
to conuey all his graces &amp; bleſſings
vnto them, <hi>Euen that night when they betraied
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why this action was deferred
vntill night,<note place="margin">Why this ſacrament was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted at night.</note> is, becauſe that was the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Law to eate the Paſſe-ouer,
which was like a predeceſſor of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Why it was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till his laſt night.</note>
The reaſon why he deferred it vntil his
laſt night, was, becauſe the Paſſe-ouer could
not be ended before the fulneſſe of time, and
the true Paſchall Lambe were come to be
ſlaine in ſtead of the other. Therefore how
fitlie did Chriſt end the Paſſe-ouer, which
was a ſigne of his ſuffering, ſo preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his ſuffering? And beſide, how ſweetly
did he confirme his Diſciples faith, when as
they ſhould ſee that the next day performed
before their eyes, which ouer night both in
the Paſſe-ouer and in the Sacrament, was ſo
liuely reſembled vnto them? If anie man
from this doe gather,<note place="margin">Why we receiue not the Lordes Supper at night.</note> that we ought to eate
the Lordes Supper at night, as Chriſt did, he
muſt vnderſtand that we haue not the ſame
cauſe to doe ſo which Chriſt had, becauſe of
the Paſſe-ouer. And therefore the Church
which hath diſcretion of times and places,
hath altered both the time and the place, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17992:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Temples in ſted of the chamber, and
the morning in ſted of the euening: for indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things are ruled by order and decency.</p>
               <p>Touching the manner,<note place="margin">Ver. 23. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>He tooke bread,
and when hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it,
and gaue it vnto them.</hi> Hee would not eate it,
nor breake it, before he had giuen thankes to
God. What neede he which was God, giue
thankes to God, but to ſhewe vs what wee
ſhould doe when we eate our ſelues?<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 18</note> 
                  <hi>In all
things giue thanks,</hi> (ſaith Paul:) whereby we
declare that all things come from God: but
the wicked beleeue eaſier that God doeth
take,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then that hee doth giue, and therefore
they neuer praie hartily vnto him for anie
thing, nor feelingly thanke him for it. For
which the Lord complaineth,<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 2.</note> ſaying: <hi>I haue
loued you, yet ye ſay, wherein haſt thou loued
vs?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 1. 5.</note> Shewing that we are worſe then the oxe,
which knoweth his feeder. And if wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
all things from God,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 20.</note> yet wee doe
like Lot, Is it not a little one (ſaith he) when
he craued to go vnto Zoar, as though it were
not much which he asked: ſo we mince &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
the giftes of God, before we receiue
them and after: like them which haue a grace
for dinner, and none for breakfaſt, as though
they had their dinners from God, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſts
of their owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:17992:48"/>
Our example did not ſo, although it was but
bread which hee receiued, yet hee was more
thankfull for bread, then many which burie
the foules, and fiſhes, and beaſtes in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
for if a count of all were kept, for one that
praieth;<note place="margin">Luk. 11 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread,</hi> a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
take their bread, and meat, and ſleep too
which neuer pray for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it,
and gaue vnto them, and ſaide, Take eate,</hi> for
when he had giuen thankes to God, then it
was ſanctified, and bleſſed, and lawfull to eate.
So when thou ſerueſt God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then it is lawfull
for thee to vſe Gods bleſſinges, then thou
maieſt eate and drinke as Chriſt did, but not
before, for theſe thinges were created to ſerue
them which ſerue God: if thou doeſt not
ſerue him for them, thou encrocheſt vpon
Gods bleſſinges, and ſtealeſt his creatures,
which are no more thine, then thou art his,
for the good God created all things for good
men, as the diuels poſſeſſions are reſerued for
euill men.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as Chriſt would not breake the
bread before hee had giuen thankes to the
founder, ſo know, that there is ſome thing to
be done before thou receiue anie benefite of
GOD, and preſume not to vſe his creatures
with more libertie than his ſonne did, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17992:48"/>
did not eate without giuing thankes, nor riſe
againe without ſinging a Pſalme.</p>
               <p>It followeth,<note place="margin">Mat 26. 30</note> 
                  <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> Here is the
fruite of his thankes before; hee prayed that
the bread and wine might be bleſſed, &amp; they
were bleſſed.<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> As Iſaacks bleſſing ſhewed it
ſelfe vpon Iacob whom he bleſſed, ſo Chriſt
his bleſſing appeared ſtraight vpon theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries:
for it could not be ſaid before, <hi>This is
my bodie,</hi> becauſe it was meere bread: but now
it may be called his bodie, becauſe his bleſſing
hath infuſed that vertue into it, that it dooth
not onely repreſent his bodie, but conuey his
bodie and himſelfe vnto vs. The efficacie of
this bleſſing is in this Sacrament euer ſince,
ſanctifying it vnto vs as well as it did to the
Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note> euen as Chriſts praier ſtaied Peters
faith after Chriſt was dead.</p>
               <p>Now ye haue heard the meaning of theſe
words, <hi>He tooke bread, and bleſſed it, and brake
it, and gaue it:</hi> you ſhall ſee with what a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
reſemblance they vnite Chriſt and vs
Firſt, as Chriſt in the Supper tooke bread to
feede vs:<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> ſo in his birth he tooke our fleſh to
ſaue vs. Secondly, as Chriſt when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the bread, bleſſed the bread to make it a
ſpirituall food: ſo Chriſt, when he had taken
our fleſh, powred foorth moſt rich and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
graces into it, to make it food of life vnto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17992:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 19.</note> Thirdly, as Chriſt when hee had bleſſed
the bread, brake the bread: ſo Chriſt when
hee had filled his bodie with moſt precious
graces,<note place="margin">1. Pe. 2. 24.</note> brake it vp like a rich treaſure houſe,
his handes by the nayles, his backe by the
ſtripes, his head by the thornes, his ſide by
the ſpeare; that out of euerie hole a riuer of
grace and goodneſſe might iſſue &amp; flow forth
vnto vs.<note place="margin">Ephe. 3. 17.</note> Laſtly, as Chriſt gaue the bread when
he had broken it: ſo Chriſt (by a liuely faith)
communicateth his bodie after he hath cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
it. Hereby wee are taught, that when
we ſee the Miniſter take the bread to feed vs,
we muſt conceiue, that Chriſt (being God
from euerlaſting) tooke our fleſh to ſaue
vs. When we ſee the Miniſter bleſſe the bread
to a holie vſe, we muſt conceiue, that Chriſt
(by vniting the Godhead vnto it) ſanctified
his fleſh for our redemption. When wee ſee
the Miniſter breake the bread to ſuſtaine our
bodies, we muſt conceiue, that Chriſt in his
death, brake his bodie to refreſh our ſoules.
When wee ſee the Miniſter giue the bread
to our handes, we muſt conceiue, that Chriſt
as truly offereth himſelf to our faith to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of vs.</p>
               <p>Becauſe vpon theſe wordes the Papiſts
ground their Tranſubſtantiation, that is that
the bread is changed into Chriſts fleſh, &amp; the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17992:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wine is turned into Chriſtes blood, whereby
we eate the ſame bodie which dyed vpon the
Croſſe, &amp; drinke the ſame blood which iſſued
out of his ſide. That you may ſee the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of this Popiſh dreame. I would haue you
but marke euerie word of this ſcripture, how
they make againſt tranſubſtantiation, that ye
may ſee them ſlaine like Goliah with their

ſpeak againſt himſelf;<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 14.</note> ſo the ſcriptures which

like the Baalites which wounded their owne

when he tempted Chriſt in the wilderneſſe, he
alleadged but one ſentence of ſcripture for
himſelfe,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 4.</note> and that Pſalme out of which hee
borrowed it made ſo plaine againſt him,<note place="margin">Pſa. 91. 11.</note> that
he was faine to picke here a word and there a
word, and leaue out that which went before,
and skip in the middeſt, and omit that which
came after, or elſe hee had marred his cauſe.
the ſcripture is ſo holie, and pure, and true,
that no word nor ſillable thereof can make
for the diuell, or for ſinners, or for heretikes:
yet as the diuell alledged ſcripture, though
it made not for him, but agaynſt him; ſo
doe the Libertines, and Epicures, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes,

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:17992:50"/>
Now there is no ſentence of the ſcripture,
which the wiſer Papiſts alleadge boldly for
their Tranſubſtantiation,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26</note> but this, that Chriſt
ſayd, <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> by which they may
proue as well,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 7. 9</note> that Chriſt is a doore, becauſe
he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the doore:</hi> or a vine, becauſe he

bodie;</hi> what did hee call his bodie? the bread
which they did eat; well then, yet it is bread.
If it be bread all this while, when hee did take
it, and bleſſe it, and brake it, and gaue it, and
they did eate it, when is it turned into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
here they ſtand like the Sadduces,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 34</note> as mute
as fiſhes.</p>
               <p>Now that ye may ſee, that not we only ſay
it is bread and wine after the conſecration; in
the 27. verſe, Chriſt himſelfe doth cal it bread
and wine after he had giuen it, as hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 25</note>
And in Marke he ſaith, <hi>I will drinke no
more of the fruit of the vine.</hi> Here Chriſt ſaith,
that it was the fruit of the vine which hee
drank; but his blood is not the fruit of vines,
but wine, therefore wine was his drinke, and
not blood.</p>
               <p>Beſide, if you would heare Paul expound
Chriſt, hee ſheweth that all our Fathers had
the ſame ſubſtance of Chriſt in their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17992:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that we haue in ours; for hee ſayth,

                  <hi>and

ſaith, <hi>that this meat and this drinke was Chriſt.</hi>
Marke that he ſayth not onely,<note place="margin">Verſ. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>They did eat
the ſame meat</hi> that we eate; but he ſaith, <hi>that
this meat was Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe. 4.</note> and not onely ſo, but
to ſhew that Chriſt is not a corporall meate,
as the Papiſts ſay; he ſayth, hee is a ſpirituall
meate as we ſay: therefore you ſee that wee
doe not eate him corporally, no more then
our Fathers, but that as they did eate him ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
ſo do wee; for ſpirituall meate muſt
be eaten ſpiritually, as corporall meate is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
corporally.</p>
               <p>Agayne, for the ſignes to bee turned into

ſeene,<note place="margin">Exo. 4. 8. &amp; 21.</note> like all the myracles of Moſes, and

Againe, a myracle (eſpecially in the time
of the Goſpell) is an extraordinarie thing, but
they make this an ordinarie thing: for if the
bread and wine be turned into fleſh &amp; blood,
then myracles are as common as Sacraments,
and ſo becauſe they haue Maſſe euerie day,
they ſhould worke myracles euerie day.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this ſeemeth ſtrange, that Auguſtin
(whom they ſo much honour) gathered all the
myracles which are written in the ſcripture,
and yet amongſt all, ſpeaks not of this: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then it was counted no myracle: but
Paule ſpeakes of lying myracles,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 9.</note> and this is
one of them.</p>
               <p>If they ſay that Chriſt can turne bread and
wine into his bodie,<note place="margin">Obiection</note> and therefore hee doth.
Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> they muſt proue that he wil, for they can
doe many things themſelues which they doe
not, becauſe they will not: therefore it is an
old anſwere, that from <hi>Can</hi> to <hi>Will</hi> no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
followeth. The Leper did not ſay vnto
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mar. 1. 40.</note> If thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt, thou wilt: but, <hi>If thou wilt
thou canſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the queſtion which they think cannot
be anſwered, like their inuincible Nauies, is
this.<note place="margin">Obiection</note> If the bread be not his bodie, why doth
he call it his bodie? Reſolue this knot, and all
is cleare.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> Marke then, and we will looſe it as

he ſaith after; <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> Why? his
bodie was not broken before he ſuffered, how
did he ſay then, <hi>which is broken,</hi> before it was
broken? There is no ſenſe of it but this, the
bread was broken, and ſignified that his body
ſhould be broken.</p>
               <p>Now, as the breaking of the bread did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the breaking of his bodie, ſo the bread
muſt needes ſignifie his bodie: but as his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
was not broken indeede when the bread
was broken, ſo the bread could not be his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
indeed, for then his body ſhould haue bin
broken when the bread was broken: Yet let
them obiect what they can.</p>
               <p>If (ſay they) the bread and wine bee not
changed into his bodie and blood, why doth
hee ſpeake ſo darkly?<note place="margin">Obiection</note> hee might haue ſpoken

mortall bodie, becauſe Chriſt hath not
a mortall bodie to giue vnto them. If they

then they muſt flie from this Text: for

               <p>When this Sacrament was inſtituted, and
Chriſt ſayde, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> his bodie was

Nay, wee ſay not that the ſacrament
is nothing but a bare ſigne, or that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
no more then you ſee: for Chriſt ſaith,
that it is his body: and Paul ſaith, that it is
the communion of Chriſts body and blood:
Therefore there is more in ſacramentall
Bread,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 16</note> then in common bread; though the
nature be not changed, yet the vſe is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
it dooth not onely nouriſh the body as
it did before, but alſo it bringeth a Breade
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17992:59"/>
with it which nouriſheth the ſoule: for as
ſure as wee receiue breade, ſo ſure wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Chriſte; not onelie the benefites of
Chriſt, but Chriſt: although not in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

               <p>As the ſpouſe dooth not marrie with the

with Chriſt himſelfe, and being partakers
of him, they are made partakers of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites:
for Chriſt may not be deuided from

and ſo the ſonne giueth vs himſelfe. For as
the Breade is a ſigne of his bodie, ſo the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

that is as good. So beloued, this is as good,
that vnder theſe ſignes, you receiue the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

               <p>All the Apoſtles ſay, that it was needfull
that Chriſt ſhould take our fleſh: but no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayth, that it is needfull that we ſhould

none ſhould be bleſſed but Marie: but Marie
was not bleſſed becauſe Chriſt was in her

and leaſt this ſhould ſeeme incredible vnto
you, becauſe Marie is called bleſſed among
women: when Chriſt heard the women ſay,
<hi>Bleſſed are the breaſts which gaue thee ſucke,</hi> he
replied vnto her,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they which heare

<hi>Bleſſed is the heart that hath me in it.</hi> If Marie

the ſunne needs come to vs, or elſe cannot his

               <p>Is this the Papiſts vnion with Chriſt? Is
this the manner whereby wee are made one
fleſh with Chriſt, to eate his fleſh? nay, when
hee tooke our fleſh vnto him, and was made

and not now. Chriſt tooke our fleſh, we take

In viſible things God hath appointed our

ſpirituall obiects, ſo ſenſe diſcerneth of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obiects. As Chriſt taught Thomas to
iudge of his bodie, ſo may we, and ſo ſhould
they: therefore if you cannot ſee his body, nor
feele his body, you may gather by Chriſtes
ſaying to Thomas, that hee would not haue
you beleeue that it is his body,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 27.</note> for my bodie
(ſaith Chriſt) may be ſeene and felt. And thus
Tranſubſtantiation is found a liar.</p>
               <p>Nowe,<note place="margin">why chriſt calleth the bread his body.</note> if you aske mee why Chriſt calleth
the ſigne by the name of the thing it ſelfe, I
aske thee againe; Mayſt thou ſay when thou
ſeeſt the picture of the Queene, this is the
Queene; and when thou ſeeſt the picture of a
Lyon, this is a Lyon: and may not Chriſt ſay
when he ſeeth a thing like his bodie, <hi>This is
my bodie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhewed you before, that euery Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is called by the name of the thing
which it dooth ſignifie, and therefore why
ſhould we ſtumble at this more then the reſt?
The reaſon why the ſignes haue the name of
the things, is to ſtrike a deeper reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in vs
to receiue this ſacrament of Chriſt reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17992:62"/>
ſincerely, and holily, as if Chriſt were there
preſet in body and blood himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, as hee which defaceth the
Queenes ſeale is conuicted of contempt and
treaſon to her owne perſon: ſo he which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneth
theſe ſeales of Chriſt, doth not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Chriſt, but deſpiſe him, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſhall be required of him, as if hee had
contemned Chriſt himſelfe. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why Chriſt calleth the ſignes of his bodie
his bodie, to make vs take this Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently,
becauſe we are apt to contemne it,
as the Iewes did their Manna.</p>
               <p>It followeth:<note place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe this in remembrance of
me:</hi> that is, theſe ſignes ſhall bee a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my death: when you breake the
bread, you ſhall remember the wounding of
my body: and when you drinke the wine, you
ſhall remember the ſheading of my blood.
If wee doe this is remembraunce of Chriſts
bodie, which was broken like the bread, it
is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an argument that his bodie is not there,
becauſe remembrance is not of thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but of things abſent: we remember not.
but wee ſee that which is before vs. This
might put the Papiſts in remembrance that
Chriſt is not ſacrificed now, when we do but
remember his ſacrifice: this is not Chriſtes
ſacrifice, but a remembrance of his ſacrifice:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17992:62"/>
he was ſacrificed before, and now it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
leſt his ſacrifice ſhould be in vaine. This
was done once reallie, when he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vpon the croſſe, therefore that offering
was called a ſacrifice, becauſe he was ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
indeed; but this offering is called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
becauſe it is but a ſigne of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt in this Sacrament were offered
indeede,<note place="margin">If Chriſts body were in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it were not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a ſacrifice.</note> then it ſhould bee called a ſacrifice
as his once offering was: but becauſe it is but
a remembrance of his ſacrifice, therefore it is
called a Sacrament. This is not a ſacrifice of
Chriſt, but a ſacrifice of our ſelues. Leſt we
ſhoulde take it to bee a ſacrifice of Chriſt,
Chriſt himſelfe calleth it a remembrance of
his ſacrifice, <hi>Do this in my remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is our worke, as Chriſt hath done, ſo
muſt we doe, ſo we miniſter, and ſo you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:
wee can giue you nothing but that
which we haue receiued from him, as Paul
ſaith. Therefore, if Chriſt did not giue his
mortall bodie which ſtood before them, and
could not profite them; nor his glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which was not glorified then, and when
it was glorified, aſcended vp vnto heauen,
and there abideth: how can theſe iugling
Prieſts make their God againe, which made
them? They can no more turne wine into
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17992:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blood, &amp; bread into fleſh, than they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
a gnat to become a camell: for it is a
greater worke to make God, than to make
the world.<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 23.</note> Therefore as Chriſt ſaith; <hi>When
they tell you here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt,
beleeue them not:</hi> So when they tell you that
Chriſt is in heauen, and that Chriſt is in
earth,<note place="margin">2. Rin. 2. 17.</note> in this place and that place, beleeue
them not: for Elias aſcenſion was a figure of
Chriſtes aſcenſion: when Elias was aſcended,
yet ſome ſought for his bodie vpon earth: ſo
though Chriſt be aſcended, yet manie ſeeke
his bodie vpon earth: but as they could not
finde Elias bodie, ſo theſe cannot finde
Chriſtes bodie, although they haue ſought
three hundred yeares.</p>
               <p>But if his bodie were vpon earth, as they
ſay, ſhould we handle it, and touch it, now it
is glorified? After his reſurrection he ſayd
vnto Marie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Touch me not,</hi> becauſe his bodie
was glorified: that is, not to bee touched

we reade of none which touched his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
(after it was riſen) but onely Thomas, to

               <p>Thus you ſee wee neede to ſuborne no

they alleadge for Tranſubſtantiation, doth

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17992:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if Antichriſt doth ſignifie thoſe which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

the right father of it, it was one of the dreames
of Innocentius the third,<note place="margin">A monſter of his age.</note> in the yeare of our
Lorde 1215. ſo manie yeares paſſed before
Tranſubſtantiation was named, and then a
Pope ſet it firſt on foote: ſo it came out of
Rome, the grandame of all hereſies, and for

into the Church: for graunt but this to Pope

vpon earth, and ſo one of the articles of our
faith ſhalbe falſified,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 11.</note> which ſaith, <hi>He is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

which ſaith, <hi>That hee ſitteth at the right

                  <note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note> that is (as Peter ſaith) he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in heauen. Secondly, it will follow,
that Chriſt hath not a true bodie, but a fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
bodie, becauſe it may bee in manie
places at one time: for if his bodie be in the
Sacrament, he muſt needes haue ſo many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as there bee Sacraments; nay hee muſt
haue ſo many bodies as there be bittes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sacrament. Thirdly, it will follow, that
his bodie is diuided from his ſoule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie
is a dead bodie, becauſe the bread
is onely changed into his bodie, and not into
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> his ſoule. Fourthly, it will follow, that the
wicked, and prophane, &amp; reprobate, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Chriſt as well as the godlie, becauſe
they haue a mouth to eate as well as the beſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, it will followe, that Chriſtes Sacrifice
once for all,<note place="margin">Heb 9. 28. &amp; 10. 12.</note> was not ſufficient, becauſe we
muſt ſacrifice him againe, and breake his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and ſhed his blood, as the Iewes crucified
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> him vpon the Croſſe. Sixtly, it will follow,
that the bread being turned into the bodie of
our Redeemer, hath a part of our redemption
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> as well as Chriſt Seuenthly, it wil follow, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17992:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt did eate his owne bodie: for all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſaie, that hee did eate the ſame Bread
which he gaue to his Diſciples. Laſtly, it will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
follow, that a Maſſing Prieſt ſhalbe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of his Creator, becauſe hee makes him
which made him. All theſe abſurdities are
hatched of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>Thus when men deuiſe Articles of their
owne, while they ſtrike vppon the anuill, the
ſparkes flie in their face; and they are like the
man which began to build, and could not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
it. When I ſee the Papiſt in ſo many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
for entertaing one errour, me thinks
hee ſeemeth like a Collier, which is grymed
with his owne coales. Therefore, as in maners
we ſhould thinke of of Peters ſaying,<note place="margin">Act. 5. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether

of a Teſtament, becauſe the ſeale is ſet vnto
them, which before this Sacrament was not
ſealed, but like a bare writing without a ſinget.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17992:67"/>
This word Teſtament, dooth implie a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and therefore teacheth vs, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

               <p>Here is to be noted, that Chriſt doth not
onely ſpeake of a Teſtament, but hee calleth
it a <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> which words neuer met
together before, as though the Law were for
the olde man to mortifie him, and the Goſpel
for the new man to comfort him againe: or,
as if the olde Teſtament had ſo waſht her
face, and chaunged her apparell at Chriſtes
comming, that one would not thinke it the
ſame, but a newe Teſtament, becauſe euen
now ſhe was ſhadowed with a thouſand Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 26. 20.</note> You may ſee then that they may
gather as well out of Chriſts words, that the
Cup is the new Teſtament, as that the Wine
is his blood: for Chriſt ſayth, <hi>This Cup is the
new Teſtament,</hi> as well as he ſaith, <hi>this Wine
is my blood,</hi> or <hi>this bread is my bodie.</hi> Beſide.
when Chriſt ſpeakes of a new Teſtament, he
implieth that the old Teſtament is fulfilled;
the ſacrifices,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note> and Ceremonies of the Lawe
did ſignifie Chriſt before hee came, therefore
they are fulfilled in his comming: no moe
Sacrifices, no mo<note n="*" place="margin">For types &amp; figures.</note> Ceremonies, for the truth
is come. Sacrifices and Ceremonies are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norablie
buried with the Prieſthood of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
let them reſt: it is not lawfull to violate
the ſepulchers of the dead, and take their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
out of the earth, as the witch would raiſe
Samuel out of his graue.<note place="margin">1. Sa. 28. 14</note> Therefore they
which retaine ceremonies, which ſhould be

like the Witch, which preſumed to raiſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
out of his graue.</p>
               <p>This Teſtament is called a Teſtament in
blood, becauſe the Teſtament and Will of a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17992:68"/>
man is confirmed, when the man is dead, ſo
Chriſt confirmed his teſtament by his death.
Moſes ſaith,<note place="margin">Leu. 17. 11.</note> that life is in the blood; ſo the
blood of Chriſt is the life of this Teſtament.
If Chriſtes blood had not bene ſhed, this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
made vnto vs, had bene vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as the Teſtament of a Father is vnto his
ſonne, if the father ſhould not die but liue:
therfore the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> without ſhedding
of blood, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes.
Therefore the Teſtament or Couenaunt of
the remiſſion of our ſinnes, is called the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
in blood: the blood of Chriſt is the
ſeale of the Teſtament, which wee haue to
ſhew vnto God for the remiſſion of our ſins,
and the two Sacraments are a ſeale of that
blood, to witneſſe that it was ſhed.</p>
               <p>Againe, this is a matter regarded in teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Willes; to the Teſtament of him
that is dead, no man addeth or detracteth, but
as the teſtator made it, ſo it ſtandeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
alteration: ſo ſhould this teſtament of
Chriſt, and this ſacrament of Chriſt, no man
ſhould alter it now hee is dead, for hee which
addeth or detracteth,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2.</note> hath a curſe in Gods
booke.<note place="margin">Reu. 22. 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt when he inſtituted this
Sacrament, commaunded, <hi>Doo this;</hi> that is,
doo as I doo: leaſt they ſhould ſwarue one
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17992:68"/>
whit from his owne manner: yet how many
gaudes haue the Papiſts added to it, that he
which had heard Chriſt ſay, <hi>Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce

handle the matter in their Maſſe,<note place="margin">The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> coulde
ſee nothing to remember Chriſt by, but
a vayle to hide Chriſt from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Commaundement was repeated
againe, when hee gaue the Wine, <hi>Doe this,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As hee commaunded them to eate the
Bread in remembraunce of him, ſo hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
them to drinke the wine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce
of him: nay, hee ſpeakes more
preciſely of the wine then of the bread; for
hee ſaith of the wine,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 27</note> 
                  <hi>Drinke you all of this,</hi>
which hee ſaith not of the breade. Surely,
Chriſt did foreſee that ſome proud heretikes
would doe otherwiſe after him, euen as it is
come to paſſe: for the Papiſt doth break this
Commandement of Chriſt, as flatly as Saul
brake the commaundement of Samuell. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell
commanded him to kill the fat and the
leane,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 9</note> Saul killed the leane but not the fat; ſo
Chriſt commaundeth to receiue bread and
wine: they teach to receiue breade, but not
wine: Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Drinke you all of this:</hi> they
ſay, drink not al of this: Chriſt gaue the bread
and wine to all; they giue the bread to all, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17992:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wine to ſome: their Prieſts receiue all
but the people muſt content themſelues with
halfe: the Prieſt eates and drinkes, but the
people muſt not drinke for ſpilling on their
cloathes. Is this the Church which cannot
erre? Doe they thinke to hemme Chriſt in
their Maſſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 35</note> and ſhut his ordinaunce out of
their Maſſe? The ſoldiors diuided Chriſtes
coate, but theſe diuide his bodie, and ſeparate
the bread &amp; wine which Chriſt hath ioyned.
Pauls ſpeaketh of Heretikes which taught,
<hi>Touch not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>taſt not, handle not:</hi> ſo theſe ſaie,
Touch not,<note place="margin">How the popiſh Prieſts do iniure the people.</note> taſt not, handle not; when they
ſhould ſaie, Touch, and taſte, and handle. Of
all hereſies either olde or new, there is none
ſo iniurious to the common people, as the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> paſture of ſhauelings Poperie: for, they may
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not read the ſcriptures, they may not come
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to Councels, they may not examine that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which is taught them, they may not be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> without a mortuarie, they may not drinke
at the Communion: as though their Prieſts
were their Lords.</p>
               <p>Therefore wee may ſay as a Heathen did,
<hi>There is no charitie in the Papiſtes Sacrament:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 5. 2.</note>
becauſe like Ananias, the Prieſts keepe backe
that which they ſhould diſtribute, and: man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
the ſacrifice, as though Ely his ſonnes had
left their hooke to the Maſſing Friers.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 13</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:17992:69"/>
Thus that ye may know who ſucceed the
Phariſies, they haue fulfilled that which the
Phariſies did,<note place="margin">Mar. 7. 13.</note> that is, <hi>By their owne commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
they haue made the commandement of
God of no effect.</hi> For whereas the purpoſe of
Chriſt was to tie our faith wholy to himſelf,
that we ſhould not ſeeke for any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, knowing that the maintenance of
this life hath need both of meate and drinke,
to teach vs that all ſufficiencie is in himſelfe;
by bread and wine he ſheweth, that hee is in
ſtead both of meat and drink, that is, in ſtead
of all: which ſignification is taken awaye
where the wine is not giuen as well as the
bread. Therefore as it is ſaid of a horrible and
odious crime,<note place="margin">Iud. 19. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſider the matter and giue
ſentence:</hi> ſo I wiſh all to conſider this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and giue ſentence of it. Can there be
any clearer contradiction to the worde, or
bolder checke to Chriſt, then when hee ſaith;
<hi>Drinke you all of this:</hi> to ſaie, drinke not all of
this? It is euen as when God ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall die,</hi>
the diuell ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>ye ſhall not die.</hi> Shall we goe
now to a Councell, or a Father, or a Doctor,
to enquire whether this doctrine bee like
Chriſtes doctrine, I doe verelie thinke that
none is here ſo ſimple, but that hee ſeeth,
that if any thing can be contrarie to Chriſts
ſpeech, this is contrarie to it: but this is only
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17992:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their detraction from the ſacrament.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall heare their additions to the

and their incenſe, and their beckes, and their

Chriſt did, and therefore the Prophet may
ſay againe,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>who hath required this of you?</hi> Did

thou art detected, apprehended, accuſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted,
and condemned vpon it to be hanged,

to bee ſet vp for a ſpectacle, like a carkaſſe

               <p>Then came the mercie of God for Chriſt,

               <p>Wretched creatures which will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

Our ſinnes are infinite, and God is infinit: but

is not come: if he be come, how can we ſay,
vntill hee come? The effect of this verſe was

you call this Sacrament a ſhewe of Chriſtes

or if you call it a remembraunce of Chriſt,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17992:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as it is called there, yet it is not Chriſt, but a
ſhewe or remembrance of Chriſt: but this is
ſuch a ſhew and remembrance, that the next

                  <hi>Whoſoeuer receiueth it vnworthily, is

In the nine and twentith verſe Paul
ſaith; he diſcerneth not the Lords bodie: that
is, which putteth no difference betweene this
bread and other, but eateth like a childe, the
meate which hee knoweth not: and after the
bread ſeemeth ſtones to him, and the wine

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 27.</note> as they diſcerne

and therefore ſo often as they come to

               </p>
               <p>Will yee know beſide, what it is to bee
guiltie of the bodie and blood of Chriſt? euen
as Iudas was guiltie for betraying him, and
Pilate for deliuering him,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 44. mar. 25. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17992:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Sacrament vnworthily, as Pilate
and Caiphas and Iudas were. If they be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Chriſts death, they are guiltie of theyr
owne death too; as if they had committed
two murthers: and therefore Paul ſaith after,
that many of the Corinthians dyed,<note place="margin">Verſe 30.</note> onely for
the vnwoorthie receiuing of this Sacrament.
As the Worde is the ſauour of death to them
which receiue it vnworthelie, ſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the ſauour of death to them which
receiue it vnworthelie:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 216.</note> it neuer goeth into

may ſay to Hell, this day haue I taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thee,<note place="margin">How we ſhould be prepared before we come to the Lords table.</note> because I am guiltie of Chriſtes
blood. Therefore it followeth immediatlie,
<hi>Let a man examine himſelfe before hee eate of
this bread, or drinke of this wine:</hi> as if he ſhould
ſay, If he which receiueth this Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely,
bee guiltie of Chriſtes death, like
Iudas which hanged himſelfe; if theſe ſignes
be receiued to ſaluation or damnation, like
the Word; the next leſſon is, to examine your
ſelues before you receiue, leſt you receiue
like the ſonne of perdition,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 27.</note> which ſwallowed
the bread and the Diuell together. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let
him eate:</hi> that is, let him examine firſt, and
receiue after: for if wee ſhould receiue the
bread of the earth reuerentlie,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 9. 13.</note> how ſhould
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17992:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we receiue the bread of heauen? When Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honadab

<hi>Is thy heart vpright as my heart is toward thee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. K. 10. 15.</note>
So when wee come to the Lordes table, hee
would haue our hearts vpright to him, as his
heart is to vs: for who feaſteth his enemies
and mockers?<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 2.</note> The golden Ring ſitteth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
at our table, but the Wedding garment
ſitteth higheſt at this table. It is ſafer eating
with vnwaſhen handes, than with an vnwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen

the Lambe of the Paſſe-ouer on the tenth
daye of the firſt moneth, in which moneth
they came out of Egypt,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 3. and 6.</note> and on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
daye after they were taught to eate
him: ſo they had foure daies reſpite betweene
the chooſing and the killing, to prepare and
ſanctifie themſelues for the Paſſe-ouer, which
was a ſigne of the Lords Supper. This admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
them, that the matter (now to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
was verie waightie, and therefore
they were deeply to conſider it: for now was
the action and ſumme of al ſaluation in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
If they did prepare themſelues ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did receiue the figure of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how ſhould wee bee prepared before
we receiue the Sacrament it ſelfe?<note place="margin">2. Chro. 35. 6</note> Therefore
as Ioſiah commaundeth the Leuites to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17992:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to prepare themſelues, that is, to examine
whether they haue faith, and loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">All are bound to know the ſcriptures.</note>
before they come to this feaſt. By
this all may ſee: firſt, that Paule would haue
euerie laie man skilfull in the ſcripture, that
hee be able to examine himſelfe by it; for this
admonition is not to them which miniſter
the Sacrament, but to all which receiue the
Sacrament. And the rule by which we muſt
examine our ſelues, is the lawe which wee
ſhould obey: therefore if the rule be vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
the examination muſt be vndone. Our
doctrine muſt bee examined by the doctrine
of the Prophets and Apoſtles;<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> our prayers

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Search

the firſt, here Paul ſaith, <hi>Examine your

charge, <hi>Proue your ſelues;</hi> and againe at next
word, <hi>Examine your ſelues:</hi> as if hee ſhould
ſay, this worke muſt be done when it is done,
becauſe it is neuer throughly done; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt double our examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Paul
doubleth his counſell. If a man ſuſpect his
enemie, hee will trye him with a queſtion; if
that wil not ſearch him, he wil put forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if that bee ſpyed, hee will moue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like one which putteth diuers keyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a locke vntill it open: So he which exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
muſt trie and trie, prooue, and prooue,
ſearch and ſearch:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 14.</note> for the angell of darkneſſe
is like an angell of light,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 1.</note> and we haue no way

ſpirites.</hi> God examineth with trials, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
examineth with temptations, the world
examineth with perſecutions: we which are
thus examined, had neede to examine too.
If anie man skill not what <hi>Examining</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the very word <hi>Examine</hi> is ſo pregnant,
that it prompteth vs how we ſhuld examine:
for it ſignifieth to put our ſelues vnto the

Touch-ſtone, as if we would trie gold from

is the eye of the ſoule,<note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</note> whereby ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her ſelfe, and her ſafetie, and her daunger,
and her way which ſhe walketh, and her pace
which ſhe holdeth, and the end to which ſhe
tendeth: ſhe lookes into her glaſſe and ſpieth
euerie ſpot in her face, how all her graces are

               <p>To heare, and read, and pray, and faſt, and

The Diſciples of Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Maiſter, is it I?</hi>

                  <hi>Maſter, what ſhall wee doe?</hi> not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
what ſhall they doe? Wee muſt obey
ſome, and heare others, &amp; admoniſh others,
and loue all; but examine our ſelues. That
which we applie vnto others, the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
vnto our ſelues: for when we ſpeak of
an examiner, we intend one which exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
other; when wee ſpeake of an accuſer,
we intend one which accuſeth other; when
we ſpeake of a Iudge, wee meane one which
iudgeth others:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 13</note> but the ſcripture crieth, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
thy ſelfe, accuſe thy ſelfe, iudge thy
ſelfe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 3.</note> that is, be not curious to ſearch a moat
in thy brothers eye, but pull out the beame
which is in thine owne eye. This doth ſhew
that they which ſit in Gods chaire to iudge
others, commonly haue greater faults them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17992:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then they whome they vſe to iudge:
and therefore Chriſt calleth their fault a
beame, and the others a moate. This made
Dauid ſaie,<note place="margin">Pſa. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Examine thy heart:</hi> thy heart is
thy owne heart, therefore thou muſt examine
whether thou praie, whether thou watche,
whether thou faſt; and not whether he praie,
whether hee watch, whether he faſt, as the
Phariſie examined the Publicane,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 11.</note> leaſt thou
haue Peters checke, when he examined what
Iohn ſhould doe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 22</note> Chriſt ſaid, <hi>What is that to
thee? follow thou me.</hi> Thou art a priuat man
and haſt a priuate examination, therefore let
thy queſtion be, <hi>What haue I done?</hi> and make
thy Anatomie of thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>See beloued, wee may not beleeue our
ſelues, before we haue examined our ſelues:
for we are falſe hearted, and the notableſt
couſiner that deceiueth moſt, for one time
that he deceiueth others, tenne times decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
himſelfe. Becauſe the fleſh is a wilie
ſeruaunt, and will lye like Gehezi to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 25.</note>
and face him that it hath not ſinned,
when it commeth from ſinne: therefore as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha
examined his ſeruant,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 26.</note> ſo the ſoule must
examine her ſeruaunt, that is, man muſt bee
iealous of himſelfe, and take himſelfe for a
liar, for a flatterer, for a diſſembler, vntill
he be throughlie acquainted with himſelfe:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17992:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for no man is ſo often beguiled as by himſelf,
by truſting his double heart, and taking his
own word without further trial. If Paul had
bid vs examine others,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note> we would haue ſifted
them like Sathan. <hi>Sathan hath deſired to ſift
thee</hi> (ſayth Chriſt to Peter) ſo we haue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſift others. Euen Peter which was
ſifted of ſathan, longed to ſift Iohn, &amp; knowe
what he ſhould do, before hee hearkened to
his owne charge. Therefore the helpe of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is a needfull preſeruatiue, although
we were as ſound as Peter. They which are
ſuſpected of a crime, doe not examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
but are examined of others, leaſt they
ſhould be partiall: but a Chriſtian muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
himſelfe of his crime,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 11.</note> and be his owne
iudge, his owne accuſer, and his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner:
for no man knoweth the ſpirite of
man, but the ſpirit which is in man, which
will condemne him if he be guiltie, and tell
him all that hee hath done, and with what
minde he did it, and what he deſerueth for it.
This is the priuate araignment, or cloſe ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
when Conſcience ſits in her chaire to
examine, and accuſe, and iudge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
her ſelfe, becauſe ſhe will not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of God.</p>
               <p>Thus holie men haue kept their ſeſſions at
home, and made their hearts the fore-man
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17992:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the iurie, and examined themſelues as wee
examined others, the feare of the Lord ſtood
at the doore of their ſoules, to examine eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thought before it went in, and at the dore
of their lips, to examine euery word before
it went out, wherby they eſcaped a thouſand
ſinnes which we commit, as though wee had
no other worke. So thou ſhouldeſt ſitte in
iudgement of thy ſelfe, and call thy thoughts,
and ſpeeches, and actions, to giue in euidence
againſt thee, whether thou be a Chriſtian, or
an infidell, a ſonne, or a baſtard, a ſeruaunt, or
a rebell, a Proteſtant, or an hypocrite: if thou
find not faith, nor feare, nor loue, nor zeale,
when thou examineſt thy ſelfe, let no man
make thee beleeue that thou art holie, that
thou art ſanctified, that thou art a Chriſtian,
that thou art a beleeuer, that thou art a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller,
becauſe thou art worſe then thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
thy ſelfe, for euery man is partiall to
himſelfe when he is moſt humbled.</p>
               <p>Therefore if my heart tell mee that I doe
loue God, whome ſhall I beleeue before my
ſelfe?<note place="margin">Pro. 25. 3.</note> As Salomon ſayth: <hi>No man can ſearch
the heart of the king:</hi> ſo Paul ſayth, <hi>No man
knoweth the ſpirite of any man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 11</note> 
                  <hi>but the ſpirite
which is in man:</hi> that is, no man feeleth the
heart of man ſo wel as himſelf. And yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
although hee haue liued with it euer
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17992:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſince he was borne, doth not know his owne
heart, vnleſſe hee examine it narrowlie, no
more than hee knoweth his owne bones, or
his veines, or his ſinewes, or his arteries, or his
muskles, how many are in his bodie, or where
they lie, or what they doe.</p>
               <p>This ſeemes ſtrange that a man ſhould
not know his owne heart: yet it is true that
the beſt of all dooth not knowe his owne
heart, though he hath dwelt with it from his
mothers wombe. For Chriſt ſaith to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 55.</note>
euen to his Diſciples, <hi>you know not of
what ſpirit you are,</hi> that is, you thinke better
of your ſelues then you are, and know not
what the clocke ſtriketh within. There is a
zeale without knowledge, &amp; there is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without zeale; there is a fayth without
obedience, and there is an obedience without
faith; there is a loue without feare, and there
is a feare without loue, and both are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
Therefore as Dalilah ſearched where
Sampſons ſtrength lay,<note place="margin">Iudg. 16. 6.</note> ſo let euery man
ſearch where his weakeneſſe lieth, and alwaie
be filling the emptie gap.</p>
               <p>Now this examination muſt goe before
vs to the Sacrament. Euerie meate worketh
according as it is digeſted, &amp; this meate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
according as it is receiued. Therefore
when Chriſt had taught what we ſhould doe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17992:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in receiuing the Sacrament, now Paul ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what we ſhould doe before wee receiue
the Sacrament. <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe.</hi>
But ſome will come before they examine
themſelues: and therefore, as the Prieſtes of
the lawe had authoritie to put by lame and
blinde ſacrifices, ſo the miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
haue power to put by lame and blind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers,
and he which doth not ſo, giueth a
ſworde into their handes to kill themſelues. If
the Paſtor would vſe this examination duly,
it were the onely way to make euery one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
himſelfe, leaſt he be put by like <hi>Non
proficients.</hi> As Iiphtah diſcerned the Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
becauſe when they ſhould pronounce
Shibboleth, they pronounced Sibboleth: ſo
all which cannot pronounce Chriſt, that is,
giue a reaſon of their faith, are to bee thruſt
from this table.</p>
               <p>There is a hearing,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 18.</note> &amp; a preparatiue before
hearing. There is a praying, and a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
before praying.<note place="margin">Eccle. 4. 17.</note> There is a receiuing, and
a preparatiue before receiuing; which if it be
wanting, the receiuer receiueth vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablie,
the prayer praieth idlely, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
heareth vnfruitfullie, like thoſe which
doe eate before hunger, and drinke before
thirſt.</p>
               <p>This preparatiue before hearing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17992:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and receiuing dooth ſignifie that there is
a kind of phiſicke in theſe three, for prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
are miniſtred alwaies before Phiſicke,
and as the preparatiue which goeth before,
maketh way to the phiſick, or els it would do
no good but hurt: ſo vnleſſe examination go
before the ſacrament, we ſeale vp the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
which are written againſt vs, in ſteade
of the promiſes which are made vnto vs: for
the ſacrament is a ſeale, and therefore ſealeth
good or euill, as euerie other ſeale doth.</p>
               <p>The preparatiue before wee receiue,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 76.</note> is to
<hi>Examine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> As Iohn was the fore-runner of
Chriſt, ſo examination is the fore-runner of
the ſacrament, like the Harbinger which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
before to prepare the roome.<note place="margin">Iob 1. 5.</note> For, if Iob
commaunded his ſonnes to ſanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
before they did come to his ſacrifice,
how ſhould we ſanctifie our ſelues before we
come to Chriſtes ſacrament, wherein we are
commaunded to doe as the Lorde himſelfe
did which inſtituted it?<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 12.</note> It is ſayd that the
chamber wherein Chriſt did inſtitute this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
was trimmed; the chamber wherein
the Apoſtles receiued this ſacrament, was
trimmed. If Iudas chamber, his inner cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
had bene trimmed ſo too, he had receiued
this Sacrament with as much comfort as the
other diſciples did: but becauſe his heart
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17992:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was not trimmed: therefore he was the firſt
which was condemned for the vnworthie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Adam did not thinke that death had bene
in an apple,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> ſo you would not thinke that
death ſhould bee in bread: but as a coale
hath fire in it, beſide the coale it ſelfe, which
fire dooth either warme, or burne; ſo this
meate hath another meate in it, beſide that
which is ſeene, which dooth either ſaue, or
deſtroy: therefore he which commeth to this
ſpiritual meat, muſt examine whether he haue
a ſpirituall mouth, as well as a carnall mouth,
or elſe he ſhall receiue no more than he ſeeth,
&amp; that which he ſeeth not ſhall deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>putteth new wine
into olde veſſels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 2. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>leſt the veſſels breake, and the
wine leake.</hi> This wine is new wine, therefore
put it into new veſſels, holie veſſels, ſanctified
veſſels, or elſe it will leake foorth, and breake
the veſſell, and thou ſhalt haue no more taſte
of it, than while the reliſh of bread is in thy
mouth. When Chriſt commeth to our houſe,
ſhall we not looke whether our chamber be
trimmed, as the chamber was trimmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his comming to the Paſſe-ouer? But
how ſhall we trimme it?</p>
               <p>When a man takes an office, hee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his ſubſtance; when he takes a trade, he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17992:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
examineth his skill: when he goeth to fight,
he examineth his ſtrength: but theſe wants
are no wants when hee goeth to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Wilt thou know now vpon what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
thou muſt inquire at that time, that is,
how thou ſhouldeſt examine thy ſelfe?</p>
               <p>As ſome praier may be at all times,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> &amp; ſome
reioycing may be at all times; ſo ſome exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is at all times.<note place="margin">Iob. 9. 28.</note> Thus <hi>Iob</hi> examined
himſelfe euerie day, nay, euerie houre, because
he ſcanned all that he did.</p>
               <p>But there is a ſpeciall examination before
the Sacrament, becauſe it is the bread which
is receiued to ſaluation,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 29.</note> or damnation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the feaſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 11</note> to which whoſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
without his wedding garment, ſhall be

               <p>Therefore hauing obſerued that examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

a ſpeciall examination, for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
Catechiſme, which leadeth immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Sacrament as a gueſt is handed to the

and how thou ſhalt trie thine owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:17992:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>

manner of ſpeaking,<note place="margin">The firſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the marks of true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp; the falſe, in our ſelues or other.</note> plainlie, or doubtfullie,

               <p>By the proportion of faith: for euerie he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
is contrarie to ſome article of our beleef,<note place="margin">1. K. 22. 11.</note>
as euery ſinne is againſt ſome of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p>By the euent of their ſpeeches: for they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

               </p>
               <p>By their ſucceſſe: for if they be not of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
they will come to nought as the Arrians, and
Manichees, and Pelagians are vaniſhed, as if
they had neuer bene: ſo time ſhall weare out
euerie doctrine that is not trueth. This is thy
rule to trie others ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt trie thine owne ſpirite by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
motions that it hath to good or euill. For as
a good ſtomacke turneth all that it eates into
good nutriment: and a bad ſtomack turneth
all that it eates into raw humors: ſo likewiſe
a good minde conuerteth all that it heareth,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17992:81"/>
and all that it ſeeth, and all that it feeleth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, by the firſt cauſe, or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which thou hadſt vnto it: for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

to verifie that ſaying; <hi>Where a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

is like the thought which ſet it a worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdlie, by the manner of the conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it, whether it be of knowledge, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
whether it be conſtant, or mutable,
calme, or boyſterous, ſimple, or mixt: for as a

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthlie, whether it bring to Chriſt, or
take any thing from him to thy ſelfe, like all
the parts of Poperie, which mangle his honor
either to angels, or to ſaints, or to pope, or to

drawe thee not from anie good, then thou

that the Phariſies had their rewarde alreadie,

               <p>Others reſpect whether it be a faire daye,

that God loued him, but as the Leuit did not
profit him,<note place="margin">Iudg. 17.</note> becauſe he receiued nothing but
the Leuit, ſo the bread and wine dooth them
no good, becauſe they receiue nothing but
bread and wine for want of faith. Maruell
not then if you haue not felt that comfort af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Sacrament, which you looked for, for
it is comfortable to none, but to them which
prepare their hearts and examine themſelues
before, becauſe it is not the mouth, but the
heart which receiueth comfort.</p>
               <p>Now it may be that the moſt which are
here haue brought a mouth, and not a heart,
theſe go away from the Sacrament to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 30.</note> as Iudas went from the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to betraie him.</p>
               <p>The other goe awaie like one which hath
receiued a chearefull countenaunce of the
Prince, all his thoughts are ioy, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Prince is ſtill in his eye. As he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17992:87"/>
which hath eaten ſweete meate, hath a ſweete
breath: ſo they which haue eaten Chriſt, all
their ſayings, and doings, are ſweete, like a
perfume to men, and incenſe to God: their
peace of conſcience, and ioy of heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to doe good, will tell them whether they
haue receiued the bare ſignes, or the thing
ſignified.</p>
               <p>Euerie one which receiueth this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">How a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall know whether he haue receiued well.</note>
ſhall feele himſelfe better after it, lyke
the Apoſtles: or elſe hee ſhall finde himſelfe
worſe after it, like Iudas. Heereby ye ſhall
knowe whether ye haue receiued like the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
or like Iudas. Thus we haue ended
the doctrine of the Lordes Supper. Now if
you cannot remember all that I haue ſayd,
yet remember the Text: that is, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your ſelues before you
receiue this Sacrament

who ſhall come to
heauen? and God tels him
that Vſurers ſhall not come thither: as if he
ſhould ſay, they goe to hell. Therefore as Paul
taught Timothie to warne them which are
rich,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17</note> as though they had more neede to bee

to be penned for a warning to the rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſtrikes vpon the rich mans vice.</p>
               <p>I haue ſpoken of Briberie, and Symonie,
and now I muſt ſpeake of their ſiſter Vſurie.
Many times haue I thought to ſpeake of this
Theame, but the arguments which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17992:89"/>
for it, haue made me doubtfull what
to ſay in it, becauſe it hath gone as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
protection. At laſt you ſee it falleth into
my text, and therefore now I cannot bauke it
any longer. Therefore if anie heere haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
this occupation before, let him now
ſubmit his thoughts to Gods thoughts, for I
will alleadge nothing againſt it, but that
which is built vpon the rocke.</p>
               <p>Vſurie is the ſin which God will trie now
whether you loue better than his word: that
is, whether you will leaue it if hee forbid it.
For if he flatly forbid it, and yet you wilfullie
retaine it, then you loue Vſurie better than
Gods word. Therefore one ſaith well, that
our Vſurers are Heretikes,<note place="margin">Vſurers heretikes.</note> becauſe after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
admonitions, yet they maintaine their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and perſiſt in it obſtinately as Papiſts do
in Poperie. For this cauſe I am glad, that I
haue anie occaſion to gripple with this ſinne
where it hath made ſo manie ſpoiles, &amp; where
it hath ſo manie patrones: for it is ſayd, that
there be moe of this profeſſion in this Citie,
then there be in all the Land beſide. There be
certaine ſinnes, which are like an vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enemie, which will not bee reconciled to
death; and this is one of theſe euerlaſting
ſinnes, which liue and dye with a man. For
when he hath reſigned his pride, and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17992:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his luſt, yet Vſurie remaineth with
him, and hee ſaith as Naaman ſaide; <hi>Let the
Lord be mercifull vnto me in this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 18.</note> let mee haue
a diſpenſation for this; as though this were a
neceſſarie ſinne, and he could not liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.<note place="margin">Three ſins counted no ſinnes,</note> There be three ſinnes which are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no ſinnes, and yet they doe more hurt
then all their fellowes; and thoſe are, Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
Nonreſidencie, and Vſurie: theſe three
(becauſe they are gainfull) are turned from
ſinnes to occupations.</p>
               <p>How manie of this Citie for all that they
are vſurers, yet wold be counted honeſt men,
and would faine haue Vſurie eſteemed as a
trade: whereas, if it were not ſo gainefull, it
would be counted as great a ſinne as anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
and ſo it is counted of all but them which
liue by it. This is the nature of pleaſure and
profite, to make ſinnes ſeeme no ſinnes if we
gaine anie thing by them: but the more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a ſinne is, the more dangerous it is; and
the more gainefull vſurie is, the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
it is. I will ſpeake the more of it, becauſe
happely you ſhall not heare of this matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>Firſt I will define what Vſurie is:<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I will ſhew you what Vſurie doth ſignifie:

Fourthly, I will ſhew the kindnes of it: Fiftly,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17992:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will ſhewe the arguments which are allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for it: Sixtly, I wil ſhew the puniſhment
of it: Seuenthly, I will ſhew you what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we ſhould holde of them, which doo not
lend vpon Vſurie, but borrow vpon Vſurie:
Laſtly, I will ſhew you what they ſhould do
which haue got their riches by Vſurie.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt,<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Vſurie.</note> Vſurie is that gayne
which is gotten by lending, for the vſe of the
thing which a man lendeth, couenaunting
before with the borrower, to receiue more
then was borrowed: and therfore one cals the
Vſurer a legall theefe, becauſe before he ſteale
he tels the partie how much he will ſteale, as
though he ſtoale by lawe.<note place="margin">Vſurers ſteale by law.</note> This word <hi>more,</hi>
comes in like a ſixt finger, which makes a
monſter, becauſe it is more then ſhould bee.
Another defining vſurie, calleth it the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to Charitie: for Paul ſaith, <hi>Loue ſeeketh
not her owne,</hi> but vſurie ſeeketh anothers that
is not her owne; therefore Vſurie is farre from
loue:<note place="margin">1. Iob. 4. 8.</note> but <hi>God is loue</hi> ſaith Iohn, therfore Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is farre from God too.</p>
               <p>Now, all the Commaundements of God
are fulfilled by loue; which Chriſt noteth,
when hee draweth all the commaundements
to one commaundement,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37</note> which is, <hi>Loue God
aboue all things, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi>
as if hee ſhould ſay, hee which loueth God,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17992:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:17992:92"/>
will keepe all the Commandements which
reſpect God, and he which loueth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
will keepe all the Commandements
which reſpect his neighbour: therefore, to
maintaine loue, God forbiddeth all things
which hinder this loue, and amongſt the reſt
here he forbiddeth Vſurie, as one of her dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
enemies. For a man cannot loue and be
a Vſurer, becauſe Vſurie is a kind of crueltie,
and a kinde of extortion, and a kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
and therefore the want of loue doth
make vſurers: for if there were Loue, there
would be no vſurie, no deceipt, no extortion,
no ſlaundering, no reuenging, no oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but we ſhould liue in peace, and ioy, and
contentment like the Angels; whereby you
ſee that all our ſinnes are againſt our ſelues:
for if there were no deceipt, then we ſhould
not be deceiued: if there were no ſlaunder,
then wee ſhould not be ſlaundered; if there
were no enuie, then wee ſhould not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied;
if there were no extortion, then wee
ſhould not be iniured; if there were no vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
then we ſhould not be oppreſſed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods law had bene better for vs than
our owne law: for if his law did ſtand, then
we ſhould not be deceiued, nor ſlaundered,
nor enuied, nor iniured, nor oppreſſed. God
hath commaunded euerie man to lende free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Luke 6. 35.</note>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:17992:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and who would not borrow freely? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they which brought in vſurie, brought in
a law againſt themſelues.</p>
               <p>The firſt Vſurers which we reade of, were
the Iewes, which were forbidden to be Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:<note place="margin">Eze. 18. 12.</note>
yet for want of faith and loue, Ezechiel
and Nehemiah doe ſhew,<note place="margin">Nehe. 2. 5.</note> how the Iewes,
euen the Iewes which receiued this law from
God himſelfe, did ſwarue from it, as they did
from the reſt. Firſt, they did lend vpon vſurie
to ſtrangers, after they began to lende vpon
vſurie to their brethren: and now there be no
ſuch vſurers vpon earth, as the Iewes which
were forbidden to be vſurers: whereby you
may ſee, how the malice of man hath turned
mercie into crueltie.<note place="margin">Deu. 15. 10.</note> For whereas lending
was commaunded for the benefite of men,
vſurie hath turned it to the vndoing of men:
for they take when they ſeeme to giue, they
hurt when they ſeeme to helpe, they damage
when they ſeeme to vantage: therefore it is
well noted, that vſurie hath her name of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
and ſhe may well ſignifie biting, for
many haue not onely bene bitten by it, but
deuoured by it, that is, conſumed al that they
haue.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 15.</note> Therefore, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If you
bite one another, take heed you bee not deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one of another:</hi> ſo I may ſay, If you be V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
one to another, take heed you bee not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17992:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deuoured one of another, for Vſurers are
byters.</p>
               <p>As the name of the deuill dooth declare
what an enemie hee is;<note place="margin">Becauſe it ſignifieth an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chec.</note> ſo the name of vſurie
dooth declare what an enemie ſhee is. That
you may know vſurie for a byter, her name
dooth ſignifie byting. If there were one by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vſurie, and another healing vſurie, then
vſurie ſhould haue two names, one of byting,
and another of healing: but all vſurie ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
byting, to ſhew that all vſurie is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Now you haue heard what vſurie is, and
of what it is deriued, you ſhall heare the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is againſt the lawe of charitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
charitie biddeth vs to giue euery man
his owne,<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes of Vſurie.</note> and to require no more then our
owne: but vſurie requireth more then her
owne, &amp; giues not to other their owne. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
reioyceth to communicate her goods to
other, and Vſurie reioiceth to gather other
mens goods to her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is againſt the Law of Nations:
for euerie Nation hath ſome lawe againſt
vſurie, and ſome reſtraint againſt vſurers, as
you ſhall heare when we ſpeake of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, as it is againſt the law of Nations,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17992:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo it is againſt the lawe of Nature, that is, the
naturall compaſſion which ſhould be among
men.<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> You ſee a riuer when it goeth by an
emptie place, it will not paſſe vntill it hath
filled that emptie place, &amp; then it goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to another emptie place and filleth it,
and ſo to another emptie place and filleth it,
alwaies filling the places which are emptie:
ſo ſhould wee, the rich ſhould fill the poore,
the full ſhould fill the hungrie, they which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
ſhould fill them which want, for the
rich are but Gods Amners, &amp; their riches are
committed to them of God to diſtribute and
doe goods as God dooth himſelfe. As the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is charitable after a ſort, ſo is the aire: for
it goeth to emptie places too, and filleth them
as the water doth. Nature cannot abide that
anie place ſhould bee emptie, and therefore
the aire though it be a light bodie, and ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
aſcendeth vpward, yet rather then any
place in the earth ſhould be emptie, the aire
will diſcend as it were from his throne, &amp; go
into caues, into dens, &amp; into dungeous, to fill
them. If the rich were ſo good to their emptie
brethren, as the aire and water are to other
emptie things: as there is no emptie place in
the world, ſo there ſhold be no emptie perſon
in the world: that is, the rich in Iſrael would
fill the poore in Iſrael. But the rich make the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17992:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
poore to fill them: for Vſurers feed vpon the
poore, euen as great fiſhes deuour the ſmall.
Therefore he which ſaid, <hi>Let there not bee
a begger in Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 4.</note> ſaid too, Let there not bee a
Vſurer in Iſrael; for if there be Vſurers in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
there will be beggars in Iſraell, for Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
make beggers, euen as Lawyers make
quarrellers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is againſt the lawe of God.
Firſt, it is forbidden in Exodus 22. where it is
ſaid, <hi>If thou lend monie vnto my people, that is,
to the poore with thee, thou ſhalt not oppreſſe
them with Vſurie:</hi> here is Vſurie called op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
therefore if oppreſſion be a ſin, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie
is a ſin too. Secondly, it is forbidden in
Leuiticus 25. 26. where it is ſaid. <hi>Thou ſhalt not
giue thy monie to Vſurie, nor lend thy vittailes
for increaſe:</hi> here you may ſee, that men may
be Vſurers of vittailes and other things, as
well as of monie. Thirdly, it is forbidden in
the 23. chapter of Deuteronomium, where it
is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lend vnto thy brother vpon
Vſurie.</hi> And leaſt you ſhould ſay, that hee
meaneth but one kind of vſurie, hee ſheweth
that hee meaneth all kinds of vſurie: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in verſe 19. hee ſayth; <hi>As vſurie of monie
vſurie of vittailes, vſurie of corne, or vſurie of
any thing that is giuen to vſurie:</hi> becauſe ſome
are not vſurers of monie, but ſome are vſurers
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17992:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of vittailes, ſome are vſurers of cloth, ſome
are vſurers of corne, ſome are vſurers of wine,
ſome are vſurers of oyle, and ſome of one
thing, and ſome of another, and none woulde
be counted vſurers but they which lend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
vpon vſurie; therefore God forbiddeth ſo
preciſely vſurie of anie thing, ſhewing that al
vſurie is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>It is a miſerable occupation to liue by
ſinne, and a great comfort to a man when he
looketh vpon his gold and ſiluer, &amp; his heart
telleth him; all this is well gotten, and when
he lieth vpon his death-bed, and muſt leaue
all to his children, hee can ſay vnto them, I
leaue you mine own: but the Vſurer cannot
ſay, I leaue you mine owne, but I leaue you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens; therefore the Vſurer can neuer die
in peace, becauſe if he die before hee make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
he dieth in his ſinne.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt raiſed Lazarus from death,
after he had laine foure daies in the graue, hee
wept ſo ouer his Sepulchre, that the ſtanders
about ſaid one to another:<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>See how he loued

                  <hi>Loue one another as I haue loued
you:</hi> but it may be ſaid of the Vſurer, ſee how
he hateth other, &amp; loueth himſelfe. For when

he ſayth that he lendeth for compaſſion, hee
meaneth for compaſſion of himſelfe, that he

the borrower, as the Iuie loueth the Oke: the

vſurer loueth the borrower to growe rich by
him. The Iuie claſpeth the Oke like a louer,
but it claſpeth out all the iuice and ſap, that
the Oke cannot thriue after: ſo the vſurer
lendeth like a friend, but he couenanteth like
an enemie, for he claſpeth the borrower with
ſuch bands, that euer after he diminiſheth, as

the Vſurer knoweth that the poore man is

which day the Vſurer knoweth that the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower

lende out their money to occupiers, vpon
condition to be partakers in their gaines, but
not in their loſſes: So one takes all the paines,
and abideth all the venture, and the other that
takes no paines, reapeth halfe the profit. This
Vſurie is forbidde in 2. Theſſ. chap. 3. verſ. 10.
where it is ſaid; <hi>Hee which will not worke, let

doe not onely ſell their owne, but they ſell
Gods owne. Therefore one ſaith of theſe,
when he ſelleth the day, he ſelleth the light,
and when he ſelleth the night, he ſelleth reſt:
therefore when hee would haue the light of

ſo firſt we ſinne, and then we excuſe,
firſt a Vſurer, and then an excuſer: Therfore
euerie Vſurer will defende vſurie with his

If the Image-makers of Epheſus had
not liued by Images,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 25.</note> they would haue ſpoken

if the Vſurers did not liue by vſurie, they
woulde ſpeake for vſurie no more than the

               <p>It is an eaſie matter (if a man be diſpoſed)
to ſpeake ſomething for euerie vice, as ſome
defend the ſtewes, ſome defend Nonreſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
ſome defend ſwearing by my faith, ſome

defend Vſurie: but, <hi>will you pleade for Baal?</hi>
(ſaith Ioaſh) that is, Will you plead for ſinne
which will pleade againſt you? A ſinne is a
ſinne when it is defended: nay, a ſinne is two
ſinnes when it is defended:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 19.</note> for, <hi>Hee which

Who then is the leaſt in the Kingdome of

               <p>To defend Vſurie, they diſtinguiſh vpon
it, as they diſtinguiſh of lying. As they ſay,
there is a pernicious lye, and an officious lye,
and a merrie lye, and a godlie lye: ſo they ſaie,
there is the Merchants vſurie, and the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
vſurie, and the Widowes vſurie, and the
Orphans vſurie, and the poore mans vſurie,
and the byting vſurie, and the charitable v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie,
and the neceſſarie vſurie. As God ſaid,
<hi>Ye ſhall dye;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> and the Woman ſaide, <hi>perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture

thinke that Vſurie is vtterlie vnlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God hath vtterlye forbid it: ſome
ſaye like to the Woman, <hi>peraduenture thou
ſhalt dye;</hi> they doubt whether Vſurie bee
vtterlye vnlawfull or no, becauſe it is ſo
much tollerated; ſome ſaie like the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
                  <hi>thou ſhalt not dye;</hi> they thinke that
Vſurie is lawfull, becauſe it is gainfull, as Saul

not be killed,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 15. 9.</note> becauſe they were fatte. But, as
hee was commanded to kill the fatte beaſtes,
as well as the leane: ſo wee are commaunded
to kill fat ſinnes as well as leane ſinnes, gainful
ſinnes as well as prodigall ſinnes.</p>
               <p>They which plead for Vſurie, obiect theſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Arguments. Firſt they ſay, God doth allow
ſome kinde of Vſurie;<note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for Vſurie.</note> for in Deut. 23. it is ſaid,
<hi>Of a ſtraunger thou maiſt take Vſurie.</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
no ſcripture ſpeaketh for Vſurers. <hi>Of a
ſtranger</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thou maieſt take Vſurie:</hi>
but thou takeſt vſurie of thy brother; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this condemneth thee, becauſe thou v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
thy brother like a ſtranger. Here <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
doth ſignifie the Iewes enemies, whome
they were commaunded to deſtroy: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marke how much this maketh againſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie,
which they obiect for vſurie. God doth
not licenſe the Iewes to take vſurie of any but
their enemies, whom they might kill. They
might not be Vſurers vnto anie, but to them
of whome they might be deſtroyers; whome
they might ſlaie, of them onely they might
take vſurie: ſhewing that Vſurie is a kind of
puniſhment, and ſuch a kinde of puniſhment,
as if we are to kill a man, it were a verie fitte
puniſhment for him: and therefore the Iewes
might take vſurie of none, but them whom
they might kill. I hope vſurers will alleadge
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17992:100"/>
this Scripture no more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſay they lend for compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and ſo make Vſurie a worke of Charitie.
This were charitie not to be partakers in our
gaines, but to be partakers in our loſſes: but
vſurers will bee partakers in our gaines, but
not in our loſſes: nay, though we looſe, yet
they will gaine. Is this charitie? It is vſurers
charitie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they ſay, if he gaine and I gaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
too, is not this well? may hee not conſider
my friendſhip, and bee thankfull? Yes, hee
may be thankfull: but no man is bound to be
thankfull, but when he hath receiued a good
turne, then hee is tried whether hee will bee
thankeful or no, and if he requite thy courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
then he is thankfull; but if thou bind him
to requite it, then thou art couetous.</p>
               <p>Fourthly they ſay, Vſurie is neceſſarie for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Orphanes, and Widowes, and Straungers,
which haue no other way to get their liuing,
and therefore ſome vſurie muſt be tolerated.
If Vſurie be neceſſarie for vs, how did the
Iewes without it? Did God thinke it good
for the ſtate of their Common-weale to bee
without Vſurers: and is it good for the ſtate
of our Common-weale to haue vſurers: this
is wiſdome againſt God.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie they ſaie, if I may not gaine by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:17992:101"/>
money which I lend, I will lend no more, but
keepe my money to my ſelfe: nay, that is as
bad to keepe thy money from them which
neede, as to lend thy money for vſurie; For
Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>From him which borroweth, turne
not away thy face:</hi> therefore thou art bounde
to lend. As he hath a curſe in Pro. 11. which
keepeth his corne when hee ſhould ſell it to
them which hunger; ſo he hath a curſe in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zec.
18. which keepeth his money when hee
ſhould lend it to them which want.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly they ſay, becauſe Vſurie comes of
biting, the biting vſurie is onely forbidden,
and none but the biting vſurie: why then all
vſurie is forbidden, for all vſurie commeth of
biting, ſo the wiſe God hath giuen it a name
to condemne it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Laſtly, they alleage the lawe of the lande
for it, and ſay, the Queenes ſtatute dooth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
vs to take vpon Vſurie ten in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Theſe are like the Iewes, which ſaid,

then they ſaide, <hi>by our law hee ſhall die:</hi> ſo
when they cannot ſaie by Gods law we maie
take Vſurie, they ſaie by mans lawe wee

all the reſt: for if Gods law forbid thee, can
any law of man excuſe thee? As it would not

                  <hi>The woman bad me,</hi> ſo it
will not ſerue the vſurer to ſay, the law doth
licenſe me: for though peraduenture our law
doe tollerate more then ſhould be tollerated,
yet I would haue you know, that our law doth
not allow ten in the hundred, nor fiue in the
hundred, nor one in the hundred, nor any v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie
at all: but there is a reſtraint in our law,
that no vſurer take aboue ten in the hundred;
it doth not allow ten in the hundred, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
that tirant which exacteth aboue ten
in the hundred. It is much like that tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we reade of diuorces: for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of mens heartes,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 7.</note> Chriſt ſaith that Moſes
did ſuffer the man &amp; wife to part aſunder: ſo
for the hardnes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hearts, our Moſes, our
Prince is faine to ſuffer as it were a kind of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie,
becauſe otherwiſe no men would lend.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the beſt excuſes which our vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
haue to pleade for themſelues, againſt
they come before the tribunall of God, and
if their reaſons wil not ſtand before men, nor
their own conſcience, how wil they ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord? and yet hee which ſpeaketh
to theſe, maketh himſelfe a mocke. Chriſt
preached manie Sermons, and was neuer
ſcorned at any, but when he preached againſt
couetouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14.</note> then it is ſaide, that hee was
mocked: ſhewing, that theſe kinde of men
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17992:102"/>
are moſt incorrigible, and wedded to their
ſinne til death make them part. Yet (for their
greater condemnation) we are commaunded
to ſpeake to them which will not heare:<note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 5.</note> of
which number, is euerie reader of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,<note place="margin">What the Vſurer is like.</note>
if he be a Vſurer after.</p>
               <p>Now you long to heare what the vſurer is
like. To what ſhall I liken this generation?
They are like a Butlers boxe; for as all the
counters at laſt come to the Butler, ſo all the
money at laſt commeth to the vſurer: ten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ten, and ten after ten, and ten to ten, till
at laſt he receiue not only ten for an hundred,
but an hundred for ten: this is the onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that the Butler can receiue no more
then he deliuered, but the Vſurer receiueth
more then hee deliuereth. They are like a
Moath; euen as a Moath eateth a hole in
cloath, ſo vſurie eateth a hole in ſiluer. If
you haue a peece of ſiluer which is as much as
an hundred pounds, in one yeare vſurie will
eate a hole in it as big as ten pounds: in two
yeares ſhe will eat a hole as bigge as twentie
pounds, in three yeares ſhe will eate a hole as
bigge as thirtie pounds. Nay, now they ſay,
hee is but a bad husband, which cannot eate
a hole as bigge as fiftie poundes in a yeare:
that is, which cannot gaine half in halfe: how
many holes haue theſe moths eaten in poore
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17992:102"/>
mens garments? they are like Nonreſidents,
that is, ſuch bad members, that no man ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
for but themſelues: as no man ſtandeth
for nonreſidencie, but he which is a Nonreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or he which would be a Nonreſident, ſo
no man ſtandeth for vſurie, but he which is an
vſurer, or he which would be an vſurer. They
are like Ieſabell,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 21. 7</note> which ſaid, <hi>Let mee alone, I
haue a way.</hi> If there bee no waie to liue (ſayth
the falſe Steward) I know what to doe,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 4.</note> I will
deceiue: ſo if there be no way to liue (ſaith the
vſurer) I know what to doe, I will oppreſſe. If
I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not liue by buying, nor by ſelling, nor by
flattering, nor by laboring, I will liue by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
But as one in his Comment ſpeakes
to the falſe Steward; Thou ſaiſt, I know what
to doe, but doeſt thou know what thou ſhalt
ſuffer? So I ſay to vſurers, you ſay you knowe
what to doe, but do you know what you ſhal
ſuffer? Indeed he knoweth not what to doe,
which knoweth not to doe well: and therfore

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondlie, it dooth detaine him from the

and wil not ſuffer him to be buried,
as though hee were not worthie to lie in the

               <p>Laſtlie, it maketh his will to be no will, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
though his goods were not his owne: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ours, but that which wee haue
rightlie got: and therefore we ſay, It is mine

it be ours by right. This is the iudgement of
mans law.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall heare the iudgement of
Gods law. A Vſurer dooth receiue two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
one of the borrower, and another of
the reuenger: of the borrower he lookes for
gaine, but of the reuenger he lookes for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
Therfore all the Scripture prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth
euill vnto him, as Michaiah did to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 8.</note>
Salomon ſaith: <hi>He which encreaſeth his
riches by Vſurie, gathereth for them which will
be mercifull to the poore.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſaie,
when he hath loden himſelfe like a Cart, hee
ſhall be vnloden like a Cart againe, and they
ſhall inherit his monie, for whom he did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
gather it. For he which is vnmercifull to
the poore, meaneth not to gather for them
which will bee mercifull to the poore. But
Salomon ſaith: That they ſhall be his heires,
which will be mercifull, as hee was vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.</p>

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:17992:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now marke whether this propheſie of
Salomon be true, I know not how many in
this Cittie doe encreaſe by vſurie, but this
propheſie ſeemeth to be verified of many: for
it is noted, that the riches &amp; lands of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Merchants, and other in London,
do not laſt ſo long, nor indure ſo well, as the
riches and lands of other in the countrie, and
that their children doe not prooue ſo well as
others, nor come to that place in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weele, which for their wealth their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
looked that they ſhould come to. I can
giue no reaſon for it, but the reaſon of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>Hee which increaſeth by Vſurie, gathereth
for them which will bee mercifull to the poore.</hi>
That is, their riches ſhall go from their heires
to Gods heires,<note place="margin">Pro. 13. 22.</note> according to that, <hi>The riches
of the ſinner is layd vp for the righteous:</hi> that is,
the righteous ſhall enioie that which the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
gathereth.</p>
               <p>All riches are vncertaine, but the riches
which are euill gotten, are moſt vncertaine:
They may be called moueable goods, for
they are verie moueable, like the clowdes
which neuer reſt till they fall as they climed.
God ſayth,<note place="margin">Eze. 22. 13.</note> that he will ſmite the Vſurer with
his fiſt, not with the palme of his hand, but
with his fiſt, which giueth a greater blow. As
his handes were ſhut againſt the poore, ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17992:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gods handes ſhall be ſhutte againſt him, that
his puniſhment may be like his ſinne. But if
you will heare their finall ſentence. Dauid
ſaith heere; <hi>That they ſhall not dwell in Gods
Temple, nor reſt in his holie mountaine.</hi> Then
we will ſeeke no more puniſhments, for this
puniſhment is all puniſhments. If they ſhall
not come to heauen, whoſe then ſhall thoſe
riches be? Nay, whoſe then ſhall the honour
be when that day commeth? If hee ſhall not
reſt in heauen, then he ſhall reſt in hell, where
no reſt is. Then, ſaith one, the Vſurer ſhall crie
vnto his children,<note place="margin">Note.</note> Curſed bee you my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

               <p>Thus when they are curſed of God, they

This is the ſecond vſurie which the Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
ſhall receiue of God, after hee hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vſurie of men: then the name of Vſurie
ſhalbe fulfilled, as it ſignifieth biting; ſo when

too, and neuer reſt biting; then they ſhall
wiſh that they could reſtore againe as Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

yet becauſe I haue promiſed, I wil ſpeak ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it.</p>
               <p>Well then, may we neither take vſurie, nor
giue vſurie?<note place="margin">Ier. 15. 10.</note> I know that Ieremie ſaith, <hi>I haue
not lent vpon vſurie to others, neither haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
lent vpon vſurie to mee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Obiect.</note> as though both
were vnlawfull, not onely to take vſurie, but
to giue vſurie.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> But thereby Ieremie doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that hee was no medler in the worlde,
whereby they ſhould enuie him like other
men, and therefore hee cleareth himſelfe
chieflie from Vſurie, becauſe Vſurers were
moſt enuied. And to ſhewe that hee was not
an Vſurer, he ſaith that he was not a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which is more lawfull than to be a Vſurer:
like a man which ſaith, I doe neither hate him
nor know him. Why it was lawfull to know
him, but to proue that he did not hate him,
hee ſaith, hee doeth not know him. So Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
to proue that hee had not lent vpon vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
doeth ſaie, that hee neuer borrowed vpon
Vſurie, which manie will doe that will not
lende. The beſt Expoſitors giue this ſence
of it. I knowe beſide, that Chriſt did caſt
foorth the buyers out of the Temple,<note place="margin">2. Obiect.</note> as wel as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17992:108"/>
the ſellers:<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> But that was not for buying, but
for buying in the Temple, where they ſhould
not buy, but praie: or elſe it was as lawfull to
buy anie thing, as it is lawfull to vſe it.</p>
               <p>I know beſide,<note place="margin">3. Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that it is a common ſaying,
if there were no buyers, there would be no
ſellers, if there were no bribe-giuers, there
would be no bribe-takers.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> But in this caſe it
may be rather ſaide, if there were no takers,
there would be no giuers: for the giuer doth
not make the receiuer to take, but the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
dooth make the giuer to giue, becauſe
hee will not lende, vnleſſe the other wil giue
him for the loane: therefore as we ſay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer
makes the theefe: ſo I may ſay, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer
of Vſurie, makes the giuer of Vſurie.
Therefore I would be loth to compare them
which are conſtrained to borrow vpon vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
vnto them which did buy in the Temple,
and were not conſtrained more then they
which ſolde in the Temple. Much leſſe may I
compare them which giue vſurie, vnto them
which take vſurie: for there is as great oddes
betweene them, as there is betweene giuing
and taking, or betweene couetouſneſſe and
neceſſitie, for one is couetouſneſſe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is neceſſitie. He which lendeth for vſurie,
lendeth for couetouſneſſe, but he which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth
vpon vſury, borroweth for neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:17992:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now, for neceſſitie God hath allowed
manie things; as, for neceſſitie it was lawfull
for Adams ſonnes to marrie with Adams
daughters, becauſe there were no other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;<note place="margin">1. Sa. 21. 6.</note>
for neceſſitie it was lawfull for Dauid
to eate the ſhew-bread, becauſe hee had no
other foode; for neceſſitie it was lawfull to
worke,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 10.</note> and heale, and fight vpon the Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth,
which was not lawfull but for neceſſitie:
therefore for neceſſitie why may not a man
paie more then hee borrowed? ſeeing no
ſcripture doth forbid vs to paie more then we
borrowed, but to require more then we lend.
Some doo thinke, that as God did vſe the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of Abſalon, and the malice of Pharao,
and the trecherie of Iudas vnto good; ſo
men may vſe the couetouſnes of Vſurers vnto
good, that is, to helpe at a need when a man is
like to be vndone, and his children caſt away,
and his leaſe forfeited, &amp; many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
beſide like to enſue, which you know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then I, vnleſſe hee haue preſent money at
ſome time to preuent a miſchiefe. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hereof, I may alleadge how Iacob did vſe
the ſinne of Laban. Laban did euill in ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by idols,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 53.</note> but Iacob did not euill in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſuch an oath of him, though it was an
vnlawfull oath: ſo though the Vſurer do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
in taking vſurie, yet a man doth not euill
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17992:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in giuing Vſurie.<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 31.</note> Beſide, I may alleadge the
example of Abraham and Abimelech: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
made a couenant with Abimelech; to
confirme this couenant, Abraham ſware, and
Abimelech ſware: Abraham ſware by the
true God, but Abimelech ſware by his falſe
Gods; and yet Abraham did receiue this oath
and ſinned not. So, if her Maieſtie and the
Turke ſhould make a couenant, the Turke
woulde not ſweare as the Queene woulde
ſweare; for the Queene would ſweare by the
Lord: but the Turke would ſweare by Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.
If it be lawfull then to receiue ſuch an
oath, though it be an vnlawfull oath, why
may it not be lawful for me to giue more than
I borrowed, though it be vnlawful for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
to take more then hee lended? Beſide, a
Prince may not pardon a wilfull murtherer,
yet I thinke that no man will ſay in haſt, that
hee which hath committed murther may not
take a pardon. As this vnlawfull giuing doth
not make the taking vnlawfull; ſo the other
vnlawfull taking doth not make the giuing
vnlawfull. Beſides, it is lawfull to ſuffer iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
though it be vnlawfull to offer iniurie: it
is lawfull to ſuffer iniurie, as Chriſt paide
tribute, which was iniurie; but it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to offer iniurie;<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 17</note> becauſe there are ſix com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:17992:109"/>
Now, to take vſurie, is (as it were) to offer
iniurie; but to giue Vſurie, is (as it were) to
ſuffer iniurie; therfore, though I may not take
more than I lended, yet I may giue more than
I borrowed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I may compare giuing of vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
to ſwearing: if a man ſweare without a
cauſe, hee ſinneth; but if hee ſweare as the
Word teacheth him to ſweare, hee ſinneth
not: ſo, if a man borrowe vpon vſurie, and
borrow without cauſe, he ſinneth, becauſe he
feedeth the Vſurer; but elſe, as a man may
ſweare in ſome caſe, ſo in ſome caſe a man may
borrow vpon vſurie that is, in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when a man muſt needes borrow, and can
borrow of none but Vſurers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I may alledge, that vſurie &amp; vſurer,
are neuer read in the ſcripture, but they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him that takes vſurie, not him which giues
vſurie: and therfore the ſcripture ſeemeth to
forbid taking, but not giuing.</p>
               <p>Many reaſons more are alleadged, which
I cannot refute, and therefore I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
them: yet I meane not to decide the
queſtion, becauſe I will not be miſtaken. But
if ſome ſhould come vnto mee in that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
and extremitie which I can imagine,
and aske; May I borrowe money of theſe V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers

liuing, ſeeing no man will lende me freely? I
woulde anſwere him as the Prophet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Naaman: neither doo, nor doo not, but
<hi>goe in peace.</hi> I will not forbid thee, nor I will
not condemne thee, but if thy conſcience
condemne thee not, I thinke thy ſinne one of
the leaſt ſinnes: and as Naaman praied, <hi>Lord
be mercifull vnto mee in this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg. 5. 18.</note> ſo I thinke the
Lorde will be mercifull vnto thee in this. But
if thy conſcience goe againſt it, then doo it
not; for it is ſinne to thee, though it be free
for another, becauſe whatſoeuer is not done
of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23</note> is ſinne. I charge you in the feare of
God, that you doo not miſtake that which is
ſaid, for I know no learned Preacher, nor lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
writer of other mind. Yet leaſt you ſhuld
miſtake the matter, as I diſtinguiſhed of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſo I will diſtinguiſh of borrowers.</p>
               <p>If ſome may borrow vpon Vſurie,<note place="margin">Diuers kindes of borrowers</note> it doth
not follow that all may borrow vpon Vſurie,
becauſe all haue not the like cauſe: therefore
doo not ſay that I teach you to borrow vpon
Vſurie, for I thinke that the moſt in this Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
which borrow vpon vſurie, ſhould not
borrowe as they doo, becauſe they rather
maintaine vſurie, then ſupplie their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Some I know borrow for meere neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
if anie may be allowed, thoſe are they:
but there is a kinde of borrowers in this Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17992:110"/>
which feede vſurers as the bellowes kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the fire, ſo they haue no need to borrow
but becauſe they would be rich, and richer, &amp;
richeſt of all: therefore they will imploy all
the money which they can borrow, thinking
to get more by the vſe of it, then the vſurie of
it doth come to. This maketh them ſell their
wares ſo deare, becauſe they muſt not onelie
gaine the price, but the intereſt beſide, and
more then the intereſt too, or elſe they gaine
nothing. Theſe borrowers are in another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
then thoſe which borrow for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie:
and therefore if they bee not old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to anſwer for themſelues, I am too
yong to anſwer for them. There are other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers
(as I haue heard) which for ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
cauſe would ſeeme barer &amp; needier then
they are, either becauſe they would not bee
charged deepely with ſubſidies, or els becauſe
they would compound with their Creditors
for a little: therefore they will haue alwaies
ſomething for Vſurie, that their Creditors
may thinke them bare of monie, or that other
may pittie them in their charges. Theſe are
like thoſe Foxes which haue wealth ynough
to pay their debts, and yet lie in priſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would defraud their Creditors. I
doubt not but there bee more ſorts then I
know, I cannot hunt euerie corner, becauſe I
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17992:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
want experience.<note place="margin">Note.</note> But this is my concluſion,
I would haue no man paie intereſt vnto V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
but for neceſſitie, euen as a trauailer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

               <p>Now you would vnderſtand the laſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;<note place="margin">What V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers ſhould do with their gaines.</note>
if you haue bene vſurers alredie, what

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 8.</note> The beſt thing is to do no

that is, Let no vnlawfull thing ſtaie in your

                  <hi>Reſtore it againe:</hi> the
reaſon of this lawe is, becauſe the ſinne is not
remitted, vntill the debt be reſtored. For as
humilitie is the repentance of pride, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
is the repentance of ſurfet, and alms
is the repentance of couetouſneſſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe
is the repentance of malice; ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17992:111"/>
is the repentance of vſurie. As hee
which is not humble, dooth not repent his
pride; he which doth not abſtaine, dooth not
repent his gluttonie; he which doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,
doth not repent his malice; ſo he which
doth not reſtore, doth not repent his vſurie:
for how can he be ſaid to repent for his Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

As diſeaſes are healed by the contrarie,
ſo pride is healed by humilitie, gluttonie by

by almes, and vſurie by reſtoring. This

               <p>As a Cammell when hee comes home ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> Zacheus did not feare how hee ſhould

the Lorde of all, can giue thee more wealth

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17992:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
repent that thou haſt kept it ſo long: but in

               <p>When Hezechia was like to die, Eſay ſaid

                  <hi>Set thy things in order before thou

all, ſet your things in order before you die.
What is this to ſet things in order, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore

bequeatheſt thy bodie to the earth, then thy

thy ſoule to God, then thy ſoule is ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
when thou bequeatheſt thy goods to the

therefore if thou die with other mens goods
in thy hand, then thou dieſt before thou haſt

ſinnes, and then no promiſe in all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
appertaineth vnto thee, becauſe nothing
is promiſed vnto ſinners, but vnto penitent
ſinners.</p>
               <p>Therefore that you may not die in your

hee is readie to deceiue againe; when the day
is paſt, he would it were to begin again; when
the Tearme is ended, hee wiſheth it were to
come againe; and though his houſe bee full,
and his ſhop full, and his coffers full, and his
purſe full; yet his heart is not full, but lanke &amp;
emptie, like the diſeaſe which we call the
Wolfe, that is alwaies eating, and yet keepes
the bodie leane. The Ant doth eate the food
which ſhe findeth, the Lion doth refreſh him
ſelfe with the praie that hee taketh: but the
couetous man lyeth by his money, as a ſicke
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17992:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man ſits by his meate, and hath no power to
take it,<note place="margin">2. King. 7. 2.</note> but to looke vpon it, like the Prince to
whom Eliſha ſayde, that hee ſhould ſee the
corne with his eyes, but none ſhould come
within his mouth. Thus the couetous man
makes a foole, of himſelfe, hee coueteth to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet,
hee gathereth to gather, hee laboureth to
labour, he careth to care; as though his office
were to fill a coffer full of Angels, and then to
dye; like an Aſſe which carrieth treaſures on
his backe all day, and at night they are taken
from him, which did him no good but loade
him. How happie were ſome, if they knewe
not gold from leade?<note place="margin">Pro. 9. 12.</note> 
               <hi>If thou be wiſe</hi> (ſaith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)
<hi>thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelfe:</hi> but he
which is couetous, is couetous againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
For what a plague is this (vnleſſe one
would kill himſelfe) for a man to ſpende all
his life in carking, and pining, and ſcraping,
(as though hee ſhould do nothing but gather
in this world, to ſpend in the next) vnleſſe he
be ſure that he ſhall come againe when hee is
dead, to eate thoſe ſcraps which hee hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with all this ſtirre? Therefore couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
may well bee called <hi>miſerie,</hi> and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
<hi>miſerable:</hi> for they are miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
            <p>Of them which ſeeme to bee wiſe, there
be no ſuch fooles in the world, as they which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17992:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
loue money better than themſelues: but this
is the iudgement of God, that they which
deceiue others deceiue themſelues, and liue
like Cain which was a vagabond vpon his
owne lande;<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note> ſo they are beggers in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of their wealth: for though they haue
vnderſtanding to know riches, and a mind to
ſeeke them, and wit to finde them, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
to keepe them, and life to poſſeſſe them;
yet they haue ſuch a falſe ſight and bleare
eye, that when their riches lye before them,
they ſeeme pouertie, and hee which hath
not halfe ſo much, ſeemeth farre richer than
they.</p>
            <p>Will you knowe how this commeth to
paſſe? To ſhewe that the couetous men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Hell, they are like Hell while they
liue. Hell is neuer filled, and they are neuer
ſatisfied:<note place="margin">Pro. 20. 15.</note> but as the Horſ-leach crieth, <hi>Giue,
giue;</hi> ſo their hearts crye, <hi>Bring, bring:</hi> and
though the Tempter ſhould ſaye to them as
hee ſaid to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>All theſe I will giue thee,</hi> yet
all will not content them,<note place="margin">Iude 6.</note> no more than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
contentented him.</p>
            <p>But as the Glutton in Hell deſired a
droppe of Water,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14.</note> and yet a whole Riuer
woulde not ſatisfie him: for if a drop had

a drop more, and a drop more, and a drop to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17992:118"/>
that; ſo they will lye, and ſweare, and deceiue,
for a drop of riches. The Diuell neede not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them all, as hee did to Chriſt, for they will
ſerue him for leſſe: but if he could giue them
all, all would not content them, no more than
the world contented Alexander: for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the name and nature of couetouſneſſe,
to be content, as it is againſt the name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Contentation, to be couetous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one ſaith, that no mans heart is like the
couetous mans heart, for his heart is without
a bottome.</p>
            <p>A Prentiſe is bound but for nine yeares, and
then he is free: but if the couetous might liue
longer than Methuſhelah,<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 15.</note> yet they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be free-men, but bounde prentiſes to the
worlde, while they haue a foote out of the

            <p>It is a wonder to ſee: as the Diuell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
about,<note place="margin">1. Pe. 5. 18.</note> ſeeking whom hee maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uore:
ſo men compaſſe about, ſeeking what

men and money,<note place="margin">Pro. 1. 13.</note> that they which profeſſe
good will vnto it with their hearts, will not
take ſo much paines for their life, as they take

            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:17992:118"/>
Chriſt knew what he ſpake when he ſayd,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 24</note> 
               <hi>No
man can ſerue two maiſters:</hi> meaning, God
and the world; becauſe each would haue all.
As the Angel and the diuel ſtroue for Moſes
body,<note place="margin">Iude. 9.</note> not who ſhould haue a part, but who
ſhould haue the whole; ſo they ſtriue ſtil for
our ſoules, who ſhall haue all. Therefore the
Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The loue of this world is enmity
to God:</hi> ſignifying ſuch emulation betweene
theſe two, that God cannot abide the world
ſhould haue a part, and the world on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide cannot abide that God ſhould haue
a part. Therefore the loue of the world muſt
needes be enmitie to God, and therefore the
louers of the world muſt needs bee enemies
to God: and ſo no couetous man is Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
but Gods enemie.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe Paul in the fifth chapter of
his Epiſtle to the Epheſians and fifth verſe,
calleth couetouſneſſe <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> which is the
moſt contrarie ſinne to God; becauſe as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſetteth vp another King in the Kings
place, ſo Idolatrie ſetteth vp another God in
Gods place. This word doth ſignifie that the
couetous make ſo much of money, that they
euen worſhip it in their hearts, and would do
as much for it as the Idolaters doe for their
Idols.</p>
            <p>Paul ſeeing ſuch ſinnes committed, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17992:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch paines taken for gaine, thought with
himſelfe; If they could bee perſwaded that
Godlineſſe is gaine, it is like they would take
as much pains for godlineſſe, as they take for
gaine: therefore hee taketh vpon him to
prooue this ſtrange Paradox, that <hi>Godlines is
gaine,</hi> againſt all them in the verſe before,
which hold that Gaine is Godlineſſe. Theſe
two opinions are verie contrarie, and here
are many againſt one.</p>
            <p>A man would thinke that Paul ſhould
be verie eloquent and ſharpe witted, and that
he had neede to vſe ſome Logicke, for hee
hath choſen a hard Text. What Paul? will

As Chriſt ſayth,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 11</note> 
               <hi>All doe not receiue this
Word,</hi> ſo all do not count this gaine but loſſe.
We count him rich which hath his barns full
like the Churle, his coffers full like the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
his table full like Belſhazzar, his ſtable
full like Salomon, his grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds full like Iob, his
purſe full like Craeſus. You ſpeake againſt
your maſter, for Chriſt ſent word vnto Iohn,
that the poore receiue the goſpell, as though
the godly were of the poorer ſort, and Dauid
calleth the wicked rich,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 12.</note> 
               <hi>They proſper and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi>
ſayth he, their ſeede blaſteth not, their
Cow caſteth not: as if he ſhould ſay, It is not
as you take it Paul, that Godlines doth make
men rich; for this I haue obſerued in my
time, that the wicked be the wealthieſt, and
good Lazarus is the poore man, and wicked
Diues is the rich man.</p>
            <p>Againe, we reade, that the Officers were
asked, which of the Phariſies or of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
did follow Chriſt, yet theſe were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rich men though they had no godlineſſe:
and if we ſhould examine your owne ſelfe,
it ſeemes you were no great rich man for
all your Godlineſſe, when you did worke
with your hands for your liuing: therefore if
Godlineſſe be ſuch gaine, how happeneth it
that your ſhare is no better? So they which
are like Nicodemus, when Chriſt ſayth, that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17992:120"/>
they muſt be borne againe;<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 4.</note> thinke that hee
can haue no other meaning, but that they

wombe:<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> and when he calles himſelfe Bread,
that he muſt needs meane ſuch bread as they
dine with.</p>
            <p>As the Iewes hearing the Prophet ſpeake

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17992:121"/>
of vs, becauſe it is the health of our ſoules: ſo
it is not called a kingdome in reſpect of God,

            <p>Put all the good things in the world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

and therefore godlines is called by the
names of thoſe things that men count beſt,
to ſhew that the godly are as well, as merrie,
as content with their loue toward God, and
Gods loue toward them, as other are with

it is ſayd of the godlie;<note place="margin">Eſa. 35. 36.</note> 
               <hi>The feare of the Lord

if God had ſayd, bee rich, and they were rich
ſtraight. For al good things were created for

becauſe the good God created them for good
men, to good purpoſes: and therfore as Iacob

(ſaith Dauid) <hi>They which ſeeke the Lord ſhall

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 10</note> Now God knowes
better then wee what is good for vs: as the

               <hi>Your heauenly Father

but he calleth it <hi>Great gaine,</hi> as if hee woulde

vnſearchable riches, euerlaſting riches,
with al the names of honor, and al the names

in her Iewels, with letters of commendation,
to make her to bee beloued. Leſt anie riches

as if hee would make a diſtinction betweene
riches and riches: betweene the gaine of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,
&amp; the gaine of godlines: the peace
of the world, and the peace of conſcience: the

The worldly men haue a kinde of peace, and
ioy, and riches, but I cannot call it great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue not inough, they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
as the godlie are, therefore onely god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe

The gaine of couetouſneſſe is nothing
but wealth: but the gaine of godlineſſe is
wealth, and peace, and ioy, and loue of God,
and the remiſſion of ſinnes, and euerlaſting
life: Therefore onely godlines hath this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

ſuch gayne, ſuch ioy, ſuch peace is in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

he is gone he boaſteth of his peni worths, and
ſaith it is better than his money. So godlines,
before a man haue it, hee ſaith it is not worth
his labour, and thinks euerie houre too much
that hee ſpendeth about it: but when he hath

ſhould bee contented, not with a thouſande
poundes, nor a hundred pounds, nor twentie
poundes, but with that hee hath: and there is
great reaſon why hee ſhould ſo; becauſe no
man knoweth what is fit for him, ſo well as
his Caruer. And therefore euerie one ſhould
eſteeme ſo reuerently of God, that hee thinke
nothing better for him (for that preſent
time) than that which God meaſureth forth
vnto him.</p>
            <p>For when Chriſt had no money, hee was
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17992:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contented, and when hee wanted money to
paie tribute,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 87</note> hee ſent for no more than hee
needed: hee might haue commanded twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
poundes, as well as twentie pence. But
to ſhewe that we ſhould deſire no more than
will ſerue our turne, hee would haue no more
than ſerued his turne. Now, becauſe Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is of ſuch a nature, that it can pleaſe it
ſelfe with pouertie, as well as riches. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called the great gaine, as though it
had all, which it wanted.</p>
            <p>And this Contentment (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Paul) we owe to Godlines, becauſe it is
not poſſible for a wicked man to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for as he is not ſatisfied with ſinne, ſo he
is ſatisfied with nothing. Riches come, and
yet the man is not pleaſed: honor comes, and
yet the man is not pleaſed: libertie comes,
&amp; yet the man is not pleaſed: pleaſure comes,
and yet the man is not pleaſed, vntill God
come,<note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 6.</note> and then he ſaith, <hi>My cup is full.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shewe vs thy Father</hi> (ſayth Phillip) <hi>and
it ſufficeth,</hi> Iohn 14. 7. Nay ſhewe vs thy
trueth, and it ſufficeth. <hi>Now my ſoule</hi> (ſayth
the Churle) <hi>take thy reſt:</hi> Nay, now my ſoule
take thy reſt, for thou haſt laide vp for many
yeares.</p>
            <p>The godly man hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that which al the
world doth ſeeke, that is, inough. Euery word
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17992:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may bee defined, and euerie thing may bee
meaſured, but inough cannot bee meaſured,
nor defined, it changeth euerie yeare: when
we had nothing, we thought it inough if we
might obtaine leſſe than wee haue: when we
came to more, we thought of another inough:
now we haue more, we dreame of another i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
ſo inough is alwaies to come, though
too much be there alreadie. For as oyle kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the fire which it ſeemes to quench, ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
come as though they would make a man
contented, and make a man more couetous.
Therefore ſeeing Contentation was neuer
found in riches, the Apoſtle reacheth to ſeeke
it in godlineſſe, ſaying; <hi>Godlineſſe is riches:</hi> as
though it did not onely make a man conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but make a man contented with it ſelfe.
Hee ſpeakes as though hee had found a newe
kinde of riches, which the world neuer thoght
of, that are of ſuch a nature, that they will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
a man like the water that Chriſt ſpake
of,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that drinkes of this water ſhall thirſt no
more:</hi> ſo they that taſt of theſe riches ſhal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
no more:<note place="margin">Act. 2. 2.</note> but as the holie Ghoſt filled all
the houſe, ſo the grace, and peace, and ioy of
the holie Ghoſt filleth all the heart, that as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
had no neede of Aſtronomie,<note place="margin">Gen. 44. 15.</note> becauſe
he had the Spirite of prophecie; ſo he which
hath Contentation, hath litle neede of riches,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17992:124"/>
hee thinkes not of the Philoſophers Stone,
nor the golde of Ophyr,<note place="margin">1. King. 28.</note> nor the mynes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;
but he hath his <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> without ſuite
of law, for hee retaineth a peace-maker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which would make all lawyers preachers,
if men were ſo wiſe to take counſell of it.
When the lawe is ended, if the man be not
content, hee is in trouble ſtill; when his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
is cured, if hee be not content, hee is ſicke
ſtill; when his want is ſupplied, if he be not
content, he is in want ſtill; when bondage is
turned into libertie, if hee be not content, hee
is in bondage ſtill; but though hee be in law,
and ſickneſſe, and pouertie, and bondage, yet
if he be content, he is free, and rich, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 25.</note>
and quiet: euen as Adam was warme,
though he had no cloathes. Such a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is Contentation, that whereſoeuer ſhe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
foote, an hundred bleſſings waite vpon
her: in euerie diſeaſe ſhe is a Phiſition, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſtrife ſhee is a Lawyer, in euerie doubt ſhe
is a Preacher, in euerie griefe ſhe is a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
like a ſweete perfume, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the euill ſent, and leaueth a pleaſant ſent
for it. As the Vnicorne dippeth his horne in
the fountaine, and maketh the waters which
were corrupt and noiſome, cleare and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
vpon the ſodaine: ſo, whatſoeuer eſtate
Godlines comes vnto, it ſaith like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17992:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> peace bee to this
heart, peace be to this man.</p>
            <p>I may liken it to the fiue loaues and two
fiſhes wherewith Chriſt fed fiue thouſande
perſons,<note place="margin">Luke 5. 9.</note> and yet there were twelue baskets
full of that which was left, which could not
fill one basket when it was whole. Thus their
little Feaſt was made a great Feaſt: ſo the
godly, though they haue but little for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
yet they haue ſomething for other, like
the Widowes Myte,<note place="margin">Mar. 12. 42</note> that they may ſay as the
Diſciples ſaid to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 35.</note> they want nothing,
though they haue nothing.</p>
            <p>Contentation wanteth nothing, and a
good heart is woorth all. For if ſhee want
bread,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 32.</note> ſhee can ſay as Chriſt ſayd, <hi>I haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bread:</hi> if ſhe want riches, ſhe can ſay, I
haue other riches: if ſhe want ſtrength, ſhe
can ſay, I haue other ſtrength: if ſhee want
friends, ſhe can ſay, I haue other friends. Thus
the godlie finde all within, that the godleſſe
ſeeke without.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if you ſee a man contented
with that which he hath, it is a great ſign that
godlines is entered into him: for the heart of
man was made a Temple of God,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 16.</note> &amp; nothing
can fill it but God alone.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12.</note> Therefore Paul ſaith
after his conuerſion, that which hee could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaie before his conuerſion, <hi>I haue learned
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17992:125"/>
to be content.</hi> Firſt he learned godlineſſe, then
godlines taught him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation. Now (ſayth
Paul) <hi>I haue learned to be content,</hi> as though
this were a leſſon for euery Chriſtian to learn,
<hi>to be content.</hi> For thus hee muſt thinke, that as
God ſayd to Moſes, when hee could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
leaue to goe to Canaan.<note place="margin">Deu. 3. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Let this ſuffice
thee to ſee Canaan:</hi> ſo, whatſoeuer hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
hee giueth this charge with it, <hi>Let this
ſuffice thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 19.</note> As Ieremie ſaith, <hi>This is my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and I will beare it;</hi> ſo thou muſt ſay, This
is my portion, and I will take it. This is the
ſigne whether godlines be in a man, if he haue
ioy of that which hee hath; for the things that
God giueth to the righteous,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17</note> Paul ſaith he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enioy, that is, if he haue much, he
can ſay with Paul,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I haue learned to abound:</hi> if
he haue litle, he can ſay with Paul, <hi>I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to want:</hi> that is, if he haue much, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
&amp; Lot, &amp; Iacob, &amp; Iob, &amp; Ioſeph, yet it
cannot corrupt his minde; but as the net was
full of fiſhes,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 11.</note> &amp; yet did not rent, becauſe they
caſt it at Chriſts commandement: ſo though
the godly be full of riches, his hart is not rent,
his minde not troubled, his countenance not
changed, becauſe he remembreth, theſe things
were giuen him to do good,<note place="margin">Heſt. 4. 14.</note> as Heſter thoght
of her honor: if he haue litle, it is like the oyle
which ſerued the widow as litle as it was:<note place="margin">2. Kin. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17992:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a little to the righteous</hi> (ſaith Dauid) <hi>is better
than great riches to the vngodlie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 37. 16.</note> for when a
man hath founde the heauenly riches, hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not for earthly riches, no more than hee
that walketh in the Sunne, thinkes whether
the Moone ſhine, or no, becauſe hee hath no
neede of her light.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6.</note> Therefore wee conclude
with Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed are they which thirſt after
righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> not
they which thirſt after riches, nor they which
thirſt after honor, nor they which thirſt after
pleaſure; they ſhall not be ſatisfied but thirſt
more, as the ambitious, voluptuous and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
do, but they that thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
ſhall be ſatisfied, though they haue no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
nor honour, nor pleaſure. If ye aske like
the Virgin,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 25.</note> 
               <hi>How can this be?</hi> I anſwere, euen
as Adam was warme without cloathes; ſo
God doth ſatisfie manie men without riches.
Though he was naked, yet hee did not ſee his
nakedneſſe, ſo long as he was innocent: but,
when hee began to rebell, than hee began to
want cloathes; ſo though a man bee poore,
yet hee doth not ſee his pouertie, ſo long as he
is contented: but when hee begins to couet,
then he begins to want riches, and from that
daye the curſe (in the firſt of Agge. 6.) takes
holde vpon him, <hi>Ye eate, but you haue not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
yee drinke, but you are not ſatisfied; yee
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17992:126"/>
cloath your ſelues, but you are not warme.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the couetous man ſeemeth to drawe the
world to him with cords, his coffers are of
load-ſtones, his hands like nets, his fingers
like lime-twigs, here it comes, and there it
comes; one would think that this man ſhold
be happie one day. When the churles barnes
were full, hee bad his ſoule reſt, thinking to
gaine reſt by couetouſnes, that he might ſay,
Riches gaine reſt as well as Godlines: but ſee
what happened; that night when hee began
to take his reſt, riches, and reſt, and ſoule, and
all, were taken from him. Did hee not gaine
faire? would he haue taken ſuch paines if hee
had thought of ſuch reſt? Couetouſnes may
gaine riches, but it cannot gaine reſt: ye may
thinke like this Churle to reſt, when your
barnes, and ſhops, and coffers are full: but ye
ſhall finde it true which Eſay ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſa. 48. 22.</note> 
               <hi>There is
no reſt to the vngodlie.</hi> Therefore the Wiſe
man to preuent any hope of reſt, or honour,
or profit, by ſinne, ſpeakes as though hee had
tried,<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>A man cannot bee eſtabliſhed by iniquitie:</hi>
therefore he cannot bee quieted nor ſatisfied
by the gaine of deceipt, or bribes, or lies, or
vſurie, which is iniquitie; therefore bleſſed is
the man whom godlines doth make rich, For
<hi>When the bleſſing of the Lorde maketh rich</hi>
(ſaith Salomon) <hi>hee dooth adde no ſorrow to it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 22.</note>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:17992:127"/>
               <hi>but</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the reuenewes of the wicked is
trouble;</hi> as though his mony were care. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let Patron, and Landlord, and Lawyer,
and all ſay nowe, that Paule hath choſen the
better riches, which thiefe, nor moath, nor
canker can corrupt: theſe are the riches at laſt
which we muſt dwell with, when all the reſt
which we haue lyed for, and ſworne for, and
fretted for, and couzened for, and broken our
ſleepe for, &amp; loſt many Sermons for, forſake
vs, like ſeruants which change their maſters:
then Godlineſſe ſhall ſeeme as great gaine to
vs as it did to Paule, and he which loued the
world moſt, would giue all that he hath for a
dram of faith, that he might be ſure to go to
heauen when he is dead, though he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
hell ſo long as he liued. Here then is
an anſwere to them which aske,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>What profit
is it to ſerue God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sa. 19. 33.</note> Howe happie was Barzillai
that would not be exalted? What quiet had
the Shunamite,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 4. 13.</note> which cared not for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?<note place="margin">Luke 5. 11.</note>
When did the Diſciples ſeeme ſo rich,
as when they were willing to leaue all? This
ſhall be your gaine, when you are Vſurers of
godlineſſe. Is not the word gone foorth yet,
which hath killed couetouſneſſe, that I may
end my Sermon? Either you goe away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
or elſe you goe away condemned of
your owne conſcience. Before you were vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17992:127"/>
with couetouſnes, but now the word ſhall
vexe you too; for you ſhall neuer couet, nor
lye, nor deceiue hereafter, but a ſergeant ſhall
arreſt you vpon it, and ſome ſentence which
you haue heard, ſhall gnaw you at the heart
with a Memorandum of hell, that yee ſhall
wiſh; Oh that I could abandon this ſinne, or
elſe that I had neuer heard that warning, that
makes it a corroſiue vnto mee before I can
leaue it. If they which are greedie ſtill, could
ſee what peace, and reſt, and ioye go home
with them which are contented (although
they may ſay with Peter,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Gold and ſiluer haue
I none</hi>) euerie man would be a ſuter to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that he might haue the dowrie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation.
If anie here be couetous ſtill, let
him alway thinke why Dauid prayeth, <hi>Turne
my heart vnto thy law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and not vnto couetouſnes;</hi>
he might haue named pride, or anger, or luſt:
but to ſhewe that no ſinne did ſo keepe his
thoughts from the law, as couetouſnes when
it came vpon him, he ſaith, <hi>Turne my hart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>It is ſaid of this Citie, that many Citizens

that is, you doe no good vntill ye die. Firſt, ye
are vngodly, that you may be rich, and then
you part from ſome of your riches, to excuſe
for your vngodlineſſe. It may bee, that ſome
here haue ſette downe in their wils; When I
die, I bequeath 100 pounds to a Colledge, &amp;
100 pounds to an hoſpitall, and 100 gownes
to poore men.<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3.</note> I do maruell that you giue no
more when you are at that point, for Iudas
when he died returned all againe: ſo yee die,
and thinke when ye are gone, that God will
take this for a quittance. Bee not deceiued,
for God doth not looke vpon that which you
doe for feare,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9. 7.</note> but vpon that which ye doe for
loue. If you can find in your heart to do good
while you are in health,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 8.</note> as Zacheus did, then
God hath reſpect to your offering; but before
God hearken how you giue your riches, firſt
he examins how ye came by them: for a man
may be hanged for ſtealing the monie which
he giueth to the poore, becauſe if hee ſhould
count Godlines gaine, much more ſhould he
care to gaine by godlie meanes. Thus you ſee
the fruits of Godlineſſe, and the fruits of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,<note place="margin">Nu. 22. 17.</note>

they ſay, Thy mother and thy brethren are

it:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſaie, I haue a Mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
which brought me foorth, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of them which heare the word of God,
and doe it, ſhe is like a ſtepmother, and theſe
are like a naturall mother.</p>
            <p>With this wiſe anſwer hee quieted the
Auditors, and made them heare him better
then they did before. For now they thought
with themſelues, what man is this which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs more then his mother? his mother
called him, and yet he would not go from vs:
his brethren ſtay for him, and he maketh as if
he did not know them, but ſaith; <hi>Who is my
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17992:130"/>
mother? who are my brethren?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt ſtood vp as it were in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt Sathan, and ſaide; Sathan,
this Sermon was not begun for thee, neither
ſhall it end for thee: this worke was not done
for my mother, neither ſhall it be left for my
mother. Thus he caught the diuell with his
owne baite, and made the people more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and attentiue towardes him, by that
which Satan thought to diſgrace him. He was
ſo armed with the Spirite, that let the diuell
tempt him, or the woman tempt him, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
tempt him, all is one.</p>
            <p>Here are two doubtes: the firſt is, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene the Euangeliſts: For Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
ſaith that one brought this meſſage:<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 47</note>
Marke and Luke attribute it to mo;<note place="margin">Mar. 3. 31.</note> both may
ſtand:<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 20.</note> for the word which his mother gaue
of calling him foorth, was receiued of the
reſt, and ſo paſſed amongſt many till it came
to Chriſt: ſo that one may be ſayd to bring
this meſſage, becauſe one noyſed it firſt: and
many may be ſayd to bring this meſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many noyſed it after.</p>
            <p>The ſecond doubt is, becauſe Chriſt had no
brethren, how they ſaid; <hi>Thy brethren would
ſpeake with thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt vnderſtand, that they which
are heere called Chriſtes brethren, were his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17992:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Coſens by the mothers ſide: that is, her ſiſters
children: for there were three Maries, and
theſe three were ſiſters: Marie the virgin, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the mother of Iames, &amp; Marie the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Cleophas, whoſe ſonnes theſe were:
their names were Iames, Ioſeph, Iudas, and
Simon; and they are called the Lordes bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
becauſe they were kinne vnto him.
Therefore note that in holie Scripture there
be foure ſortes of brethren: Brethren by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 30.</note>
ſo Eſau and Iacob were called brethren,
becauſe they had one father, and one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Brethren by nation, ſo all the Iewes are
called brethren,<note place="margin">Den. 15. 12.</note> becauſe they were of one
Countrey: Brethren by conſanguinitie, ſo
all are called brethren which are of one fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note>
and ſo Abraham called Lot his brother,
and Sarah his ſiſter,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 13.</note> becauſe they were of
one line: Brethren by profeſſion, ſo all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are called Brethren,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> becauſe they are of
one Religion: Theſe were Brethren of the
third order, that is of Conſanguinitie, becauſe
they were of one Familie.</p>
            <p>Now when his Mother, and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were come to ſee him, it is ſayd, that
they could not come neare him for the preaſe.
Here were Auditors inough: Chriſt flowed
now with Diſciples, that his mother coulde
haue no roome to heare him, but after a while
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17992:131"/>
it was low water againe.</p>
            <p>When the ſhepheard was ſtroken,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 31</note> the
ſheepe were ſcattered: when he preached in
the Streetes, and in the Temple, and in the
Fieldes, then manie flocked after him: but
when he preached vpon the Croſſe, then they
left him, which ſayd they would neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him: then there was as great a preaſe to
ſee him dye, as there was heere to heare him
preach:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> and many of theſe which ſeemed like
Bretheren, and Siſters, were his betrayers,
and his accuſers, and his perſecutors, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
we are in our zeale, more than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Thus much of their comming and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Chriſt, now to the doctrine which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in it.</p>
            <p>Heere be two Speakers: one ſayth, <hi>Thy
Mother and thy Brethren are come to ſpeake
with thee:</hi> the other ſaith, <hi>Theſe are my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Brethren, which heare the worde of
God, and doe it.</hi> The ſcope of the Euangeliſt is
this: Firſt, that Chriſt would not hinder his
doctrine for mother, or brethren, or any kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
Then, to ſhewe that there is a nearer
coniunction between our Sauiour Chriſt and
the Faithfull, than betweene the mother and
the ſonne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:17992:132"/>
The firſt is written for our inſtruction, and
the latter is written for our comfort. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the firſt,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> he which teacheth vs to honor
our father and mother, doth not teach vs here
to contemne father and mother, becauſe hee
ſpeakes of another mother: for it is ſaid; <hi>That
he was obedient to his parents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 46.</note> in Luke 2. This
he ſheweth, when being found in the temple
among the Doctors, hee left all to goe with
his mother, becauſe ſhe ſought him: ſo he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
her, that hee left all for her. This hee
ſhewed againe at his death, being vpon the
croſſe, he was not vnmindfull of her: for poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vnto Iohn,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 26.</note> hee ſaid; <hi>Behold thy mother:</hi>
and pointing vnto her, he ſaid; <hi>Woman behold
thy ſonne:</hi> ſo he commended her to his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Diſciple before he dyed.</p>
            <p>Therefore this is not a doctrine of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
but a rule how to obey. As he
taught his Diſciples to giue vnto Caeſar that
which is Caeſars,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21</note> and to God that which is
Gods:<note place="margin">Luk. 20. 25.</note> ſo hee teacheth vs here,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> to giue vnto
parents that which is parents, &amp; to the Lord,
that which is the Lordes. When God ſaide,
<hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> hee did not
giue a commaundement agaynſt himſelfe:
and therefore he ſaith; <hi>Honour me,</hi> before hee
ſaith <hi>Honour them.</hi> The firſt commandement
is <hi>Honour God,</hi> and the fift commandement is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17992:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>nour thy Parents;</hi> leaſt you ſhould honor your
Parents before God.<note place="margin">1. Kin. 2. 20.</note> When Salomon bad his
mother aske him anie thing, he ſignified that
the mother ſhould be obeied in many things;
but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he denied his Mother that one thing
which ſhe asked, he ſheweth that the Mother
ſhould not be obeied in al things. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt
ſaide,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 9.</note> 
               <hi>You haue but one Father, and one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
he ſpeakes of Faith and Religion, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that when it concerneth our Faith and
Religion, we ſhould reſpect but one Father
and one maſter, which is the giuer of our faith
and the maſter of our Religion.</p>
            <p>When Paule ſaid,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Children obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in the Lord,</hi> hee meaneth not that wee
ſhoulde obeye them againſt the Lorde; As
when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Obey Princes for conſcience
ſake,</hi> hee meaneth not that wee ſhould obey
them againſt conſcience. Therefore when it
commeth to this, that the earthly father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
one thing, and the heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commaundeth another thing; then as
Peter anſwered the Rulers, ſo maieſt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
thy Parents; <hi>Whether is it meete to obey
God, or you?</hi> Then theſe are the hands which
thou muſt cut off, then theſe are the eyes
which thou muſt pull out: or elſe they
ſhould be as deare vnto thee, as thy hand or
thine eye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:17992:133"/>
In the nineteenth of Mathew, A man muſt
forſake his father &amp; his mother, to dwel with
his wife. In the ſixteenth of Luke, he muſt
forſake father, &amp; mother, &amp; wife too, to dwel
with Chriſt: For <hi>He which forſaketh father or
mother for me, ſhall receiue more,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 26.</note>
Nay, <hi>He which doth not hate father, or
mother, or wife for me, can not be my Diſciple.</hi>
Shewing, that our loue toward God ſhould
be ſo great, that in reſpect of it, our loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men ſhould ſeeme but hatred. Thus he
which obeyed his parents more than we, yet
would haue ſome rule, ſome ſentence, ſome
example in Scripture of not obeying them
too, becauſe it is ſuch a hard point, to know
how farre they are to be obeyed, which are
ſet in authoritie ouer vs.</p>
            <p>As none but God ſpeaks alwaies aright, ſo
none but God muſt alwayes be obeyed: we
are not called onely <hi>the ſonnes of men,</hi> but we
are called <hi>the ſonnes of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 2.</note> Therefore, as
Chriſt anſwered his mother, when ſhe would
haue him turne water into wine, <hi>Woman,
what haue I to do with thee?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> ſo wee ſhould
anſwere father, and mother, and brethren,
and ſiſters, and rulers, and maiſters, and wife
too, when they will vs to do that which is
not meete, What haue I to do with you?
For to leaue doing good, and do euill, were
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17992:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to turne water into wine, but to turne
wine into water. Peter was not Sathan, but
when he tempted Chriſt like Sathan, Chriſt
anſwered him as he anſwered Sathan,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23</note> 
               <hi>Come
behind me Sathan:</hi> ſhewing, that we ſhould
giue no more attention vnto father, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or maſter, or wife, when they tempt vs to
euill, than we would giue vnto Sathan, if he
ſhould tempt vs himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Three things children receiue of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
life, maintenance, and inſtruction. For
theſe three they owe other three: for life, they
owe loue; for maintenance, they owe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for inſtruction, they owe reuerence; for
life, they muſt be loued as fathers; for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
they muſt be obeyed as maiſters; for
inſtruction, they muſt be reuerenced as Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
But as there is a king of kings, which
muſt be obeyed aboue kings: ſo there is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of fathers, which muſt be obeyed aboue
fathers; therfore, ſometime you muſt anſwer
like the ſonne, when he was bid go into his
fathers vineyard, <hi>I will go:</hi> and ſometime you
muſt anſwer as Chriſt anſwered, <hi>I muſt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
my Fathers buſineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When two milch kine did carrie the Arke
of the Lord to Bethſhemeſh, their calues
were ſhut vp at home, becauſe the kine ſhuld
not ſtay, when they heard their calues crie
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17992:134"/>
after them: ſo when thou goeſt about the
Lordes buſineſſe, thou ſhalt heare a crie of thy
Father, and thy Mother and thy brethren, and
thy Siſters, and thy Kinred, to ſtaie thee; but
then thou muſt thinke of another father, as
Chriſt thought of another Mother: and ſo as
theſe Kine went on till the Lord brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
where the Arke ſhould reſt; ſo thou ſhalt go
on till the Lord bring thee where thou ſhalt
reſt. It is better to flie from our friends, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham

Sampſon did with Dalila.</p>
            <p>I may ſay, Beware of Kinſmen, as well as
our Sauiour ſaid, <hi>Beware of men.</hi> For this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of couſenage made Eli his ſons Prieſts;<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.</note>
and this reſpect of couſenage hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

which will not out againe. As Chriſt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his ſpirituall kinſmen, ſo we preferre our
earthly kinſmen. Manie priuiledges, many
offices, and many benefices haue ſtooped to
this voice, Thy Mother calleth thee, or thy

               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:17992:134"/>
As this voice came to Chriſt while he was
labouring, ſo many voyces come to vs while
we are labouring. One ſaith, Pleaſure would
ſpeake with you: another ſaith, profit would
ſpeake with you: another ſaith, Eaſe would

            <p>When a man is in a good way, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

haue thee ſtudie the Lawe, for by Diuinitie

he beginneth to drawe vp his hand, and lay

            <p>So ſoone as the Children bee borne, their
Parents bring them to the Temple, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
them, &amp; offer them to God: but ſo ſoone
as they be able to ſerue him, they tempt them

they ſhould be of any Tribe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Tribe

            <p>Here is another genealogie of Chriſt, which
Mathew and Luke neuer ſpake of. As Chriſt
ſaith. <hi>I haue another bread which you knowe

Saint Iohn writing to a Ladie,<note place="margin">2. Iohn 1. 1.</note> which
brought vp her children in the feare of God,
calleth her the elect Ladie: ſhewing, that the
chiefeſt honour of Ladies, and Lordes, and
Princes, is to be elect of God. Saint Luke
ſpeaking of certaine Beroeans,<note place="margin">Act 17. 11.</note> which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the word of God with loue, calleth them
<hi>More noble than the reſt:</hi> ſhewing, that God
counteth none <hi>noble,</hi> but ſuch as are of a noble
Spirite. As Iohn calleth none elect, but the
vertuous; and Luke calleth none noble, but
the religious: ſo Chriſt calleth none his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but the righteous: and of thoſe onelie
hee ſaieth, <hi>Theſe are my Mother, and my
Brethren, which heare the word of God, and
doe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Abrahams Children are not counted
Children after the fleſh,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 8.</note> but Children after

Kindred after the fleſh, but kindred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Spirite;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> for the fleſh was not made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Image of God, but the ſpirit was
made after his Image: therefore God is not
called the Father of bodies, but the Father of
Spirites.</p>
            <p>Now, God (which is a Spirite) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
them which are a kinne to him
in the Spirite. Therefore Eſau was not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
becauſe hee was of Iſaacks fleſh, but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17992:136"/>
Iacob was bleſſed, becauſe he was of Iſaacks
Spirite. As wee loue in the fleſh, ſo Chriſt
loueth in the ſpirit, therefore he calleth none
his kinſemen, but them <hi>which heare the word
of God, and do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemeth that Paule thought of this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note>
when he ſaid; <hi>Till Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>
If Chriſt be formed in vs, as Paule ſaith, then
we are Chriſts mother: euerie one which wil

The virgin asked the angel <hi>how ſhe could
beare Chriſt ſeeing ſhe had not knowen a man?</hi>
Luke Chapter 1. Verſe 24. ſo you may aske
how you can beare Chriſt, ſeeing he is borne
alreadie?</p>
            <p>As there is a ſecond comming of Chriſt,
ſo there is a ſecond birth of Chriſt. When we
are borne againe, then Chriſt is borne againe:
the virgin was his mother by the fleſh,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> &amp; the
faithfull are his mother by the ſpirit:<note place="margin">Luke 21.</note> the holy
Ghoſt doth conceiue him in them: hee was
in her wombe, and he is in their hearts: ſhee
did beare him, and they doe beare him: ſhee
did nurſe him, and they do nurſe him. This
is the ſecond birth of Chriſt. As the ſoule of
man may bee called,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Temple of the holie

               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:17992:136"/>
Before theſe words it is ſaide, that Chriſt
asked, <hi>Who are my brethren?</hi> as if hee ſhould
ſay, you thinke that I am affected to my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as you are: but I tell you that I count
them my kinſmen, which heare the word of
God and do it. To ſhewe that Chriſt loueth
vs with an euerlaſting Loue, hee ſheweth
that hee doth not loue vs for anie Temporall
things, but for that which doth endure for
euer.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt loued vs,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 28.</note> as Iſaack loued Eſau, for
veniſon, then we might miſſe the bleſſing as
Eſau did: But as Iohn ſaith; <hi>He loued in the
truth,</hi> ſo Chriſt loueth in the truth. To loue
in the truth, is the true loue: euerie loue but
this at one time or other hath turned into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as the truth ouercommeth falſhood.</p>
            <p>Nowe for this loue, Chriſt calleth them
by all the names of loue, his father, and his
brethren, and his ſiſters. In Rom. 6. they are
called his ſeruants. If that be not enough, in
the fiftee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of Iohn they are called his friends.
If that be not enough, in the third of Marke
they are called his kinſmen. If that be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
in the foure &amp; twentith of Luke they
are called his brethren. If that be not enough,
in Mark 1. they are called his children. If that
be not enough, here they are called his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If that be not enough, in Cantic. 5. they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17992:137"/>
are called his Spouſe, to ſhewe that hee loued
them with all loues; the Mothers loue, the
Brothers loue, the Siſters loue, the Maſters
loue, and the Friends loue. If all theſe Loues
could be put together, yet the loue of Chriſt
exceedeth them all: and the Mother, and the
Brother, and the Siſter, and the Childe, and
the kinſmen, and the Friende, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
would not do, and ſuffer ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them all, as Chriſt hath done, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for vs alone. Such a loue we kindle in
Chriſt, when we heare his word, and do it,
that wee are as deare vnto him, as all his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together.</p>
            <p>Now as wee are his Mother, ſo ſhould we
carrie him in our heartes, as his mother did
in her armes. As wee are his Bretheren, ſo
wee ſhould preferre him, as Ioſeph did Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin,
Geneſis, Chapter fortie three, Verſe
fortie three. As we are his Spouſe, ſo ſhould
we imbrace him as Iſaac did Rebecca: if thou
be a kinſman, do like a kinſman.</p>
            <p>Now wee come to the markes of theſe
kinſmen, which I may call the Armes of his
houſe: As Chriſt ſaith; <hi>By this all men ſhall
knowe my Diſciples, if they loue one another,</hi> ſo
hee ſaith; By this ſhall all men knowe my
kinſmen, if they heare the word of God, and
doe it.</p>

As there is a kindred by the Fathers ſide,
and a kindred by the Mothers ſide, ſo there
is a kindred of Hearers, and a kindred of
dooers. In Matthew it is ſaide, <hi>Hee which
heareth the Wil of my Father, and doth it:</hi> Here
it is ſaide, <hi>Hee which heareth the worde of
God and dooth it:</hi> both are one; For his word
is his will, and therefore it is called <hi>his will.</hi>
Pſalme 119.</p>
            <p>As he ſpake there of dooing, ſo hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
here of a certaine rule, which hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>the worde of God,</hi> whereby all mens
workes muſt be ſquared: For if I do all the
workes that I can, to ſatisfie an others
will, or mine owne will; it auaileth mee
nothing with God, becauſe I doe it not
for GOD. Therefore, hee which alwaies
before followed his owne will, when hee
was ſtricken downe and beganne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note>
cried out: <hi>Lorde, what wilt thou haue
mee to doe?</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, I will doe
no more as men woulde haue mee, or as
the Diuell would haue mee, or as the fleſh
would haue mee, but as thou wouldſt haue
me.</p>
            <p>So Dauid prayed, <hi>Teach mee O Lord to
doe thy will:</hi> not my will, for wee neede not
to bee taught to doe our owne will, no more
than a Cuckoe, to ſing Cuckoe her owne
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17992:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
name. Euerie man can goe to hell without a
guide.</p>
            <p>Here is the rule nowe, if you liue by it,
then are you kinne to Chriſt: as other kinreds
go by birth, and marriage, ſo this kinred goes
by faith and obedience. Hearers are but halfe
kin, as it were in a farre degree; but they that
heare and do, are called his Mother, which is
the neareſt kinred of all. Therfore if you haue
the deed, then you are kin indeed; there is no
promiſe made to hearers, nor to ſpeakers, nor
to readers: but all promiſes are made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,
or doers.</p>
            <p>If you aske God who ſhall dwell in the
holie Mountaine;<note place="margin">Pſa. 15. 2.</note> he ſaith, <hi>The man which
walketh vprightly.</hi> Here are none but doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
If you aske Chriſt who ſhall enter into
the kingdome of heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> he ſaith; <hi>Not they
which crie Lord, Lord,</hi> (though they crie twiſe
Lord) <hi>but they which do the will of my father:</hi>
here are none but dooers. If you aske him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
howe you may come to heauen, hee
ſaith,<note place="margin">Luke. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Keepe the Commaundements:</hi> here are
none but doers. If you aske him againe, who
are bleſſed?<note place="margin">Reu. 22. 7.</note> he ſaith; <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare
the word of God and do it:</hi> here are none but
doers. If you aske an Angell, who are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
he ſaith; <hi>Bleſſed are they which keepe the
words of this booke:</hi> here are none but dooers.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17992:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If you aske Dauid, who are bleſſed? he ſaith;
<hi>The man is bleſt which keepeth iudgement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 106. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and
doeth righteouſnes:</hi> here are none but doers. If
you aske Salomon, who are bleſſed? hee ſaith;
<hi>The man is bleſſed which keepeth the law:</hi> here

bleſſed?<note place="margin">Eſay 50. 2.</note> he ſaith; <hi>Hee which doeth this is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi>
here are none but doers: If you aske Iames
who are bleſſed?<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note> he ſaith; <hi>The doer of the word

Thus bleſſing and dooing runne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Leaſt any man ſhould looke to be bleſſed
without obedience,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> Chriſt calleth Loue the
greateſt commaundement:<note place="margin">Ro. 12. 13.</note> but Salomon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Obedience the end of all, as though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obedience all were to no end.</p>
            <p>When Michah had got a Leuite into his
houſe,<note place="margin">Iudg. 17. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I know the Lord will

houſe:</hi> So many thinke, when they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a Preacher into their pariſh; Now the
Lorde will be good vnto vs, now Chriſt will
loue vs, now we are good ſonnes, ſeeing we
maintain a Preacher amongſt vs. But Michah
was not bleſſed for a Leuite, nor you for a
Preacher: but as you would haue vs do as we
teach, ſo God woulde haue you doe as you
heare: for you ſhalbe no more ſaued for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17992:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than we are for ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>When God created the Tree,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it to bring foorth fruite: ſo when he
createth Faith, he commaundeth it to bring
foorth workes: and therefore it is called a
liuely Faith. VVhen our Sauiour woulde
prooue him ſelfe vnto Iohn, to be the true
Meſſias indeed, he ſayd to his Diſciples, <hi>Tell
Iohn what things you haue heard and ſeene:</hi>
Matth. 11. 4. not onely heard, but ſeene: So
if wee will prooue our ſelues to be Chriſtes
kinſmen indeede, we muſt worke that thing
which may be ſeene as well as heard. Iohn
was not onely called, <hi>The voyce of a Crier,</hi>
Luke the ſeuenth Chapter and two &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
verſe, but, <hi>Aburning Lampe,</hi> Mathew
chap. 3. verſe 3. which might be ſeene: ſo all
which are crying voyces, muſt be burning
Lampes.</p>
            <p>Iames dooth not ſay, Let me heare thy
faith,<note place="margin">Iames 2. 18</note> but <hi>Let me ſee thy faith.</hi> As the Angels
put on the ſhape of men,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 2.</note> that Abraham
might ſee them: ſo faith muſt put on works,
that the world may ſee it. <hi>The workes which
I do</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>beare witneſſe of me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 16.</note> So the
workes which wee doe, ſhould beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of vs. Therefore Chriſt linketh Faith
and Repentance together. <hi>Repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the Goſpell.</hi> Marke the firſt chapter, verſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17992:139"/>
fifteene. Therefore I conclude, <hi>That which
Chriſt hath ioyned, let no man ſeparate.</hi> Marke
chap. 10. ver. 9.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue ſhewed you Chriſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
a great preaſe hearing, his Friends and
Kinsfolke interrupting, and Chriſt againe
withſtanding the interruption: By this you
may ſee what a ſpirite the diuell hath to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Sermon, therfore no maruell though
he cauſe ſo many to be put to ſilence; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
though he ſtand ſo againſt a learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie;
no maruell though he raiſe vp ſuch
ſlaunders vpon Preachers; no maruell though
he write ſo manie bookes againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Gouernment in the Church; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
though he make ſo manie Non-reſidents;
no maruel though he ordain ſo many dumbe
Prieſtes; for theſe make him the God of this
world.</p>
            <p>The Diuell is afrayde that one Sermon
will conuert vs, and we are not moued with
twentie: So the diuell thinketh better of vs
than we are.</p>
            <p>Againe, by this you may learne howe to
reſiſte and withſtande temptations: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee thy father which tempteth thee,
thy mother which tempteth thee, or thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which tempteth thee, or thy ſiſter which
tempteth, or thy kinſman which tempteth,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17992:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or Rulers which tempteth, or Maſter which
tempteth, or wife which tempteth. As Chriſt
would not know his mother, againſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
ſo thou ſhouldſt not know any father, or
mother, or brother, or ſiſter, or friend, or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or maſter, or childe, or wife againſt God.
If the mothers ſute may be refuſed ſometime,
a noble mans letter may be refuſed too: Hee
that can turne his hinderance to a furtherance
as Chriſt did heere, may make vſe of euerie
thing.</p>
            <p>Againe, by this you may learne how to
chooſe your friends. As Chriſt counted none
his kinſmen but ſuch as heare the worde of
God and doe it: ſo we ſhould make none our
familiars, but ſuch as Chriſt counteth his
kinſmen.</p>
            <p>Againe, you may ſee the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Chriſt and the worlde: Chriſt calleth
the godly his kinſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be they neuer ſo poore;
and we ſcorne to call the poore our kinſmen,
be they neuer ſo honeſt, ſo proude is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
aboue his maſter.</p>
            <p>Againe, by this you may ſee how Chriſt is
to be loued, for when hee calleth vs his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hee ſheweth vs the way to loue him as a
mother, for indeede hee is the mother of his
mother, and his brethren too.</p>
            <p>Againe, by this all vaunting and boaſting
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17992:140"/>
of Kinred is cut off. Glorie not in that thou
haſt a Gentleman to thy Father, glorie not
that thou haſt a Knight to thy Brother, but
glorie that thou haſt the Lord to thy Brother.<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note>
He which called Abraham his Father fried in

If Marie might not bee prowde of ſuch a

            <p>Againe:<note place="margin">Eſay 2.</note> by this you may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you be kinne to Chriſt. As thoſe Prieſtes
were ſhut out of the Temple, which could
not count their Genealogie from Aaron:
ſo they ſhall bee excluded out of Heauen,
which cannot reckon their Pedegree from
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Heere are the Armes now, whereby you
may ſhewe of what Houſe you come. If you
heare the woord of God, and doo it, then
Chriſt ſaith vnto you, as hee ſaid vnto them,
<hi>Theſe are my Mother, and my Bretheren, and
my Siſters:</hi> You women are his Siſters, and
you men are his Bretheren: and if you be
Chriſts Brethren, then are you Gods Sonnes:
and if you be Gods Sonnes, then are you his
Heyres; for all Gods Sonnes are called <hi>heires</hi>
Rom. 8. 7.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, by this you may know the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17992:141"/>
Kinſemen: and therefore our Sauiour
Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> 
               <hi>You are of your father the diuell:</hi>
Shewing that the diuel and the wicked are as
neare kinne as Chriſt and the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Now as Dauid ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Sa. 16. 23</note> 
               <hi>Seemeth it a light thing
vnto you to be the Sonne of a king, ſeeing I am
a poore man and of ſmall reputation?</hi> So may I
ſaie, ſeemeth it a light thing vnto you, to be
the ſonnes of the king of kings, ſeeing you are
poore men and of ſmal reputation? It is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a great honor to Abraham,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 16.</note> Iſaac &amp; Iacob
that God was not aſhamed, to be called their
God; What an honor then is this, that God
is not aſhamed to be called our Father? nay,
our brother, as though we were matched with
him.</p>
            <p>If the Iſraelites had ſuch care to match with
the ſeruants of God, what a bleſſing is this to
marrie with the ſonne of God? Therefore if
any affect rich kinſmen or great marriages:
heere is a greater then Salomon, marrie thou
him. This kinſman of ours is now gone vp
into heauen, that we may haue a friend in the
Court.</p>
            <p>Ioſeph deſired the Butler to remember him
when hee ſtood before Pharaoh,<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 40.</note> and hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
him though hee had pleaſured him.<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 14.</note> But
a Theefe deſired Chriſt to remember him
<hi>when he came into his kingdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 48.</note> and hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

him into paradiſe the ſame day, though
he had alwayes offended him: to ſhewe that
although wee haue beene as bad as theeues,
yet we may hope in Chriſt. Therefore, now I
may conclude, you haue heard the word, if
you goe away and doe it: then you are the
Mother, and Brethren, and Siſters of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

then the fortreſſe is loſt. For that time all our
thoughts, words and works, are captiue vnto
him: he bids them go, and they go, do, and
they do it.</p>
            <p>That man is like Eſau, which had an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
which had a heart,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 23.</note> but now he hath
not poſſeſſion of his owne, therfore giue God
thy heart, that he may keepe it, not a peece of
thy heart, not a roome in thy heart, but thy
heart. The heart diuided, dieth: God is not
like the mother, which would haue the child
diuided, but like the naturall mother, which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17992:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaid, rather then it ſhould be diuided, let her
take all. Let the diuell haue all, if he which
gaue it bee not worthie of it: God hath no
copeſmate, therefore he will haue no parting
of ſtakes, but all or none, and therefore hee
which askes heere thy heart, in the ſixt of
Deuteronomie, and the fift verſe, askes <hi>all thy
heart, all thy ſoule, all thy ſtrength;</hi> thriſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
all, leaſt we ſhould keepe a thought
behind: yet it is thy heart, that is, a vayne
heart, a barren heart, a ſinfull heart, vntil thou
giue it vnto God, and then it is the ſpouſe of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eſa. 47. 17.</note> the temple of the holy Ghoſt, and the
image of God,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11. 9.</note> ſo changed and formed,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 16.</note> and
refined,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 19.</note> that God calls it a new heart.</p>
            <p>Some haue a double heart, as it is in the
twelfth Pſalme: but God acknowledgeth
but one heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12. 2.</note> ſaying, <hi>Giue me thy heart,</hi> not
giue thy hearts; declaring that a ſingle heart
is pleaſing vnto him, and that they which
haue a double heart, a heart and a heart, haue
neuer a good heart.</p>
            <p>God doth not require the heart, as though
he required no more but the heart, like the
Pope, which ſaith, Giue my thy heart, and it
ſufficeth. To maintaine his Papiſts pendant
and crouehant, which liue among Chriſtians;
he requireth nothing of ſuch but their heart,
that they may worſhip God with their lips,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17992:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and diſſemble their religion, and forſweare
their opinion, and come to ſermons, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to other lawes, and ſeeme Proteſtants,
as the diuell licenſeth witches to ſeeme Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
ſo they giue him their heart, he diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
with them to diſſemble, and giue the
reſt as they liſt: but God requireth the heart,
becauſe we ſhould not diſſemble; for in the
twelfth to the Romanes, he commandeth the
bodie too,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Offer vp your bodies:</hi> which we can
not do, vnleſſe we giue heart, and hand, and
tongue, and eyes, and eares, and all; for the
bodie is all: but the heart is chiefe in requeſt,
becauſe if there be anie goodneſſe, it lyes in
the heart, &amp; becauſe he which giues the heart,
giues all:<note place="margin">Luke 6. 45.</note> for out of the abundance of the hart
the mouth ſpeaketh, the hand worketh, the
eye looketh, the eare liſteneth, the foote wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to good or euill.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is ſuch ſtrife for the heart,
as there was for Moſes bodie,<note place="margin">Iud. 9.</note> Giue it mee
ſaith the Lord, giue it me ſaith the Tempter,
giue it me ſaith the Pope, giue it me ſaith ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
giue it me ſaith pleaſure, as though thou
muſt needes giue it: now here is the choyce,
whether thou wilt giue it to God or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
Gods heart or the diuels heart, whoſe
wilt thou be?</p>
            <p>Thus doth man hang in a ballance, like
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17992:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a yong virgin which hath manie ſutors: ſome
ſhe fancieth for parentage, ſome for perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
ſome for friends, ſome for wealth, ſome
for wit, ſome for vertue, and after all, chooſeth
the worſt of all; ſo the heart hath ſo many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
beſides God, that ſometime ſhe marrieth
with one, ſometimes with another, the world
keeps her, the fleſh keeps her, the deuil keeps
her, which haue no more intereſt in her, than
Herod to his ſiſter,<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 4.</note> but ſeeke her ſpoile, like
them which marrie for riches, are glad when
one dies, that another may come. Theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are like Abſolon, which did not ſeeke
the hearts of the people like Dauid, but ſtole
them with flatterie and lies:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 6.</note> but God would
haue thee <hi>giue thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a man conſiders what he doth when he
giues: ſo God licenſeth vs to conſider of that
which we do for him, whether he deſerues
it, whether we owe it, whether he can requite
it, leſt it ſhould come againſt our will, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>giue me,</hi> ſaith God: as though he would
not ſtraine vpon vs, or take from vs, but if
thou wilt giue him thy heart, then he accepts
it; it muſt come freely like a gift, as his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
come to vs, and then his demaund is
graunted.</p>
            <p>Here is no reſpect of time, how long thou
maiſt ſtay it, or how long he wil keepe it, but
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17992:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
giue it, is the preſent time, as though he wold
haue it out of hand, while hee askes, before ye
goe out of the Church: for what can we aske
of him, while we denye him but one thing
when he askes of vs? therefore conſider who
is a ſutor to you. Now I am a Collector for
God, to gather hearts, either you muſt grant
him, or denie him; thinke who ſhall looſe by
it, if thou wilt not pay thy Land-lord his rent.
How many ſubiectes would reioyce if they
had any thing to giue to their prince, &amp; pray
her to accept it, and be glad if ſhe would take
it, that they might but ſay; I haue giuen a

that ſhee had a little Oyle to ſprincke vpon

yea the widdow of Zareptah was ſo ioyfull
that ſhe had a little food for the Prophet,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 17. 13</note> that
ſhe ſpared it from her children and her ſelfe,
to ſerue him firſt: ſo they which loue the

him,<note place="margin">Luke 5. 11.</note> had rather that he ſhould haue their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
their honors, their hearts and their liues,
then they themſelues.</p>
            <p>Why is Dauid called <hi>a man after Gods
owne heart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sa. 13. 14</note> but becauſe when God ſaid, <hi>Giue
me thy heart,</hi> his ſpirite anſwered like an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,
I giue thee my heart? Is God ſo deſirous
of my heart? what good can my heart doo to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17992:147"/>
God? It is not woorthie to come vnder his
roofe, I would I had a better gift to ſend vnto
my Lorde, goe my heart to thy Maker, the
Bridegroome hath ſent for thee, put on thy
wedding garment, for the King himſelfe will
marrie thee. Who is not ſorrie now, that hee
did not giue his heart before? Is hee not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to die which will take his heart from him
that made it, from him which redeemed it,
from him which preſerues it, from him which
will glorifie it; to giue it vnto him which will
infect it, torment it, condemne it? Will a
ſeruant reach the cup to a ſtranger, when his
Maſter cals for it? Or will a man ſell his coate
if he haue no moe? What dooſt thou reſerue
for God, when thou haſt giuen Sathan thy

ſhall he dine, if the chamber be taken vp, and
the heart let foorth to another? Thou art but

if thou wert Landlord,</p>
            <p>Canſt thou poſſeſſe another mans goods
but he will moleſt thee, and trouble thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

vntill thou let thy heart goe,<note place="margin">Exo. 8 &amp; 9. &amp; 10.</note> that it may
ſerue God: for, as if a man ſhould pull
out thy heart, and take it from thee, ſo
greeuous is it to God to keep thy heart from
him.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all Sutors haue their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that thy heart is married alreadie. As
Iſaac anſwered Eſau,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Iacob haue I bleſſed, and
he ſhalbe bleſſed:</hi> ſo thou maiſt ſay, God hath
my heart, and he ſhall haue it; and them that
craue it hereafter, ſend them to Chriſt for it,
for it is not thine to giue, if thou haue giuen it
to God alreadie. But take heede thy heart do
not lye to thy ſelfe, and ſay it is Gods when it
is the worldes,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 24. 6.</note> like Ieroboams Wife, which
woulde not ſeeme to bee Ieroboams Wife.
By this thou ſhalt knowe whether thou haſt
giuen it to him or no; if the Heart be gone,
all will followe. As the Sunne riſeth firſt,
and then the beaſtes ariſe from their dennes,
the Fowles from their neaſtes, and men from
their beddes: ſo when the Heart ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to God, all the members will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after it, the tongue will praiſe him, the
foote will follow him, the eare will attend
him, the eye will watch him, the hand will
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17992:148"/>
ſerue him, nothing will ſtaie after the heart,
but euerie one goes like handmaydes after
their miſtreſſe:<note place="margin">Pſal. 123. 2</note> this Chriſt verifieth, ſaying:
make cleane within,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 26</note> and all will bee cleane:
therefore the Publican did beat vpon his hart,
as though hee were angrie with it, becauſe it
did not waken all the reſt: ſhewing that as
the Father gaue vs all, when hee gaue his ſon,
ſo we giue him all when wee giue our heartes.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note>
This is the melodie which Paul ſpeaketh of,
Epheſ. 5. 19. <hi>Make melodie in the Lord in your
hearts:</hi> ſhewing that there is a conſort of all
the members, when the heart is in tune, and
that it ſoundes like a melodie in the eares of
God, and makes vs reioyce while wee ſerue
him. Wee haue example heereof in Chriſt,
which ſaid it was meate and drinke vnto him
to doo his fathers will:<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 34.</note> and in Dauid, which
daunced to ſee the Arke;<note place="margin">2. Sa. 6. 14.</note> and in the Iſraelites,
of whom it is ſaide,<note place="margin">1. Chro. 29. 9</note> that they reioyced, when
they offered from their heart vnto the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Therefore Salomon pricking out the heart
for God, ſpake as though he would ſet out the
pleaſanteſt, and faireſt, &amp; eaſieſt way to ſerue
him, without any grudging, or toyle, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe:
touch but the firſt linke, and all the
reſt will follow; ſo ſet the heart a going, and it
is like the poize of a clocke, which turnes all
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17992:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wheeles one way; ſuch an Oyle is vpon
the heart, which makes al nimble and currant
about it: therfore it is almoſt as eaſie to ſpeak
well and doe well, as to thinke well. If the
heart indite a good matter, no maruel though
the tongue be the Pen of a readie writer:<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 1.</note> but
if the hart be dull, all is like a left hand, ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
and vntoward, that it cannot turne it ſelfe
to any good.</p>
            <p>Therfore Gods ſutes haue ſo hard paſſage
in mens counſailes, iudgements, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe they doe not giue him their
harts, which ſhould be the firſt offering of all;
if they woulde giue him their hearts before
they ſit downe to heare his cauſe, they could
not denie him anie thing that is for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
though it were againſt their profit: but
as Chriſt ſaieth,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39</note> 
               <hi>Not my will, but thy will:</hi> ſo
they would ſay, It is not our Kingdome, but
thy Kingdome; it is not our Church, but thy
Church; therefore not our will, but thy will;
not our law, but thy law; not our diſcipline,
but thy diſcipline raigne in it; and all that
giue their hearts ſubſcribe to this: the reſt ſay,
not thy wil, but our wil; not thy law, but our
law; not thy diſcipline, but our diſcipline, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>They ſeeke their
owne glorie, and not Chriſts,</hi> Phil. 2. 21. This
hath bene the rub euer ſince Antichriſt was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17992:149"/>
firſt reſiſted.<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 3.</note> Herode could not ſee how hee
ſhould be King, if Chriſt ſhould raigne, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Image-makers cried and ſtormed
when Images ſhould goe downe,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 25.</note> alleadging
that they liued by that craft: ſo, if you marke
what kind of men they were which did preach
and write, and labour ſo hotly againſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is they that were like to looſe ſome of
their dignities, or their commodities by it.</p>
            <p>The Scribes and Phariſies reſiſted Chriſt
more than the people,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 48.</note> becauſe hee denounced
woe to them,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 7.</note> and miſliked that they ſhould
bee called Rabbi:<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 21</note> how hard it is to follow
Chriſt, when he ſaith, <hi>Leaue all;</hi> nay, if he bid
vs leaue any thing for him, though we ſhould
leaue our ſelues, Matt. 16. 24. The tongue wil
not praiſe, becauſe the heart doth not loue;
the eare doth not heare, becauſe the heart
doth not minde; the hand doth not giue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the heart doth not pitie; the foote will
not goe, becauſe the heart doth not ſtirre; all
ſtaie vpon the heart, like the Captaine that
ſhould giue the onſet. Thus to ſhew that hee
deſerueth all, the Lord requireth that which
bringeth all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God requireth the Heart,
ſhewing that all the things of this worlde are
not woorthie of it, nor a peece of it, nor a
thought, vnles it be to contemne them, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17992:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thought of vanitie:<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 13. &amp; 14.</note> for if the heart be
the Temple of God, hee which giueth it
to anie thing elſe, committeth Sacriledge,
and breaketh that Commaundement, <hi>Giue
vnto GOD that which is Gods,</hi> Matthewe
22. 21.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that all ſhould conſent ſo with
the heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 4.</note> that wee ſhould ſpeake as if our
heart did ſpeake,<note place="margin">Iob 22. 22.</note> pray as if our heart did pray,
heare as if our heart did heare, giue as if our
heart did giue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remit as if our heart did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and counſell as if our heart did counſell,
as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Doe all things heartely.</hi>
Col. 3. 23. which if we could keepe, nothing
that wee doe ſhould trouble vs, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is troubleſome, but that which goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that wee ſhould ſerue God for
himſelfe, and not for our ſelues, as he which
giues his heart, doth all for loue: this Chriſt
requires, when he caſts off that Diſciple, that
offred to follow him for aduantage,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 19.</note>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt not looke for a place

Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 20.</note> as Peter did, &amp; not ſeeke all by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Fiftly, that wee ſhould not ſerue God by
fits, as we vſe to pray when the night comes,
to heare when the Sabboath comes, to faſt
when Lent comes, to repent when death
comes: but the ſeruice of the heart is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſeruice,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 16.</note> like that in 1. Theſſ. 5. 16. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
euermore, praye continually, in all things

prayeth, and thanketh continually? The tong
prayeth but ſometime, the eare attendeth but
ſometime, the hand giueth but ſometime; but
the heart prayeth, and praiſeth, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
alwaies; a man may ſerue God alwaies
with his heart and neuer bee wearie, becauſe
the heart cannot ſerue him, vnles it reioyce in

God with muſicke,<note place="margin">1. Chro. 15. 16.</note> which did not delight
God, but ſhewed that they delighted in his

tongue, or the hande, or the eare, thinke to

before he begin, and thinketh himſelfe in the

vntill his Prayer bee done, that hee may
bee at libertie, and returne to his olde byas
againe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this ſhewes how God miſlikes
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17992:150"/>
our coldneſſe in hearing, or praying, if we

Chapter and ſixe and fortieth verſe,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 46.</note>

and almes, were as faire as the Apoſtles; yet
they had no reward,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> but <hi>Wo to you hypocrites;</hi>
becauſe they wanted the heart; which is like
the fire that kindleth the Sacrifice.<note place="margin">1. Re. 18. 25</note> But will
he require our prayers, and faſtes, and almes,
as he did theirs?<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> Yea ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Except your

Except we giue our hearts beſide our lippes,

becauſe our righteouſneſſe doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
the righteouſneſſe of the Phariſies,
but their righteouſneſſe verie farre exceedeth
ours.</p>
            <p>Chriſt doth not bid them <hi>wo,</hi> becauſe they
were Phariſies as we are not, but becauſe they
were hypocrites as we are. God delights him
ſelfe in giuing,<note place="margin">Mica. 7. 18</note> and therefore he loueth a
cheerefull giuer; but he cannot giue cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 7.</note>
which giues not his heart. Therefore, as
Iudas thought the Oyle ſpent which was
powred vpon Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 9.</note> and wiſhed the price of
it in his purſe: ſo they grutch &amp; grieue when
they ſhould doe good, and thinke, Shall I
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17992:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
giue it? Can I ſpare it? What will it bring?
So the good worke dieth in the birth, like a
bird which droupeth in the hand, while the
head conſiders whether he ſhall let her goe,
or hold her ſtill: as eaſie to wring Hercules
club out of his fiſtes, as to wring a penitent
teare from their eyes, a faithfull prayer from
their lips, or a good thought from their heart,
which cannot affoord the heart it ſelfe: all is
too much, which they do, and they thinke
God more beholding to them for blurting
out a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or ſtaying a Sermon, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
a Friday, than they to him for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites:
and when they haue done, what is
their reward?<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> Woe bee vnto you like the
Scribes and Phariſies, becauſe you giue not
your hearts but your mouthes,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 8.</note> therefore we
do but vexe our ſelues, and looſe our labour,
thinking to make God beleeue that we pray,
when indeed our lips do but pray: whereby
it comes to paſſe, as we ſerue him, ſo he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs, our peace is not in deed but in word,
our ioy is not in heart but in countenance, a
falſe comfort, like our falſe worſhip: for he
which giueth God his lips in ſtead of his hart,
teacheth God to giue him ſtones in ſtead of
bread: that is, a ſhadow of comfort for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue giuen God faire words,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17992:152"/>
and long prayers, and ſolemne faſtes, and
mourning countenances, hee puts in but a
word more to fill vp the Sacrifice, <hi>Giue me thy
heart,</hi> and it ſufficeth. It is like the laſt ſute of
Abraham when he ſaid to God, <hi>I will ſpeake
but this once:</hi> ſo if thou wilt heare him in this,
he will aske no more, therefore nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
whether God ſhall haue thy heart or

thou canſt not keepe it till I ende my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>Of all the ſuters which come vnto you, it
ſeemes there is none which hath anie title to

it by the name of a ſonne:<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> as if he ſhould ſay,
thou ſhalt giue it to thy Father, which gaue it

I am their father, if I dwell in their hearts, for
the heart is the temple of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 16.</note> therefore if

deſires it, thy Redeemer deſires it, thy Sauiour

            <p>Therefore now aske your hearts, whoſe

we demurre vpon the cauſe when we ſhould
giue, whether we ſhould giue or no; and aske
the fleſh, and our luſts, and our pleaſures: and
if the diuell will not giue his aſſent, then wee
returne an excuſe, it is not mine to giue, or if
thou canſt get the diuels good will, I will not
ſtand; or let ſinne and pleaſure haue it for a

God ſhall haue it.</p>
            <p>Thus euery thing which ſhould be thrown
out, hath a place in our heart; and he which

there, though hee would open the doores of

then, when it may not ioy any longer here,
and the ioyes of Heauen are ſhut agaynſt it?
and hee which deſired it, will not haue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it comes like the fooliſh Virgins,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 11</note> when

that yee might haue a Kingdome for them.
Send for your hearts where they are wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
one from the Banke, another from the

the Theaters; call them home, and giue them
all vnto God, and ſee how hee will welcome
them,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 22.</note> as the Father imbraceth his Sonne. If

Euen as Dina was defloured when ſhe ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

from God. Therefore call the members toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and let them faſt like a queſt of twelue
men, vntill they conſent vppon lawe, before
anie moe Tearmes paſſe, to giue God his
right, and let him take the heart which hee
wooeth, which hee would marrie, which hee
would endowe with all his goods, and make
it the heyre of the crowne. When you pray,
let your heart pray; when you heare, let your
heart heare; when you giue, let your heart
giue; whatſoeuer you doe, ſet the heart to
doe it: and if it be not ſo perfect as it ſhould

Now if you cannot command your hearts
to turne vnto God, becauſe the diuell pleades
cuſtome, and the fleſh will not agree to leaue
her poſſeſſions, then remember what Chriſt
ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>When ye giue almes, let not your left hand
know what the right hand doth:</hi> ſo the fleſh
muſt not knowe what the ſpirite doth. Thou
muſt not make thy luſts of counſel; but as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
when hee was bid to offer his ſonne,
roſe vp betime and left his wife at home, and
neuer made Sarah priuie leſt ſhe ſhould ſtop
him,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 6.</note> being more tender ouer her childe (like
women) than the father is: ſo thou muſt giue
thy heart to God, before the fleſh heare of it:
for if Abigaile had conſulted with Nabal,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 25. 18</note>
whether ſhe ſhuld haue ſupplied Dauid with
victuals or no, when he ſent; the miſer would
neuer haue giuen his conſent, which ſcolded
ſo ſoone as he heard of it, therefore ſhe went
alone, and gaue that which hee asked, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tolde her husband what ſhee would doe,
leſt hee ſhould hinder her, which ſought her
welfare and his too: ſo wee ſhould ſteale our

            <p>I haue but one daye more to teach you all

where haue I caſt the ſeede, and how haue ye

ye ſhall bee adopted this daye the ſonnes of

but being made out of Paradiſe, hee was
brought into Paradiſe, to ſhew how all his ioy

in zeale,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> that is, Be zealous according to
diſcretion, as Paule ſaith, <hi>Be wiſe according to
ſobrietie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 28</note> The Diſciples were commended
for their zeale, when they left all to followe
Chriſt: but Chriſt reprooued them for their
zeale, when they would pray for fire from
heauen to conſume the Samaritanes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
zeale and diſcretion vnited together,<note place="margin">Luke. 9. 55.</note> are
like vnto the two lyons which ſupported the
Throane of Salomon:<note place="margin">1. King. 20.</note> and hee which hath
them both, is like Moſes for his mildneſſe, &amp;
like Phineas for his feruencie: therefore, as
wine is tempered with water, ſo let diſcretion
temper zeale. But I neede not bring water to
que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch that fire which is out alreadie, I would
rather I could ſay of you, You are too zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 22</note>
as Paule told the Athenians, they were
too ſuperſtitious. But our ſickneſſe is not a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17992:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hot ſickneſſe, but a colde ſickneſſe, the hot
bodie is diſtempered, but the colde bodie is
dead. Zeale was neuer infamous before our
dayes: the Papiſts are commended, if they
be zealous; but the Proteſtant if he be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
is held in deriſion.</p>
            <p>Then I ſhewed you how the ſpirit is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
as a man doth quench his reaſon with
ouermuch wine: and therefore we ſay, when
the wine is in, the wit is out; becauſe before
he ſeemes to haue reaſon, and now he ſeemes
to haue none: ſo our zeale, and our faith, and
our loue are quenched with ſinne. Euerie
vaine thought, and euery idle word, and euery
wicked deed, is like ſo many drops to quench
the Spirit of God. Some quench it with the
buſines of this world, ſome quench it with the
luſtes of the fleſh, ſome quench it with the
cares of the minde, ſome quench it with long
delayes, that is, not plying the motion when
it commeth, but croſſing the good thought
with bad thoughts, and doing a thing when
the Spirite ſayth, Doo it not; as Achab went
to battell after he was forbidden. Sometime
a man ſhall feele him ſelfe ſtirred to a good
worke, as though hee were led to it by the
hand; and againe he ſhall be frighted from
ſome euill thing, as though he were reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in his eare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, if hee reſiſt hee ſhall
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17992:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtraight feele the ſpirit going out of him, and
heare a voyce pronouncing him guiltie, and
hee ſhall hardly recouer his peace againe.
Therefore Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Grieue not the Spirite;</hi>
ſhewing, that the ſpirite is often grieued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be quenched: and that when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to grieue, and checke, and perſecute the
ſpirit, lightly he neuer ceaſſeth vntill he haue
quenched it, that is, vntill he ſeeme to haue
no ſpirit at all, but walketh like a lumpe of
fleſh.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Quench not the Spirite,</hi> followeth,
<hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying.</hi> In the ende of this
Epiſtle, Paule ſpeaketh like a father which is
come to the ende of his life; who becauſe he
hath but a while to ſpeake, heapeth his Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
together, which he would haue his ſons
remember when he is gone: ſo Paul, as though
he were ſet to giue good counſel, and had not
leaſure to ſpeake that he would, ſendeth the
Theſſalonians a briefe of his minde, which
their meditation ſhould after amplifie &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
vnto them.</p>
            <p>His firſt aduice is, <hi>Quench not the Spirite,</hi>
that is, when a good motion commeth, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it like a frend, and croſſe it not with thy
luſts. The ſecond admonition teacheth how
the firſt ſhould be kept, <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the ſpirite will not quench, becauſe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17992:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
propheſying doth kindle it. The third admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
teacheth how to make fruite of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
Trie the doctrines of them which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
and thou ſhalt not beleeue errour for
truth, but hold the beſt. The fourth admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the ſumme of all, and it commeth laſt,
becauſe it is longeſt in learning; that is, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from all appearance of euill.</hi> This is the
ſumme of all, for he which can abſtaine not
onely from euill, but from the appearance of
euill, is ſo perfect as a man can be in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life: put all theſe together, and it is as if
Paule ſhould ſay, Quench not the ſpirite by
deſpiſing of propheſying; neither deſpiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,
becauſe all do no prophecie alike:
but rather when you heare ſome preach one
way and ſome another, when you ſee ſome
follow him, and others follow him, do you
trie the doctrines by the Scripture, as the men
of Beroea did,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> and chuſe that which is beſt,
and ſoundeſt, and trueſt, hauing alway ſuch
an eye to the truth, that you abſtaine from all
appearance of error; ſo iealous the holy ghoſt
would haue vs of our faith, that we ſet no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
vpon our religion but that which is an
vndoubted truth. As Moſes did nothing in
the Tabernacle, but that which was ſhewed
in his patterne. It ſeemes that there were ſome
among the Theſſalonians, as there be among
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:17992:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, which did forſake all religion becauſe the
preachers did not agree, or becauſe the liues
of profeſſors gaue ſome offence, therefore
Paul ſheweth that there is no cauſe why they
ſhould miſlike the word for the Preacher, or
why they ſhould deſpiſe religion for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
becauſe the word and the religion are
not theirs which teach it and profeſſe it, but
Gods, and therefore can not be polluted by
them no more than God. Then hee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that ſeeing it is neceſſarie, that there ſhal
be alwayes errours and hereſies to trie vs, we
ſhould alſo trie them, and thereby be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſo much the more from errour, or hereſie,
or ſuperſtition, that we abſtain euen from the
appearance thereof, leſt we fall into the ſinne;
this is the ſcope of theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying.</hi> This admonition
is as it were the keeper of the former, for by
prophecying the Spirit is kindled, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prophecying the Spirit is quenched, and
therefore after <hi>Quench not the Spirite,</hi> Paule
ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying;</hi> ſhewing that as
our ſinne doth quench the Spirit, ſo prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
doth kindle it.<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 32.</note> This you may ſee in the
Diſciples that went to Emaus, of whom it is
ſayd, when Chriſt preached vnto them out of
the law and the Prophets, the ſpirite was ſo
kindled with his propheſying, that their harts
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17992:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
waxed hot within them. This you ſee againe
in Sauls meſſengers,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 19. 20</note> which were ſent for Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
when they came among the Prophets &amp;
heard them prophecie, their ſpirite was ſo
kindled, that they could not chuſe but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
alſo, inſomuch that Saul came after
him ſelfe, and hearing the Prophets as they
did, the Spirit came vnto him likewiſe, and he
prophecied too;<note place="margin">1. Sa. 19. 23</note> wherupon it was ſaid, <hi>Is Saul
alſo among the Prophets?</hi> This is no maruell,
that the ſpirit of man ſhould be ſo kindled,
and reuiued, and refreſhed with the word, for
the word is called the Food of the ſoule; take
away the word from the ſoule,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> and it hath
no foode to eate. As if you ſhould take food
from the bodie, the bodie would pine. And
therefore Salomon ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 26. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Without viſions the
people periſh:</hi> that is, without prophecying the
people famiſh. Therefore hee which loueth
his ſoule, had no need to deſpiſe prophecying;
for then he famiſheth his owne ſoule, and is
guiltie of her death; therefore that Paſtor or
that Patron, which is the cauſe why any place
doth want preaching, is guiltie of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
becauſe he which taketh, or kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
away the food, doth famiſh the bodie.
The Apoſtle might haue ſayd, loue prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,
or honor prophecying; but he ſaith,
<hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying.</hi> And why doth hee
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17992:161"/>
forbidde to deſpiſe Prophecying? Why did
Chriſt ſay,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The poore receiue the Goſpell?</hi> but
to ſhew that the rich did contemne it. Why
doth Paul ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpell?</hi>
but to ſhew that many are aſhamed of it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſo he ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the greateſt honour which we giue
to Prophets, is not to deſpiſe them; and the
greateſt loue which we carrie to the Word, is
not to loath it. If we do not deſpiſe the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
then we thinke that we honour them
enough: and if wee do not loath the Word,
then we thinke that we loue it enough: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
for Honour prophecying. <hi>Prophecying</hi>
here dooth ſignifie Preaching, as it dooth in
Rom. 1. 14. Wil you know why preaching is
called <hi>prophecying?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 14.</note> To adde more honor and
renown to the preachers of the word, to make
you receiue them like Prophetes, and then
Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 41</note> 
               <hi>You ſhall haue a Prophets reward;</hi>
that is, not ſuch a reward as you giue, but ſuch
a reward as God giueth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (if you marke) Paul ſaith not, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
not Prophets, but <hi>prophecying:</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that from the contempt of the Prophets,
at laſt we come to deſpiſe Prophecying too,<note place="margin">Ier. 11. 27.</note>
like the Iewes, who when they were offended
with the Prophet, charged him to prophecie
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:17992:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no more. Therefore, as Chriſt warned his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 3.</note>
to heare the Scribes and Phariſies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they did not as they taught; ſo Paule
warneth the Theſſalonians, that if anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
among them do not as they teach, and
therefore ſeeme worthie to bee deſpiſed like
the Scribes and Phariſies, yet that they take
heed that they do no deſpiſe prophecying for
the Prophets. Becauſe the preachers are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed
before the word be deſpiſed, therefore
we will ſpeake firſt of their contempt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt asked his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 13</note> what they
thought of him; ſo; I would aske you, what
you thinke of Preachers?<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> Is he a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perſon,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 20.</note> which bringeth the meſſage of
God? which hath the name of an Angel? and
all his words are meſſengers of life? Prophets
are of ſuch account with God,<note place="margin">Amos 3. 7.</note> that it is ſayd,
<hi>God will do nothing before he reueale it vnto his
Prophets;</hi> ſo prophets are (as it were) Gods
counſellers. Againe, Kings and Prieſts, and
Prophets were figures of Chriſt, al theſe three
were annointed with oyle, to ſhew that they
had greater graces than the reſt:<note place="margin">1. Kin. 13. 1.</note> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Prophets are called, <hi>Men of God;</hi> to
ſhewe, that all which are of God will make
much of Prophets for Gods ſake. Therefore
women are forbidden to take vpon them to
prophecie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 34</note> leſt that noble calling ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17992:162"/>
vile and deſpiſed, by ſuch vnskilfull
handlers of it. Therfore when the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha
would ſende for Naaman the leaper to
come vnto him, theſe were his wordes,<note place="margin">2. King. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhall know that there is a Prophet in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi>
as though all the glorie of Israel were
chieflie in this, that they had Prophets, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had none: as if one Pariſh ſhould triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph
ouer another, becauſe they haue a preacher,
and the other haue none. Therefore when this
Prophet was dead, Ioaſh the King came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <hi>O my Father, my Father, the Chariot of
Iſrael, and horſemen of the ſame:</hi> ſhewing,
that the Chariots, and horſes, and ſouldiers
doe not ſo ſafegarde a Citie, as the Prophets
which teach it, and praye for it. Therefore
when God would marke the Iſraelites with a
name of greateſt reproach, hee calleth them,
A people which rebuke their Prieſts: as if he
ſhould ſay, vſurpers of the Prieſts office: for
they rebuke their Prieſts, which are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to rebuke them.</p>
            <p>How ioyfull and glad was Lydea when ſhe

tender was the Shunamite ouer Eliſha, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:17992:163"/>
ſhe built an houſe to welcome him,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 4. 10</note> and to
keep him with her; thinking all the places in

much did the Galatians make of Paul,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note> that
he ſaith, they would pull out their owne eyes
to doe him good: So once a Prophet was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
like a Prophet. And hath he bid you
deſpiſe them now, which bad you to honour
them before? No, Paule chargeth vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
our teachers, as hee was receiued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
ſaying, <hi>He which laboureth in the word,
is worthie of double honour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 14</note> that is, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
(after a ſort) is more to be honoured than

but Moſes was the yonger brother; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be any appendix, the Magiſtrate
is the appendix:<note place="margin">Exo. 28. 30.</note> for if Aarons Vrim &amp; Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
would haue ſerued, Moſes rod and ſtaffe
ſhould not haue needed; but when the tongue
could not perſwade, the rod did compell, and
ſo came in the Magiſtrate. As Paul ſheweth
the Theſſalonians how the Preachers of the

the Philippians how to honor their teachers;<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 29.</note>
ſaying, <hi>Receiue him in the Lorde with great

your ſelues ſo glad of him, that hee may bee
glad of you. Haue you neede to bee taught
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:17992:163"/>
why Paule would haue you make much of
ſuch? Becauſe they are like Lampes, which
conſume themſelues to giue light to other;
ſo they conſume themſelues to giue light to
you: becauſe they are like a Henne, which
clocketh her Chickens together from the
Kite; ſo they clocke you together from the
Serpent: becauſe they are lyke the ſhowte
which did beate downe the walles of Iericho;<note place="margin">Ioſua 6. 20.</note>
ſo they beate downe the walles of ſinne: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are like the fiery piller which went

ſo they goe before you to the Lande of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
becauſe they are like good Andrewe,

ſo they call you to ſee the Meſſias: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make much of ſuch.</p>
            <p>If wee ſhoulde make much of Prophets,
how much ſhoulde wee make of Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
If wee ſhould loue our Inſtructors, how

manie hearing the Worde, haue met with

but without the Worde neuer any was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

the Word is preached, euerie one may ſay

               <hi>Be of good comfort hee calleth thee:</hi> Be of
good comfort, the Lorde calleth thee: but
when the word is not preached, then euerie
man may ſay to himſelfe; beware, the diuell
calleth thee. When the Prophets went from

and all the plagues of God rained vpon

            <p>There be two trades in this Land, without
which the Realme cannot ſtand; and one is
the Queenes ſouldiers, and the other is the
Lordes ſouldiers, and the Lords ſouldiers are
handled like the Queenes ſouldiers, for from
the Merchant to the porter, no calling is ſo
deſpiſed, ſo contemned, ſo derided, that they
may beg for their ſeruice; for their liuing is
turned into an almes. One ſaith, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

but Aaron is <hi>Quaſi quis,</hi> that is, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter

If Paule had liued in our dayes he would not

               <hi>If I be

not the contempt of prophets cry vnto God,

let the vineyarde vnto others, which ſhould

hereof is this, that when the preachers &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
which Chriſt ſendeth to his Church for
fruits, are abuſed &amp; perſecuted of them whom
they call to the banket, then he will remooue
their light and his Goſpell to other which wil

we are plaine and ſimple as Iacob, yet at this

for your ſake, to ſpeake ſometime that which
we conceiue not our ſelues, becauſe the houre
is come wherein God hath appointed to call

therefore as the princely Spirite came
vpon Saul when hee ſhoulde raigne,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 11. 6.</note> to
teach him how he ſhould rule, ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
ſpirite commeth vpon Preachers
when they ſhould teach, to teach them how
they ſhould ſpeake:<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 18.</note> therefore as Chriſt was
content to be baptized of Iohn, ſo bee you
content to be inſtructed of vs, that (if wee
bee more ſimple than you) the glorie of

            <p>Hath not this deſpiſing of the Preachers,
almoſt made the preachers deſpiſe preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
the peoples neglect of the prophets hath
made the Prophets neglect prophecying? the
Nonreſident keepes himſelfe away, becauſe
hee thinkes the people like him better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
dee dooth not trouble them. And the
droane neuer ſtudieth to preach, for hee
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17992:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaith, that an Homelie is better liked of than
a Sermon: and they which would ſtudie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie

to Law, to Phiſicke, or trades, or anie thing,
rather than they will enter this contemptible
calling. And is not the Arke then readie to
depart from Iſraell?</p>
            <p>Now if you will knowe what makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and prophecying ſo deſpiſed, you may
ſee firſt in Ieroboams Prieſts. It is ſayd, that

therefore they which make Prieſts like

leaſt the Arke (which was a ſigne of God)
ſhould be deſpiſed? Therefore none ſhould
meddle with the Word (which is the law of

their children to God, before they be weaned,
before they can go, before they can ſpeake;
and ſend them to fight the Lordes battailes,
before they haue one ſtone in their hand to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17992:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fling at Goliah;<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> that is, one Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Tempter. This is either becauſe the
Patrones, or the Biſhoppes haue lime vpon
their fingers; which makes them like blinde
Iſaac,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 11.</note> that they take no heede whome they
bleſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which makes Prophets
and prophecying deſpiſed, is the lewdneſſe
and negligence of them that are able to doe
well in their Miniſterie, and yet do contrary.
It is ſaid of Hophni and Phineas,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 2. 17.</note> that by
their corrupt ſacrificing, they made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
abhorre the ſacrifices; ſo, many by their
ſlubbering of the Word, (for want of ſtudie
and meditation) do make men thinke, that
there is no more wiſedome in the word of
God, than they ſhew out of it: and therefore
they ſtay at home, &amp; ſay, they know as much
as the preacher can teach them.</p>
            <p>There is a kinde of Preachers riſen vp but
of late, which ſhrowde and couer euerie ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
and vnſauerie, and childiſh, and abſurd
Sermon, vnder the name of the ſimple kind
of teaching, like the Popiſh Prieſtes, which
make ignorance the mother of deuotion: but
indeede to preach ſimplie, is not to preache
rudely, nor vnlearnedly, nor confuſedly, but
to preach plainly and perſpicuouſly, that the
ſimpleſt man may vnderſtand what is taught
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:17992:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as if he did heare his name. Therefore if you
will knowe what makes manie Preachers
preach ſo barely, and looſely, and ſimplie, it is
your owne ſimplicitie, which makes them
thinke that if they go on and ſay ſome thing,
all is one, and no fault will be found becauſe
you are not able to iudge in or out; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they giue no attendance to doctrine, as
Paul teacheth them,<note place="margin">1. Tim 4. 16</note> it is almoſt come to paſſe
that in a whole Sermon the hearer can not
picke out one note more than hee could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him ſelfe. Wheate is good, but they
which ſell the refuſe of wheate are reproued,
Amos the eight Chapter and ſixt verſe: ſo
preaching is good, but this refuſe of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is but like ſwearing, for one taketh the
name of God in vain, and the other takes the
word of God in vaine. As euerie ſound is not
muſicke, ſo euerie Sermon is not preaching,
but worſe than if he ſhould reade an Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
In the eight and fortieth of Ieremiah,
there is a curſe vpon them which doe the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of the Lord negligently. If this curſe
doo not touch them which doo the chiefeſt
buſineſſe of the Lord negligently, truely I
can not tell whome the Prophet meaneth.
Theſe woulde not haue prophecying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
and yet they make it deſpiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:17992:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The laſt thing which makes Prophets and
<hi>prophecying</hi> deſpiſed, is the diuerſity of minds,
while one holdeth one way, and another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way, ſome leaue all, and will be of no
Religion, vntill both parties agree: as if a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
ſhould pine himſelfe and eate no meate
at all, becauſe one Phiſition ſayth, that this
meate will hurt him, and another ſayth, that
meate will hurt him. Theſe are the three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
which make vs and our labours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Now what ſhall we anſwere to our deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers?
<hi>Reioyce not againſt mee, O mine enemie!</hi>
(ſaith the Church) <hi>for I ſhall be raiſed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah. 7.</note> ſo, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe

they ſhall be honored.<note place="margin">Act. 5. 3.</note> Peter ſaith to Ananias
and Saphira, <hi>You haue not lyed vnto men, but

them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you do vnto me.</hi> Why then
if they deſpiſe Chriſt, Chriſt wil deſpiſe them,
for he told Saul that he ſpurned againſt the
pricke; that is, he ſpurned againſt that which
would ſpurne againſt him. Therefore, if you
giue vnto Chriſt when you giue vnto the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17992:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
poore; and if you honour Chriſt when you
honour his Prophetes: as you giue vnto the
poore for Chriſts ſake, ſo deſpiſe not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
for Chriſts ſake. If for all this we muſt
be deſpiſed ſtil, then this is our remedie, Paul
ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Whatſoeuer wee are to you: yet wee are a
ſweet ſauour to God, both in them which are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and them which periſh:</hi> that is, though we
bring him word that you will not come to

you. And ſo much of that.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying,</hi> followeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Trie all things:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Deſpiſe
not prophecying, but for all that try prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,
leſt you beleeue errour for truth: for
as among Rulers, there bee bad Rulers: ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Prophets therebe falſe Prophets. This
made Chriſt warne his Diſciples to beware
of the leauen of the Phariſies,<note place="margin">Mar. 8. 25.</note> that is, of their
falſe doctrine. This made Iohn ſay, <hi>Trie the
Spirites.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 4. 1.</note> And therefore wee reade in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteenth
Chapter of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and the eleuenth verſe, how the men of
Beroea would not receiue Paules doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had tried it, and how did they trie
it? It is ſayd, that they ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This is the way which Paule woulde
teach you to trie other whereby he was try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him ſelfe: whereby you may ſee, that if
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17992:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you vſe to reade the Scripture, you ſhal be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to trie all doctrines: for the word of God
is the touchſtone of euery thing,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> like the light
which God made to behold all his creatures;
ſo is the Scripture to decide all queſtions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
doubt muſt come to the Word, and all
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies muſt be ended at this Tribunall,
the Scripture muſt ſpeake which is right, and
which is wrong, which is truth, and which is
errour, and all tongues muſt keepe ſilence to
heare it: ſo God hath appointed that the
Iudge of our controuerſies, which he ſaith in
the twelfth chapter of Iohn and the eight and
fortieth verſe, <hi>ſhall iudge vs in the last daye.</hi>
Here a man may aske, If it be ſo that God
would haue vs to trie all our Religion by the
Scripture, and not by Fathers, nor by Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
nor by Councels, nor by Angell, nor by
Pope; how then do the Papiſts ſay, we muſt
beleeue as the Church beleeueth? and neuer
looke into the Scripture, whether our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
ſay as God ſaith, but take it vpon their
credit, as a blind man eateth his meate.</p>
            <p>A man trieth his horſe which muſt beare
him, and ſhall hee not trie his faith which
muſt ſaue him? Paule ſaith, <hi>Let euerie one be
able to giue a reaſon of his faith.</hi> Is this a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our faith to ſay, I beleeue ſo, becauſe
Rome beleeueth ſo? or rather becauſe that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:17992:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the word doth teach me ſo. It will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for them which die in hereſie, to ſay, the
Prieſts taught vs ſo; no more than it would
excuſe Eue to ſay,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 13.</note> the Serpent taught her ſo:
for God ſaith, <hi>Be not deceiued,</hi> neither by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
nor by Prophet, nor by Angell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude with Paule, <hi>Deſpiſe not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,</hi>
leſt the Goſpell be taken from you;
and yet trie prophecying, leſt you receiue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
for truth.</p>
            <p>As we are to trie doctrines, ſo Paul would
haue vs to trie our thoughts, and our ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and our actions: therefore he ſaith, <hi>Trie
all things.</hi> He doth not bid vs take a taſt of all
ſinnes and vanities, as Salomon did to trie
them; for they are tried alreadie: but that we
ſhould ſet the word of God alway before vs
like a rule, &amp; beleeue nothing but that which
it teacheth, loue nothing but that which it
preſcribeth, hate nothing but that which it
forbiddeth, doo nothing but that which it
commaundeth; and then we trie all things by
the word. As the Eunuch ſayd, <hi>How ſhould I
vnderstand without an Interpreter?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 8. 31.</note> ſo thou
mayeſt ſay: Howe ſhould I trie without the
word, which is the touchſtone of good and
euill?</p>
            <p>Now, when wee haue tried by the word
which is truth, and which is error; what ſhuld
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17992:170"/>
we doo then?<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Keep that which is beſt:</hi> that is,
ſtay at the truth, as the wiſe men ſtayed when
they came to Chriſt. We muſt keep and hold
the truth, as a man gripeth a thing with both
his handes; that is, defend it with thy tongue,
maintain it with thy purſe, further it with thy
labour, in danger, and trouble, and loſſe, and
diſpleaſure, come life, come death; thinke, as
Chriſt did ſeale the truth with his blood, ſo
thou muſt ſeale it with thy blood, or elſe thou
dooſt not keepe it, but let it goe. Well dooth
Paul put <hi>Trie</hi> before <hi>Chooſe,</hi> for he which tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
may chuſe the beſt; but he which chuſeth
before he trie, takes the worſt ſooner than the
beſt: and therefore the Popes prieſts becauſe
the people ſhould take ſuperſtition before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
will neuer let them haue the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
but keep them from the Scripture, and
locke it vp in an vnknowen tongue, which
they cannot skill of, leaſt they ſhould try their
doctrines,<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> like the men of Boerea, making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
a craft, as men call their trades. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as Ioſiah reioyced that the booke of God
was found againe; ſo we may reioyce that the
booke of God is found againe: for when the
people might not reade it, it was all one as if
they had loſt it.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Trie all things,</hi> and <hi>keepe the beſt:</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>Abſtaine from all appearance of euill:</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:17992:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As if hee ſhould ſaie, That is like to be beſt
which is ſo farre from euill, that it hath not
the appearance of euill; and that is like to be
the truth which is ſo farre from errour, that
it hath not the ſhewe of errour; whereby hee
ſheweth, that nothing ſhould be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, or added to our Religion, but
that which is an vndoubted truth without
ſuſpition of errour. It is not inough to bee
perſwaded of our faith, but we muſt be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of it; for Religion is not built vppon
doubtes, but vpon knowledge. Here we may
maruell why Paul biddeth vs <hi>Abſtaine from
all appearance of euill:</hi> becauſe ſinne, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
and ſuperſtition are hypocrites; that is,
Sinne hath the appearance of Vertue and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
hath the appearance of Truth, &amp; Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
hath the appearance of Religion: but
by this the Apoſtle doth note, that there is no
Sinne, nor Hereſie, nor Superſtition, but if the
viſor bee taken away from it, it will appeare
to be a Sinne, and Hereſie, and Superſtition,
though at the firſt ſight the viſor doo make it
ſeeme none, becauſe it couereth the euill,
like a painted Sepulcher vpon wormes and
rotten bones.</p>
            <p>Heereby wee are taught to iudge of all
thinges as they are, and not as they ſeeme to
bee. As wee drawe aſide the curtaine before
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17992:171"/>
we beholde the picture: ſo wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
our prudence and all ſurmiſes, and
then behold the thing naked as it is, if we will
know it indeed.</p>
            <p>Heere I might admoniſh them which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
themſelues from our Church: As Paul
ſayth, <hi>Examine whether you bee in the faith:</hi>
ſo examine whether you haue the ſhewe of
errour. Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
broach a Religion which was neuer heard of
before? Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
retaine an opinion, which the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
hath recanted? as though yee would
ſucke vp that which the Dogge hath vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that thoſe preachers may not bee
heard, which (by their owne confeſſions)
haue conuerted them to the Knowledge of
God, and dailie conuert other? Hath it
not the ſhewe of errour, to affirme that the
Lordes prayer may not bee vſed for a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which for anie thing that wee or they
can reade, was ſo vſed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to ſaie
that no man may vſe anie ſet prayer? ſeeing
there bee manie prayers, and pſalmes, and
bleſſings in the holie Scripture, which were
vſed in the ſame forme? Hath it not the ſhew
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17992:172"/>
of error, to affirme that we haue no Church;
and yet to graunt that our Martyrs which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Poperie, were true members of the
Church? Hath it not the ſhewe of errour to
affirme that two or three may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
all the reſt without a Miniſter, ſeeing the
Paſtor is the mouth of the church? hath it not
the ſhew of error to affirm, that the church of
Chriſt was euer inuiſible before this age, and
that it is ſuch a ſmall flock as their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is? &amp;
that it hath ſet foote no where but in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?
Hath it not the ſhewe of error to hold
that for ſound and good religion, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
euerie day, adding and detracting, as
though a man ſhould make a Religion of his
owne inuention, ſo faſt as new conceits come
into his braine? Let them thinke that Paul
ſaith vnto them,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Be wiſe vnto ſobrietie,</hi> and
ſuſpect that conſtruction which your ſelues
deuiſed;<note place="margin">Pro. 4. 27.</note> for Salomon ſaith, <hi>There is an error
vpon the right hand, as well as vpon the left,</hi>
that is, (as I may call it) the zealous error, and
if this bee not it, I knowe none within this
Land.</p>
            <p>Yet, ſhall I ſay that we haue not the ſhewe
of error? Nay, I would that we were but in
the ſhew of error. I may not call euill good,
no more then I may call good euill; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs pull out the beame out of our own
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17992:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eyes, as we would pull the moate out of their
eyes. If Paul would haue vs abſtaine from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
appearance of euill, ſure hee would haue
vs abſtaine from hereſie and from idolatrie;
for theſe are the greateſt euils. But if wee bee
not idolaters, yet we haue the ſhewe of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
if we be not of Antichriſts religion, yet

taile of Antichriſt (which the Pope hath left
behinde him, like an euill ſauour) is vnto vs as
the remnants of the Chanaanites were vnto
the Iewes: they ſhould haue deſtroyed all the
Chanaanites, but becauſe they ſpared ſome,
therefore they whom they left were goades
in their ſides, and pricks in their eies, that they
could neuer be quiet for them; ſo wee ſhould
haue expelled the head and the taile too of
Antichriſt, but becauſe we did not, therefore
the remnants of Poperie are goades in our
ſides, and prickes in our eyes, that wee cannot
yet be quiet for them. Therefore let vs pray
that he which hath taken away the euill, will
take away the ſhew of euill too.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue choſe a Text which is
the ſumme of the Bible. For
all Scripture runneth vpon
Chriſt lyke the Title of a

and the end of mans ſaluation:<note place="margin">Reue. 1. 8.</note> therefore he is
figured in the Law, foretold in the Prophets,
and fulfilled in the Goſpel. Some places point
to his Diuinitie, ſome to his humanitie, ſome
to his Kingdom, ſome to his Prieſthood, ſome
to his Prophecie, ſome to his Conception,
ſome to his Birth, ſome to his life, ſome to his
miracles, ſome to his Paſſion, ſome to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
ſome to his Aſcention, ſome to

lyke Iohn Baptiſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> when hee ſaide, <hi>This is
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:17992:174"/>
the Lambe of God, which taketh away the
ſinnes of the worlde.</hi> Therefore learne Chriſt,
and learne all. Now to teach vs how we ſhuld
heare, and how we ſhould loue, and how we
ſhould feare, and how we ſhould beleeue, and
how we ſhould follow Chriſt, that wee may
knowe when wee haue learned him: the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Put ye on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
as though this word did containe all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
vnto Chriſt, <hi>to put him on:</hi> (which ſeemes
to bee the leuell of this phraſe, if you marke
how it commeth in) for before Paule ſayth,
<hi>Caſt away the workes of darkneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note>

chambering, wantonneſſe; after hee nameth
the armour of light,<note place="margin">Verſe 14.</note> which we ſhould put on,
and calleth it by the name of the giuer, <hi>The
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> In ſtead of gluttonie, and
drunkenneſſe, and ſtrife, and chambering,
and wantonneſſe, and other patches of the
Diuell, wherewith man cloatheth himſelfe as

other Garment,<note place="margin">Pſa. 109. 18</note> which hee calleth Ieſus

as one would thinke when he had ſayd, Caſt

he commendeth the example of Chriſt

will teach him what he ſhall follow,
and what he ſhall flie, better than all precepts

Chriſt would do, which was made not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

though we ſhould thinke before we ſpeake

doe all by his example as the Scholler wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

put them off, becauſe they had not put him
on: for though they had ſeene his perſon, and
heard of his vertues, yet they had no faith to
apply his mercies, his merits, his death and his
righteouſneſſe vnto them, without which no
man can put on Chriſt nor weare him. Faith
is the hand which putteth him on, Faith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

and ſo taketh one robe after another, and

Chriſt, as you ſhall ſee more liuely, when
you haue taken a view of the Garment, for
we are to ſpeake of Chriſt the Garment, and
of our putting it on. There be many faſhions

to put on the new man with all his vertues,
vntill wee be renued to the Image of Chriſt,
which is like a new man amongſt men. They
which labour to be righteous, and yet beleeue
that Chriſts righteouſnes ſhal ſaue them, haue
put on Chriſt as Paule would haue them. We
are not taught to put on Angels, nor Saints,
nor the virgin Mary, nor Paul himſelfe, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our ſinnes with their righteouſnes, as the

Chriſt, and couer our ſinnes with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes.
The bodie hath manie Garments, but
the ſoule hath one Garment. Euery clout will
couer our ſores, but the fineſt ſilke wil not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

Yet this garment is out of requeſt, too rough

And therefore in ſtead of putting on
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 37.</note> they put him off, in ſtead of welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 34.</note> they diſcharge him, like the Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,

and not able to beare off the ſtormes of death

leaues of maſſes, of pardons, of pilgrimages, &amp;
ſatisfactions together, yet they will not couer
their nakedneſſe, nor keepe off the heate of
Gods wrath, but are like the curtall skirtes of
Dauids Ambaſſadors,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 29. 4.</note> which hidde not their
ſhame. Therefore when wee may goe in our
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17992:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
maſters attyre, ſhall we ſcrubbe like beggers
patched in our ragges?<note place="margin">Iob. 9. 31.</note> Mine owne garments
defile mee, ſaith Iob: Our owne Garmentes,
our owne righteouſnes defileth vs, for what
garment, what righteouſnes haue we of our

cloth, which had more neede to be waſhed it
ſelf, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wipe that which is foule? Therfore
Chriſt muſt make vs Garments, or elſe when
our backes flaunt it like Courtiers, our ſoules
ſhall ſtrip like beggers. And the diuels will
ſport themſelues like Cham,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 22.</note> to ſee our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Father made vs Garmentes in
Paradiſe,<note place="margin">Gen 3. 21.</note> now the Sonne makes vs Garments
in the Wilderneſſe, nay, the Sonne is made
our Garment, as Paul ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> that is, Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
muſt be our Garment, or elſe we ſhall be
aſhamed when our righteouſneſſe doeth not
reach to couer our nakedneſſe, but ſtill ſome
part will peepe bare vntill he caſt his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
vpon it,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 17. 42.</note> and then all is couered. As
Dauid needed no other armour againſt the
Giant than a ſling: ſo we need no other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt ſinne than Chriſt. There wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing but this, to put it on.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee how to put this Garment
on. Many fumble about it, like childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17992:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had neede of one to put on their cloathes.
Some put on Chriſt like a precious head tire,
which all day is worne, beautified with iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and beſet with gemmes, to make the face
ſeeme more amiable: but at night, that riches
is layd aſide, and the head muffled with ſome
regardleſſe tyre. Thus do our curious women
put on Chriſt, who when they heare the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of grace offering this Garment, and
preparing to make the bodie fit to bee garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with ſo glorious a veſture, as Paul did
the Romanes, firſt waſhing away drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and gluttony, then chambring and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes,
then ſtrife and enuie, and ſo ſinne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſinne, they ſeeme like the ſtonie grounde
to receiue it with ioy, and thinke to beautifie
their head with this precious ornament: but
when hee tels them there is no communion
between Chriſt &amp; Belial, that if this Garment
be put on, all other vanities muſt be put off;
they then turne their day into darkneſſe, and
reiect Chriſt, that woulde bee an eternall
crowne of beautie to their heades, and wrap
their temples in the vncomely rags and refuſe
of euerie Nations pride: and in theſe toyes
they cauſe their ſeruants to ſpend manie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
on euerie day in the weeke, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
on the Sabboth day to decke their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as if they were but little children, which
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:17992:180"/>
had neede of one to put on their cloathes.
Some put on Chriſt as a cloake, which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vpon their ſhoulders, &amp; couereth them:
when they goe abroad to bee ſeene of men,
they can caſt on the cloake of holineſſe, and
ſeeme for a while as holie as the beſt; but ſo
ſoone as they come home, the cloake goeth
off, &amp; the man is as hee was, whoſe vizard was
better than his face. Thus Hypocrites put on
Chriſt, as many retaine vnto Noble men, not
to doe them anie ſeruice, but to haue theyr
countenance. Many put on Chriſt like a hat
which goeth off to euerie one which meetes
them: ſo euerie temptation which meetes
them, makes them forget what they heard,
what they promiſed, what they reſolued, and
change their way, as though they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
at all. So the common people (lyke
your ſelues) put on Chriſt, they are zealous ſo
long as they are in the Church, and beate
their breaſts,<note place="margin">Luk 18. 11.</note> and caſt vp their eyes like the
Publican, when they heare a ſentence which
mooues them, as though they would do no
more againſt that ſaying while they liue: but
the next buſineſſe putteth all out of mind,
till they come to the Church againe. Some
put on Chriſt as a gloue, which couereth but
the hand; ſo they put on the face of Chriſt, or
the tongue of Chriſt: but their hands worke,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17992:181"/>
and their feete walke, as they did before: So
manie profeſſours of Religion put on Chriſt,
which call but for diſcipline and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they might get a name of zeale and
ſinceritie, to couer ſome fault, which they
would not be ſuſpected of. Thus euery man
would couer himſelfe with Chriſt, but they
haue not the skill, or they haue not the will to
put him on. What will you do then? Though
the Garment bee neuer ſo good, yet it is not
good to them that do not weare it: for what
profite haue we of the Garments which we
doe not weare? they neither keepe vs from
heate, nor colde. Therefore Paul doth not
bring you a Garment to laye by you for the
moaths, but he bids you put it on. Here is the
cunning now in putting it on. If Paule had
taught vs this, then you would hearken vnto
him. Well, you ſhall heare what Paul ſaith to
the putting it on.</p>
            <p>Firſt (ſaith Paul) you muſt caſt away the
workes of darkneſſe,<note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> and then put on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of light: firſt you muſt put off, and then
put on. As the Eagles feathers will not lye
with anie others feathers, but conſume them
which lye with them: ſo the Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not bee worne with filthie Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 5. 8.</note>
but ſcornes like the Arke that Dagon
ſhould ſtand by it. If any man may not weare
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:17992:181"/>
womens apparell for lightnes; may he weare
the diuels apparell, and cloath himſelfe with
pride, with couetouſnes, with enuie, with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
with vncleanneſſe, and when hee is
like the diuell,<note place="margin">Matt. 2. 21</note> ſit at Gods table? No man
(ſaith Chriſt) patcheth a new peece to an olde
Garment, and wilt thou patch an olde peece
to a new Garment? God forbad the people
to weare linſey wolſey,<note place="margin">Leu. 19. 15.</note> becauſe it was a ſigne
of inconſtancie: but this is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie it ſelf.</p>
            <p>He doth not put on Chriſt, but putteth off
Chriſt and putteth on Belial,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 23.</note> which faſhions
himſelfe to God,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eu. 3. 15.</note> and the Worlde too. As
Chriſtes coate was without ſeame, ſo they
muſt bee without ſtayne that weare it. For
when a man putteth on faire clothes, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himſelfe faire too, and auoydeth euerie
foule thing, leſt it ſhould fowle his cloathes:
ſo muſt he which putteth on Chriſt; for the
fineſt Garment is ſooneſt ſtained. Therefore
when thou haſt put on this Garment, thou
muſt waſh thy ſelfe, and picke thy way, and
chooſe thy workes, and handle nothing that
is foule for marring thy cloathes, that is, thou
muſt not thinke as thou diddeſt, nor ſpeake
as thou diddeſt, nor liue as thou diddeſt, but
remember that thou haſt chaunged thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,<note place="margin">Iude 3.</note>
&amp; ſerue him with whom thou art bound.
For if God and the diuell coulde not agree
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:17992:182"/>
vpon Moſes bodie, for one to haue one part,
and the other another part, but God would
haue all: much leſſe will God agree that the
diuell ſhould haue part of the ſoule, which
would not yeeld him part of the bodie. Thus
haue you heard what you muſt put off: now
heare how Chriſt muſt be put on. As the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
taught Iohn to reade the Booke,<note place="margin">Reuel. 10. 9.</note> when he
bad him eate it: ſo we muſt put on Chriſt, as
if wee did eate him, not as the Papiſts doe in
their Maſſe, but as the meate is turned into
the ſubſtance of the bodie, &amp; goeth through
euerie part of man: ſo Chriſt and his Word
ſhould goe from part of part, from eare to
heart, from heart to mouth, from mouth to
hand, til we be of one nature with them, that
they bee the verie ſubſtance of our thoughts,
and ſpeeches, and actions, as the meate is of
our bodie. This is to eate Chriſt and his
Word,<note place="margin">Ephe. 3. 30.</note> or elſe we do not eate them, but chew
them, &amp; when our taſte is ſatiſfied, ſpue them
out againe. Thus we muſt put on Chriſt: for
the Worde ſignifieth ſo to put him on: as if
thou wouldeſt put him in, that he may be one
with thee, and thou with him, as it were in a
bodie together. As hee hath put on all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
ſo we muſt put on all his graces, not
halfe on, but all on, and claſpe him to vs, and
gird him about vs, and weare him, euen as we
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:17992:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weare our skinne, which is alway about vs.
Then there ſhall be no neede of Wyres, nor
curles, nor perriwigs: the husbands ſhall not
be forced to racke their rents, nor inhaunce
their fines, nor ſell their lands, to decke their
wiues;<note place="margin">2. Kin. 2. 13.</note> but as the poore mantle of Eliah ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
better to Eliſha than all the roabes of
Salomon: ſo the Wedding Garment ſhall
ſeeme better than all the flaunts of vanitie; &amp;
put euery faſhion out of faſhion, which is not
modeſt and comely like it ſelfe. If you will
know farther how to put on Chriſt, you ſhall
ſee how your Text will Catechize you in his
three names, Lord, Ieſus, Chriſt. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſeemeth to ſpell out the way vnto vs, how
we ſhould weare this Garment: Firſt we muſt
put him on as Lord; then we muſt put him on
as Ieſus; laſtly, we muſt put him on as Chriſt.
Thou muſt put him on as Lord, that is, thy
ruler to command thee, thy tutor to gouerne
thee, and thy maſter to direct thee: thou muſt
be no mans ſeruant but his, take no mans part
againſt him,<note place="margin">Acts. 4. 19.</note> but ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it meete to obey God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioſua hath the like name, but not from God, nor to that end.</note> 
               <hi>or you?</hi> Thou muſt
put him on as Ieſus, that is, thy Sauiour in
whom thou truſteſt, thy protector on whom
thou dependeſt, thy redeemer in whom thou
beleeueſt: thou muſt not look for thy ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from Angel, nor Saint, nor anie thing beſide
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:17992:183"/>
him. For the name of Ieſus ſignifieth a Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and is giuen to none but him; and he is
not onely called the Sauiour, but the Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 69.</note>
in the Song of Simeon; to ſhew that he is
the onely Sauiour; for there may be many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours,<note place="margin">Iudg. 3. 9.</note>
but there can be but one ſaluation: as
there may be many tortures, and yet but one
death. Therefore, when hee is called the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
it implieth that there is no Sauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
him.<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 35.</note> Thou muſt put him on as Chriſt,
that is,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 22.</note> a King to rule, a Prophet to teach, a
Prieſt to praie and ſacrifice,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 3.</note> and pacifie the
wrath of God for thee.<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 16.</note> For this name Chriſt
doth ſignifie that hee was annoynted a King,
a Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 8.</note> and a Prophet for man: a King to
rule him, a Prieſt to offer ſacrifice for him, a
Prophet to teach him. So that hee putteth
on Chriſt as Lord, which worſhippeth none
but him, hee putteth on Chriſt as Ieſus, which
beleeueth in none but him;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note> and he putteth on
Chriſt as Chriſt, which worſhippeth none
but him, beleeueth in none but him, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
none but him.</p>
            <p>You put on Chriſt firſt, when you are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
then you were ſealed and conſecrated
to his ſeruice: ſo ſoone as you came into the
world, you vowed to renounce the world and
follow God. How many haue put on Chriſt
thus, and ſince haue put him off againe? which
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:17992:183"/>
haue broken the firſt promiſe that euer they
made,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> and were neuer faithfull to God ſince.
You put on Chriſt againe,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22.</note> when you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and ſanctified; that is, when you caſt off
the olde man, which is corrupt with the luſts
of the fleſh, the pride of life, and the cares of
this worlde; and put on the newe man, which
is regenerate in righteouſneſſe &amp; holineſſe, to
the Image of Chriſt, or likeneſſe of Adam in
his innocencie:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> for to put on the new man, is
to become a newe man, as if thou were borne
againe, and conceiued of the holie Ghoſt. Of
this Iob ſpeaketh when he ſayth,<note place="margin">Iob. 29. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I put on Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 16</note>
               <hi>and it couered mee.</hi> You put on Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
when you receiue his holy Sacrament,
and are partakers of his bodie and blood, that
is, the merites of his obedience and paſſion
by Faith, which heareth him as if ſhe did ſee
him, and ſeeth him as if ſhe did feele him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
feeleth him as if ſhe did taſte him, and taſteth
him as if ſhe did digeſt him, then Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
yours, and dwelleth in you, and feedeth
you with his grace to eternal life, as the bread
and wine ſuſtaineth the life preſent. Laſtly,
when you haue put on Chriſt in theſe three
ſortes,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> which is your Garment for this world;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 49<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
after you ſhall put on Chriſt in heauen, and
be cloathed with his glorie, and that ſhall be
your laſt veſture, which ſhall neuer weare out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:17992:184"/>
Thus haue you heard what is ment by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on Chriſt: firſt to cloath our ſelues with
righteouſnes and holines like Chriſt; &amp; then
becauſe our own righteouſnes is too ſhort to
couer our armes, and legges, and thighes of
ſinne, but ſtill ſome bare place will peere out
and ſhame vs in the ſight of God, therefore
we muſt borrow Chriſtes Garments,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 15.</note> as Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
did his brothers; and couer our ſelues
with his righteouſnes, that is, beleeue that his
righteouſnes ſhal ſupply our vnrighteouſnes,
&amp; his ſufferings ſhal ſtand for our ſufferings,
becauſe he came to fulfill the lawe, and beare
the curſe, and ſatisfie his Father for vs, that
all which beleeue in him might not die,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> but
haue life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>Now I haue ſhewed you this goodly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you muſt go to another to helpe you
to put it on; and none can put this Garment
vpon you, but he which is the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
Therefore to him let

the vices begin, and as I point them out vnto

marſhall lawe in your handes to put them to

the chaine of ſinne, how one ſinne will draw

it will goe alone, wherefore reſiſt all ſinnes or
none, for if you entertaine one ſinne, it will

cannot ſtaie after he hath committed one ſin,
to commit another, nor till hee hath come to
the bottome, euen to the bottome of hell. If
I ſhould ſtand to anatomize and paint out all
vices in their kinde, I ſhould craue a longer
time than is allotted to mee, therefore I will
briefly touch them.</p>
            <p>As huge as the ſea is, yet one maye
taſte the ſaltneſſe of it in a droppe, ſo in one

the bodie, ſhorteneth the life, corrupteth and
conſumeth the goods, preuenteth grace, and
maketh vs odious to GOD and to Angels.
You are giuen to hate your enemies, theſe are
they, therefore hate them: they keepe you
from repentance, leaſt you ſhould bee ſaued,
wherefore I wil ſhew you what is in this box,
leſt the ſame goe to your eyes and ſo blinde

            <p>
               <hi>Walke not in gluttonie, drunkenneſſe, &amp; ſtrife,
&amp;c.</hi> Theſe come lyke fayre Ladies, with

And firſt what gluttonie and drunkennes
offereth, and how many haue bene deceiued
with their ſweete meates and ſtrong drinkes,
till all haue bene turned into a bellie, and ſo
turned the body into ſinne, dayly experience
teacheth vs.</p>
            <p>Now by the way, the Apoſtle (we muſt
note) doth approue ſobrietie &amp; vertue, that as
a man may drinke and not be drunken, ſo he
may eate that he loueth, and not glut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
for he forbiddeth not to eate meate, but
not to eate too much, leſt thou ſurfet, for the
golden meane is good for all things. Salomon
doth not forbid to eate honie, but eate not
too much, leſt thou ſurfet. As the bodie may
not offend the ſoule, ſo the ſoule may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
the bodie, leſt it bee vnfit to ſerue the

            <p>Manie there bee that thinke they haue
not ſinned in gluttony til they ſurfet, but this
is gluttonie in exceſſe, and puniſheth it ſelfe

may ſinne in gluttonie, and not to ſurfet, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the rich man in the ſixteenth of

diſpleaſeth God, when men eate and drinke
and riſe vp to play, and remember not the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of Ioſeph and Lazarus lying at the

do come with a Wedding garment, &amp; where
Chriſt is neuer inuited. Manie thinges may
perſwade vs to temperance, &amp; we may learne
it of the beaſtes, who deſire no chaunge, nor
hoord not, and are content. God prouided
meate for all creatures, as hearbes, rootes, and
graſſe, before hee prouided anie for man, to
teach vs, what little care wee ſhould haue of
our belly, for we liue not by bread onely, but
by euerie worde that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God. Chriſt hath taught vs to faſt,
when he prepared himſelfe thereunto in the
wilderneſſe, but hee neuer by anie example
taught vs to feaſt: ſome there be which thinke
hee did neuer eate fleſh but in the paſchall
Lambe, which although it doth not teach, or
debar vs from eating fleſh, which Peter was
willed to eate in the viſion, yet it teacheth vs
to tame the fleſh, leſt Hagar ſhould get the
vpper hand of her miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>When the belly is full, the fleſh luſteth, the
tongue prateth, the wit ſleepeth, and Satan
carrieth away the minde when the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is away: As the moyſt and wateriſh
groundes bring forth nothing but frogs and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:17992:187"/>
toades, ſo the belly and watrie ſtomacke that
is ſtuffed like a tunne, bringeth forth nothing
but a drouſie minde, foggie thoughts, filthie
ſpeeches, and corrupt affections: therefore
the Phiſition ſaith, nothing better for the
bodie then abſtinence, the Diuine ſaith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better for the ſoule then abſtinence,
the Lawyer ſaith, nothing better for the wits
then abſtinence; but becauſe there is no lawe
for this vice, therfore it breaketh out ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie.
Whoredome hath a lawe, Theft hath a
lawe, Murther hath a lawe, but this ſinne is
without law.</p>
            <p>Now to the ſecond ſinne, which is Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes:
theſe are two ſiſters, betwixt whom
there is little difference: in this ſinne ſome
are mad, ſome are merrie, ſome doe vomite,
ſome doe ſleepe, and ſome doe reele, and then
there is no difference betweene a man and a
beaſt, ſauing that the one can ſtand, and the
other cannot.</p>
            <p>As euerie Scripture that maketh againſt
Theft, maketh againſt Nonreſidencie; ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
reaſon which maketh againſt gluttonie,
maketh againſt drunkenneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now after theſe commeth chambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and wantonneſſe, and no meruaile ſayth
one, though the impes doe followe, when
the diuell goeth before: for fulneſſe of bread
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:17992:187"/>
went before the ſinne of the Sodomites. So
when Dauid had dined and was full, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon his pallace, his eyes glaunced, his
fleſh luſted, his heart conſented, the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and there was no water to quench it.
And therefore in that ſo great a champion
as Dauid did fall, let him that ſtandeth take
heede leſt hee fall. And ſeeing that thou in
thy ſelfe art no ſtronger, or mightier, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and followe the example of thoſe that
are cunning wraſtlers, who to caſt downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
wil firſt fall downe themſelues: ſo we
to ouerthrowe our enemies muſt ſubiect our
ſelues, and humble our ſelues firſt by faſting
and praier.</p>
            <p>Sodome was burned, but the ſinnes
haue eſcaped. Sweete wordes, ſoft attyre,
wanton behauiour, and ſuch like, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
and agreed all together to ſette ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
to ſale. And wee vſe dailie to pray
that wee bee not ledde into temptation:
and yet wee doe leade our ſelues into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
For our fayre wordes, wanton ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
and daintie fare: with manie other
pleaſures, doe becken vnto ſinne: and if
there bee no wine why hanges the buſhes?
and if there be no wantonneſſe, why is there
anie wanton, or vnſeemely, or vngodly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:17992:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Let vs not walke in gluttonie and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
neither in chambering and wantonneſſes, nor
in ſtrife and enuying.</hi> It is hard to ſay which of
theſe ſins is moſt in the world; happily ſome
will ſay, I haue bene no glutton, no drunkard,
no whoremonger, no murtherer, no falſe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
worſhipper, &amp;c. but who can come
forth and ſaie, hee is free from ſtrife, for ſtrife
hath compaſſed the whole worlde, ſtrife in
Countrey, ſtrife in Citie, ſtrife in the Court,
ſtrife in the Common-weale, ſtrife in the
Church, who can ſay that he is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrife,
or that he hath not iniured his brother? ſurely
that man ſhall ſtand alone, for it wil light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
none but Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I can but exhort you with the Apoſtle, that
you would not walke in ſtrife and enuying,
therefore put away theſe among the reſt, for
he that hath not put off theſe hath not put on
Chriſt, and if he hath not put on Chriſt, hee is
then no Chriſtian. Enuie is a ſinne, and it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
it ſelf like gluttonie, for it fretteth the
heart, ſhortneth the life, and eateth the fleſh,
as a fire conſumeth the wood, it is the mother
of ſtrife, and a great worker in the Court, this
is it which brought labour and ſickneſſe, and
death into the worlde, euen the enuie of the
ſerpent, and the diuell, and it will condemne
thee in thy conſcience if thou bee an enuious
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:17992:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man. Nothing reſembleth God more than
loue; for GOD is loue: ſo if thou haſt loue,
thou reſembleſt God. But if thou haſt enuie,
and art an aduerſarie, thou reſembleſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:
for thou canſt not come neerer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
any way, than to bee enuious. As the
duſt commeth with the winde, ſo the diuell
commeth with enuie; and hee that is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with enuie; is poſſeſſed with the diuell.
Why doth the Apoſtle say in the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, <hi>Aboue all
things put on loue?</hi> Becauſe loue is beſt of all.
Why doth he call loue <hi>the band of perfection?</hi>
Becauſe it bindeth all vertues together. If
loue be the band of perfection, to bind al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
together: then enuie is the band of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie,
to binde all ſinnes together: therefore
if we muſt caſt off all but loue, wee muſt caſt
off enuie. Thou canſt not come to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of peace, without loue. The kingdome
of Satan is at peace, and ſhall not Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
be at peace? Shall we be at peace with
the fleſh, the world, and the diuell, and bee
at variance with God, and at ſtrife one with
another? <hi>Fire is cruell, wrath is raging: but
who can ſtand before enuie?</hi> Prouerbs 27. And
if none can ſtand before enuie, how can enuy
ſtand before God?</p>
            <p>If thou canſt not forgiue him that dooth
offend thee, thou prayeſt againſt thy ſelfe, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17992:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
askeſt vengeance vpon thee, therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
exhorteth thee not to let the Sunne go
downe vpon thy wrath, Epheſ. 5. 26. Charitie
enuieth not (ſaith Paul) therefore ſee thou
haue charitie, leſt thou bee counted an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſon.</p>
            <p>The beaſtes of the field are armed with
hornes, with hoofes, with tuskes, and ſuch like
to take reuenge: but nature hath left nothing
for man to put him in mind of reuenge; and
yet man aboue al other creatures, is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of reuengment, for he hateth his owne
life, therefore it is againſt nature to enuie.
Iohn ſayth, he that hateth his brother is a
manſlaier and loueth not God, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God: if an enuious man (ſayth he) ſay he
loueth God, he is a lyar, becauſe he hateth his
image: if he ſay he knoweth God, he is a lyar,
how canſt thou loue God, and hate good
men? &amp; how canſt thou loue learning, when
thou hateſt the learned? ſo doth the enuious
man all both good and bad: therefore this is
the worſt ſinne, becauſe it commeth neereſt
the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Conſider therefore whom thou hateſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thy image. The diuell was appoynted to
hate man, and not man to hate man; and if
thou hateſt a good man, thou hateſt God: if
thou hateſt an euil man, thou hateſt one like
thy ſelfe; and if thou hateſt one like thy ſelfe,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17992:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou hateſt thine owne ſoule: therefore as S.
Paul ſayth, Haue peace with all men. Canſt
thou not hate the ſinne, and loue the perſon?
as the Phiſition hateth the diſeaſe, and yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>As a great manie of Bees can lodge toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a hiue: ſo a legion of diuels can neſtle
together in one man, but many although they
cannot liue aſunder, yet they cannot liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Wherefore now conſider the pedigree of
peace; God is the God of peace, the holy
Ghoſt is the Spirit of peace, the Angels are
the meſſengers of peace, the miniſters are the
preachers of peace, and the Magiſtrate is the
defender of peace; ſhall wee then that haue
the God of peace, the Spirit of peace, the
meſſengers of peace, the preachers of peace,
the magiſtrates of peace, &amp; (as I may ſay) the
Queene of peace, bee at enuie and warre one
with another? Meruaile not though I am ſo
long vpon this ſinne; for there is none of you
that heare me this day, but you can giue mee
ſufficient matter to ſpeake hereof. Then can I
want words when ye bring matter? Shal I not
wraſtle, and ſeeke to ouerthrowe this giant,
which challengeth euery man?</p>
            <p>As no man finding a Serpent leaueth him
before hee bee dead; ſo let vs ſlaughter this
monſter while he is vnder the axe, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:17992:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
riſe anie more. Conſider of the wrong
thou doeſt to thy ſelf when thou enuieſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the ſtroake of enuie redounds vnto
thee. It were better thou didſt gratulate them
with good things, as good men haue done
and doe daylie: but in ſtead of imitating their
vertues, or commending their gifts, wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
them and maligne them, and ſo their ioye
is our ſorrow. But the enuious man doth pay
for his ſpite, for it requoyles vpon himſelfe;
and enuie is puniſhed with enuie, and hatred
alſo with hatred: for hee which hateth all,
ſhall bee hated of all. Thus hee is tormented
for another, as Herode tormented himſelfe
for Chriſt, &amp; the Iewes troubled themſelues
for Paul: for enuie is as gall to the heart, as
prickes to the ſtomack, and as a canker in the
mouth, and euer vexeth thee, as the euill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Saul vexed him.</p>
            <p>Loue is ſo contrary to enuie, as that it hath
more ioy of others welfare, then enuie hath
of his owne. Therefore an enuious man may
bee compared to Cain, who when hee killed
his brother Abel, was ſo troubled, that hee
ſaid, <hi>Whoſoeuer findeth me ſhall kill me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The couetous man, though hee will not
communicate his owne goods, yet he would
haue others to communicate their goods:
the proud man although hee bee proud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
yet he would haue others to be humble:
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17992:190"/>
but the enuious man careth not who doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good.</p>
            <p>As the Eagle doth account them baſtards
that cannot abide to looke vpon the Sunne:
ſo Chriſt doth account them baſtards which
will not take him to bee an example of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
            <p>Euery creature doeth impart his good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man: but the enuious man he hath ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelfe from dooing good to any, euen
as an Apoſtata.</p>
            <p>Euerie vice is the contrarie of ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as intemperance to moderation, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence
to chaſtitie, pride to humilitie, but
enuie is contrarie to all. This is the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
of the diuell: for God ſaith, <hi>By this ſhal
men know that you are my diſciples, if you loue
one another:</hi> ſo the Diuell hee ſaith, By this
ſhall men knowe that you are my Diſciples
if you enuie and hate one another. The proud,
the prodigall, the couetous, the laſciuious,
they are loued of ſome, but the enuious man
is hated of all. And this ſinne is ſo lothſome
vnto him, that hee cannot abide it in any but
in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if wee loue our ſelues, let vs
loue our neighbours; for nothing doth more
pleaſe God than loue: ſo that if the blacke
Moore could be cleane, here is water inough
to waſh him. But the fleſh of man is more
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17992:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrong then all theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>God hath put enmitie betweene vs and
the Serpent, and the Serpent hath put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betweene man and man.</p>
            <p>When Ioſeph had laden his brethren full

the royall pallace of Babel,</p>

and for the honour of my maiestie?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue choſen this ſtorie of
Nabuchadnezzar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is laide downe his Pride,
his Fall, and his Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
was a wicked King, and
therefore God warned him by a dreame,
and by Daniel, to amend his life, but all
would not ſerue, hee made many ſhewes,
but hee reuolted againe, therefore at the
laſt GOD gaue him ouer for a time, and he
became like a beaſt, vntill he acknowledged
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:17992:192"/>
his power to come from God. A warning to
all rulers, to put them in remembrance that
one ruler is aboue, which muſt bee ſerued of
them all, or elſe all their buildings and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and guard, will not ſhield them from
iudgement when the ſtroake commeth, no
more than they could ſaue Nabuchadaezzar.
<hi>At the end of twelue moneths</hi> (ſaith Daniel)
<hi>this king walked in his royall pallace.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſheweth that hee had deſerued this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
before, and that his dreame which
he had, did tell him that his kingdome ſhould
depart from him for his Pride, yet this reſpite
of twelue moneths was granted him, like the
fortie dayes which were granted to the Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,
to trie what hee would doe vpon his
warnings, and whether hee would repent as
the Niniuites did, therefore the holy Ghoſt
ſheweth how the time ranne, and how he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
after: as if he ſhould ſay, If he will returne
yet, and be warned by the dreames, or by the
Prophets which I ſent him, I will ſtay my
hand, and his kingdome ſhal not depart from
him. But here he ſheweth, that he forgot his
dreame like a dreame, and was more deſirous
to knowe what it meant, than to bee warned
by it. The twelue months ranne moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
moneth, yet Nabuchadnezzar is all one.
Now his dreames are gone, he thinketh that
all is ended, therefore hee getteth him vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17992:193"/>
his pallace amiddeſt his delights, to beake
himſelfe, as it were, in the ſunne of all his
pleaſures, where indeede hee haſtened God
to take away all his pleaſures and delightes
from him, when hee ſhould haue repented,
as the Prophet Daniel willed him, and rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
vp his ſinnes, and bewailed his wicked
life, and poured foorth teares, and preuented
his iudgement with prayer vpon his knees,
then was hee ſtalking in his galleries, and
thinking what ſinne ſhould bee next, to fill
vp the number of his rebellions, that GOD
might not ſpare him when he iudged: ſo the
wicked will not ſuffer the propheſies of God
againſt them to be in vaine, but they will put
GOD in minde of their puniſhments, and
ſinne till the puniſhment doe come vppon
them to fulfill the threatnings due vnto
them.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that Nabuchadnezzar wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vppon the roofe of his pallace, from
whence hee might ſee all partes of the Citie
round about him, like the mountaine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the tempter led our Sauiour Chriſt, to
ſhew him the beauty of the world.</p>
            <p>This the Prophet Daniel would ſignifie,
that the King liued in eaſe as he liued before,
and pleaſed himſelfe in vanitie ſtill for all his
warnings, and turned his time of repentance
to ſinne againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:17992:193"/>
Therefore God would deferre the time
no longer, but cut him downe, like the barren
and fruitleſſe figge tree, to teach vs to take
mercie when it is offered, and repent while
wee haue time and ſpace, and that if GOD
ſpeake vnto vs but once, to lay it vp in our
hearts for euer, not looking or expecting to
be ſpoken to againe, becauſe GOD is not
bound to admoniſh or giue vs any warning
at all.</p>
            <p>One woulde haue thought that Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
woulde haue remembred his
warning while hee had liued, which had
ſuch a ſtrange and fearefull Dreame, and
after that another dreame, being no leſſe
ſtrange and fearefull than the former dreame
to confirme it, and after ſuch a Prophet to
expound it, and the expoſition of it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſuch a miſerable ruine and downfall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelfe.</p>
            <p>One would haue thought and beleeued
that he could neuer haue forgotten it, or put
it out of his remembrance although he had
liued vnto this day. But like a wonder which
laſteth not aboue nine dayes: ſo is the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of them which ſinne by cuſtome, for
when ſinne is rooted it ſticketh faſt, and will
hardly be weeded out, though GOD ſhould
ſend vs dreames, though he ſhould ſhewe vs
viſions, though he ſhould raiſe vp Prophets,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:17992:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Daniel himſelfe cannot make this blacke
Moore white, which alwaies hath been black
before. And this we may ſee in our ſelues, for
why haue we neede to heare ſo often of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
more then of anything elſe, but
that it is ſuch a thing as we cannot frame our
ſelues vnto? If we bee warned of any thing
but of ſinne, one warning will ſerue. But we
are ſo incorporate and inured to ſinne, that a
thouſand ſermons will not ſerue: ſo cuſtome
hath made ſinne ſtronger in many than the
word of God. Well, remember, or conſider,
or applie it how he will, after twelue moneths
God wil come &amp; take account of his dreames
and of his Prophets, which he ſent him, to ſee
what he hath profited by them. Although he
hath leaden feete which are long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
yet hee hath yron hands, which when
he commeth, will ſtrike home.</p>
            <p>Now the twelue moneths are expired, God
comes &amp; findes Nabuchadnezzar vpon his
towres, when hee ſhould haue caſt himſelfe
downe to the ground, and thought vpon his
dreame, and Daniel, and ſo haue humbled
his pride; hee was pearched vpon his rooſt,
and there he begins to crowe of his wealth;
<hi>Is not this great Babel which I haue built
for the houſe of my kingdome, by the might of
my power, and for the honour of my maiestie?</hi>
See how the man ſtandeth in admiration of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:17992:194"/>
his vanitie, like a vſurer which doateth of his
money, as though hee had deſerued immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
fame for ſpending his money vainely. <hi>Is
not this great Babel, &amp;c.</hi> he ſhould rather haue
ſaide, Is not this Nabuchadnezzars follie,
which hee hath built for a mocke to his
name, and an impeachment to his wiſdome,
for men to ſay when they paſſe by, look how
our King hath beſtowed his reuenues, heere
lie our ſubſidies &amp; tributes in this ſtone wall?
But Nabuchadnezzar thinkes that euerie one
will praiſe him for his follie. Therefore like a
woman when ſhee is pricked vp in her bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,
thinkes that all doe admyre her, and
hath as goodly an opinion of her ſelfe as the
Pecocke hath of his feathers, and frameth all
her lookes, and geſtures, and ſpeeches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
ſo when Nabuchadnezzar ſate
in his Pallace, and ſawe ſuch ſhewes about
him, now ſaith Pride thou muſt frame thy
lookes, and geſtures, and ſpeeches, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
or elſe the Kings Pallace will be bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
than the King himſelfe: ſo hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to exalt his minde higher than his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and to looke and ſpeake ſtouter than
hee did before. The temptation was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in his heart, but the words were in his
mouth, and hee pleaſed himſelfe therein ſo
well, that he could not refraine being alone,
but as a foole admyres himſelfe in a glaſſe, ſo
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17992:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when hee was alone and no bodie with him,
hee ſtrouted alone and bragged by himſelfe,
to thinke what a iolly fellow he was, and how
men began to talke of his buildings. By this
we may ſee how wealth and honours change
manners, and how a gay coate, or a great
band, or a gold ring can braue a mans mind,
and make him looke and ſpeake after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner then hee is accuſtomed, when
they are from him.</p>
            <p>It is a wonderfull thing to ſee what power
theſe pettie vaine toyes haue ouer the minde,
to alter and change a man ſodainelie, to
make him thinke better of himſelfe that day
hee weares them, than anie other daye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is not this great Babel, which I haue built
for the houſe of the kingdome, by the might of
my power, for the honour of my maieſtie.</hi> Before
the holy Ghoſt laieth downe Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars
words, marke how hee commeth vnto
them, <hi>The King ſpake and ſayd.</hi> Spake &amp; ſayd,
was not one enough, but hee muſt ſay ſpake
and ſayd? This doubling of the words ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that hee ſpake with a premeditate pride
from his heart roote, which paſſed not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were a ſin or no, come what will come
of it. The holy Ghoſt doth bring other ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with <hi>He ſayd,</hi> and no more: but here he
ſaith, <hi>Spake and ſayd,</hi> as though he ſpake twiſe,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:17992:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not as he ſpake at other times, but like a man
at defiance, which woulde not recall any
word, but if he could ſay more he would ſay
more to anger.</p>
            <p>Did I call it great Babel? I may call it
great Babel? Did I ſay that I built it? I will
ſay that I built it. Did I adde, for the honour
of my maieſtie? let it goe, for the honour of
my maieſtie. Thus hee ſpake and ſayde, as
though he would bee conſtant in his pride,
although hee were conſtant in no other
thing.</p>
            <p>Is not this great Babel, which I haue built
for the houſe of the kingdome, by the might of
my power, and for the honor of my maieſtie?</p>
            <p>Three things I note in this ſaying. Firſt,
what a glorious opinion Nabuchadnezzar
had of his vaine building, out of theſe words,
<hi>Is not this great Babel?</hi> The ſecond out of
theſe words, <hi>which I haue built by the might of
my power;</hi> wherein he tearmeth himſelfe the
founder of it, as if he had done all without a
helper. The third is, that in all his worke, hee
ſought nothing but vaine-glory, out of theſe
words; <hi>for the honour of my Maieſtie.</hi> Theſe
three ſinnes Nabuchadnezzar doth bewraie
in one bragge, and in all theſe three we are ſo
like, that the beaſts were not ſo like him
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> became like a beaſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt we haue not ſo wonderfull an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17992:196"/>
of GOD, or of his word, or of heauen, as
wee haue of our owne acts, although we be
neuer able to do halfe that Nabuchadnezzar
did. Secondlie, this is our manner, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
all to our ſelues whatſoeuer it be, riches,
honour, health, or knowledge; as though all
came by labour, or policie, or arte, or litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
if wee cannot drawe it to one of theſe,
then we think it fortune, although we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not what fortune is. If wee did count
our ſelues beholding vnto God for them,
then we would finde ſome time to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when we ouer-view theſe matters,
this is our ſolace and comfort, to thinke theſe
are the things which make mee famous and
ſpoken of, and pointed at, and then we end, as
though it were inough to bee poynted at. <hi>Is
not this great Babel?</hi> That which one loues,
ſeemes greater and more precious aboue all
which he loueth not, although they be better
than it: ſo did theſe buildings ſeeme to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</p>
            <p>One would not thinke that a houſe were
a matter to make a king proude, although it
were neuer ſo faire; ſtone wals are not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that he ſhould repoſe al his honour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lime and morter. But this is a iuſt thing
with God, that vaine hope, vaine proſperitie,
vaine comfort, and vaine glory, that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17992:196"/>
them when they truſt vnto it: therefore
as the faithfull ſoule looketh vp to GOD,
or vpon the word, or vp to heauen, and ſayth
to it ſelfe, is not this my hope, is not this my
ioy, is not this my inheritaunce? So the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man when hee looketh vpon his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
or his grounds, or his money, ſayth
to himſelfe, is not this my ioye, is not this
my life, is not this my comfort? So while he
poares and gapes vpon it, by little and little
the loue of it growes more and more in his
heart, vntill at laſt he haue mind on nothing
elſe.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt dotage of Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar:
the ſecond was, <hi>which I haue built
by the might of my power.</hi> What a vaunt was
this to ſay, that he built Babylon, when al hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
accorde, that it was built by Semyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
before Nabuchadnezzar was borne,
therfore why doth he boaſt of that which an
other did?</p>
            <p>The anſwere is eaſie, why doe other men
ſo now, wee ſee that euery one doth labour
to obſcure the fame of others, that they may
ſhine alone, &amp; beare the names themſelues,
eſpecially in great buildings: for if they doe
but adde or alter any thing in Schooles, or
Hoſpitals, or Colledges, they looke ſtraight
to bee counted the founders of them, and ſo
the founders of many places are forgotten.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:17992:197"/>
So it is like that Nabuchadnezzar did adde
or alter ſome thing in this Citie, and therfore
hee tooke all to himſelfe, as the faſhion hath
bin euer ſince: but if none had built it, but he
had been the founder of it (as ſome would
ſeeme) yet this had been a proude and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
ſpeech to ſay, <hi>which I haue built by the
might of my power:</hi> for it was not he which
could build Babel, no more then Nemrod
could finiſh Babel, but vnles the Lord build
the houſe the builders build in vaine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he ſayth, <hi>By the might of my power,</hi>
he ſhould haue ſayd, by the might of Gods
power.</p>
            <p>But by this you plainely diſcerne, how
hard and difficult a thing it is to hit vpon a
right word or a good worke, which hath not
a good thought to bring it foorth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make the roote ſweete, or the fruite will
bee ſower, counterfaite as cunningly as you
can.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when he putteth in <hi>for the honour
of my maiestie,</hi> hee ſheweth that he was of
Abſoloms humour, who although he had
deſerued ſhame, yet he would haue fame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee had no children to keepe his name
in remembrance, therefore he erected a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
which hee called Abſoloms place: ſo
many ſtately houſes and places in England,
beare their names of thoſe Lords or others
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:17992:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that do poſſeſſe or owe them, for the like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>Heere Abſolom thought to bee buryed,
as Nabuchadnezzar thought to dwell in
his pallace, but he was caſt into a pit as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
was turned into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
So Shebna made his ſepulchre in one
Countrie, and was buryed in another: for
why ſhould pride haue the reward of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie?
Humilitie (ſaith Salomon) goeth before
honour, that is to ſay, honour is the reward
of humilitie: &amp; yet Nabuchadnezzar would
bee honoured for his pride. What had he, or
Shebna, or Abſolom done, that they ſhould
erect ſuch monuments, to bee praiſed after
death, which were not worthy to be praiſed
in their life? before the building Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
had done nothing worth ſpeaking
of, for becauſe he liued alwayes like a beaſt,
therefore GOD puniſhed him like a beaſt,
and did hee deſerue now to bee ſpoken of
in all ages, for heaping ſtones together?
Wee may ſee that great men are proude
of a ſmall matter, and they looke to bee
praiſed for euerie thing they doe. But looke
how GOD ouerthwarteth them: for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in that they looke to make theyr
greateſt glorie, they ſhame themſelues moſt
of all, and that which they practiſe to exalt
them doth diſgrace them, &amp; that which they
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:17992:198"/>
doe to winne them loue, getteth them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
ſinne ſo deceiueth them like the blinde
Aramites, that they take a cleane contrarie
way to their deſires, as wee may ſee in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauenth
of Geneſis, they which built Babel,
ſaid they would build it to get them a name,
but they got ſhame, for they could not finiſh
it when they had begun it, but were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in ſuch ſort, that they knewe not what
they did, ſo ſodainly they vnderſtoode not
what one another ſaid. So when Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
came to himſelfe againe, he ſhewed
that when hee ſought his owne honour, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
departed from him, and hee was made
like a beaſt: but when hee ſought Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
honour came to him againe, and hee
was made a King.</p>
            <p>This would pull away many toyes from
womens backs, if they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how God
maketh them ridiculous by that they weare,
to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues amiable, if they did thinke
that the apparell which they clogge on to
pleaſe the world, by the ſecret iudgement of
God did not pleaſe but diſpleaſe, they would
be aſhamed of their attire, as Eue was of her
nakedneſſe: would they weare ſuch gardes
and paint their faces but to pleaſe? See now
how God doth mocke them, for they are not
liked but diſliked, and worſe thought of for it
than they which go in ruſſet coates, &amp; ſeeke
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:17992:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no praiſe at all; they think, am I not braue, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thinke, is ſhe not proud? they think, am
I not ſweete? others thinke, is ſhe not light?
yet they dreame that euerie man praiſeth
them for their brauery: as Nabuchadnezzar
thought that euery one would honor him for
his pallace. If their brauerie condemne them
before men, how will it condemne them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God? Therefore when Nabuchadnezzar
ſaith, For the honor of my Maieſtie, he ſhould
haue ſaide, for the honour of Gods Maieſtie,
and then this had been recorded for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
indeed, and his houſe had bin the houſe
of God: for as we ſhould ſpeake, and ſtudie,
&amp; labour to Gods glorie: ſo we ſhould build
alſo to Gods glorie, that our houſes may bee
like temples, as Obadiahs was. But few ſeeke
glorie that way, they had rather pull downe
than build in ſuch ſort.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue heard what Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
ſpake in ſecret, as though GOD would
diſplay the thoughts and pride of ſuch buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Theſe are the meditations of Princes &amp;
noble men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they behold their buildings,
or open their coffers, or lookvpon their traine
ſwinging after them, they thinke as Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
thought, Is not this great Babel?
is not this great glorie? is not this the traine
that maketh me reuerenced in the ſtreets? are
not theſe the things which ſhall make my
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:17992:199"/>
children rich? is not this the houſe that ſhall
keepe my name, and cauſe me to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and make them which are childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now
ſpeake of me hereafter, when they ſhall paſſe
by and looke vp, and ſee theſe antikes and
knackes ouer their heads, they will ſay; oh
he which built this was a great man, he bare a
ſway both in court and countrie, who but he
while he liued?</p>
            <p>Although this king be dead &amp; buried, yet
his pride is eſcaped &amp; come to vs. Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
hath children yet aliue, which build as
high as he, looke as high as he, goe as braue as
he, ſpend as vainly as he, and are as proud as
he, although they bee not Kings nor Dukes,
nor Earles, nor Knights, nor yet good Squires:
looke vpon their pallaces, and think whether
they bee of Nabuchadnezzars brood; <hi>Is not
this great Babel?</hi> and is not Nabuchadnezzar
Lord of it? Oh if they might liue to walke in
theſe galleries ſtil, they would deſire no other
heauen, but Nabuchadnezzar hath ſhewed
the way before them, and they muſt all dance
after him, though they were as mightie,
though they were mightier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he, death will
not take his kingdome for a raunſome. Now
what is Babel, and what is Nabuchadnezzar
the King thereof? Now Babel is deſtroyed,
and the King that built it laid in the duſt, had
it not been better to haue built an houſe in
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:17992:199"/>
heauen, which might haue receiued him,
when he dyed?</p>
            <p>The name of theſe pallaces may well bee
called Babel, that is confuſion, becauſe they
propheſie confuſion to them that build them,
becauſe their foundation is Pride, their wals
extortion, their roofe ambition, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them vſurie, briberie, and crueltie. If this
bee the beſt that Nabuchadnezzar hath to
vaunt of, what is the worſt which he may bee
aſhamed of?</p>
            <p>When I ſee how earneſt this King was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his dreame, and how looſe he ſate after
in his pallace, mee thinkes I ſee the image of
the world in one man: how liuely doth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
reſemble the dreamers of our
time? He could not reſt till hee knew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of his dream: ſuch inquirie, ſuch
diligence to knowe Gods will, that a man
would haue thought, now if the King meet
with a Prophet that can tell him the trueth,
and inſtruct him from God, that his dreame
warned him to amend his life, hee will then
reclayme himſelfe, and reforme his realme,
and become ſuch a King as was neuer in the
land before.</p>
            <p>But behold, no ſooner reſolued of his doubt,
but hee is readie to bee warned agayne, and
was not ſo attentiue to the Prophet, as hee
was to his dreame, although hee cared for
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:17992:200"/>
neither: for when hee vnderſtoode that his
dreame went about to chaunge the courſe of
his life, he went away like Naaman in a chafe,
and cared no more for his dreame after. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the dreame came, all would haue ſayd,
that ſuch a dreame would haue humbled his
heart for euer. Before the Prophet came, all
would haue ſaide, that ſuch a Prophet would
haue conuerted him with a word: but Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
is Nabuchadnezzar; and if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dreame come more fearefull than this,
yet Nabuchadnezzar would be Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
and loue his Pallace better than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</p>
            <p>So we thinke, if God would ſend a famine
vpon this land, that would make vs feare him:
but God hath ſent a famine, and yet wee doe
not feare him. If God would ſend an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
vpon this lande, that would make vs
feare him: but God hath ſent an earthquake,
and yet we doe not feare him. If God would
ſend a peſtilence vpon this lande, that would
make vs feare him: but God hath ſent a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and yet we doe not feare him. If God
would ſend warre vpon this lande, that would
make vs feare him: but God hath ſent warre,
and yet we doe not feare him; therefore what
will make vs feare him?</p>
            <p>There be many which dreame vpon reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as Nabuchadnezzar dreamed vpon his
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:17992:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dreame; and as hee deſired onely to knowe
what it meant, ſo they deſire onely to knowe.
<hi>Master,</hi> (ſaith the yong man to Chriſt) <hi>what
ſhall I do to come into heauen?</hi> He would faine
knowe the way to heauen, but when Chriſt
ſhewed him the way, hee would not take it:
So they will goe from Preacher to Preacher,
as Nabuchadnezzar ſent from one wiſe man
to another to be reſolued in poynts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
ſuch a ſcrutinie, ſuch attention, ſuch
heed, as though they would runne out of the
world, and goe beyond all, that a man would
thinke they would do any thing, as the Iewes
came vnto Moſes, and this young man vnto
Chriſt: But when they haue heard what they
came for, they doe like Nabuchadnezzar, as
they did before; now they ſaye it was but a
dreame, becauſe the meaning doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
according to their will. So Achab en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the Prophet, to heare what hee
would ſay, but it appeares that he neuer ment
to follow him, except he would anſwer as he
would haue him.</p>
            <p>When it commeth to the act, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
mans triall, then you ſhall ſee who are
like Nabuchadnezzar, that is, which affect
onely to knowe; and who are like Zacheus,
that is, which practiſe as they knowe: for as
the truth is reuealed, ſo it muſt be witneſſed,
or els the fall of Nabuchadnezzar ſheweth,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:17992:201"/>
what iudgement will follow vpon ſuch neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting.</p>
            <p>Becauſe hee would not doe as his dreame
warned him, and as the Prophet counſailed
him, therefore GOD forſooke him, and his
Kingdome departed from him, and hee was
thruſt out of his Pallace, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urned like an
Oxe into the wilderneſſe, there he liued like
a beaſt vntill ſeauen yeares were ended. A
warning to all to take warning by the word,
for it is the gentle warner, the next will bee
harder, the third and the fourth harder then
it, like to the nine plagues of Egypt, which
did exceede one another: for what is he can
weigh the wrath of GOD, or the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of ſinne?</p>
            <p>Some men woulde thinke, that Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
might haue ſpoken all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſuch great offence as was taken at it:
for he ſayde no more, but that it was a fayre
houſe, and that he builded it: and that hee
erected it for his honour: ſeeing manie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Princes delight in worſe vanities than
fayre buildings, and ſpeake vayner often in a
weeke.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when you ſee howe it diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God, to vaunt of theſe earthly thinges,
or to impute any thing to our ſelues, thinke
what ſhall bee the doome of great ſinnes: if
Nabuchadnezzar became like a Beaſte, and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17992:201"/>
lodged in the wilderneſſe for his pride; they
which beare pride, and couetouſneſſe, and
luſt, and wrath, and malice in one breaſt, ſhal
lodge in hell, and become like Diuels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are like beaſts already. Therefore
let this bee in ſtead of Daniels warning, if
God did take ſuch a ſtraight account of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
for his dreame, what hee had
profited by it: what account will hee take of
vs, what profit we haue made by Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars
fall and puniſhment?</p>
            <p>Thus you haue heard what the voyce ſpake
from earth, now you ſhall heare what the
voyce ſpake from Heauen: for it followeth,
<hi>While the word was in the kings mouth, a voyce
came from heauen, and ſayd; O King to thee
be it ſpoken, thy kingdome ſhall be taken from
thee, &amp;c.</hi> God will warne him no more by
dreames, nor by Prophets, as he did: but his
Iudgements ſhall ſpeake. Heere is fulfilled
that which Elihu ſayth to Iob, <hi>God ſpeaketh
once and twice by dreames and viſions in the
night, and man ſeeth it not: at the last God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his eyes, by the corrections which he had
ſealed:</hi> ſo God ſpake vnto Nabuchadnezzar
firſt by dreames, and after by his Prophet; &amp;
Nabuchadnezzar regarded it not: at laſt God
openeth his eyes by corrections, which hee
had ſealed vp, that they ſhould not touch him
if any other meſſenger could bring him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:17992:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As the holy Ghoſt doth note the time when
Nabuchadnezzar ſpake in his pallace: ſo he
noteth the time when God ſpake from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<hi>Euen while the words were in the Kings
mouth:</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, God anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before he looked for it, when he thought
God had been as farre from him, as he was all
the yeare before. Thus God lay (as it were in
the skowte) to watch when he ſpake treaſon,
and to apprehend him vpon it: O Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
thou haſt vanted this twelue months
ſince I warned thee: I made as though I heard
not, but ſuffered thee to doe and ſpeake thy
pleaſure: and vaunteſt thou ſtill? Surely thou
ſhalt ſcape me no longer, I will not heare one
word more againſt my honour. So he cutteth
him off while the words were in his mouth,
and pronounceth the word of iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</p>
            <p>The firſt note in this verſe, is the time when
God ſpake from Heauen. <hi>Pride</hi> (ſayth Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
<hi>goeth before the fall:</hi> ſo when pride had
ſpoken, then Iudgement ſpake euen while
the proud word was in his mouth. See how
God ſhewes that theſe brags offended him,
and therefore he iudges while he ſpeaks. How
ſhort is the triumph of the wicked? When
they beginne to crowe, God ſtoppeth their
breath, and iudgement ſeaſeth vpon them,
when they thinke no danger neere them: So
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:17992:202"/>
when Baltazar was in his mirth with his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
the fearfull hand wrote his doome vpon
the wall, and preſently his mirth was changed
into ſadneſſe, that he became as one that was
ſtrooken with a palſie: ſo while Herod vanted
himſelfe, and the people honoured him like a
God, the Angell of God ſmote him vpon his
throane, and immediatly he was deuoured of
wormes in the face of them which honoured
him: while the Philiſtines were triumphing
and banquetting, Sampſon pulled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vpon their head; ſo while the men of Zik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag
were feaſting and dancing, Dauid came
vpon them and ſlew them: when the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
were at their Manna and Quailes, euen
while the meat (ſaith Dauid) was yet in their
mouths, God tooke away their liues: when
Iobs children were making merrie one with
another, the winde came and blew down the
houſe: while the old world was marrying, &amp;
giuing in mariage, the floud came and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them: while the Steward was recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with himſelfe, and thinking that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Knewe not what policie was in his heart,
ſuddenly his Lorde called him to account:
while the churle was muſing of his barnes full
of corne, and ſaying to himſelfe, be merrie my
ſoule, that night his ſoule was taken from
him: ſo while we ſinne &amp; think nothing of it,
our ſinnes mount vp to heauen, and ſtand at
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:17992:203"/>
the barre, and call for vengeance againſt vs:
how ſoone Abels blood cryed for vengeance
of Cain? We cannot ſin ſo quickly, but God
ſeeth vs as quickly. Howe many haue beene
ſtrooken while the oath hath been in their
mouthes, as Ieroboam was ſtriken while he
ſtroke, that they might ſee why they were
ſtrooken? and yet al this wil not keep vs from
ſwearing. Though a man ſinne often, &amp; ſteale
his ſins (as it were) without puniſhment, yet
at laſt he is taken napping, euen while the
wickednes is in his hand, and his day is ſette
when he ſhall pay for all, whether it be after
twelue moneths or twelue yeeres, when it
commeth, it will ſeeme too ſoone. Therefore
once agayne let this bee in ſtead of Daniels
warning, if God did take ſo ſtraight account
of Nabuchadnezzar how he had profited by
his dreame, what account will hee take
of vs how we haue profited by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars
puniſhment?

laid down the pride, fall,
and reſtitution of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar.
The two

of his Pride, which
ſhew him in his ruffling as it were in the ayre,
before he knew God, or himſelfe. The three
next verſes are the diſcouerie of his ſhame,
which ſhewe him in his miſerie, as it were
groueling on the ground after God had coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his courage. The foure laſt verſes are the
celebration of his recouerie, which ſhew him
in holines as it were rapt into heauen, &amp; ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Saints for ioye, that GOD had
brought him vnto his knowledge, though it
were through ſhame &amp; trouble, &amp; loſſe of all
that he had ſeuen yeres together. Of his pride
wee haue heard alreadie: yet becauſe we are
friends to vices as we are to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they
proſper and flouriſh; but when they decay

            <p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:17992:204"/>
Therfore ye ſhall ſee Nabuchadnezzar vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his feete againe: before you behelde him
vpon his knees, that when ye ſee what a king
he was in his galleries, &amp; after find his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts

and himſelfe like a beaſt in the wilderneſſe,
God may giue you hearts to thinke a little of
this ſinne, what it is which coſt ſo deare, and
is ſo common, now in euery houſe, as it was
then in the kings court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After twelue moneths</hi> (ſaith Daniel) that is,
twelue moneths after God had warned this
king by dreames and by Daniel, to repent his
ſinnes, he was ſtrouting in his galleries, and
thought what ſin ſhould be next, as though
he had neuer heard of dreame or Prophet.</p>
            <p>By this computation of ſin, wherein the
moneths are obſerued ſo exactly, how longe
Nabuchadnezzar rebelled after he was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Daniel ſhewes what reckoning GOD
keepes of our moneths, and weeks, and daies,
which he giues vs to repent, as he did Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,
and what an account wee ſhall
make of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Nabuchadnezzar did, though
we count no more of our age then the childe
dooth of his youth, and haue doone no
more of our taske at twentie, then when we
were but tenne, nor at thirty, then when we
were but twenty, nor at fortie, then when we
were thirtie, yet we ſhall giue account of mo
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:17992:205"/>
hours in the day of iudgement, and it ſhall be
heauier to the old then to the young, to you
which haue the worde, then to them which
want it: and there is great ods betweene Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
&amp; vs for he which challenged
Nabuchadnezzar for twelue moneths ſince
he was warned, may challenge vs of twelue
yeeres ſince we were warned, &amp; yet we looke
not for ſo great puniſhment as fell vpon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
for twelue moneths. Daniel
names there twelue moneths, as though hee
would ſpeake of a great matter, and ſhewes
how worthie Nabuchadnezzar was to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
becauſe he might haue reformed his
life ſince he was warned: for there were 12.
moneths betweene his dreames and his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
But that yeere wherein he had ſo
many warnings &amp; teachings was as vaine as
the reſt, and vainer then the yeres before: for
now he ſhould haue been a mourner like the
King of Niniuie, when Ionas threatned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
vnto them. But like a victor of a
countrie returned from battell to ſolemnize
his triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph, firſt he decked his pallace as braue
as himſelfe, and then he walkes his ſtations in
it, and when he hath ſet al things before him,
which might make him forget God, and like
a ſerpent that would burſt, vnles he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
ſome of his poyſon, he breaketh out and
ſayde, <hi>Is not this great Babel, which I haue
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:17992:205"/>
built by the might of my power, for the honour of
my maieſtie?</hi> wherein obſerue firſt what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
opinion this vaine King had of his vaine
buildings. Secondly, how that he names him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the founder of them, as though hee had
done all without an helpe. Thirdly, that in all
his works he ſought nothing but vain-glorie,
as hee witneſſeth againſt himſelfe, ſaying;
<hi>which I haue built for the honour of my maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie?</hi>
not for the honour of Gods maieſtie, but
for the honour of my maieſtie. So firſt that
which he ſhould haue contemned, as Chriſt
did the beautie of the Temple;<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 2.</note> he admired it,
&amp; nothing ſeemed ſo glorious to him, as that
which made him ſhamefull to God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that citie which was built by Semiramis, he
arrogateth to himſelfe, and neuer ioyned the
chiefe workmaſter with him, but ſaith, <hi>which I
haue built by the might of my power,</hi> when he
ſhould haue ſaid, by the might of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
for vnles God build the houſe, the builder
(ſaith Dauid) buildeth but in vaine.<note place="margin">Pſal. 127. 1</note> Laſtly,
that which hee ſhould haue built for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

for the Prophet, hee builded for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as our Nabuchadnezzars doe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when all his pleaſures were prepared
like a feaſt, and he came to ſit downe at the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ket, it hapned to him as to the churle in the
Goſpell, after he had filled his barnes, when
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17992:206"/>
hee came to ſing in his heart, Be merrie my
ſoule; that night his ſoule was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him,
and the diuels made merrie with it in hell: ſo
he had fethered his neaſt, and began to crow
vpon his rooſt, <hi>Is not this great Babel, &amp;c.</hi> As
if he ſhuld ſay, Now Nabuchadnezzar make
thee merie; that houre his honor was taken
from him, for a voyce came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
like the terrible hand which wrote vpon
the wall when Baltaſar ſate at his banquet, &amp;
daſht his pride vpon ſuch a rocke, that within
an houre all his pomp, and pleaſures, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
ſuffered ſuch a ſhipwracke, that his fall
was more admired of all, than his glorie and
buildings were admired of himſelfe. Thus all
the ioy, and pleaſures, and glory of pride are
ſpoken with a breath, and ſtopt with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>You haue heard what the voice ſpake from
earth, now ye ſhal heare what the voice ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
from heauen. Theſe three verſes following
declare this Kings fall, when and howe, and
from whom it was. <hi>While the words were yet,
&amp;c.</hi> there is the time. <hi>A voice, &amp;c.</hi> there is the
Iudge <hi>O king, &amp;c.</hi> there is the arraignement.
<hi>Thy kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> there is the iudgement. <hi>He
was driuen from men, &amp; liued with beaſts in che
wildernes, till his haires were grown like Eagles
fethers.</hi> There is the execution and maner of
his puniſhment. Firſt of the time, <hi>while, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:17992:206"/>
As Daniel obſerued the time when Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
ſinned, ſo he obſerueth the time
when Nabuchadnezzar is puniſhed: as if
God had lien in waite to catche him in his
words, and take him at the trippe, euen as he
watched Lots wife when ſhee looked backe,
and transformed her into a piller of oſ ſalte, ſo
ſoone as ſhe looked behind her: So now the
Lord lay as it were in the ſcout, to watch whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Nabuchadnezzar ſpake treaſon, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him vpon it, O Nabuchadnezzar
thou haſt vanted theſe twelue moneths ſince
I warned thee, and I made as though I heard
not, but ſuffered thee to doe and ſpeake thy
pleaſure, and vaunteſt thou ſtill? Surely thou
ſhalt eſcape me no longer, I will not heare a
word more againſt mine honour. So hee cut
him off while the wordes were in his mouth,
and propoundeth the wordes of iudgement
againſt him. If you marke the time when the
voice ſpake from heauen, you may ſee three
wiſedomes of God. Firſt God takes him in his
fault,<note place="margin">1 Kin 13. 4</note> that he might ſee his fault, as Ieroboam
was ſtriken when he ſtroke the Prophet, that
he might know why he was ſtriken. Then he
takes him ſodainly, becauſe hee contemneth
his warning,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 24.</note> as the fire came vpon Sodome
while they contemned Lots warning. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
God takes him where he is pleaſanteſt and
luſtieſt, and ſafeſt, in his pallace, which was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:17992:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like a Caſtle,<note place="margin">Act. 12. 23.</note> as he took Herod when his gard
ſtood by him, that he might ſee that nothing
can garde him from God, but God muſt gard
him from danger, or elſe Princes bee no ſafer
than ſubiects: ſo though a man ſin often, and
ſteale his ſins as it were without puniſhment,
yet at the laſt he is tooke napping, while the
wickedneſſe is in his hand; as the Iewes were,
while the quailes were in their mouthes, and
his day is ſet when hee ſhall pay for all,<note place="margin">Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 11. 33.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee after 12. moneths, or 12. yeeres,
whenſoeuer it commeth it wil ſeem too ſoon.
Vengeance doth ſtay till ſin be ripe, &amp; watch
the time when they are moſt occupied, then
iudgement ſteps forth, like the Angel to ſtop
Balaam in his way,<note place="margin">Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 22. 22.</note> becauſe the puniſhment is
more grieuous &amp; terrible whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they look not
for it (for the worſt that is, wiſh like Balaam,
to die the death of the righteous) therefore
God will croſſe them in that: though they
proſper alwayes before, yet their ends ſhall
be a kinde of iudgement vpon all their life, &amp;
a propheſie of torment, for all men to ſee
what become of the wicked after death, that
they may feare to be like vnto them: As when
we ſee ſome fall down vnder the table while
they ſit ſwilling at the Wine: ſome ſtriken
dumbe in the pulpit, while they preach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths:<note place="margin">Act. 12. 23.</note>
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Philiſtines were ſlain while
they feaſted,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 13. 4</note> and as Herod was ſhamed while
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:17992:207"/>
he vanted, and as Ieroboam was ſtriken while
he ſtroke. What doth this teach vs, but that
our ſinnes depart from vs ſo ſoon as they are
done vnto the Iudge, &amp; there they accuſe vs,
as Cains murther cried out againſt him, ſo
ſoon as he ſlew his brother.<note place="margin">Gen 4.</note> I know thy works
ſaith God:<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 15.</note> he may ſay I knowe thy works &amp;
thy thoughts too:<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 14 16, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> for Iudas could not goe ſo
cloſely about his trechery, but that Chriſt did
know when the thought entred into his hart,
and heard when he conferred alſo with the
Scribes, and ſaw likewiſe when he tooke the
bribe, though he kept a time to puniſh him, as
he ſaith Pſalm. 37. ver. 2. <hi>When I ſee a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time, then wil I execute iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the time was come, when this King
ſhould bee made an example vnto all other
Kings after him, to amend their liues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their Realmes, when as the Prophet
commeth from God vnto them, to tell them
what they ſhould doe. When Dreame and
Daniel had done what they could; now God
cals foorth his Iudgements, and bids them
ſee what they can do, and commaunds them
to chaſe Nabuchadnezzar, vntill he haue
loſt his kingdome, vntill he be driuen out of
his pallace, vntill he be fled into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
vntill he be degenerate like a beaſt, vntill
his ſubiects, &amp; ſeruants, &amp; pages make their
ſport, &amp; gaze and wonder at him, like a foole
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:17992:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which goeth vnto the ſtockes, or a treſpaſſer,
which is gazed at vpon the pillorie: ſo the
king was debaſed, when God heard him but
vaunt of his buildings.</p>
            <p>Therefore let vs take heede and be carefull,
after what ſort we ſpeake, and what wordes
ſlip from vs, leſt GOD take vs in our lies, or
oaths, or ſlanders, or ribauldrie, as hee tooke
Nabuchadnezzar, when his tongue walked
without a bit: for if he had ſuppoſed that God
had been ſo neare, and that he would haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him as he did, he would haue held his
peace, and layd his hand vpon his mouth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than pay ſo deare for a vain word, which
did him no good when it was ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The ſecond note is of the Iudge, <hi>A voyce
came downe from heauen:</hi> the controuling
voice came down from heauen, God is moſt
offended with our ſinne: for Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
might haue ſpoken more than this, before
any other man, and no man could controll
him becauſe he was king, and kings delight
in greater vanities than buildings, yet no man
ſaith, Why doeſt thou ſo? becauſe Salomon
ſaith, <hi>He which repeateth a matter ſeparateth
the Prince,</hi> that is, he which tels Princes their
faults, maketh them his enemies: therefore
ſince Iohn Baptiſt dyed, onely God is left to
reprooue almoſt all that ſinne by authoritie,
yet there is one in heauen hath an eare and a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:17992:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tongue, and checketh the king as boldly as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the king checketh his ſubiects. When the
voice from earth ſpake vainly, the voice from
heauen ſpake iudgement. Here is the king
of heauen againſt the king of earth, the voice
of GOD againſt the voice of man: a diuine
wrath, warring with a humane pride: the fire
is kindled, woe to the ſtubble. The Lorde
of hoaſts is in armes againſt the Lord of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
and beginnes to lay handes on him and
to thruſt him out of his throane. Firſt, he rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
him like a thunder, <hi>O King Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar:</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, for all thou art
a king, thou ſhalt ſee whether another bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
thee. Now gard thy perſon, now defend
thy honour, for he whom thou haſt deſpiſed,
threatneth to take thy kingdome from thee;
goe nowe and walke in thy galleries, fetch
one turne more before thou bee turned out
of doore, and walke with the beaſtes in the
forreſt.</p>
            <p>Now he comes to the arraignement, and
cals him to the barre, <hi>O king Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
to thee be it ſpoken.</hi> He was neuer called
king with leſſe reuerence, nor had ſuch paie
for ſinne in all his raigne. God giues him his
title, and he tels him his lot, he cals him king
but without a kingdom: as if he ſaid, late king
of Babel, holde vp thy hande. Here a king is
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:17992:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
arraigned in his owne kingdome, and no eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
giuen againſt him, but as though hee
had witneſſed againſt himſelfe, as all ſinners
doe, God condemneth him out of his owne
mouth, and to open his eares, he calleth him
by his owne name, <hi>O king Nabuchadnezzar,</hi>
as the priſoner is called when he holds vp his
hand at the barre. Then he pronounceth the
iudgement, <hi>To thee be it ſpoken,</hi> to thee which
aduanceſt thy ſelfe like God, to thee which
wouldſt not take heed by thy dreame, to thee
which wouldſt not bee warned by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
to thee which diddeſt all for thine own
honor. Now hearken to thy iudgement, <hi>Thy
kingdome is departed from thee,</hi> thou ſhalt bee
driuen out of thy pallace, they which ſhould
honor thee ſhall expulſe thee, thou ſhalt
raigne with the beaſtes in the deſarte, there
ſhall be thy dwelling ſeuen yeares, goe now
and ſtalke in the woods as thou diddeſt in thy
pallaces, and when thou art among the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Wolues, and Beares, looke vnto Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
which thou haſt built.</p>
            <p>How dooth this ſpeech differ from Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars
ſpeeche? his wordes were but
wordes, but Gods wordes were, <hi>He ſpake,</hi> and
it was done. For in the ſame houre that which
was ſpoken was done (ſaith Daniel) &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the voyce threatneth vnto our ſinnes,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:17992:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or vnto the ſinner, ſhal be done at firſt or laſt.
To Nabuchadnezzar it was ſaid, <hi>Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhall bee taken from thee.</hi> To vs it is ſaid,
Thy life ſhall bee taken from thee. To him it
was ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt be thruſt forth into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart.</hi>
To vs it is ſaid, Thou ſhalt bee throwne
forth into darkenes. To him it was ſaid, <hi>Thou
ſhalt be like beaſts.</hi> To vs it is ſaid, Thou ſhalt
be like the damned. Shall not the voice ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to vs be remembred with God, as well as
the threatning menaced to him?</p>
            <p>This voice came from heauen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſpake home, not like them which glide
by the faultes of Princes, &amp; whiſper behinde
their backes, as though they would reproue
them if they durſt, but for feare leſt the prince
or counſellor, or iudge, or magiſtrate, ſhould
take it as he meanes it, &amp; think that he aimes
at them, which makes them ſpeake in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as though they would caſt a vayle ouer
their reproofe, and eate their meſſage before
they haue ſpoken it. The holy Ghoſt teacheth
vs here to reproue, ſo that whoſoeuer ſinneth
may knowe that thou ſpeakeſt to him. Hee
which ſpeaketh from Heauen (as the voyce
did) muſt ſpeak like Iohn Baptiſt among the
Publicans &amp; harlots, and ſouldiers, as though
he went from one to another, and ſaide, this
is ſpoken to thee, this is ſpoken to thee, this is
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:17992:210"/>
ſpoken to thee. For vnleſſe wee come neere
theſe mortall Gods and proud Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars,
as neer as Elias came to Achab, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſaid, <hi>It is thou that troubleſt Iſrael,</hi> they wil
poaſt it ouer and thinke that thou ſpeakeſt
not to them vntill thou ſpeakeſt plainly, as
the voice ſpake from heauen, <hi>To thee be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
And they will reforme the matter, or elſe
God ſhew ſome iudgement vpon them, as he
did heere vpon this great king Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar.</p>
            <p>Now the decree goeth foorth, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
ſhall be King no more, <hi>Thy
kingdome is departed from thee.</hi> This is ſuch a
ſaying, as if Nabuchadnezzar had thought of
it before, he would haue wept when he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to thinke that his honor was going from
him, when hee thought it was comming to
him: and yet his kingdom was departed from
him, and yet God ſaith, <hi>Thy kingdome is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from thee,</hi> becauſe the decree was paſt,
which ſhould as ſurely come to paſſe, as if it
were paſt already. Therefore becauſe we
care not ſo long as the Prophet ſayth, we ſhal
die, we ſhal ſuffer, we ſhal anſwere, he leaueth
<hi>Shall,</hi> and ſaith <hi>Now,</hi> as God ſaid to Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec:
<hi>Thou art a dead man,</hi> not <hi>thou ſhalt dye,</hi>
but <hi>thou art dead,</hi> which rouſed him more,
then if hee had threatned him an hundred
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:17992:210"/>
deaths, becauſe he thought that he ſhuld die
preſently: So the holy Ghoſt is forced as it
were to exceede, and ſpeake more then wee
thinke he ſhould ſpeake, for the hardneſſe of
our hearts, which heare like ſtones, and goe
like ſnayles. If we haue but a weeke to repent
we will deferre it to the laſt day, that we may
ſinne all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was meet to ſay, <hi>Thy kingdome
is departed from thee.</hi> That ſeeing his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould not ſtay, he ſhould not ſtay his
repentance. If this voyce had ſaide, <hi>Thy Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
ſhall ſinke,</hi> as Nemrods Babel did, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
he would haue thought his honour bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
but when he was ſtript, not onely of his
pallace, but alſo of his kingdome, what heauy
newes was this vnto him, which thought him
ſelfe equall with GOD, and nowe may not
be a King? But when hee was thruſt among
beaſts to eate graſſe with oxen, what a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
was this to be brought vnder all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
which ſpake euen nowe as though
there were none but he: and now his ſeruants
ſeruant would not be like vnto him? So the
king of kings wil be honored of kings, as they
are of their ſubiects, or elſe he will tread vpon
their crownes, and they ſhal heare the ſame at
laſt, <hi>Thy kingdome ſhall depart from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the execution of his
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:17992:211"/>
iudgement, for Daniell ſaith, <hi>The ſame houre
all this was fulfilled.</hi> So he ſheweth the order
of it: as a priſoner is brought to the barre, and
lead to a gybbet, ſo this King was drawne
from his throne, and turned into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
where he aboade among wilde beaſtes
ſo long, <hi>Till his haires were growne like Eagles
feathers, and his nailes like birds clawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God began, he made haſt, as it was
long before he ſpoke, but when he ſpoke, hee
did it, and effected in an houre all that the
dreame and the Prophet had foretolde.</p>
            <p>Then was fulfilled, <hi>The pride of man ſhall
bring him lowe:</hi> Euen in that houre that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
aduanced himſelfe more than
before, in the ſame houre hee was brought
vnder all his ſubiectes, all his ſeruants and
pages; ſo he which ſetteth vp can pull down,
he which gaue can take, he which made can
deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no man vaunt though hee
were a king of his houſe or land, or farme
or children, but know that hee ſhould haue
nothing, if GOD did not regarde him more
than other, and thinke when thou doeſt read
this ſtorie, whether thou be not as proude of
thy wealth, as Nabuchadnezzar was of his
pallace: whether thou be not as proud of thy
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Nabuchadnezzar was of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:17992:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether thou be not as proud of thy
parentage, as Nabuchadnezzar was of his
honour: whether thou be not ſo proud of thy
lerning, as Nabuchadnezzar was of his train.
If thou be not ſo proud, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God doth ſay no
more, <hi>O King, to thee be it ſpoken,</hi> O ſubiect to
thee be it ſpoken, theſe bleſſings ſhalbe taken
from thee. For, hath God take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no mans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from him but Nabuchadnezzars? hath
he taken no mans office from him but Iudas?
hath he taken no mans riches from him but
Iobs? how did Antiochus, and Iulian, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,
and Saul, and Athalia, and Iezabel, &amp; Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
the third goe from their thrones, as if
God had pulled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out by the eares? he had
no reſpect vnto their perſons, but vſed them
like beaſts as hee did Nabuchadnezzar, and
fulfilled his threatning: The candle of the
wicked ſhall be put out. Therefore as Chriſt
ſaith vnto them which turne backe: <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Lots wife:</hi> ſo I may ſay to them which
beare high mindes, and proud lookes, &amp; ſtout
wordes, remember King Nabuchadnezzar,
how God reſiſted the proud. Now if any man
long to be reſolued, how this king was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to a beaſt, he muſt not imagin any ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
metamorphoſis, or popiſh tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as though his ſhape were altered, or his
manhood remoued, or that he put on hornes
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:17992:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and hoofe, as the Poets faine of Acteon, for
the voyce doth not ſaye that hee ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a beaſt, but that he ſhould dwell with
the beaſtes. Daniel dooth not ſaye that his
head or armes, or legges were transformed:
but that the haire of his head and the nayles
of his fingers did growe like Eagles feathers,
and like birds clawes, as euerie mans haire
and nayles will doe, if hee doe not pare
them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Nabuchadnezzar ſaith not, that his
ſhape was reſtored vnto him, but that his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
was reſtored vnto him: all which
declare, that he was not chaunged in bodie,
but in minde: not in ſhape, but in qualitie. A
ſauage minde came on him, like that which
droue Cain from the companie of men,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 12.</note> and
he became like a Satyre or wilde man, which
differeth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a beaſt, but in ſhape: though
hee was not turned to a beaſt, yet this was a
ſtraunge alteration, to bee ſo chaunged in an
houre, that his Nobles abhorred him, his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
deſpiſed him, his ſeruants forſooke him,
none woulde companie with him but the
beaſts. Conſider this all that aduaunce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
againſt GOD and deſpiſe his word, as
Nabuchadnezzar did. Take warning by a
King, which euen now walkt in his galleries,
&amp; his Nobles ſerued him in his pallace, with
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:17992:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all diſhes that the ayre, or ſea, or land, could
afford: now he is turned to graſe &amp; feede like
an oxe with the beaſts in the wilderneſſe. This
was to ſhewe that God maketh no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the wicked then of beaſts, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the holy Ghoſt calleth them often by the
name of beaſts: ſhewing how that ſinne and
pleaſure make men like beaſts: when they
haue abuſed their wits often, and peruerted
their reaſon, at laſt God taketh their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
from them, and they become like
beaſts, lothſome to themſelues and others:
many ſuch beaſts wee haue ſtill like Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,
who were fitter to liue in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart
among lions, where they might not anoy
others, then in townes amongſt men, where
they infect more then the plague. Thus if you
haue not conſidered the beaſtlines of ſinne,
looke vpon Nabuchadnezzar like a beaſt. If
you would ſee the guilt of it,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 12.</note> looke vpon
wandering Cain. If thou wouldeſt ſee the
frenſie of it,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 16. 14</note> looke vpon frantike Saul. If thou
wouldeſt ſee the feare of it, looke vpon trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Baltazar.<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 6.</note> If thou wilt ſee the ſhame of
it,<note place="margin">Heſt. 7. 10.</note> look vpon Haman, hanging vpon his own
gallowes. If thou wilt ſee the end of it, looke
vpon the Glutton frying in hell.<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 23.</note> Theſe are
the pictures of ſinne, which GOD hath ſet
for a terror before vs:<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note> like the piller of ſalt,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17992:213"/>
or Achans Sepulchre to ſpeake to vs.<note place="margin">Ioſua. 7. 26.</note> Take
heed by thoſe, when I haue warned you, as I
warned them, I will puniſh you, as I puniſhed
them. This is the Epitaph, as it were, which
God ingraueth vpon Nabuchadnezzars Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre:</p>
            <p>Be thou an example to Kings and Rulers,
for all the children of pride, to beware how
they ſet themſelues agaynst him who aduaunced
them.</p>
            <p>Thus hee which ſets vp, can pull downe.
Did not I ſende thee dreames to warne thee?
Did not I ſende a Prophet to warne thee? If
eyther of them woulde haue ſerued, thou
mighteſt haue ruled ſtill, and walked in thy
galleries, and feaſted in thy pallace, and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon thy throane, and dyed a King: but
now thy kingdome is departed from thee.
Who would bee like Nabuchadnezzar, now
he is like a beaſt? If this heathen was thus
challenged for his warning, which had heard
but one Prophet, we may tremble to thinke
what wee ſhall anſwere for our warnings,
which haue been threatned as often as the
Iſraelites, and yet prouoked the Lord while
he ſerueth vs, like thoſe which curſe the ſunne
while it ſhineth vpon them.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you ſeene the fall of pride. Euen
now he ſayd, <hi>Is not this great Babel?</hi> Now he
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17992:213"/>
may ſay: Is not this vnhappie Babel? euen
he ſayd, <hi>which I haue built by the might of my
power:</hi> and now hee may ſay, which I haue
built by the vanitie of my pride: euen now he
ſayd, <hi>for the honour of my maieſtie:</hi> now hee
may ſay, for the ruine of my kingdome: yet
after this he roſe againe, and came to himſelf,
and receiued his kingdome, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him which puniſhed him ſo: but
the time will preuent me to ſpeak
of his reſtitution, therefore
here I ende.</p>

firſt Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
was humbled, as
God humbleth his

humbleth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that although
he had more honour than he had before, yet

now with heart and mouth honoureth none
but God. His pride and his fall Daniel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but when hee came to his reſtitution, hee
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:17992:215"/>
makes Nabuchadnezzar to ſpeake himſelfe,
and giue thankes in his owne perſon, like a
witneſſe brought in to teſtifie the trueth of
this wonderfull ſtorie.</p>
            <p>When the Prophet had ſhewed how this
King vaunted, and how he was debaſed for it,
preſently after he had ſpoken it, he calles in as
it were the King himſelfe, to witneſſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and declare how he was raiſed agayne,
like a man which hauing receiued grace from
a Prince or great perſon, is brought in before

at the firſt view, that is, Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars
Reſtitution, and his thankfulneſſe in his

hee was reſtored in theſe wordes, <hi>I Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
lift vp mine eyes to heauen, and

thankfulnes, firſt he extolleth Gods power,

and raiſing him agayne: then he comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
Gods iuſtice and trueth, which deſerues to be

            <p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:17992:215"/>
               <hi>At the end of theſe dayes.</hi> As Daniel noted
the time of his pride, when hee walked in his
pallace, to ſhewe how pride growes out of
buildings, and wealth, and apparell, and ſuch
rootes: ſo he noteth the time of his fall, while
the wordes were in his mouth, to ſhewe that
he was puniſhed for his pride and ignorance,
that he might knowe where to begin his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion,
and abate his pride, and when he had
taken away the cauſe, then God would take
away the puniſhment: ſo likewiſe he noteth
the time of his Reſtitution, <hi>At the ende of
theſe dayes,</hi> that is, after ſeauen yeares were
expired; to ſhewe how long the ſickneſſe of
pride is in curing, and to ſhewe how euerie
thing was fulfilled which was propheſied, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the poynt of time, for it was tolde him
by Daniel that he ſhould be like a beaſt ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
yeares, therefore Nabuchadnezzar is prompt
as it were to confeſſe the trueth, and ſayth as
the Prophet ſayth, <hi>At the ende of theſe dayes,</hi>
that is, at the ende of ſeauen yeares, I Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
was reſtored to my kingdome,
as Daniel tolde me. Yet another note is ſet
vpon this beaſt, leaſt wee ſhould thinke that
God only regarded the ſeaſon, and thinke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
yeares puniſhment enough for ſuch a
ſinne: He ſaith not barely, that his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and honour were reſtored vnto him,
when ſeuen yeares were ended: but that they
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:17992:216"/>
were reſtored vnto him when hee began to
lift vp his eyes vnto heauen: to ſhewe that
this bleſſing came from aboue, and that hee
which had humbled him, had reſtored him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
as if hee ſhould ſaye to all that are caſt
down with ſickneſſe, or pouertie, or infamie,
or any trouble whatſoeuer in bodie or minde,
hee which hath humbled you will raiſe you,
as hee hath done mee, but you muſt looke
vp vnto heauen, and lift vp your hearts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and then your vnderſtanding, and
comfort, and wealth, and pleaſure, &amp; health,
and libertie, and good name, and all ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
vnto you agayne: like Iobs ſheepe, and
cammels, and oxen, in greater number than
he had before, as all the bleſſings of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Nabuchadnezzar when he looked
vp to heauen: ſo they ſhall come backe like
a riuer vpon you, when your eyes can goe by
theſe vanities, and looke vpon him which
lookes vpon you, or els ſeuen and ſeuen yeres
ſhall paſſe ouer you, and you ſhall be neuer
the better, but worſe and worſe; like Saul
which was vexed more and more, till he had
killed himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the Iewes looked vp to the
braſen Serpent, which was a figure of Chriſt,
when they would bee healed, Numb. 21. 8:
ſo all that woulde recouer that which they
haue loſt, or obtaine that which they want,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:17992:216"/>
Nabuchadnezzar doth teach them here to
lift vp their eyes to heauen, from whence
(sayth Chriſt) commeth euerie bleſſing of
man. <hi>At the end of theſe dayes, I Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
lifte vp mine eyes, &amp;c.</hi> Like a man
which is wakened out of a long traunce, now
he began to ſtirre and lift vp his eyes: when
the heart is once lift vp, it wil lifte vp the eyes,
and the hand and voice, and all to heauen: he
which neuer looked vp to heauen ſo long as
his comfort was vpon the earth; nowe his
minde is changed, his lookes, and ieſtures, &amp;
ſpeeches, and all are chaunged with it: As
though God would ſhew a viſible difference
betweene the ſpirituall and the carnall, euen
in their lookes and ieſtures: as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a childe and an olde man. The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
mindes are heauenly, and looke vp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their ioy is aboue. The carnall mindes
are earthly, and looke downe like beaſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their treaſure is belowe.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note> As the ſerpent
grouels vpon the ground, ſo doth the ſerpents
ſeede, and hath not ſo much as the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of grace.</p>
            <p>Therefore by lifting vp his eyes to heauen,
is ſignified that the time was come, which
the Lord had ſet downe, that he ſhould bee
like a beaſt, vntill he had learned that leſſon,
That the moſt high beareth rule ouer the ſons
of men. Therfore Nabuchadnezzar ſheweth
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:17992:217"/>
that hee had learned his leſſon, for he looked
not vp to heauen to beholde the Sunne, the
moone or the ſtarres, like an Aſtronomer, but
thinking howe hee had ſet himſelfe againſt
Heauen, from whence came all his honour,
in a godly ſhame &amp; holy anger, toward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he turnes his face from earth to heauen,
to magnifie him, which had humbled him;
that ſo contemneth him, which aduanced
him. Nowe hee talkes no more of his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
nor his power, nor his Maieſtie, though
it be greater then it was, but hee looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his owne pallace, to another Pallace,
from whence that terrible voyce came down
vnto him, <hi>Thy kingdome is departed from thee.</hi>
Which expreſſeth his contrite hearte, and
wounded ſpirit, howe many paſſions batled
within, as if hee ſhould chide himſelfe, and
ſaye: Vnthankefull man, my power euer
deſcended from aboue, and I euer looked
vpon the earth, and mine honour came
downe from heauen, and I neuer lifte vp
mine eyes before: But now ſayth he, goe vp
my voyce, and my handes, and my eyes, how
long will ye pore vpon the earth like a beaſt?
ſo he lifted vp his eyes vnto heauen. After hee
had lifted vp his eyes, he beginneth to pray, &amp;
praiſe, and giue thanks to God, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he did not onely lifte vp his eyes, but
his heart too: for vnleſſe we can ſay with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:17992:217"/>
               <hi>I lift vp my hart.</hi> Pſal. 25. 1. it is in vain to
lift vp eies, or hands, or voice, as the hypocrits
doe, becauſe he which is a ſpirite, will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
in ſpirite. Iohn 4. Therefore Marie
ſayth, <hi>My heart doth magnifie the Lord.</hi> Luke
11. 46. As for the Infidels and Idolaters, they
haue no heartie ſeruice, but their religion is
like an occupation, which is done with the
body. For when we reade of the ſacrifice or
prayers of the Idolaters and Infidels, we doe
not find, that they lifte vp their hearts to their
Idols, but their hands, or their eyes, or their
voyce, as the Baalites roared to Baal, 1. King.
18. 28. and the Marriners cryed to their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods,
1. Ionas. 5. and the Epheſians ſhowted
to Diana, Act. 19. 28. But the lifting vp of the
heart is the holy ſeruice, and alway appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
vnto God, which ſaith, <hi>My ſonne, giue me
thy heart.</hi> Pro. 23. 26. Therefore now Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
lifts vp his heart to God, ſhewing
that he had learned that leſſon which GOD
gaue him 7. years to ſtudy, that <hi>The moſt high
beareth rule ouer the ſonnes of men, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God thinkes the time long enough:
&amp; as he reformed the ground after the flood,
with fruit, and hearbes, and flowers agayne;
ſo hee reformeth Nabuchadnezzar with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and beauty, and honour againe.
As when he repented himſelfe, and ſayd, I wil
drown the earth no more, Gen. 8. 21. ſo I wil
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:17992:218"/>
chaſe Nabuchadnezzar no more: nowe he
knowes a king aboue him, he ſhall bee king
againe nowe he ſeekes my honour, I wil giue
him honour; now he magnifieth him which
debaſed him, I will returne to exalt him. So
the voyce which thundred from heauen, <hi>Thy
kingdome is departed from thee:</hi> ſounds again,
<hi>Thy kingdome is reſtored to thee.</hi> For it was
not tolde that he ſhould be like a beaſt vntill
he dyed, but <hi>vntill he knew that the moſt high
beareth rule ouer the ſonnes of men.</hi> Therefore
when he knew this, nothing could ſtay him
from his kingdome, no more then they could
ſtay him in it before. Thus the diſpleaſure of
God is but an <hi>interim,</hi> vntill we knowe ſome
thing that we ſhould know, and then Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
ſhalbe king againe, then the ſick
man ſhalbe whole againe, then the bondman
ſhall be free againe, then the poore man ſhall
be rich againe. His mercies are called euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
becauſe they endure for euer. Pſal. 136.
1, 2. But his anger is compared to the clouds,
becauſe it laſteth but a ſeaſon, whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
hee loueth to the ende, but whome hee
ſcourgeth hee ſcourgeth to repent; as Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kias
was ſicke vntill hee wepte, Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
was baniſhed but vntill hee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Now the firſt cure of the Kings reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was of his mind, <hi>Mine vnderſtanding</hi> (ſaith
Nabuchadnezzar) <hi>was reſtored vnto me.</hi> To
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:17992:218"/>
ſhewe what an ineſtimable gift our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and reaſon is, whereby wee differ
from beaſts, for which we cannot be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough, therefore he records it twiſe, as
though his heart did flowe with gladnes, and
his tongue could not chooſe but ſpeak often
of it, as a man thinketh and ſpeaketh of that
which he loueth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mine vnderstanding was reſtored vnto me,
&amp;c.</hi> That which was firſt taken away, was
firſt reſtored againe, which ſo ſoone as it was
gone, he was counted a man no more, but a
beaſt. As Dauid ſayth, Like Horſe and Mule
which haue no vnderſtanding. Pſalme 32. 9.
counting them which are voide of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to better then horſe and mule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they which haue loſt their vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
at the Tauerns, as many here haue done ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
&amp; they which vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not yet what
is the booke of God, are but horſe and mule,
though they beare the viſors of men.</p>
            <p>After he had ſayd, <hi>Mine vnderſtanding was
restored to me,</hi> he annexeth, <hi>Mine honour was
restored to me,</hi> ſo he grew to a king againe: as
he was wont to put on one roabe after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when hee was a King, ſo when GOD
would make him a king againe, firſt hee puts
vpon him the roabe of vnderſtanding as it
were the foundation of a king, like the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ſpirit which came vpon Saul, the firſt
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:17992:219"/>
of Samuel 10. 9. And when he had a princes
heart, then GOD gaue him a Princes power,
and proclaymed like a voyce from Heauen,
<hi>Nabuchadnezzar king of Babel:</hi> ſo gloriouſly
he roſe againe like the Sunne, with a triumph
of his reſtitution, &amp; welcome of his ſubiects,
like the ſhoute which went before Salomon.
1. King. 1. 34. One would think when Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
was a King, GOD would neuer
haue made him like a beaſt, nor after made
him again a king: for who would ſuffer a beaſt
to rule ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing ſuch ſtomackes are in
men, that they will hardly endure any rulers.
Therefore it is ſtrange that theſe men would
ſuffer one to rule ouer them that had been 7.
yeeres like a beaſt; it is euen as if one had lien
7. yeres in the graue, and after come to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
his houſe and goods from them which
haue it in poſſeſſion, and count it their owne:
I think ſuch a one ſhould haue ſo cold a ſuite,
that vnles it were ſome fewe that loued him,
while hee liued hee might goe againe to his
graue for a houſe to dwel in: ſo no body loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
now for Nabuchadnezzar to come out
of the wildernes, hee was the vnlikelyeſt man
in the world to bee King after ſuch a change:
but ſee what God can doe, though all bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; he which made a king like a beaſt,
rayſed a king of a beaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mine vnderſtanding</hi> (ſayth Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17992:219"/>
               <hi>was restored to me,</hi> and more than that,
<hi>mine honour was augmented,</hi> more than it was
when I was ſo proud of it. As God turned his
heart, ſo hee turned the hearts of his Nobles
and people, that they receiued him for their
King againe, and ſought vnto him, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
him, for all the diſgrace which they
had ſeene, which made them before to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
him like a beaſt.</p>
            <p>Here a wiſe man may ſtudie and wonder
like Eliſha when his maſter was rapt to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
For as though a ſnuffe had beene taken
from the ground, and ſet in the candleſtick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ſhined brighter than it did before:
So Nabuchadnezzar was raiſed from the
duſt, and ſet in the throan: euen now no man
cared for him, and nowe no man dare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
him: that which Salomon ſayth in
Prou. 16. 17. <hi>When the wayes of a man pleaſe
the Lord, he will make all his enemies at peace
with him:</hi> ſo when Nabuchadnezzar pleaſed
the Lord God gaue him grace with men, &amp;
his glorie was augmented. <hi>My glory was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
&amp;c.</hi> that is, he receiued not onely his
kingdome, and power, and honour agayne,
but hee receiued vſury of them. For his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
yeers baniſhment, they had been put out
ſeuen yeeres to the Banke, for him to receiue
more whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came again, ſo when he ſought
his owne honour, honour departed from him,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:17992:220"/>
his pallace could not holde it, his treaſures
could not redeeme it, his gard could not ſtay
it, but pride chaſed it away, whileſt he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after it. But when he ſought Gods honor,
and cared not for his owne, honour was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
according to that, <hi>I will honour them
that honour me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What would Nabuchadnezzar ſay to our
Nabuchadnezzars (if hee were liuing) which
thinke it agaynſt their honor to ſeeke Chriſts
honour, and that if his kingdome went vp,
their kingdome ſhould go down, like Herod
which thought hee coulde not bee King, if
Chriſt ſhould raigne; and the Phariſies, which
thought they ſhoulde bee deſpiſed if Chriſt
were regarded.</p>
            <p>If Nabuchadnezzars honour came vnto
him for the honour which he gaue to GOD:
how long will their honour laſt, which eate
and drinke, giue and take, ſet vp and pull
downe, and doe all that they doe to honour
themſelues? as Nabuchadnezzar built Babel
vntill that voyce came thundering from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<hi>Thy kingdome is departed from thee, thy</hi>
office is departed from thee, thy life is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from thee. Some haue exalted themſelues
like Nabuchadnezzar, and are not fallen yet:
ſome mounted vp haue fallen low, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
like Balaam, but they are not yet at the
ground: they haue ruled like beaſts, longer
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:17992:220"/>
then Nabuchadnezzar, and yet looke not vp
to heauen, that they may bee changed. Thus
Nabuchadnezzar is welcome to his throne
againe.</p>
            <p>Now he hath receiued grace, let vs examine
his thankfulnes. If you marke how euery thing
comes in his order, you ſhall ſee a marueilous
conſequence obſerued both in his Fall &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
When he looked vpon his pallace,
then he waxed proud; when he waxed proud,
then God threatned him; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
then God baniſhed him; when hee was
baniſhed, then he lift vp his eyes to heauen;
when he lift vp his eyes to heauen, his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
came vnto him; when his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
came vnto him, then he gaue thanks
to God: ſhewing vs the vſe of our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
why God hath giuen reaſon vnto men,
viz. to ſerue him and praiſe him vpon earth: as
Nabuchadnezzar worſhipped God ſo ſoone
as he came to vnderſtanding; ſo, ſo ſoone as
we come to yeres of diſcretion, and begin to
vnderſtand, we ſhould begin a new life, and
ſerue him whom all creatures doe ſerue with
vs, or elſe our vnderſtanding is vaine, and wee
are beaſts ſtill: for by this Nabuchadnezzar
ſhewes that hee had vnderſtanding, and was
like a man, becauſe hee gaue praiſe to God,
&amp; was moued in heart to worſhip him which
made him, according to that definition that
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:17992:221"/>
Dauid maketh of vnderſtanding, in the tenth
verſe of the one hundred and eleuenth Pſalm.
<hi>They which obſerue them haue a good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi>
they which obſerue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
haue a good vnderſtanding;
not they which ſpeake of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor they which write of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
nor they which preach of the
Commaundements, but they which keepe
the Commaundements, haue a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
The reſt haue a falſe vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a vaine vnderſtanding, an vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
like that of the Scribes &amp; Phariſies which
was enough to condemne them, but not to
ſaue them.</p>
            <p>By this euery man ſhould trie his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
for ſo ſoone as vnderſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to him as it came to Nabuchadnezzar,
it will extort praier and obedience from him,
whether hee will or no: therefore our Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars
are beaſts ſtill, for this is no part
of their vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>But he which can go beyond all in ſhifts &amp;
policie, is counted the wiſeſt man in Court &amp;
Citie. Oh, if Machauil had liued in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
what a Monarch ſhould be be? to what
honour, and wealth, and power, and credite,
might he haue riſen vnto in ſhort time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had been a Lawyer, or a Courtier, or a
Prelate? me thinkes I ſee how many fingers
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:17992:221"/>
would poynt at him in the ſtreetes, as they
doe at his apes, and ſay, there goeth a deepe
fellowe, he hath more wit in his little finger
then the reſt in their whole bodie. You talke
of Sectaries how faſt they growe, and how
faſt they breed; I warrant you where any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary
hath one ſonne, Machauil hath a ſcore,
and thoſe not the brats, but the fatlings of the
Land, which if they had but a dram of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for an ounce of their policie, they might
goe like Saints among men. But wee ſpeake
to the belly that hath no eares.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee the parts of this kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
that we may ſee how his thankfulnes
did anſwere to his ſinne: before he had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
God of his honor: now, as though hee
came to make reſtitution, he brings praiſe, &amp;
thankes and glorie in his mouth. Firſt, he ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uanceth
Gods power, and ſaith, that <hi>his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is an euerlasting kingdome:</hi> in which
wordes he confeſſeth that God was aboue
him, becauſe that his kingdome was not an
euerlaſting Kingdome, but a momentanie
Kingdome, like a ſparke which riſeth from the
fire, and falleth to the fire againe. Therefore
he ſheweth what a foole he was to vaunt of
his Kingdome, as though it were like Gods
Kingdome, which laſteth for euer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hee magnifieth the power of
God, and ſayth, that <hi>God doth what he listeth
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:17992:222"/>
both in heauen and in earth,</hi> and nothing can
hinder him, or ſay vnto him, <hi>what doest thou?</hi>
Vnder which words, he confeſieth againe,
that God was aboue him, becauſe hee could
not raigne as he liſted, for when hee thought
to liue at his pleaſure, hee was thruſt out at
doores, and God ſaid not to him, what doeſt
thou? but <hi>Thy kingdome ſhall depart from thee:</hi>
therefore he ſheweth what a foole he was to
vaunt of his power, as though it had beene
like Gods power, which cannot bee chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
            <p>Thirdly hee commendeth the iuſtice of
God, and ſaith, that his workes were all truth,
and his waies were all iudgement. Vnder
which words, he confeſſeth againe, that God
was aboue him: for his waies were all errors,
and his workes were all ſinnes, as the ende
prooued. Therefore he ſhewes what a foole
he was, to vaunt of his workes, as though they
had been like Gods workes, which cannot
be blamed: therefore hee concludes, <hi>I Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
praiſe, and extoll, and magnifie
the King of heauen.</hi> When hee lighted vpon
the right ſtring, marke how he harpes vpon
it, and doubles it, and trebles it, like a bonde
which is ratified with many wordes of like
ſenſe; ſo he ratifieth his bonde to God with
many words of like meaning, <hi>I will praiſe and
extoll and magnifie the King of Heauen:</hi> as if
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17992:222"/>
hee would praiſe him, and more than prayſe
him. They which loue with the heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
from the bottome, praiſe &amp; praiſe, praie
and pray, giue and giue, ſerue and ſerue, that
is, when they haue ſerued him, they are ready
to ſerue him againe.</p>
            <p>Here is a glaſſe for al the children of pride.
Firſt looke vpon Nabuchadnezzar, you that
are great men like Nabuchadnezzar. For thus
will GOD make his example of great men,
becauſe they ſhould bee examples to others.
Many wicked men died in Iurie, and ſcarſe a
man was by to ſee their ende; but Herode
was ſtriken before the people, that all might
ſee, becauſe hee was a wicked King. There
were many in Babel as proud as Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
but none but Nabuchadnezzar was
made like a beaſt, becauſe hee was a proud
King: ſo God doth ſtomacke ſinne in thoſe
that beare his owne perſon. As Princes vſe to
picke thoſe that are principall and chiefe in
rebellion to make them examples of terrour
to others, which were ringleaders in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
ſo God doth bend his ſhot againſt the
captaines of his enemies, like the King of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,
which charged his ſouldiers, that they
ſhoulde fight with none but againſt Achab
the King, as it is written in the ſecond Booke
of Chronicles, the eighteenth chapter and
thirtieth verſe. For as Salomon ſaith in the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:17992:223"/>
nineteenth Chapter of his Prouerbes and fiue
and twentieth verſe, <hi>Strike the ſtrong, and
the rest will beware:</hi> ſo Iuſtice ſhewed vpon
a Ruler, or great perſonage, dooth terrifie
manie.</p>
            <p>If we could ſee but one of our Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars
ſo degraded, it would make all the
reſt better in their office, &amp; thinke when they
ſit in their maieſties, as Queene Heſter did,
that their power is giuen them for the
Church and not againſt the Church.</p>
            <p>Paul being before Feſtus and Agrippa, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
not vnto the King Agrippa, more
wealth, or more honor, or more riches, but
more religion, which is the greateſt want of
Princes and Magiſtrates. They ſitte in Gods
chayre, and are called Gods, but are not like
God, but like Mammon, except their names
and their crownes: peraduenture a Dauid, or
a Salomon, or a Ioſua, that is, a few that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
whoſe perſon they beare: the reſt are
like Saul, and Herod, and Nabuchadnezzar,
which know not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome their kingdomes
come. Nabuchadnezzar built for his honour,
and they built for their honour: Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
gathered for his wealth, and they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their welth: Nabuchadnezzar ſought
after his pleaſure, and they ſeeke after their
pleaſure: Nabuchadnezzar vaunted of his
power, and they vaunt of their power: what
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:17992:223"/>
did Nabuchadnezzar which they do not, but
repent which they doe not? I cannot wiſh
them beaſtes to doe them good, like Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,
becauſe it is a queſtion, whether
they are worſe than beaſts already, but if we
could driue them out of their pallaces to liue
like beaſts in the wilderneſſe, it were a good
riddance, for there they ſhoulde doe leſſe
harme: where now their proude hornes doe
gore others, &amp; their hoof is vp to ſtrike euery
one that is better than themſelues, which
maketh many flie into the wilderneſſe, from
their houſe, and church, and calling, leſt they
ſhould fall into their clutches: The Lorde
which reſtored Nabuchadnezzar from the
likeneſſe of a beaſt, reſtore them to the likenes
of men, or els fright them like Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
to runne from their roomes, that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may haue their places.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee Nabuchadnezzar was made
like a beaſt that he might die like a man, for
he could neuer learne from whence his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
came, vntill he had beene apprentice
ſeuen yeares vnto the croſſe, and when hee
perceiued who took his kingdome from him,
then he perceiued alſo who gaue his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to him, and learned his thankefulneſſe
in the wilderneſſe, when al the bleſſings were
gone, which he ſhould haue been thankfull
for, he thought that God was no body, vntill
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:17992:224"/>
he became like no body himſelfe, and then
who but God, no power but of him, no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
but from him, his firſt honor came from
God, as well as his laſt: but when he was like
a beaſt which knew not his owner, like a babe
which knewe not his Father, like an Image
which knowes not his maker, but nowe hee
knoweth from whom Kings raigne, and hath
learned to ſay thy Kingdome, as well as my
Kingdome, and is like the elders in the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which caſt downe their crownes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lambe.</p>
            <p>Such a ſchoolemaſter is affliction, to teach
that, which Prophets and Angels cannot
teach. For the Prophet and his dreame had
tolde him as much before, yet he could neuer
ſay, the Lord hath giuen, before he did ſee
how the Lord had taken: they ſay a friend is
neuer knowne before hee bee loſt: ſo when
God fled, then Nabuchadnezzar followed:
but when God called, then Nabuchadnezzar
contemned; when he hath all things he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull,
and when he hath nothing hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to be thankefull.</p>
            <p>So wee muſt learne Gods loue out of his
wrath, and ſpel his goodnes out of his iuſtice:
therefore we preach iudgement vnto you, to
make you flie vnto mercie, wee denounce the
law againſt you, to make you loue the goſpel,
we ſhew you hell, to make you ſeeke heauen.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17992:224"/>
Becauſe we are all like Pharaoh his ſorcerers,
though we receiue neuer ſo much, yet we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſay, the finger of GOD hath done this:
but when he begins to plague vs, then we cry
the finger of God hath done this: therefore
if we will not be inuited, it is good to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled:
to conclude, he which made Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
a King when he was like a beaſt,
is hee which makes them rich which were
poore, and he which makes them free which
were bounden, and hee which makes them
beloued which were hated, and hee which
makes them wiſe, which were rude, and hee
which makes them whole which were ſicke:
they muſt ſtaie a time, ſeuen dayes, or ſeuen
weekes, or ſeuen moneths, or ſeuen yeares,
as Nabuchadnezzar did, and when they are
ready for it, it will come ſodainly, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
came to refresh Chriſt ſo ſoone as he was
hungry: yet a little while, a little longer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is on foote, and that goodneſſe which is
comming, will come, as the ſunne which was
riſing is riſen: for as Nabuchadnezzar ſaide,
mine honor was reſtored to mee, ſo I am ſure
many here may ſay, my right was reſtored to
mee, my libertie was reſtored to mee, my
health was reſtored to mee, my good
name was reſtored to me, in leſſe time than
Nabuchadnezzars honour was, and what
then? <hi>Therefore I Nabuchadnezzar, prayſe,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:17992:225"/>
and extoll, and magnifie the King of heauen,
whoſe workes are all trueth, and his waies iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thoſe that walke in pride, hee is able
to abaſe.</hi> This is the concluſion of all Gods
benefites, they which doe not prayſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
the King of heauen are worſe than Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all which ſayd in their harts,
like Nabuchadnezzar: is not this the houſe
which I haue built, is not this the land which
I haue purchaſed, is not this the monie which
I haue gathered, are not theſe the children
which I haue be gotten, ſay now with Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
for all, I praiſe, and extoll, and
magnifie the King of heauen, which can take
all againe, as hee did from Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue ſeen pride and humilitie,
one pulling Nabuchadnezzar out of his
throne, the other lifting him vnto his throne,
whereby they which ſtand may take heed leſt
they fall; and they which are fallen,
may learne to riſe
againe.</p>

king counteth her his enemie, &amp; all that take
her part: ſhe hath been ſuſpected euer ſince
the Angels rebelled in heauen,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and Adam
ſought to bee equal with God. therfore his
maieſtie hath a ſtich againſt her, as Salomon
had to Shemei, &amp; would not haue her fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
come in his court,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 2. 36</note> vnleſſe they hold
downe their mace, ſtoope when they enter.
But if you can get in with humilitie, and
weare the colours of lowlines, then you may
goe boldly, and ſtand in the Kings ſight, and
ſtep to his chamber of preſence, and put vp
your petitions, and come to honor. For humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
is very gracious with him, and ſo neere
of his counſell, that as Dauid and Salomon
ſay,<note place="margin">Pro. 3. 32.</note> he committeth all his ſecrets to her. This
is Peters meaning,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note> that the humble ſhall
finde grace with God and men: as wee read
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17992:226"/>
of Dauid and Iohn Baptiſt, according to that
in the firſt Pſal. verſ. 4. <hi>All things which hee
doth ſhall proſper:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 4.</note> but the proude ſhall bee
troubled and croſſed, and when they would
doe beſt they ſhall doe worſt, when they
would grace themſelues, they ſhall ſhame
themſelues: and God will be to them like the
ſpirit of Saul which tormented him whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
hee went. This ſentence is repeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note place="margin">Iames. 1. 6.</note>
Iames 4. 6. the like ſentence to this is
in Prouerbes 3. 34.<note place="margin">Pro. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34.</note> where he ſayth, <hi>with the
Scornefull he ſcorneth:</hi> but he giueth grace to
the humble: the like ſentence is againe in the
16. of Prouerbs 18. where he ſayth,<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 18.</note> Pryde
goeth before deſtruction:<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 33.</note> and in the 15. of
Prou. 33. before honour goeth humilitie.<note place="margin">Pro. 29. 23.</note> The
like ſentence is againe in the 29. of the Prou.
verſ. 23. where he ſaith, the pryde of man ſhall
bring him lowe, but the humble in ſpirit ſhall
enioy glorie.</p>
            <p>The like ſentence is againe in the firſt of
Luke. 46 where the Virgin ſings,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 46.</note> He hath put
downe the mightie from their ſeate, and hath
exalted the humble and meeke; that as it
were by two or three witneſſes, pryde might
bee condemned, and humilitie acquited.
One is to GOD like Iacob,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 13.</note> of whom hee
ſayth;<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 3.</note> Iacob haue I loued: the other is to
God like Eſau,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 8.</note> of whom he ſayth, Eſau haue
I hated. Iacob loued Eſau becauſe hee loued
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:17992:227"/>
veniſon, but Rebecca loued Iacob becauſe
he was loued of God. So the proud are in the
Kings Court, becauſe they ſeeke honour, but
the humble are in Gods court, becauſe they
contemne honour: as he ſayth in the third of
the Prouer. ver. 34. <hi>with the froward he will
ſhew himſelfe froward:</hi> So he threatneth here
that with the proude, he will ſhewe himſelfe
proud; that is, if they chalenge, he wil defend:
if they will prouoke him, he will reſiſt them:
if they will clime higher then their compaſſe,
he will pull them lower then their will.</p>
            <p>Peter ſpeaks of the proud, as if they did cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
God, like champions, &amp; prouoke him
like rebels, that vnles he did reſiſt them, they
would goe about to depriue him of his rule,<note place="margin">Num. 16. 2</note>
as Corah, Dathan, and Abiram vndermined
Moſes. For ſo the proud man ſayth, I will be
like the higheſt,<note place="margin">Eſai. 14.</note> and if he could, aboue the
higheſt too. This is the creature which was
taken out of the duſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> and ſo ſoone as he was
made, he oppoſeth himſelfe againſt that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
which the Angels adore, the throanes
worſhip, the diuels feare, and the heauens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.
How many ſins are in this ſinfull world,
and yet as Salomon ſayth of the good wife,
Prou. 31. 29. Many daughters haue done ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 29.</note>
but thou ſurmounteſt them all. So I
may ſay of pryde, many ſinnes haue done
wickedly, but thou ſurmounteſt them all: for
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17992:227"/>
the wrathfull man, the prodigall man, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious
man, the ſurfeting man, the ſlothfull
man, is rather an enemy to himſelfe then to
God. The enuious man, the couetous man,
the deceiptful man, the vngrateful man, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an enemy to men then to God. but the
proud man ſets himſelf againſt God, becauſe
he doth againſt his lawes, he maketh himſelfe
equall with God, becauſe he doth all without
God and craues no helpe of him: he exalteth
himſelfe aboue God, becauſe he will haue his
owne wil, though it be contrary to Gods wil.
As the humble man ſaith;<note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 1</note> 
               <hi>Not vnto vs Lord,
not vnto vs, but thy name giue the glorie.</hi>
Pſal. 115. 1. ſo the proud man ſaith, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, not vnto him, but vnto vs giue the
glorie: like vnto Herod, which tooke the
name of God, and was honored of all but
the wormes, and they ſhewed that he was not
a God but a man,<note place="margin">Acts 12. 21.</note> Actes 12. 21. Therefore the
proud men may be called Gods enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as the couetous pull riches from men,
ſo the proud pull honor from God. Beſide the
proud man hath no cauſe to be proud, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinners haue, the couetous for riches, the
ambitious for honor, the voluptuous for ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the enuious for wrong, the ſlothful for
eaſe; but the proud man hath no cauſe to
be proud, but pride it ſelfe, which ſaith like
Pharaoh, <hi>I will not obey,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. Therefore
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:17992:228"/>
God is ſpecially ſaid to reſiſt the proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the proud reſiſt him. Heere is heauen
againſt earth, the creator againſt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the father againſt the ſonne, the Lord
againſt the ſeruant, the Prince againſt the
ſubiect, who is like to winne the fielde? <hi>If the
Lord iustifie</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>who ſhall condemne?</hi>
ſo if the Lord reſiſt, who ſhall defend? If his
lawe come with thunder and lightning and
tempeſt, with what terrour will hee come
himſelfe? It was but a brag, when the king of
Iuda proclaimed warre againſt the king of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
&amp; ſaid,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>No man ſhall deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of my

ſhall deliuer them out of my hands:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> therefore
the author to the Hebrews ſaith, It is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing to fall into the hands of God, for hee
euer ouercommeth. Therefore when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
perceiued that God fought againſt
them,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 14. 9</note> they cryed, <hi>Wee will fle, wee will flie,
for God ſighteth againſt vs,</hi> Exod. 14. 25. So
the proud may cry, I will flie, I will flie, for
God fighteth againſt vs. When the king of
Iuda proclaimed warre againſt the king of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
the king of Iſrael returned anſwere, that
the thiſtle rebelled againſt the cedar, 2. King.

a man againſt a man; how much rather may
the king of heauen anſwer this proud earth,
the thiſtle rebelleth againſt the Cedar?<note place="margin">1. Sa. 17. 2.</note> The
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:17992:228"/>
giant durſt chalenge but one of the hoſt of
Iſrael, but the Lord chalengeth all the hoſt of
pride: euen as hee giueth grace to all that are
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, ſo he reſiſteth all that are proud. It had
been too heauie for them, if he had ſayde, the
Lord doth not care for them, for Gods care
preſerueth vs, and our owne care doth but
trouble vs: but to ſay that the Lord doth reſiſt
them,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 7</note> is as if Michael ſhould denounce warre
with the dragon, till he hath caſt him into the
pit. This is a marſhall word, and comes with
armes and weapons vpon them: if a man
ſhould ſee a Lion come vpon him, would hee
not ſtart? if he ſhould ſee a Giant come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
him, would he not feare? But now the
Lorde of hoſts, the Lion of Iuda, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
the Giants, is vp in armes to reſiſt the
proud, and the proud feare not ſo much as the
humble. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth
grace to the humble:</hi> but the world reſiſteth
the humble, and giueth grace to the proud, as
Dauid notes.<note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 18.</note> Men will praiſe thee, not when
thou reformeſt thy ſelfe to God, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou
doeſt forme thy ſelfe to thy luſts: that is, they
which will be ſtrowters, ſhal not want flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
which will praiſe euery thing that they

thing that they weare, and ſay it becomes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

well to weare bellied dublets, that it becomes

them well to iet in their going, that it becoms
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel to ſweare in their talking. Now, when
they heare men ſooth them in their follies,
then think they, we haue nothing els to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vs, if men will praiſe vs for our vanities,
we will haue friends enough: ſo the humour
ſwelleth and thinkes with it ſelfe, if they will
looke vpon mee when, I doe ſet but a ſtout
face vpon it, how would they behold mee if
I were in apparell? if they doe ſo admire me
in ſilkes, how would they cap me and curſie
me, and worſhip me, if I were in veluets? if
I be ſo braue in plaine veluet, what if my vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
were pinct, or cut, or printed? So they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
for faſhions, as Lawyers do for delayes, &amp;
count that part naked which is not as gaudie
as the reſt, till all their bodie be couered ouer
with pride, as their mind is with folly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Dauid ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 6.</note> that pride is as a chaine vnto
them, that is, it goeth round about them like
a chaine, and makes them thinke that all men
loue them, and praiſe them, and admire them,
and worſhip them for their brauerie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Saul ſayd to Samuel, <hi>Honour me before
this people:</hi> ſo the proude man ſaith to his,
chaine and his ruffes, and his pinckes, and his
cuts, honour me before this people: all that,
he ſpeaketh, or doth, or weareth, is like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars
pallace,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note> which he built for his
honor. This is their work, ſo ſoone as they riſe,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:17992:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to put a Pedlars ſhop vpon theyr backes, and
colour their faces, and pricke their ruffes, and
friſle theyr hayre, and then their daies worke
is done, as though their office were to paint a
fayre Image euery morning, and at night to
blot it out agayn: from that day that pride is
borne in the heart of man, as the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were ſchooled to ſpeake as the King
would haue them,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 21. 8.</note> ſo their eyes, and feete, and
tongues are bound to ſpeake, and looke, and
walke, as the proud heart doth prompt them.
If GOD were in loue with faſhions, hee were
neuer better ſerued than in this age, for our
world is like a pageant, where euery mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
is better then himſelf.<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 6.</note> Once Chriſt ſaid,
that ſoft clothing is in Kings courts: but now
it is crept into euerie houſe: then the rich

the poore vnthrift iets as braue as the glutton,
with ſo many circumſtances about him, that
if yee could ſee how pride would walke her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
if ſhe did weare apparell, ſhe would
euen goe like manie in the ſtreetes: for ſhe
could not goe brauer, nor looke ſtouter, nor
mince finer, nor ſet on moe laces, nor make
larger cuts, nor carrie more trappings about
her, then our ruffians and wantons doe at this

if their bodies did chaunge formes ſo

that God might not knowe them, nay
they diſguiſe their bodies ſo, till they knowe
not themſelues: for the ſeruant goeth like his
maſter, the handmaide like her Miſtreſſe, the

like a man in the darke, which puts on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans coate for his owne, that is too
wide, or too ſide for his bodie: ſo their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
are ſo vnfit for their bodies, ſo vnmeete

cannot call them fitter, then the monſters of

in nature, as their attires are in faſhion,
that if they could ſee their apparell but with

it makes them like Apes and Puppets, and
Vices, they would fling away their attire, as
Dauid flung away Sauls armour:<note place="margin">1. Sa. 17. 39</note> and bee as
much aſhamed of their clothes,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 9.</note> as Adam was
of his nakedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Pride hath been the deuiſer of all theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
which now neither ſhame nor lawes
nor preaching can take away: therefore had
we not need to ſhew you, how God reſiſteth
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:17992:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this vice, that careth not for any elſe? Who
can tell how this weede groweth, ſeeing wee
haue nothing to be proud of, but more cauſe
to be aſhamed of our ſelues, and flie from the
face of God and man too,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 13.</note> then Adam our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had? we were earth, we are fleſh, and we
ſhall bee wormes meate: what cauſe hath
earth, or fleſh, or wormes meate to be proud?
We are borne in ſinne, we liue in miſerie, we
ſhal die in corruption: what cauſe hath ſinne,
or miſerie, or corruption to puffe vs, but to
humble vs? there is nothing good which we
are proud of, but a wiſe man is aſhamed of
the ſame things whereof we boaſt. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſee, how a gay coate, or a gold ring, or
a wrought handkerchiefe can braue a mans
minde, that he thinkes better of himſelfe that
day when he weareth them, then any day els,
and ſpeakes and walkes, and lookes after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faſhion then he did before?</p>
            <p>If ye could ſay as the diſciples ſaid, Luk. 10.
17. <hi>Lord the diuels are ſubiect vnto vs: Yet</hi>
(ſaith the Lord) <hi>glorie not in this:</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
things doe we glorie in, which we ſhould
not, if wee may not glorie in the gift of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?
Euen as a couetous man is greedie of an
halfpenie, and an enuious man is angrie for a

Therefore ſhall not God reſiſt them which

which ſitteth in the temple of God, and is
worſhipped as God.<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 4.</note> The Lords miniſters are
called ſeruants, and his miniſters are called

Chriſt as humbly as the ſhepheardes: but
for pride our men would goe like Abraham,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 6.</note>
and our women like Sara, as they would bee
called their children: but for pride Noble
men would come to Church, as well as the
people: but for pride Gentles would abide
reproofe, as well as ſeruants: but for pride
thou wouldeſt forgiue thy brother, and thy
brother would forgiue thee, and the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
ſhould haue no worke. But when thou
thinkeſt of theſe things, Pride comes in and
ſaith, Wilt thou goe like a hagler? wilt thou

follow Sermons? wilt thou take the checke?
wilt thou put vp wrong? what will men ſay?
that thou art a mome, and a cowarde, and a
foole, and no man will reuerence thee, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man will contemne &amp; abuſe thee. Thus
men are faine to put on the liuerie of pride, as
they put on the liueries of Noble men, to
ſhrowd and defend them from the contempt
of the world. Who hath not felt theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes
in his heart, which would not beleeue
that any pride was in him? Yet as Abſolon

in Princes, ambition in Nobles, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in Subiects, diſobedience in Children,
ſtubbornneſſe in ſeruants: name Pride, and

not GOD reſiſt pride, which hath ſowed ſo

luſteth after pride, though he haue many hart
breakes and pull downes, and many times no
countenance to ſhew it: yet if a little ſparke
be put to the tow, you ſhal ſee how ſoon this
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:17992:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flaxe will flame: therefore Salomon ſaith, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.
3. 10. that all the troubles that God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vpon a man, haue this purpoſe, to humble
him; as though al troubles were little inough
to humble pride, and that but for pride there
were no need almoſt of our troubles. For the
auoiding of this vice, GOD ſuffereth men to
fall into other vices, which men abhorre and
puniſh, as theft, and fornication, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
to make them aſhamed by theſe vices
which were not aſhamed of pride: this is an
argument, that of all ſinnes pride is the worſt,
becauſe God ſuffereth other ſinnes to come
and ſhame vs, leaſt we ſhould bee proude. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
Pride hath this propertie and ſleight
that it mixeth it ſelfe with our good workes,
and followeth vertue: As from the aſhes of a
Phoenix ariſeth another Phoenix, ſo of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
of our good workes ariſeth pride. When
the diuell cannot ſtay vs from a good worke,
then he laboureth by all meanes to make vs
proud of it, and ſo he ſtaineth our worke and
ſtealeth our reward. For though a man doe
neuer ſo much good, yet if he be proude of it
hee loſeth his reward, as the Phariſies did:
therefore the beſt and the wiſeſt, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
men had need to watch this vice: for if
they take not great heed, it will make them
proud of their wiſedome, and of their zeale,
and of their goodnes.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> Paul was almoſt puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed

vpon the beſt,<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> euen as the temper ſet vpon
Chriſt. Agayne, a man had need to take heede
of pride, for ſhe will not keepe counſaile: but
if he be proud, ſhe will tell that he is proud,

            <p>Thus God hath tied a iuſt puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to this

What a turne is this, that that which he tooke

doth hang him? that which he tooke to exalt

            <p>When the Phariſie ſaid he was not like the

he was not like the Publican indeede, becauſe
the Publican was better than he: So, when a
proude man thinkes beſt of himſelfe, then
God and men thinke worſt of him; all his
glorie is but like a vapour, which clymeth as
though it would goe vp to heauen, but when
it comes to a little height, it falles downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and neuer aſcends more. So Adam
thought that the faire apple ſhuld make him

thought that rebellion would make him a

            <p>Nimrod thought that Babel ſhould get him

Herod hoped when the people cryed
at his words, <hi>It is the voyce of God,</hi> that hee
ſhould be worſhipped euer after as God, but
God reſiſted his pride, and before he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his throane, the wormes ſo defaced
his pompe, that none which called him God

more paines to dreſſe themſelues, then they
doe all the day after, and pay deerer to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
one vice, than they neede to learne all

God reſiſteth their pride, and al that ſee them
though they cap and curtſie to them, yet they

Thus if their apparell condemne them
before men, how will it condemne them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
GOD? If ſinne did not blinde them,
would they ſo deceiue themſelues to take the
contrary way, and thinke that ſhould honor
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:17992:235"/>
them which diſgraceth other?<note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note> But as Balaam
was ſtopped &amp; knew not who ſtopped him:
ſo they are reſiſted, and know not who reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
them. Though they doe al to pleaſe, yet
they can pleaſe none: they pleaſe not God,
for God reſiſteth them; they pleaſe not the
humble, for the humble are contrarie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
they pleaſe not the proud, for the proud doe
enuie them which ſtriue to bee as proude as
they: they pleaſe not themſelues, becauſe
they cannot bee ſo proud and braue as they

their pride doth intitle him to them.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Gods battailes againſt the
proud. Heere Peter leaueth the proud with
this brand in their forehead, <hi>This is the man
whom God reſisteth:</hi> then hee turneth to the
lowly, and comforteth them: <hi>But he giueth
grace to the humble;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, you
are like Iohn the beloued Diſciple, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on Chriſts boſome: Iohn 13. 23. though
God reſiſt the proud, yet hee will not frowne
vpon you: but when he reſiſteth them, he wil
giue grace vnto you, as if hee ſhould ſay, the
proud are without grace, for God giueth not
grace vnto the proud, but to the humble, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that to Eſay 66. 2. <hi>To him will I
looke, euen to him that is poore &amp; of a contrite
heart, and trembleth at my wordes:</hi> therefore
<hi>Learne of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble &amp; meek:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:17992:235"/>
as though the humble and meeke were his
ſchollers. Therefore God muſt needes loue
the humble, becauſe they are like his ſonne:
they ſhall haue his beſt giftes, of which hee
ſayth, 2. Cor. 12. 9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient:</hi> as if
hee ſhould ſay, hee which hath giuen you his
grace, can he denie you any thing? as Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Hee which hath giuen vs his Sonne, will
he not giue vs all things with him?</hi> Therefore
grace may be called the gift of gifts, becauſe
all gifts come with grace, as the Court goeth
with the Queene. Therefore feare not to bee
humble, leaſt you be contemned: for all the
promiſes of God are made to humilitie, and
yet men feare to be humble, leſt they ſhuld be
contemned. Humilitie did not make Iohn
contemptible, but when he refuſed the name
of a Prophet, Chriſt ſaith, that hee was more
then a Prophet, Mat. 11. 2. Humilitie did not
make Moſes contemptible, but as he was the
mildeſt man vpon earth; ſo he was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
vpon the earth, Numb. 12. Humilitie did
not make Dauid contemptible, but when he
humbled himſelfe, hee ſaid vnto Micol, I will
be more humble yet, and lowly in my owne
ſight, yet thou and thy maides ſhall honour
me, 2. Sam. 6. 22. As Chriſt ceaſed not to be a
king becauſe he was like a ſeruant, nor to bee
a Lion becauſe he was like a Lamb, nor to be
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:17992:236"/>
God becauſe he was made man, nor to bee a
Iudge, becauſe he was iudged: ſo man dooth
not looſe his honour by humilitie: but he ſhal
be honored for his humilitie, as the Son was
honoured when he was humbled, Luk. 15. 8.
Thus humilitie hath found that which pride
ſought, like little Dauid, which was leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
of, and yet gotte the victorie; yea,
when no man durſt encounter with the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
1. Sam. 17. 28. This is the ladder where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we muſt aſcend, Gen. 28. 12. pride did caſt
vs downe, and humilitie muſt raiſe vs vp. As
the way to heauen is narrowe, Mat. 12. 13. ſo
the gate is lowe; and he had neede to ſtoope
which entreth in at it: therefore be not proud,
leaſt God oppoſe himſelfe againſt you; but
be humble, and the grace of God belongeth
to you. So long as thou art proude, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
this ſentence, <hi>GOD giueth grace to the
humble:</hi> thou mayſt ſay to thy ſoule: Soule
thou haſt no part herein; for grace is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the humble, and the dowrie of the
meeke, and the treaſure of the lowlie; but to
thee it, is ſaide, <hi>The Lord reſisteth the proude:</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Auoide Sathan,</hi> Math. 4.
or <hi>Departe from mee ye wicked,</hi> Math 25. 45.
Thus you ſee howe you may haue GOD
your friende or your enemie, <hi>Hee reſisteth
the proud, and giueth grace to the humble:</hi>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:17992:236"/>
if thou diſdaine to learne humilitie of man,
learne it of GOD, who humbled himſelfe
from heauen to earth, to exalte thee from

when is the beſt time to ſow the ſeede
of vertue, that it may bring foorth the fruite
of life, and make a man alway readie to die.
Let him remember his Creator in the daies

ende like the middle; as the Sunne ſetteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>After Salomon had deſcribed man (like
Martha) troubling and toyling himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
many things; at laſt hee bringeth him
to that one thing neceſſarie, which Chriſt
taught Marie: and ſhewes him, that if he had
begun there at firſt, he had found that which
he ſought without trouble, and been happier
many yeares ſince, than he is now. Therefore
to them which are young Salomon ſhewes,
what a vantage they haue aboue the aged
like a ſhip, which ſeeing another ſhip ſinke
before her, lookes about her, pulles downe
her ſayle, turneth her courſe, and eſcapes the
ſands, which would ſwallow her, as they had
done the other.</p>
            <p>So they which are young, neede not trie the
ſnares and allurements of the worlde, or the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:17992:238"/>
iſſues and effectes of ſinne, which olde men
haue tried before them, but take the tryall
and experience of others, and goe a neerer
way to obtaine their wiſhed deſires. That is
this (ſayth Salomon) If thou wouldeſt haue
any ſetled peace or heartie ioye in this vaine
or tranſitorie worlde, which thou haſt beene
ſeeking all the time ſince thou wert borne,
thou muſt <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> which did
make thee, which hath elected thee, which
hath redeemed thee, which daylie preſerueth
thee, which will for euer glorifie thee: and as
the kinde remembrance of a friende doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
the minde, ſo to thinke and meditate
vpon GOD, will ſupply thy thoughts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
thy griefes, and make thee cheerefull, as
the ſight of the Arke comforted Dauid: for
ioye, and comfort, and pleaſure is whereas
God is, as light, and cheerefulnes, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

to bee long, and wouldeſt eſcape thoſe

which Salomon by many weary and tedious
tryals ſought to make naked before thee, &amp;
yet held all but vanitie when hee had founde
the way, thou muſt <hi>Remember thy Creator in

and then thy happyneſſe ſhall bee as long as
thy life; and all thy thoughts while thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:17992:238"/>
on earth, a foretaſte of the glorie of
Heauen. This is the ſumme of Salomons
counſaile.</p>
            <p>Salomon findes man ſeeking happineſſe
out of the way, as Eſau hunted long for a
bleſſing, and yet went without it: he pities to
ſee him ſeeke and not finde, to runne and not
obtaine: therefore he ſetteth him in the way
like a guide ſent from heauen, which often
had ſtrayed himſelfe before, and being now
recouered to his right way, ſtands like a mark
of knowledge in the turnings that leade vnto
blinde by-waies, to direct all thoſe that paſſe
by, that they may followe the readie path that
leadeth to eternall happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Trauailour marcheth
cheerefully, which knoweth his way before
he ſetteth foorth: therefore from the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth, euen from the time of youth, when
a man beginneth to runne his pilgrimage, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
tels him how he ſhall therein prepare
himſelfe to walke, and ſets him in a faire high
way, wherein is no turning either to the right
hand or the left, which he calleth, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of GOD. As if he ſhould ſay, Walke
with God as Enoch did, and remember well,
that he which ſhall be thy Iudge, doth ſee all
that thou doeſt, and heareth thee at euerie
worde: and this thought ſhall keepe thee in
the way at all times, like the clowde and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:17992:239"/>
of fire which went before the Children of
Iſrael aſwell by day as night, when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed

            <p>In the next chapter before, and the ninth
verſe, Salomon ſayd, <hi>Reioyce O young man in
thy youth:</hi> now he hath chaunged his note to
Remember O young man in thy youth. No
more <hi>Reioyce,</hi> but <hi>Remember.</hi> Salomon
mocked before, and ſhewed what they did
remember: here he ſhewes what they ſhould
remember, leaſt anie Libertine ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſter
him and ſay, Salomon taught vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
Salomon gaue vs leaue to ſinne, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſaid, doe as ye liſt, for you are yong men,
and haue a priuiledge to bee laſciuious and
vaine: he recants with a breath, and denyes
forthwith his word, euen where he ſpake it.</p>
            <p>What ſayd I? <hi>Reioyce O young man in thy
youth?</hi> I would ſay, Remember O young man
in thy youth. So God mockes vs while wee
ſinne, like Michaiah, which bad Achab fight
agaynſt Aram, and then forbad him againe:
ſo hee bids them reioyce, and forbids them
agayne. Reioyce not in thy youth, but repent
in thy youth. One would thinke that Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſhould haue giuen this Memorandum
rather to olde men then to young men, let
them repent which looke to dye. Oh ſaith Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,<note place="margin">Lam. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.</note>
it is good for a man to beare the yoake
in his youth: if it be good to ſuffer in youth,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:17992:239"/>
it is better to learne in youth. Therefore if
Dauid wiſht that his tongue might cleaue to
the roofe of his mouth,<note place="margin">Pſal 137. 6</note> if hee forgot Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:
what are they worthie which forget
GOD the King of Ieruſalem? Can a childe
forget his father? Is not GOD our Father?
therefore who is too young to remember
him, ſeeing the childe doth knowe his father?
As the deepeſt wounds had neede to be firſt
tented: ſo the vnſtableſt mindes haue neede
to bee firſt confirmed. In this extremitie is
youth, as Salomon ſhewes them before hee
teacheth them. For in the laſt verſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
chapter, he calleth youth <hi>vanitie,</hi> as if he
would ſpeake all euill in a word, and ſay that
youth is euen the age of ſinne. Therfore when
he had ſhewed young men their ſollie vnder
the name of vanitie, like a good Tutor he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them to ſchoole, and teacheth them
their dutie: <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> as though
all ſinne were the forgetfulneſſe of God, and
all our obedience came from this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
that God created vs after his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, to
ſerue him here for a while, and after to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the ioyes which he hath himſelfe. Which
if we did remember, doubles it would make
vs aſhamed to thinke and ſpeake, and doe as
wee are woont. For what man dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his Creator, or why he was created,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:17992:240"/>
while he ſweareth and forſweareth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his trade of ſinne, as though there were
no God to iudge, nor hell to puniſh.</p>
            <p>This is becauſe the remembrance of God
which would wake ſinners, is ſo chaſed from
men, for feare it ſhould curbe them of their
pleaſures, that they dare not thinke of him,
but ſtriue to forget him, that they may ſinne
without feare. Therefore he becommeth a
Schoolemaſter for God, and calleth children
vnto him before they be corrupted, to teach
them this one leſſon for the guide of their life,
<hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi> To which he draweth
them as it were with two cordes: the ſhort
ſlight of their youth, and the infinite infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of age. To ſhew how ſoone our youth is
gone, which we thinke will neuer haue ende:
Salomon doth not reckon it by yeares, but by
dayes, in the dayes of thy youth: ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
numbers our life, by dayes and houres,
and minutes, to teach vs to make vſe of al our
time, and euery day to thinke vpon the ende.
Yet leaſt they ſhould poſt ouer this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
vnto age, which is the generall daye
that all ſet to repent, after this verſe Salomon
brings in the old man deafe, and blinde, and
lame, and ſtammering, for the young man to
behold, as if he ſhould ſay: looke my ſonne, is
this man fit to learne? which cannot heare,
nor ſee, nor ſpeake, nor goe? Therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:17992:240"/>
thou thy creatour in the dayes of
thy youth before this dotage come. This then
is the leuell of our meſſage, to haſten them
forward which trauell towards heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is a great ſpace betweene God
and vs, and much a doe to aſpire the toppe of
mount Sion, but more a doe to aſpire the top
of the mount of heauen.</p>
            <p>Therefore as Abraham roſe early to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
his ſonne in the morning,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 3</note> ſo in the
morning of thy life ſacrifice thy ſelfe to God,
and let him which is <hi>Alpha</hi> in euery thing, be
<hi>Alpha</hi> in thy conuerſion, that is, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as well as the ende. Becauſe wee are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to ſet the beſt laſt, that wee may haue a

&amp; knoweth that with what liquor our veſſels
be ſeaſoned at firſt, they will taſt of the ſame
euer after, whether it be good or bad. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as God ſueth to haue vs begin at good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſo the diuell wooes vs to begin at wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe:
alledging either that wee are not
reſolued yet to leaue our pleaſures, or els that
God is exceeding mercifull to ſinners, or elſe
that we ſhall haue ſpace enough to ſerue him
hereafter. So he ſtands as it were at the ladder
foote, and keepes vs off with theſe weapons,
that wee cannot get vpon the firſt ſtaffe, but
one thought or other pulleth vs backe, when
the foote is in the ſtirrop, ready to ride away
from all our ſinnes at once. Thus wee haue
long purpoſed to ſerue God, and euery man
thinketh that hee ſhould be ſerued, but wee
cannot accord of the time when to beginne:
One ſaith when I am rich, an other ſaith
when I am free, another ſaith, when I am
ſetled, an other ſaith when I am olde, then my
pleaſure will leaue me, and I ſhall be fitter to
faſt and pray, and ſequeſter my ſelfe, but now
I ſhal be mocked if I be not like others. Thus
like bad borrowers, when our day is paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie,
we craue a longer and a longer, and
yet a longer, til we be arreſted with death: ſo
the prince of creatures dieth, before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
why hee liued, for as no diſcipline is

vſed where Chriſts diſcipline is neglected,
ſo no time is obſerued, where Gods time is
omitted.</p>
            <p>It is an olde ſaying; Repentance is neuer
too late, but it is a true ſaying; Repentance
is neuer too ſoone.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 24.</note> Therefore we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to runne, that wee may obtaine,
which is the ſwifteſt pace of man.<note place="margin">Exo. 25. 20.</note> The Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
were portraited with wings before the
place where the Iſraelites praied, to ſhew how
quickly they went about the Lords buſineſſe.
The Hound which runnes but for the Hare,
girdes foorth, ſo ſoone as he ſees the Hare
ſtart: the Hawke which flyeth but for the
Partridge, taketh her flight ſo ſoone as ſhe
ſpyes the Patridge ſpring: ſo we ſhould
followe the woord ſo ſoone as it ſpeaketh,
and come to our Maſter ſo ſoone as hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
For God requiring the firſt borne for his
offering, and the firſt fruites for his ſeruice,
requireth the firſt labours of his ſeruants, and
as I may ſay, the maidenhead of euery man.
Therefore ſo ſoone as man was created, a law
was giuen him,<note place="margin">Ge. 2. 15. 16</note> to ſhew that hee ſhould liue
vnder obedience from the day that hee is
borne. So ſoone as he is borne, hee is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the name of God, to ſhew that when
we cannot runne to Chriſt, we ſhould creepe
vnto him, and ſerue him as we can in youth
and age: ſo ſoone as hee beginneth to praye,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:17992:242"/>
hee ſaith, Thy name be hallowed, thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
come, thy will be doone, before hee
aske his dayly bread, to ſhew that wee ſhould
ſeeke the will of God, before the food which
we liue by, much more before the ſinnes and
pleaſures which we periſh by: ſo ſoone as
the Lord diſtributed the Talents, he enioyned
his ſeruants to vſe them. Who is ſo young
which hath not receiued ſome tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or other:
therefore youth cannot excuſe him, becauſe
the talent requires to be asked of euery one
which hath it. So ſoone as God had created
the man and the woman, hee commanded
them to increaſe and multiplie: ſhall we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
and multiplie in the fleſh, before we
encreaſe and multiplie in the ſpirit: the firſt
thing which God did after hee had created
heauen and earth, he did ſeparate light from
darkenes,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 14.</note> to ſhew vs how we ſhould ſeparate
good from euill, before our good become

            <p>The firſt leſſon that Iohn taught, was:
<hi>Repent, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.</hi>
Math. 3. 2. The firſt leſſon that the Diſciples
taught, was, <hi>Repent</hi> too, <hi>for the kingdome of
heauen is at hand,</hi> Matth. 10. And the firſt
leſſon that Chriſt taught, was <hi>repent, for the
kingdome of heauen is at hand,</hi> Matth. 4. 10. to
teach vs what we ſhould do firſt. <hi>Repent</hi> was
the firſt leſſon to yong and old: For what can
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:17992:242"/>
we owe God to morrow, which wee are not
indebted to day? Therefore Dauid prayed,
<hi>Teach mee O Lord to number my dayes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 12.</note> not
yeares, nor my moneths, nor my weekes.
but my dayes, ſhewing that we ſhall anſwere
for daies as well as yeares, for to day as well as
to morrow: and for our youth as ſtraightly as
our age, which made him cry, <hi>Remember not
the ſinnes of my youth:</hi> which hee would not
haue ſpoken, if God did not marke the ſinnes
of youth as well as age. Therefore he calleth
children vnto him as Salomon dooth, and
ſaith, that hee will teach them the feare of
the Lord. For ſhould children honor their
father and not honour God. It was a ſweete
comfort, when the children went before
Chriſt to his temple, and ſang there <hi>Hoſanna,</hi>
to make their fathers aſhamed, which did
not know the Meſſias when he came, when
their little children knew him. It is written
that when Chriſt heard a young man anſwer,
that hee had kept the commaundementes
from his youth, Chriſt beganne to loue him,
which ſhewes how Chriſt loueth theſe time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
beginnings, when wee make him our
nurſe, and drawe our firſt milke from his
breſts. There is not one confeſſion for olde
men, and another for young men, the old man
ſaith not, I did beleeue in God: the young
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:17992:243"/>
man ſaith not, I will beleeue in God, but both
ſay, I doe beleeue in God, for hee which is
called <hi>I am,</hi> in the third of Exodus, loueth, I
am, and careth not for, I was, nor I will be.
When Chriſt aſketh Peter, <hi>Loueſt thou me?</hi>
he looketh that Peter ſhould anſwere him,
<hi>Yea Lord I loue thee:</hi> and not driue him off
as Felix did Paule, I will heare thee, I will
loue thee, when I haue a conuenient time.
For he which will not come when God cals,
whatſoeuer he ſay, it is impoſſible that hee
ſhould reſolue to come heereafter: for hee
which is euill, how ſhould hee reſolue to bee
good? therefore now or neuer, now and euer,
the tree which buddeth not in ſpring, is dead
all the yeare. when a man is firſt maried, he
may vſe the matter ſo, to winne his wife vnto
him, or to eſtrange her hart for euer. when a
Paſtor commeth firſt to a place, with a ſmall
matter he may make the ſimple people like
him or diſlike him, ſo long as he ſtaieth: when
the heire comes to his lands, lightly all his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
beginne to ſpeake well of him, or euill
of him. when a Prince commeth to the
crowne, by the lawes which hee maketh, firſt
the people geſſe how he will rule euer after:
and eyther diſpoſe theyr hearts to loue him,
or wiſh his death.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſage and beaten counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:17992:243"/>
aduiſed Rehoboam when he beganne to
raigne:<note place="margin">1. Chro. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Shew thy ſelfe louing to the people this
day, and they will be thy ſeruants for euer.</hi> As
though all the dayes after could not doo ſo
much as the firſt: Such a victorie it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
well, as our Prouerbe ſaith: hee which
hath begunne well, is halfe his waye, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
it is good for a man to beginne his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
before he learne to be euill: For
herein our minds do follow our bodyes. If
our children bee deformed in their youth,
we neuer looke to ſee them well ſauored: ſo
if the minde be planted in ſinne, ſildome any
goodneſſe buddeth out of that ſtocke. For
vertue muſt haue a time to growe, the ſeede
is ſowne in youth, which commeth vp in
age.</p>
            <p>And if we can ſay of others, when we ſee a
graceleſſe boye, thou wilt prooue a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring,
if thou liue to bee elder, why ſhould
wee, if we begin as ill as hee, thinke that wee
ſhall bee better and better, which iudge that
he will be worſe and worſe; as the arrowe is
directed at the firſt, ſo it flyeth all the waye,
ouer, or vnder, or beſide, but it neuer findeth
the marke, vnleſſe it bee leuelled right in the
hand; ſo they which make an euill beginning
foreſpeake themſelues as it were at the firſt,
and wander out all their race, becauſe when
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:17992:244"/>
they ſhould haue leuied their life, they tooke
their aime amiſſe. Therefore happie are they
which haue the arrowe in theyr hande, and
day before them, for they neede not wiſhe to
bee yong againe. Now kill the ſerpent in the
egge, for when he is a ſerpent he wil kil thee,
if thou cannot ouercome ſinne in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
before the roote faſten, and the fence bee
made about it: how wilt thou ſtruggle with
the Lion, when he ſeeth his pawes? and
ſinne is become like an olde man, ſo tough
and froward, that he will not heare. As harde
as it is to reclaime one of theſe olde ſinners,
or graunde Papiſts, which are incorporate
into poperie, and as poyſon is ſetled in a
ſerpent; ſo harde it will bee to reclaime
thee, when thou wilt beginne to ſaye, it hath
beene my cuſtome, and I cannot leaue it.</p>
            <p>Trie thy ſtrength but with one of thy ſins:
and ſee what ſhifts, what excuſes, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
it will find, and how it will importune
thee to let it alone, as the diuell tormented
the Childe before hee went out: if thou
canſt not diſcharge one vice that thou haſt
accuſtomed thy ſelfe vnto, when all thy
vices are become cuſtomes, how wilt thou
wraſtle with them?</p>
            <p>Therefore wee bende the Tree while it is
a twigge, and breake the Horſe while hee
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:17992:244"/>
is a Colte, and teach the Dogge while hee
is a whelpe: and tame the Eagle while hee
is young.</p>
            <p>Youthe is like the daye, to doo all our
woorkes in. For when the night of age
commeth, then euerie man ſayeth, I might
haue beene learned, I might haue beene a
teacher, I might haue beene like him or
him, but the harueſt was paſt, before I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to ſowe; And Winter is come, now
my fruite ſhould rype. Thus euerie man
that is olde ſaith, he cannot doe that which
hee thought to doe, and crieth with Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
Catechiſe the Childe in his youth, and
he will remember it when he is olde: ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him in his youth, and he will remember
that too.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> This Nabuchadnezzar perceiued,
and therefore hee choſe the towardlieſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Iſraelites to traine them vp in
idolatrie, like the popiſh Seminaries, that
they might be his inſtruments another day:
If he had let them alone till they had learned
the truth firſt, hee thought that they would
not take his way: therefore hee tooke them
before they had any religion, to frame them
to his religion. If idolatours and Papiſts be
ſo cunning in their generation, to poyſon
their Children betime, leaſt they ſhould
prooue Chriſtians after, what care appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to Chriſtians to ſeaſon their children in
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:17992:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſpring, like the vertuous Ladie which
Iohn commendeth, leaſt they prooue papiſts
and traytours, and reprobates, when they
looke for comfort of them. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which made Rehoboam to chooſe ſuch
young counſailers, when hee beganne to
raigne, but becauſe they were his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before: therefore they became his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailers
after. This is the preferment of our
ſinnes, if they haue been our companions in
youth, in age they will looke to be our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailers
and maſters too. Therefore the beſt
ſeaſon to ſeeke GOD, is to ſeeke him early
before the floudes of wrath ariſe, and the
heape of ſinnes ſtand vp like a rampired wall
betweene GOD and vs. They which ſeeke
mee earlie, ſhall finde mee, ſaith Wiſdome,
in the 8. of Prouerbes: but to them which
deferre (ſhee ſaith) they ſhall ſeeke mee, but
they ſhall not finde me; 1. Prouerbes: becauſe
they did not chooſe the feare of the Lorde:
that is, when good and euill were ſet before
them, they did preferre euill before good, as
a man chooſeth that which hee liketh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they ſeeke mee (ſaith GOD)
they ſhall not finde mee. How doe yee
ſay then that yee will ſeeke GOD, when
God himſelfe ſaieth that yee ſhall not finde
him? Therefore in the 4. of Prouerbes and
the 7. Wiſedome is called the beginning, to

For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If yee ſeeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>There was a poole in Iurie, where the ſicke

the Angell came and ſtirred the water, and
then he which ſtept in firſt was healed of his

For when golden opportunitie is paſt,
no time will fit for her. If Elias would bee

our friends farewell: that is the riches,

<pb n="469" facs="tcp:17992:246"/>
that there is no time left to ſeeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
but followe mee, is turned to, followe
vs, Chriſt muſt followe our ſinnes, and come

tyll we were men: when we are men, we
deferre tyll wee bee olde men, when wee
are olde men, wee deferre tyll death: in all
our lyfe wee finde no leaſure to liue well, but
flit from ſinne to ſin, from wicked thoughts
to wicked ſpeeches, from wicked ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

wee care not to ſeeke it againe. Therefore I
cannot ſay to you as Chriſt ſaide: <hi>First ſeeke
the kingdome of heauen,</hi> for then you ſhould
haue ſought it long agoe, but now I muſt ſay
with the Apoſtle, <hi>Redeeme the time,</hi> and at
laſt, <hi>Seeke the kingdome of heauen.</hi> For it is to
be feared, that as little flies when many came

ſo ſhort houres, but many in ſinne and

            <p>Conſider this, ye which might haue known
a thouſand things more than yee doo, if yee

            <p>God will not alway knocke at the doore,
Chriſt will not alway clocke like an Henne,
Iohn will not alway crie in the wilderneſſe;
but mercy is in the foreward, and iudgement
in the rereward. They which can ſaye now,
We haue a prophet; ſhall ſay, We had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
but wee entertained him like the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſites:
ſo God ſent him awaie from vs like
Ionah to the Niniuites, when the Iſraelites
deſpiſed him. Yet Wiſedome cryeth in the
ſtreetes, Let euerie Ioſeph ſtore vp before the
famine come: for he which promiſeth thee
pardon when thou dooſt returne, dooth not
promiſe that to morrowe thou ſhalt returne.
Repentance is a gift, and a gift muſt be taken
when it is offered. The time paſt is gone, and
thou canſt not recall that to repent in; the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:17992:248"/>
time to com is vncertaine, &amp; thou canſt not
aſſure that to repent in; the preſent time is
onely thine, and thou maieſt repent in that:
but anone that will be gone too. Therefore,
as Samuell began to ſerue God in his mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as Timothie read the Scriptures in his
childhood, and Iohn grewe in ſpirit as hee ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in yeares; ſo whether thou be olde or
yong thy repentance ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not come too ſoone,
becauſe thy ſinne is gone before. If thou lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
a ſpurre to make thee runne, ſee how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
day runneth awaye with thy life, youth
commeth vpon childhood, age commeth
vpon youth, death commeth vpon age, with
ſuch a ſwift ſaile; that if all our minutes were
ſpent in mortifying our ſelues, yet our glaſſe
would bee runne out, before wee had purged
halfe our corruptions. All theſe examples &amp;
ſentences, and Prouerbs, and reaſons do cry
with Salomon, <hi>Remember thy Creator in
the dayes of thy youth.</hi> This is the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
or greeting to the Colledge of
youth. But how ſhould young men remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God, when olde men forget him? If No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah

time to remember GOD in age, or to forget
him for euer. Therefore as the Iſralites ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
twice ſo much Manna the day before
the Sabboath as they gathered any day before
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:17992:248"/>
that, becauſe they might not gather vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Sabbaoth; ſo the gray head which looketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
day for the laſt Sabbaoth when he ſhall
reſt in the graue, ſhould pray twice as much,
heare twice as much, doo twice as much, to
prepare the ſacrifice of his bodie &amp; ſoule rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and acceptable vnto GOD; becauſe the
night is at hand, when he cannot heare, nor
pray, nor repent any more. It is ſaid, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
is very buſie becauſe his time is ſhort, but
an old mans is ſhorter. What haſte ſhould he
make, that muſt goe farther than the <hi>Mores,</hi>
than the Sunne in a yeare, or a mouth, or a
weeke, which the Saintes were going all their
life. Therefore, if youth had neede of legges,
age had neede of wings to flie vnto God. But
as Chriſt ſaide, <hi>The poore receiue the Goſpell,</hi>
though the rich be more bound; ſo we may
ſay, the yong men receiue the Goſpel, though

            <p>The yong men follow Chriſt, the yong

euen to the skirtes, may ſay as Zedechias ſaid
to Micaiah, When did the ſpirit depart from
me and goe to thee? When did zeale depart
from vs, and goe to you? They are ſo nouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the world, and acquainted with ſinne,
that it is too late now for the world to ſpeake
vnto them; they may looke vpon the ſignes
of wiſdome, and grauitie, and holines, when
they ſee their long beards, and gray heads, &amp;
ſide gownes, and aske why is this buſh hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and no wine within? What meruaile
then if they be not reuerenced, but mockt and
pointed at, when Sem and Iaphet had need to
come againe, and couer their nakedneſſe?
What a ſhame was it to the Iſraelites, when
Chriſt ſaide by a Canaanite, I haue not found
ſo great faith in Iſrael? So what a ſhame is it
to the elders, that Chriſt may ſaye againe, I
haue not found ſo great faith nor knowledge
nor zeale in Maſters, and Fathers, and Rulers,
as in ſeruants, and children, and prentiſes?
Which made an olde Father of this Citie ſay,
which now is with God, that if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good to bee done in theſe dayes, it is the
yong men that muſt doe it, for the olde men
are out of date, their courage ſtoopes like
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:17992:249"/>
their ſhoulders, their zeale is withered, like
their browes; their faith ſtaggereth like their
feete, and their religion is dead before them.
Bee aſſured of this that yee are come to that
time which your ſelues ſet to repent: and yet
as though there were another age to repent
after olde age: for you ſpende olde age like
youth, as if you were appointed to die in your
ſinnes. <hi>God hath choſen the weake things</hi> ſaith
Paul, 1. Cor. 1. ſo I may ſay, God hath choſen
the young things to doe his woorke: as if the
Lord had ſpoken to you in his wrath, Fathers
I will prouoke you by your children, Maſters
I will prouoke you by your ſeruants, as once
hee threatned to prouoake the Iewes by the
Gentiles. Therefore be of good cheere yong
Daniel, yong Samuel, yong Timothie, though
our aduerſaries be as the Aramites, yet there
be mo with vs, than againſt vs. Fleſh &amp; blood
could not ouercome fleſh and blood: but if
you be ſanctified, it is the ſpirite which hath
ſanctified you; for the diuell would not goe
out, vnles a ſtronger than the diuell had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the houſe; when you come to be richer,
and elder like Demas, then take heed that ye
doo not embrace the world as Demas did, &amp;
turne to that which ye condemne. The vine
would not leaue her grapes, nor the oliue her
fatnes, nor the fig-tree her ſweetnes to bee a
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:17992:250"/>
King, but the bramble did; hee is not a vine,
nor an oliue, nor a fig-tree, but a bramble,
made for the fire, which leaueth his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
to become worſe. He which is of the
Church, will ſay with the Church, <hi>I haue wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
my feete, how ſhould I defile them again?</hi> Let
the dogge turne to his vomite, and the ſwine
to their walloing, but hold thou on thy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
like Abraham to the euening of thy life,
and a full meaſure ſhalbe meaſured vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <q>Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſumme of this verſe
is, as if he ſhould ſay, Let
the Righteous looke for
mo troubles than other,
&amp; likewiſe let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hope
for greter comforts than
other: for when they are
well, they ſhall bee eclipſed againe, to ſhewe
that their light was but borrowed; and when
they are eclipſed, their light ſhall returne, to
ſhew their difference from them whom God
hateth, which fall from plague to plague, as
they runne from ſinne to ſinne.</p>
            <p>This verſe hath three partes, for heere the
righteous are the agents, their condition trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and the Lord their deliuerer: ſo manie
things fall out contrarie vnto our mindes,
euery day, that hee which wanteth patience
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:17992:251"/>
in this worlde, is like a man which ſtandeth
trembling in the field without his armor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
euerie one can ſtrike him, and hee can
ſtrike none: ſo the leaſt puſh of pain, or loſſe,
or diſgrace, dooth trouble that man more,
which hath not the skill to ſuffer, than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
tryals can moue him which is armed with
patience, like a golden ſhield in his hand, to
breake the ſtroke of euerie croſſe, and ſaue
the heart though the bodie ſuffer: for while
the heart is whole, all is well. <hi>A ſound ſpirit</hi>
(ſaith Salomon) <hi>will beare his infirmitie: but
a wounded ſpirit, what can ſuſtaine?</hi> Pro. 19.
14. Therefore as the lid is made to open and
ſhut, to ſaue the eie: ſo patience is ſet to keepe
the ſoule, and ſaue the heart whole, to cheare
the bodie againe. Therefore if you marke,
when you can goe by an offence, and take a
little wrong, and ſuffer a trouble quietly, you
haue a kinde of peace and ioy in your heart,
as if you had gotten a victorie; and the more
your patience is, ſtill the leſſe your paine is.
For as a light burthen borne at the armes end,
weigheth heuier by much, than a burthen of
treble weight, if it be borne vpon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which are made to beare: ſo, if a man
ſet impatience to beare his croſſe, which is
not fit to beare; it will grumble, and murmur
and ſtart, and ſhrinke, and let the burthen fall
vpon his head like a broken ſtaffe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:17992:251"/>
to helpe him ouer the waters, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

&amp; ſet her to beare it which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to beare, ſhe is like the heartie Spies that
came from Canaan,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 2.</note> and ſayd, <hi>It is nothing to

to beare, it is nothing to faſt, it is nothing to
watch, it is nothing to labour, it is nothing to
be enuied, it is nothing to be backbited, it is
nothing to bee impriſoned:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 37.</note> 
               <hi>In all theſe things</hi>
(ſaith Paul) <hi>we are more then Conquerours.</hi> As
though all theſe things came not to make vs
mourners, but to make vs Conquerours, nay
more than Conquerours, becauſe a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
conquereth his enemie but once: but we
conquere theſe as often as Chriſt did the
tempter. Thus all is in the maner of bearing,
which maketh perſecution ſeeme ioyfull to
ſome, and irkeſome to others, which maketh
pouertie welcome to one, and bitter to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which maketh him ſing in his ſicknes, as
if he were whole, and thee raue and whine, &amp;
curſe, as if thou were not ſicke but franticke:
Therefore Chriſtes yoake is called an eaſie

               </gap>e it; by his infinite patience, hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
infinite paines for infinite ſinnes. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
was like a priuie coate vpon his ſoule,
that when the Diuell ſtroake at him, he was
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:17992:252"/>

hee was killed himſelfe; and all their ſhotte

which he had about him,<note place="margin">Iud. 16. 17.</note> like Sampſons

which ſtand like the fierie ſword betweene

For what hath the poore man to beare his

               <note place="margin">Iere. 10. 19.</note>

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:17992:252"/>
               <hi>Thy iudgements are pleaſant;</hi> ſhewing,
that Gods iuſtice is as pleaſant to the patient,
as his mercies to others. Therefore what a
peace-maker were this in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
if the Magiſtrate had patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to beare
his enuie, if the Preacher had patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to beare
his ſtudie, if the creditor had patience to
beare his loſſes, if the bond-man had patience
to beare his ſeruice, if the husbandman had
patience to beare his labour, if the ſicke man
had patience to beare his paine, if the poore
man had patience to beare his wants: for
want whereof, many think themſelues in hel,
and ſay, that no mans paine is like their paine,
no mans wants like their wants, no mansfoes
like their foes, no mans wrongs like theyr
wrongs, when they can ſcarſe tell where their
paine holds them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, albeit fewe can brooke of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
and Charitie, and Meekeneſſe, and
Thankfulnes, and Temperance, and thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
vertues, which pull from pleaſure; yet
euery man doth wiſh for patience, like a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to eaſe his griefe, by all meanes that he
can: ſo they which are wicked, although they
cannot ſee the goodneſſe of other vertues,
yet can ſee the goodnes of patience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
when they ſee a patient man, and an
impatient man both ſicke of one diſeaſe, yet
both are not troubled alike; but that he which
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:17992:253"/>
hath moſt patience, hath moſt eaſe: and hee
which is moſt impatient, is moſt tormented,
like a fiſh which ſtriues with the hooke. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euen thoſe which cannot ſuffer, that they
might haue reſt, yet ſing the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prouerb,
<hi>In ſufferance is reſt.</hi> This is a leſſon which I
know you would gladly learne, euen as Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh
longed to knowe his dreame,<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 15.</note> though ye
care not for vertue, as the cruell Iudge cared
not for charitie. Yet if you could gaine ſuch
a bargaine by any vertue to eaſe you of your
paines, it would make you looke vnto vertue,
as Pharaoh vſed Moſes,<note place="margin">Exo. 9. 28.</note> but to remooue the
plagues.</p>
            <p>This power God hath giuen to patience,
the medicinable vertue, that it ſhould be like
an wholeſome hearbe in the world, or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Phiſition for all perſons and all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Therefore when the Angell had recorded
all the troubles which ſhould come in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dayes: at laſt hee concludeth, <hi>Here is the
patience of Saints:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apo. 13. 10.</note> as though patience ſhould
beare all. Therefore ſo many ſcriptures goe
like preachers about the Bible, to exhort vnto
patience, like a Beacon which is ſet vp to call
men together, ſhewing vs, that by <hi>patience we
poſſeſſe our ſoules:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> as though a man without
patience had no rule of himſelfe: that <hi>a mans
wiſedome is knowne by his patience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 9.</note> as though
that he which is not patient, cannot be wiſe:
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:17992:253"/>
that <hi>by patience wee receiue the promiſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note>
though the promiſes did not belong vnto vs,
vnleſſe we haue patience:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 4.</note> that <hi>patience bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
experience, and experience hope,</hi> as though
hee which wanteth patience, had no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of GOD, to knowe the ſcope of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
nor anie hope to comfort him about the
life to come:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> beſides many reaſons moe, <hi>That
the afflictions of this worlde are not worthie of
the ioyes that ſucceed them:</hi> that <hi>all things</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
our afflictions) <hi>turne to the beſt, if we loue
God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> that <hi>they are bleſſed which weepe heere,
becauſe they ſhall laugh heereafter:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> that <hi>if wee
ſuffer with Chriſt, wee ſhall raigne with Chriſt:</hi>
that <hi>the Lord doth loue thoſe whom he chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 3.</note>
that <hi>by ſuffering we are made like the
Sonne of GOD,</hi> whoſe life was a perſecution,
as though the holie Ghoſt by often calling
vpon vs, like the importunate woman, would
compell vs to bee patient,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> whether our fleſh
will or no.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe honourable prayſes of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the Prophets, Euangeliſts, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
haue a ſet number of examples before
our eyes, like banners of ſuch cures as haue
been healed by her: that as the Author of the
Hebrewes ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
               <hi>By faith Abel offered a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sacrifice than Caine: by faith Enoch was
tranſlated before he ſawe death: by faith Noah
prepared the Arke and was preſerued from the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:17992:254"/>
Floud: by faith Abraham was content to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his Sonne, and yet beleeued that in his ſeede
all the world ſhould be bleſſed: by faith Sara re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
ſtrength to bring foorth a child, when ſhe
was ſtrooken in yeres, and paſt the ſtrength of the
wombe.</hi> So I may ſay of patience: by patience
Iob did beare all the torments that the diuell
could heape vpon him:<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> by patience Iacob
put vp a thouſand wrongs from Laban and
his children,<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 50. 31</note> and neuer complained in one &amp;
twentie yeares before he departed: by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
Ioſeph forgaue his brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 15.</note> when hee
might haue put them to death, and gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
food when they feared reuenge: by patience
Chriſt ſuffered baniſhment, and reproaches,
and ſcourges, vntill he went to his death, like
a Lambe to the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Among the ſtrange cures of patience, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
may report of his experience, what this
plaiſter hath done for him: for being a figure
of Chriſt, he was alwaies hedged about with
the croſſe, which prooued his patience like a
Touchſtone euery day. As Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
of his Countreymen, ſo Dauid was
contemned of his brethren:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 26. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. 2.</note> as Chriſt fled to
Egypt, ſo Dauid fled vnto Gath: as Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
foode of women,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 2.</note> ſo Dauid receiued
food of Abigail:<note place="margin">1. Sa. 25. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. 2. 16. 13.</note> as Herod perſecuted Chriſt,
ſo Saul perſecuted Dauid: and the wrath of
the King brought many enemies with it, that
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:17992:254"/>
when hee was annointed, yet hee coulde not
reigne: and when he reigned, yet his reigne
was but a warfare:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 8. 2. 6, 5, 6, 15, 4, 18, 33.</note> the Philiſtines agaynſt
him, the Ammonites agaynſt him, the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
agaynſt him, the Moabites agaynſt
him, and Abſolon his owne bowels agaynſt
him, for whom he cryed, <hi>Would God I had died
for thee.</hi> This ſonne which was his dearling,
was his traytor, and ſought his death that
brought him to life, as though Saul had been
riſen from the graue againe. In all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
Samuel ſhewes what was this pilgrimes
comfort:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 30. 6</note> 
               <hi>But Dauid comforted himſelfe in the
Lord his God,</hi> as though hee had no comfort
but in GOD alone. This was the ſtone vpon
which he leaned his head, Be patient, for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
are the troubles of the righteous, but the
Lord deliuereth him out of all.</hi> When hee did
behold his trouble,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 6. 10</note> like the hoaſt of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
he looked backe vnto God like Eliſha,
and ſpied one with him ſtronger then all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. Therfore reſpecting his afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
he crieth, <hi>Many are the troubles of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi>
reſpecting the promiſe, he ſingeth, <hi>The
Lord deliuereth them out of all.</hi> Thus (by his
owne foote) Dauid meaſureth the condition
of the righteous, and ſaith, <hi>Many are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the righteous:</hi> and then by his owne
cure hee ſheweth how they ſhall bee healed,
ſaying, <hi>The Lord will deliuer him out of all.</hi> If
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:17992:255"/>
ye marke, the ſpirite hath directed Dauid to
thoſe two things, which make vs take our
troubles grieouſly: one becauſe we doe not
looke for them before they come. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 28</note>
as Chriſt told Peter before he ſuffered, to
ſtrengthen him when he ſuffered: ſo the holy
Ghoſt doth run vpon the Croſſe, to keep vs in
expectation of troubles, that wee might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
faith, and patience, and conſtancie for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Noah prepared an Arke for the floud.
The ſecond thing which makes vs to ſtart ſo
at the Croſſe, is, becauſe we are like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſeruant,<note place="margin">2. King. 6.</note> which did ſee his foes, but not
his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: ſo we ſee our ſore, but not our ſalue.
Comfort ſeemes a far off,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> like Abraham in the
heauens, as though it would neuer come ſo
low: therefore wee goe about to deliuer our
ſelues,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> as it is ſaid, <hi>Let vs breake his bands,</hi> as
though we could deliuer our ſelues. But, <hi>Hold
your peace</hi> (ſaith Moſes) <hi>the Lord ſhall fight for
you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo. 14. 14.</note> So Dauid comes in like a pacifier, and
ſaith: <hi>Vexe not your ſelues, for the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
you.</hi> Beare both theſe ſentences in mind,
that you muſt go through a ſea of troubles, &amp;
then that you ſhall come to a hauen of reſt,
and no affliction ſhall take you, before you be
armed for it, and in euery trouble you ſhall
know where to haue your remedie. <hi>Many are
the troubles of the righteous, but the Lorde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth
him out of all.</hi> Here bee the two hands
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:17992:255"/>
of God like a wound and a plaiſter: one caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
downe, &amp; the other raiſeth vp. It is good
for a man to knowe his troubles before they
come, becauſe afflictions are lightned in the
expectation. Therefore GOD ſayth of Paul,
<hi>I will ſhewe him how many things he ſhall ſuffer
for me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 16.</note> God dealeth plainlie, and tels vs the
woorſt at the firſt, what wee ſhall truſt to, as
Chriſt told his Diſciples at the firſt:<note place="margin">Math. 16. 8</note> 
               <hi>If ye will
bee my Diſciples, yee muſt take vp the Croſſe:</hi>
cold entertainment to breake their faſt with
the rod.<note place="margin">Luk. 9.</note> Other feaſtmakers (ſayth Chriſt)
broach the beſt wine firſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 10.</note> but Chriſt himſelfe
keepeth the beſt till the laſt. This is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Gods proceedings, to ſend good after
euill,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> as hee made light after darkneſſe: to
turne iuſtice into mercie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> as he turned water
into wine: for as the beaſts muſt be killed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could be ſacrificed, ſo men muſt be
killed before they can bee ſacrificed, that is,
the knife of correction muſt prune them, and
dreſſe them, and lop off their rotten twigs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can bring forth fruite, theſe are the
cordes which binde the ram vnto the Altar,
leaſt when he is brought thither hee ſhould
runne from thence agayne, this is the chariot
which carrieth our thoughts to heauen, as it
did Nabuchadnezzars, and our aſſumption
before our aſſumption. This is the hammer
which ſquareth the rough ſtones, till they be
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:17992:256"/>
plaine and ſmooth, and fit for the Temple.
This is the fierce meſſenger, which is ſent to
compell them to the banquet, which will not
come when they are inuited. Becauſe we are
naturally giuen to loue the world, more then
is good for vs, therefore God hath ſet an edge
of bitterneſſe vpon it, to make vs to loath it,
like a Nurſe which layeth Muſtard vpon her
breaſts to weane the childe from the dug: ſo
<hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 2.</note> to
weane vs from the dugge of the world. The
croſſe is one of our Schoolemaſters in this
life, and the beſt wiſdome is deereſt bought:
proſperitie ſeeketh for nothing, but neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſeeketh, and ſtudieth, and laboureth, and
prayeth for her wants. As the rodde maketh
the Scholler to applye his booke, ſo all our
knowledge is beaten into vs: ſome learne
theyr goodneſſe of pouertie, ſome of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſome of troubles: aduerſitie is the fit
time to learne the iuſtice, mercie, power, and
prouidence of GOD, a fit time to learne the
patience, wiſedome, faith, and obedience of
man, a fit time to learne the ſubtiltie, frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and miſerie of this worlde. All this thou
buyeſt for troubles, yet they are but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
not plagues, nor curſſes, nor torments,
but like the trauels of a woman, when the
birth is ripe, ſhee is deliuered, and ſtraight
ſhee forgetteth all her paynes, for ioye that a
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:17992:256"/>
man child is borne into the world. So the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God trauell but till the fruits be ripe.
When the new man is borne, their trauels are
ended, and they forget all their troubles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
one is borne into the worlde, like the
ſonne of God. This is the difference between
the afflictions of the righteous and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
            <p>When GOD doth viſite the wicked,<note place="margin">Exod. 8. 6.</note> his
puniſhments are called plagues and curſes,
and deſtructions;<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> the plagues of Egypt, the
curſe of Cain, the deſtruction of Sodome.
But when he doth viſite the righteous, his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
are called corrections,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.</note> &amp; chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and rods, which proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a father,
not to deſtroy vs,<note place="margin">Gen. 36.</note> but to trie vs, and purge vs,
&amp; inſtruct vs: therefore when we are afflicted,
one ſayth, that God letteth vs blood to ſaue
our liues, for our liues are rancke, and muſt be
lopped. As Iacob was bleſſed, and halted
both at one time; ſo a man may bee bleſſed
and afflicted together. Afflictions do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our happineſſe, but our happineſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by affliction, as Iacobs bleſſing came
with halting, and as peace is procured by
warre.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> Therefore bleſſed are ye (ſayth Chriſt)
when men perſecute you: as though they
were bleſſed euen while they were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Therefore this muſt not diſmay vs, that
the ſcripture ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Tim 3.</note> 
               <hi>Many are the troubles of
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:17992:257"/>
the righteous;</hi> but rather reioyce vs, hecauſe
we beare the markes of the righteous. Daniel
complayneth not of his ſickneſſe, but of his
ſinnes. Who ſhall fight the Lords battailes
but the Lordes ſeruaunts? Therefore when
Dauid ſpake of many troubles, he pointed to
the righteous, as if he ſhould ſay; this is your
ſhare, the rodde is made for the Childe.
Chriſt called the Croſſe his cup. The ſeruant
is beloued that drinkes of his Maiſters cup:<note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note>
Therefore Chriſt teacheth it to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and bids none but his diſciples take the
Croſſe:<note place="margin">Mat 11.</note> euerie man which hath his heauen
here,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> dooth labour and ſweate for his liuing,
and ſhal not they which haue their hell heere,
ſuffer more then they which haue their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
heere? All men are ſubiect to dangers and
loſſes, and ſickneſſe: <hi>But all that beleeue in
Chriſt</hi> (ſayth Paul) <hi>ſhall ſuff<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> perſecution.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note>
That is, more then dangers, or loſſes, or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which the wicked ſuffer, for the worlde
will not perſecute her children, but ſhee will
perſecute Gods Children: therefore this
church is called the militant church, becauſe
it is alwayes in warfare. Therefore the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is called the worde of the Croſſe, as
though it came to croſſe vs: Therefore Paul
deſcribing the way to heauen,<note place="margin">Acts. 14. 22</note> draweth by
this line, by many tribulations: the Croſſe
way is the way to heauen and the righteous
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:17992:257"/>
walke in it.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> Therefore the Children of God
are not only called labourers, to ſhew what
they ſhould doe for God,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 3.</note> but they are called
Souldiers, to ſhew what they ſhould ſuffer for
GOD.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20.</note> 
               <hi>The ſeruant is not aboue his master:</hi>
but if Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and we ſhould reſt
the ſeruant were aboue his Maſter. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
muſt be fulfilled. <hi>I will put enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the ſeede of the woman and the ſeede of
the Serpent:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> but if there be no war betweene
the children of God and the children of the
world, the propheſie is not fulfilled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Eſau and Iacob had no ſooner life, but
they began to ſtruggle one with another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came out of their mothers wombe.
Therfore Abraham was baniſhed ſo ſoone
as he receiued the promiſe. Therefore Abell
was enuied of his brother,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 22. 4. 14.</note> ſo ſoone as he was
accepted of God. The righteous man was
alwayes like Lot among the Sodomites, and
like Sampſon among the Philiſtines, ſette a
worke by his enemies. As Chriſt was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
borne, but Herod ſought his life; ſo the
new man is no ſooner borne of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.</note> but
the ſerpent is ready to deuour him, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to baniſh him, and hell to ſwallow him.
In all the worlde hee hath no friend, but hee
which made the world. This is the ſtate of the
church militant: ſhe is like the Arke floating
vpon the waters, like a Lilly growing among
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:17992:258"/>
thornes,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 2.</note> like the buſh which burned with fire
and was not conſumed, ſo the citie of God is
alwayes beſieged, but neuer ruined. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and perſecutions cloſe together, like
Chriſt and his Croſſe. As Chriſt was made to
beare his owne croſſe: ſo they are made to
holde their cheekes to the nippers,<note place="margin">Luke 23. 33</note> their faces
to be buffeted,<note place="margin">Iohn 19. 17</note> their backes to bee ſcourged,
their eyes to be pulled out, their peace is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
their reſt labour, their riches pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
their glorie reproches, their libertie impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment;
although they bee the ſonnes of
God, the brethren of Chriſt, the onely heires
of heauen; yet becauſe they ſuffer their hell
heere, they muſt bee contented to be ſubiect
to their enemies, to bee abiects to their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Pſalm 69. 8, 7, 1, 7.</note>
to be hated of moſt, to bee contemned
of all, to be perſecuted ouer the earth, a very
hauen and receptacle of all troubles. Yet as
Chriſt was the ſonne of God, though his life
was nothing but perſecution;<note place="margin">Luk 10. 35.</note> ſo the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are the ſonnes of God, for all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
This is like a bayte in their iourney, to
thinke as the Samaritan told his hoaſt, if thou
ſpend any more I wil recompence thee whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I come. So Chriſt will mende their wages,
when he commeth. Why ſhuld not God trie
his friends, as well as wee trie our friends, the
ſame afflictions (ſaith Peter) are accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in others, naye, greater afflictions are
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:17992:258"/>
borne of other, which woulde make vs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
like Caine, Chriſt was conſecrated by
afflictions, therefore we cannot be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without afflictions, who would not go to
heauen with Eliah, though it were in a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind?
if our troubles be light and few, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are weake &amp; tender:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 13</note> therefore God
doth reſpect our feeblenes, &amp; layeth no more
vpon vs, becauſe wee are not able to beare
more. It is not a ſigne that we are righteous,
becauſe our troubles are few; but becauſe our
troubles are few, it is rather a ſigne that wee
are not righteous, becauſe <hi>Many are the
troubles of the righteous.</hi> For they muſt bee
made examples of patience, they muſt ſuffer
their hell here, they muſt be ſquared for the
temple, therefore they muſt haue manye
ſtrokes to make them fitte: God is not like a
Waſpe, which when ſhee hath ſtoong once,
cannot ſting againe: but there is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of croſſes, and a pluralitie of troubles.
When Dauid ſpake of trouble, hee ſpake of
troopes and heapes, and ſtars, and ſands, and
therefore he ſaith, <hi>Many,</hi> as though hee were
faine to lay them downe in the groſſe ſum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not reckon them. By many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
(ſaith Paul) but how many he could
not number:<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> For except our ſinnes, there is
not ſuch plenty of any thing in the world, as
there is of troubles, which come from ſinne:
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:17992:259"/>
as one heauy meſſenger came to Iob one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another:<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 14. 16.</note> ſo now we are not in Paradice,
but in the wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 7. 18. 19.</note> we muſt looke for one
trouble after another; therefore afflictions
are called waters, becauſe as one waue falleth
vpon another, ſo one trouble falleth vpon the
head of another.</p>
            <p>As a Beare came to Dauid after a Lyon,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 17. 34</note>
and a Giant after a Beare, and a King after a
Giant, and Philiſtines after the King: ſo when
they haue fought with pouertie, they ſhall
fight with enuie: when they haue fought
with enuie, they ſhall fight with infamie:
when they haue fought with infamie, they
ſhal fight with ſicknes, like a labourer which
is neuer out of worke. This you ſee the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in troubles, like the Iſraelites in exile:
Now the Lord commeth like Moſes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them:<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 10.</note> aduerſitie ſeeketh out the promiſe;
the promiſe ſeeketh out fayth; fayth ſeeketh
out prayer; then God heareth, and mercie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth.
All this while Chriſt ſeemed to
ſleepe, as he did in the ſhippe: nowe hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
the windes and waues,<note place="margin">Math. 8. 26</note> and troubles
flie before him, like a troupe of Woolues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Shepheard. As he asked the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe,
where are thy accuſers? and ſhe ſayd
they are gone: ſo he may aske his patients,
where are your troubles? and they may ſay,
they are gone: the ſunne roſe, and the miſts
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:17992:259"/>
vaniſhed: yet (ſaith Dauid) God is good to
all that are pure in heart: that is, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
them while he afflicteth them, and is
preparing an iſſue while the croſſe prepareth
them. When Chriſt heard them ſay, he whom
thou loueſt is ſicke, he anſwered, this ſicknes
is not to death. Ioh. 11. 3. So when it may be
ſayd, he whom God loueth is ſicke: then it
may be ſayd, this ſicknes is not vnto death, &amp;
though it be to the firſt death, yet not to
the ſecond.<note place="margin">Ion. 3.</note> Who would thinke when Ionas

the acts of mercy which make the righteous

is the priuiledge of the righteous,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> as God ſaith
<hi>Ye ſons of Iacob are not conſumed.</hi> So they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

               <hi>We are not conſumed.</hi> Therefore
(Paul ſaith) we are in diſtreſſe, but we are not

               <hi>They are dead

and ſickneſſe are ended,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 20.</note> at laſt tidings ſhall
come that our troubles are dead, and then
the righteous ſhall looke vp like Moſes,
when hee was paſt the ſea, and ſee all their
enemies, all their troubles drowned behinde
them; then the heart ſhall daunce like Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
and ſing the ſong which ſounded before
Moſes:<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 15 20. 34.</note> 
               <hi>The Lorde, the Lord is ſtrong, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and gratious, ſlow to anger, but aboundant
in goodneſſe and truth.</hi> And if Dauid had ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at troubles, and ſpoken of nothing but
rods, the wicked might ſay as they doe in the
115. Pſalme.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 115.</note> 
               <hi>Where is their God?</hi> and the

               <hi>I haue
clenſed my heart in vaine:</hi> but as the waters of

afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flow &amp; ebbe again, one caſteth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
into the water, and another draweth him
out of the water. There lieth Lazarus at the
gate, there lieth Ioſeph in priſon, there lyes
Ieremie in the dungeon, there lies Iob in the
Aſhes, there lyes Iacob in the fields, there lies
Dauid in the wilderneſſe, there lies Abraham
in exile, there lies Daniel among the Lions,
there lies the children in the Furnace:<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 20.</note> at laſt
comes the yeare of Iubile, and al the priſoners
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:17992:260"/>
of the Lorde are ſet at libertie, therefore they
are called the priſoners of hope, becauſe they
may hope to be deliuered, &amp;c. Therfore God
tranſlateth his Croſſe from the head to the
heart, from the heart to the foot, from pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to ſickneſſe, from ſickneſſe to labour: that
whereſoeuer he placeth it, we might haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,<note place="margin">Zach. 9. 1.</note>
knowing that he can remoue it as hee
placeth it.</p>
            <p>Then are fulfilled all theſe ſweet ſcriptures:
<hi>The Lord retaineth not his wrath for euer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
mercie pleaſeth him.</hi> Mich. 7. 8. <hi>After
two dayes he will reuiue vs, and the third day he

and thy hope ſhall not be cut off.</hi> Prouer. 23. 18.
<hi>Heauineſſe may endure for a night, but ioye will

Vntill Dauid ſaith, <hi>The Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer,</hi>
the righteous and the wicked goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.</note>
but now they part, one is taken and the
other is refuſed, one is deliuered, the other is
left in priſon. As Abraham came not to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Sodomits,<note place="margin">Gen 14 16.</note> but to deliuer his brethren:
ſo Chriſt came not to deliuer his enemies, but
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:17992:261"/>
to deliuer his ſeruants: not to deliuer them
from troubles, but to deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 21.</note>
that they may ſay as well, <hi>The Lord hath
taken, as the Lord hath giuen.</hi> As Dauid gaue
charge to his Souldiers, that they ſhould not
kill Abſolon his ſonne,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 18. 5.</note> though he ſent them
againſt Abſolon, to ſtay his rebellion: ſo God
forbids his croſſes to deſtroye his children,
though he ſend them againſt his children to
purge their corruptions. As the Angel paſſed
by the houſes of the Iſraelits, when he ſaw the
bloud of the lambe vpon their doores:<note place="margin">Exo. 12. 13.</note> ſo God
hath his markes, whereby he knoweth whom
he ſhould deliuer out of trouble, &amp; whom he
ſhould leaue in trouble: to one he ſaith, Take
my croſſe: to another he ſaith, Be thou healed:
to another he ſaith, Stay till thy time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth:
euerie hard word may be ſpoken to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as wel as the wicked, but that deadly word,
<hi>Depart into euerlasting fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> Although they
ſeeme to depart here, yet then it ſhall be ſaid,
come and not depart. As Iohn after the voice

they haue bin beaten, they ſhal be cheriſhed:
therefore the trials of the righteous, though
they be called many troubles, yet they are not
called euerlaſting troubles.</p>
            <p>As Dauid ſaith here,<note place="margin">Pſal 32. 10</note> 
               <hi>Many are the troubles

<hi>Many are the ſorowes of the righteous:</hi> but it

followeth, the Lord will deliuer them out of
all:<note place="margin">Prou. 11. 8.</note> nay (ſaith Salomon) <hi>when the righteous

went to Gehezi:<note place="margin">Prou. 21. 18</note> and therefore the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
are called the ranſome of the iuſt, becauſe
they lye in baile for them. As one bird chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth

that he crie like Caine, <hi>My puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is greater then I can beare.</hi> The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
neuer ſaid, that their troubles were more,
or greater, or longer, then they could beare.
For God hath promiſed, he will not lay more
vpon them then they are able to beare:<note place="margin">1. Cor 10. 13.</note> but
when they begin to ſinke like Peter vpon the
Sea, then the hande is readie to catch them,
and ſtraight GOD maketh an iſſue for theyr
troubles.<note place="margin">Acts. 27.</note> As the Viper lept vpon Paul, &amp; lept
off againe, ſo troubles leape vpon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and leape off againe; as though they had
miſtaken the partie, and rapt at the wrong
doore.<note place="margin">Pſal. 37 37.</note> Therefore, <hi>Mark the vpright man</hi> (ſaith
Dauid) <hi>and beholde the iuſt, for the end of that
man is peace.</hi> Though his beginning be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">55 23.</note>
yet his end is peace: <hi>He will not ſuffer the
righteous to fall for euer:</hi> he ſayth not that he
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:17992:262"/>
will not ſuffer him to fall, but that he ſhall not
fall for euer: that is, at laſt his ſhackel falleth
from him, the net breakes, the priſon ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and he goes foorth like Lazarus out of
his graue, to ſhewe what wonderfull things
the Lord hath done for him: So Paul after he
had ſpoken of his troubles, (as thought hee
thought vpon this ſentence of Dauid) repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ſame of himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>But the Lord
deliuered me out of all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> Therefore one calleth
affliction the trance of the righteous, becauſe
they ſeeme dead for a while, but they wake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
therefore they chalenge their enemies
(and ſay) <hi>Reioyce not againſt me O mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 7. 8.</note>
               <hi>for though I fall, yet I ſhall riſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhould content the righteous, to bee
deliuered at laſt, as Dauid quieteth himſelfe,
ſaying: <hi>By this I know the Lord fauoureth me,
becauſe mine enemies doe not triumph ouer me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 41. 11</note>
not becauſe I haue no enemies, or becauſe I
haue no troubles which would ouercome
me. Therefore when he wrote downe. <hi>Many
troubles,</hi> hee blotteth it (as it were) with his
pen againe, as a Merchant raceth his booke
when the debt is diſcharged: and in ſtead of
many troubles, he putteth in, <hi>The Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth.</hi>
Becauſe he forgiueth all ſinnes, he is
ſayd to deliuer from all troubles, to ſhew that

When Paul had forbidden the Romanes

them another faſhion, which hee calles
<hi>The renuing of the minde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 5.</note> As the Eagle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth

abide but in new mindes.<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 17.</note> The minde renued

When the ſerpent taught knowledge, he ſaid

word, but hee which hath a new minde: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as the Sunne is not diſcerned by any

which wrote it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 3.</note> which is called <hi>the holy ſpirite,</hi>
becauſe it is <hi>holy,</hi> and becauſe it makes holy.
Sinne was the firſt vaile which obſcured

            <p>They which haue renued their mindes,

ſaith he, ſhall proue what the will of God is:
that is, they ſhall trie all that they doe heare,
and learne by all that they ſee, vntill they tract
out the will and meaning of GOD. As the

from caſting knowledge to the vngodly, they
may know ſo much as ſhall condemne them,
but they neuer knowe what will ſaue them.
When Chriſt heard Peter ſaie,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 16</note> 
               <hi>Thou art the
Sonne of the liuing God:</hi> Chriſt anſwered;
<hi>Fleſh and blood hath not taught thee this;</hi>
               <note place="margin">17.</note> ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
that carnall men haue not this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 17</note>
This is the word of which Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>All men doe not receiue it,</hi> It is true, <hi>that the
Spirite breatheth where it will:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 8.</note> but it will
breath vpon none but her louers. Wiſedome
is like the daughter of God, which hee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
to none but to him which loues her, and
ſues for her.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 17</note> As Dauid could not vnderſtand
why the wicked proſpered vntill he entered
into the ſanctuary of GOD; and as Aaron
might not enter the Sanctuary where GOD
did anſwere, vntill he had ſanctified himſelfe;
ſo if we will vnderſtand myſteries, and heare
God himſelfe ſpeake; wee muſt put off our

was rapt into the third heauen,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 2.</note> when GOD
would talke with his Church, hee ſaith, <hi>I will
take her aſide into the wildernes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oſe. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and then I will
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:17992:267"/>
ſpeake friendly vnto her:</hi> ſo when wee will
learne Diuinitie, we muſt goe aſide from the
world, and ſequeſter our ſinnes, &amp; lift vp our
mindes aboue the earth, or els it will not ſtay
with vs. As the ſpirit went from Saul when
he ſinned; ſo when knowledge hath ſaluted
the wicked, ſhe bids them farewell; like vnto
a Martin, which will not builde but in faire
houſes. It is ſaid in Iohn 14. 15. When Ieſus
went to eate the Paſſeouer, hee came to a
chamber which was trimmed: ſo the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that receiued God, the hart which ſhould
lodge knowledge muſt bee trimmed, and all
the ſinfull corners ſwept;<note place="margin">1. Sa. 15. 26</note> or elſe, as Samuell
would not come to Saul, ſo Wiſedome will
not come to that hoſte. There is an harbinger
which goeth alway before the knowledge
of God, to prepare the houſe, &amp; this is loue,
the bond of perfection.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>They which haue loue</hi>
(ſaith Iohn) <hi>knowe GOD, but they which haue

               <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 19.</note> 
               <hi>you ſhall not ſee;</hi> like Hagar,

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:17992:268"/>
Gods word, becauſe a godly minde eaſelieſt
pearceth into Gods meaning, according to

in Iohn 7. 17.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>If any man will doe Gods will, he
ſhall vnderſtand the Doctrine whether it bee of
God, or no:</hi> and that in Pſalm. 111. 19. <hi>They
which keepe thy precepts, haue a good vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi>
&amp; that in 1. Cor. 2. 15. <hi>The ſpirituall man
vnderſtandeth al things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 1. 7</note> And therfore <hi>the feare
of the Lord</hi> is not onely called <hi>the beginning of

it ſelfe. As when Chriſt taught in the

the Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 7, 15</note> 
               <hi>ſeeing hee neuer learned them.</hi>
So it is a wonder what learning ſome men

able to ſchoole Apollos that great Clerke, a

               <hi>Father ſo it
pleaſed thee:</hi> as when Iacob came ſo ſoone

how he came by it ſo ſodainly?<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 20</note> Iacob anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
becauſe the Lord thy God brought it
ſodaynly to mine hand, ſo the holy &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men cannot giue any reaſon, why they
conceaue the words of God ſo eaſily, and the
wicked doe conceaue them ſo hardly, but
that GOD brings the meaning ſodainly to
their hearts as we read in Luk. 24. 45. When
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:17992:268"/>
the Diſciples were ſetled in the profeſſion of

So we read in Prouerbs 1. 23. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
promiſeth to the righteous, <hi>If you will

A Schoolemaſter might ſay to his ſchollers,

which Paul obſerueth, 1 Corin. 1. 18.
that to ſome religion ſhall ſeem fooliſhneſſe.
The reaſon of all this Paul layeth downe in a

heauenly things, he ſayth, Becauſe
they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 Corin 2. 14.
therefore, how ſhould he diſcerne them, that
hath not the ſpirite?</p>
            <p>For this cauſe, wiſedome is not ſaid to bee
iuſtified of any, but of her owne Children,
Mat. 11. 19. neither doth Chriſt ſay, that any
ſheepe heare his voyce, but his owne ſheepe.
<hi>My ſheepe</hi> (ſayth hee, Iohn 12. 27) <hi>heare my
voyce:</hi> they followe their ſhepheard, they
heare his voyce, they vnderſtand his Lawe,
they iudge of his iudgements, they haue the
meaſure of his Wordes, all is open, and
plaine, and manifeſt and cleare vnto them:
they ſearch deeper, and iudge righter, and
know ſooner, and though they haue no lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet they haue better iudgements, than
the learned: wheras the other that labour and
ſtudy without God, walke in a labyrinth, &amp;
fall into doubts, while they ſeeke reſolutions.
When a wicked man reads the Scriptures, he
ſeeth no difference betweene the worde of
God,<note place="margin">Luk 24. 16.</note> and the wordes of men, like Cleopas
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:17992:270"/>
which talked with Chriſt, &amp; knew not Chriſt.
When he ſpeakes of Religion, he flutters like
a young bird which cannot flye becauſe her
wings are not growen: when he prayeth, his
prayer is like a childes grace, that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not one word that he ſaith: hee which
hath but a ſhew of holines, hath but a ſhewe
of wiſedome: a little knowledge is in his
head, but there is no knowledge in his heart.
An euill man may knowe ſome thing, and
ſpeake ſomething of his reading &amp; hearing,
as Iob ſaith,<note place="margin">Iob. 32. 8.</note> 
               <hi>There is a ſpirit in man,</hi> that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

as though the ſinners vnderſtanding did not

            <p>If the wicked man ſpeake any thing that is
good, hee ſpeakes by roate, but hee which
ſpeakes not out of the abundance of his hart,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 45.</note>
is ſoone drawne drie. The preaching of the

that we cannot ſee the perfection of it,
as the Sunne is ſo bright that wee cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

acceptable, and perfect to vs, much leſſe may
our will ſeeme good, or acceptable, or perfect
vnto him, for this is our goodneſſe, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his goodneſſe. If it be ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,

Becauſe we will not renue our mindes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

ſeemeth trueth, euery euill ſeemes good,
and this hath been the beginning of al errors

            <p>Now a word of the Sacrament, there is an
infant to be receiued into the Church, which
putteth vs in minde of the promiſe which we
made vnto God, when we were receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

was inſtituted by Chriſt, when he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
of Iohn in the riuer of Iordan, and it
ſucceedeth Circumciſion as the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was ordained in ſtead of the Paſſeouer,<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 14.</note> ſo
ſoone as we are borne we are baptized,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19</note> 
               <hi>In the
name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie
Ghoſt,</hi> to ſignifie that we owe a duetie vnto
God, from the day that wee come into the

with water, to ſignifie how our ſinnes
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:17992:272"/>
are waſhed with Chriſtes bloud: when our

water againe, to ſignifie how we ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from death to life, by the reſurrection of
Chriſt, and how we ſhould riſe from ſinne to
righteouſneſſe: thus we begin our life with a
ſolemne promiſe to God before the Church,
to ſerue him with our bodies and ſoules till
death vs depart.</p>
            <p>Now let vs remember how we haue kept
this promiſe with the Lord, or rather how we
haue broken promiſe with him: then we gaue
our ſelues to GOD, but ſince we haue giuen

as a ſeale of his mercie, to receiue this

therefore they are not to go to Chriſt,
although if they went to heauen they muſt
needes go to Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt touching

Chriſt, for vnleſſe we aſcend to him as he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended

to eternall life: therefore good cauſe had Paul
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:17992:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to deſire to be with Chriſt, that he might be
at reſt: for no doubt it was the ſweeteſt voice
that euer the theefe heard in this life, when
Chriſt ſaid vnto him, <hi>This day ſhalt thou bee
with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Luke 23. chapt. verſ. 45.
Beſides, as Paul perſecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c.</hi> Therefore good cauſe had Paul to
deſire to be with Chriſt, that he might be out
of trouble. Yet he wil not diſſolue himſelf, but
deſireth to be diſſolued: that is, that he which
brought him into this world, would take him
out of the world: neither doth he wiſh or pray,
or make any petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God to take away his
life, but tels him his deſire, deſiring to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued:
to deſire is not to pray, but ſhewes
what we approue: neither doth he deſire ſo to
be diſſolued, as though he were weary of his
labors, &amp; would ſuffer no more for Chriſt, but
he is content to liue as he ſaith in the 24. verſ.
<hi>Neuertheles for me to abide in the fleſh were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for you,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, to do you good
I am content to ſuffer euil, and ſtay ſtill from
Chriſt, whom I long to be with. Seeing then
that he wil not diſſolue himſelf, nor pray to be
diſſolued, but is content to liue ſtil: why doth
he ſay, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued?</hi> Onelie to ſhew
what he preferreth in his deſire, if hee might
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:17992:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chooſe life or death for his owne reſpect, he
could be content to leaue friends and riches,
and pleaſures, and life, and all, onely to bee
with Chriſt. This ſeemes to be a good leſſon
for ſickemen, when they can liue no longer,
then to be with Chriſt were better then to be
with the glutton, which neuer thought of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
til he was in hell:<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> but Paul was not ſicke
nor ſore when he deſired to be diſſolued:
therefore this is not onely for the ſicke, but for
the whole. If he had wiſhed to liue &amp; ſtay ſtill
in the world, no man need to be taught to ſay
after him, for yong &amp; old deſire not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,
but few are content to bee diſſolued.
To a naturall man in this life, nothing is ſo
ſweete as life it ſelfe, and he which is in loue
with this world, ſeldome dyeth quietly vpon
his bed: but to a minde which miſliketh this
worlde, nothing can come ſo welcome as
death, becauſe it takes him out of the world.
This it is which Paul would haue vs learne,
that nothing in this world is ſo pretious or
pleaſant, that for it we ſhould deſire to liue
or ſtay from God one hower: though all may
not wiſh to die, yet all muſt ſubſcribe to this,
that death is better then life, becauſe it leads
to Chriſt, which when Paul had throughlie
taſted, he was ſatiſfied for all things elſe, and
deſired to liue no longer that he might bee
with Chriſt; heerein appeareth the end of
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:17992:274"/>
mans life, which when he hath obtayned, he
deſireth to liue no longer, how great riches,
and honours, and friends ſoeuer he leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him. From the time he knoweth Chriſt
crucified,<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 22.</note> and begins like Enoch to walke
with God, he cryeth euer after with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note>
               <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt:
who ſhall deliuer mee from this bodie of ſinne?
death weare to me aduantage.</hi> Euen as Simeon
reioiced that Chriſt came to him,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 28.</note> ſo the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reioice that they ſhall go to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The neceſſitie of ſinne is ſo irkſome to him
which knoweth the vileneſſe of ſinne, that
the faithfull man, but to doe good, would not
liue out of heauen, no not one hower. This
made the Martyres ſo willing to abide any
kinde of death that tyrannie could deuiſe, to
be rid of their ſinfull bands, and this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
burthen, which preſſeth downe the
ſoule, that looks after Chriſt like his diſciples
when he aſcended to heauen.<note place="margin">Acts 1. 10.</note> All is trouble
and wearines, and vanitie to the godly mind,
whether he eate or drinke, or ſleepe, he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it a ſeruitude vnto the fleſh, and wiſheth
with Dauid to be rid from theſe neceſſities:
ſo the knowledge and loue of God maketh a
man forget his owne fleſh, maketh him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice
the whole world, taketh away the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from life and death, changeth his
nature which hee could neuer ouercome,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:17992:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and teacheth him to renounce his deere ſelfe,
and ſay, though he ſhould die, <hi>Not my will
but thy will bee done.</hi> All this appeareth in
this example, what operation is in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and loue of Chriſt: it made the world
irkſome vnto Paul, which all men naturally
deſire: it made death pleaſant vnto him,
which all men naturally abhorre: although
they bee wearie of their life, and haue no
pleaſure from morning to night; yet it will
not pleaſe them to change, which they
needes muſt, they neuer loath but loue
their miſeries, I will not dye one houre to
liue for euer. Doe not the wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
prophecie by their feare of death a
worſe condition of ſome dreadfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after this life prepared for ſinners, and
all that contemne GOD, when none but
they ſtande in ſuch feare of death? Why
dooth one wiſh for it, and another tremble
to heare of it? If it were but a ſleepe, no man
would feare it at all: for who feareth to take
his reſt when the night approacheth? If it
did take away ſence and feeling, and make
men trees or ſtones, no man would feare it
at all, for who would feare ſtrokes if hee
could feele no more then a ſtone? or who
would care for any thing if he had no ſence
of anything? would any man tremble ſo to
bee as the dead creatures which haue no
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:17992:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſence of euill? They muſt needes be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
caſe than the happieſt man in this life,
which is not without the ſence of euill.
Therefore this feare of death which you ſee
in all but the faithfull, dooth preſage ſome
ſtrange torment, ſome heauie change and
ſharpe puniſhment to thoſe men: which
they begin to taſt alreadie before they dye,
like the ſpirite which perſecuted Saul before
his end.<note place="margin">1. Sa. 16. 14.</note> They deſire not to be diſſolued, but
they feare to bee diſſolued, they goe not to
Chriſt, but their departure is an euerlaſting
departure from Chriſt to the damned, to the
diuels, to hell without either end or eaſe, or
patience to endure it.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that no man is willing to die,
before his conſcience bee quieted towarde
God, and that he can catch ſome hope of a
better life after this life. He which knowes
that he ſhall go to Chriſt, it is impoſſible that
he ſhould die vnwillingly: but he which can
not hope for a better world, muſt needs leaue
this world grudginglie, and feare death more
then all the terrors of life. He had rather to
be ſicke and cold, and hungry, and want and
beg, then go with death, becauſe he knoweth
what he ſuffereth here, but hee knoweth not
what he ſhall ſuffer hereafter. Therefore he
which is not willing to be diſſolued, hath not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earned Chriſt yet as Paul did, for no man

eſteeme this life when he begins to taſte of

            <p>The Apoſtle had ſeene many good things
in his daies, and was neuer ſatiſfied, willing
to be diſſolued, but thirſted ſtill, and no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
could quench his thirſt, vntill hee dranke
of the water of life, and then hee thirſted no

was made for God, but God alone. Riches

willing to die, but the ſight of Chriſt: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie

Baptiſt did ſee our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Math 3. 11.</note> and knew that it
was hee, hee debaſed himſelfe, as if hee had

of, but ſought to looſe the opinion of the
people that Chriſt might haue all; although
he was a Prophet, and more than a Prophet,
and not a greater amongſt the ſonnes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
So when Paul had ſeene his Sauiour,
hee forgot all that he loued, all that hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and all that hee poſſeſſed: no ioye, no
glorie, no life now but to die. All thinges
muſt yeelde to the Sonne, and bee content
with Iohn, that hee increaſe, and wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
This is our glorie and life, that hee
liueth in glorie.<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 28.</note>

me that Ioſeph my ſonne liueth:</hi> it is enough for
vs that Ieſus our Sauiour reigneth. If the head
be crowned, all the bodie is more honoured:
therefore let vs glorie that Chriſt is glorified,
and reioyce as much that hee is aſcended, as
our fathers reioyced that he deſcended: for
where the head is, there the body muſt needes
be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued:</hi> he calleth his death
not a deſtruction but a diſſolution, for three
cauſes. Firſt he departeth from this life, and
hath no more ſocietie with them that liue
vpon the earth. Secondly, his ſoule departeth
from the bodie vntill the day of resurrection,
then ſhe findeth her owne bodie agayne, and
they reioyce like friends which are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thirdly, he departeth from this vale of
miſerie, into the paradiſe of ioy and all felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to liue and reigne with God for euer: in
aſſurance whereof he ſaith, that he ſhall bee
with Chriſt, ſo that death is the way to Chriſt.
As the Doue found no reſt vntill ſhe came to
the Arke:<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 9.</note> ſo the faithfull find no reſt till they
come to Chriſt, they goe through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
like other men. Vntill the Iewes arriued
at Canaan,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 13. 17.</note> all their life was ſpent in ſinfull
Egypt, or in the dreadfull deſert, during the
time of their iourney they had no ſetled reſt
or continuing pleaſure. Peace beginneth
when the battell endeth, there is the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:17992:277"/>
of the dead, leaſt death ſhould bee too
fearefull to vs. The beſt of Gods bleſſings are

to it is death, thou art going to ioye, therefore
looke not for it vntill thou come to thy iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys

land of plentie, the land of pleaſure, bee in
the wilderneſſe: ſtay heere, march no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whither doe you goe like the Pilgrims
of Iſrael if Canaan be in the wilderneſſe? But
Paul lookes for the crowne at the gole: he is
not with Chriſt, but truſts to bee with Chriſt:
he is not in heauen, but he hopes to come to
heauen, and this hope led him through the
wilderneſſe, that he murmured not like the
Iſraelities, but only longed for that day, when
Chriſt ſhall ſay vnto him as he ſaid to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
theefe: <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in
Paradiſe.</hi> Thus you haue heard the difference
betweene the faithfull and the wicked, how
the one lotheth this life, and the other long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>Now wee come to our queſtions. Simeon

               </hi> ſo Paul ſaith, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued and

the other ſaith that he goes to peace: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſeemes that Purgatorie was not yet
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:17992:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found, when the iuſt men went to peace. This
is one of the fruits of a godly life, it hath hope
(ſaith Salomon) in the end:<note place="margin">Pro. 14. 36.</note> in death it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth
a man of life,<note place="margin">Prou. 11. 7.</note> &amp; when the fleſh ſaith,
feare, and the ſerpent, deſpaire, it makes the
fleſh crouch, and the ſerpent flye, &amp; the ſoule
reioyce while death is opening the priſon
doore, that ſhe may flie to her countrey from
whence ſhe came. Therefore what ſhall I ſay
to Purgatorie, if Paul go to Chriſt, &amp; Simeon
goe to peace? Some ſay that it is in the ayre:
ſome ſay that it is in the earth, ſome vnder the
earth:<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 1.</note> ſome a little aboue hell. Thus Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
cannot aſſoile his owne dreame.
You muſt vnderſtand that Purgatorie is like
your paynted Sepulchers, which are framed
more for the liuing then for the dead: for you
know that the locuſts of Rome liue by Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and Dirges, and Maſſes for the dead, as
the Siluerſmiths in Epheſus liued by Images:<note place="margin">Act. 10. 25.</note>
and therefore as they were loth that Images
ſhould goe downe: ſo they are loth that their
Purgatorie ſhould bee quenched: for it is the
gainfulleſt lye in all Poperie, for out of this
lake iſſue their Maſſes and Dirges, and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
for the dead. They are ſayd for the dead,
but they make for the liuing: <hi>For the dead
haue no portion of al that is done vnder the ſun.</hi>
doe what you will, ſay what you can, Maſſes,
Dirges, or Trentals, they haue no portion in
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:17992:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, for they haue receiued their reward alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and the <hi>tree lieth where it fell:</hi> yet theſe

and thinke they ſhall be paied for other

and Maſſes: as though they neuer

that he which beleeueth ſhal not go to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 24.</note>

ſtay at Purgatorie, and fire &amp; torments? Hath
Chriſt ſatisfied for vs, &amp; muſt wee now make
ſatisfaction for our ſelues?<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> Whither the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

all, that is to Abrahams boſome, or hell fire:
there are but two kindes of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

which the beſt of the fathers confeſſeth
that he could neuer finde in Scripture? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed of hell, for Purgatorie is but a
ſcarre babe. Furthermore, when Paul ſayth,
that he ſhall goe to Chriſt, this ſeemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
the old queſtion often debated among
the ſimple people, once deluded, whether the
ſoules of men departed, walke after death,
and appeare vnto men, exhorting them to
this or that, as Gregorie or ſome counterfeit
reporteth in his Dialogues.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles before their full groweth,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:17992:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might ſeeme to bee incumbred with this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
becauſe when they ſaw Chriſt walking
vpon the waters, they ſayd, <hi>It is a ſpirite:</hi> and
when Peter knocked at the doore in the
night, they ſayd to Rhode a Damſell, <hi>It is his
Angel:</hi> Act. 12. 15. Which errour was dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
from the eluſion of Sathan, and vulgar
opinion receiued from Pythagoras, which
taught that the ſoules of men departed, did
returne into the bodies of other men after
death, either for correction, or for reward: if
they were good ſoules, then they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to better men: if they had been badde
ſoules, then they were caſt into worſe bodies
then they had before: a fine Philoſophicall
dreame.</p>
            <p>This deluded Herod: when hee heard of
Chriſt, he ſuppoſed that Iohn Baptiſt was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
againe, whom he had beheaded: and the
better ſort of the people, as we reade in <hi>Mat.</hi>
16. 14. dreamed that Chriſt was Elias, or Iohn
Baptiſt, or Ieremie, or ſome of the Prophets
riſen againe. But touching the ſoule once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the body, that it returnes not nor
can returne into the world: many examples
and teſtimonies, and reaſons, &amp; the order of
our reſurrection declareth.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10. 28</note> The ſoules of the
righteous are in the hands of the Lord, &amp; no
man or diuell can take them out of his hands:
the ſoules of the wicked are in the hands of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:17992:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the diuell, and God will not take them out of
his hands: and therefore Abraham ſayth. He
which is here,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> cannot come from hence, and
they which be there, cannot come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence:
for then the paines of hell were not euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paynes, not the ioyes of heauen euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ioyes, but temporal, like the paynes and
ioyes of this world. Therefore it is no ſoule
which walks about. How then? What is this
which I ſee in the night like ſuch a man, and
ſuch a man? The Diuell (which chaungeth
himſelfe into an Angell of light to deceiue)
can change himſelf into the likenes of a man
much more: that is it which thou ſeeſt, as Saul
ſawe Samuel, 1. Sam. 28. 8. not Samuel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
For could the Witch raiſe Samuel out
of the graue, which could not keepe her ſelfe
out of the graue? or could the diuell diſturbe
the Prophet after death? Then he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be quiet, if the diuell could diſturbe him,
becauſe hee diſquieteth the godlie ſo much
while they liue. If this apparation bee called
Samuel, how doth he call it Samuell, if it be
not Samuel? As the Bookes of Caluine are
called Caluine: as the picture of Beza is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Beza: as he which playeth the King vpon
a ſtage, is called a King: as the golden Myce
and Hemerodes which the Philiſtines layd
in the Arke, were called Myce and Heme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes,
although they were but meere ſhapes
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:17992:279"/>
and figures of them: ſo this likeneſſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
is called Samuell, though it was not
Samuel in deede, but a counterfeit ſhape of
Samuel. For GOD would not anſwere Saul
before by Oracle, nor by Prieſt, nor by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
and would hee aunſwere him by the
dead, which dooth forbid to aske counſell
of the dead? <hi>No</hi> (ſayth Abraham) <hi>they haue
Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> Luke 16. As if hee
ſhould ſay: let them learne of the bookes of
the dead, for the dead ſhall not returne vnto
them. Againe, if it had been Samuel himſelfe
which had taught Saul to worſhip GOD,
woulde that holie Prophet haue receiued
worſhip himſelfe, as this ſpirit did? Againe,
If it had been Samuel Sauls Schoolemaſter,
which taught him alwayes to repent while
hee liued: hee would rather haue exhorted
him to repentance now then before, ſeeing
the daye of his death was ſo neere. But you
will ſay, Whatſoeuer it was, it ſeemes that he
could prophecie of things to come: for hee
foretold Sauls death. Can the diuell prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie?
This was an eaſie matter for the diuell to
prophecie, becauſe he knew that Dauid was
annoynted before, and therefore Saul muſt
be remooued, that he might reigne as he was
annoynted. Secondly, he knew that Samuel
had prophecied his confuſion, and therefore
hee muſt bee degraded, that the Prophecie
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:17992:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might bee fulfilled. Thirdly, hee did ſee the
Philiſtins comming againſt him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no meruaile if he did aime that his death
was neere at hand, ſeeing a man might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
the ſame.</p>
            <p>If any man bee not ſatisfied with this, to
beleeue that the ſoules of the dead doe not
walke after their diſſolution, let mee reaſon
with him thus. Is it a ſoule which thou ſeeſt?
Why a ſoule is a ſpirit, and cannot bee ſcene
no more then a voyce, or an Eccho: diddeſt
thou euer ſee thine own ſoule, though it hath
been euer with thee ſince thou was borne?
Doeſt thou thinke it is a bodie? Why a bodie
cannot walke without a ſoule: for the ſoule
is the life which mooueth the bodie. If thou
ſay it is a bodie and ſoule too, then why doth
Paul call death a diſſolution? It is a ſeparation
of the ſoule from the bodie: if the bodie and
ſoule bee not diſſolued, then the man is not
dead but liuing ſtill. If thou ſay the ſoule is
come to the bodie, and the bodie is riſen to
the ſoule for that time: then I can ſay no more
to thee, but beleeue thine owne eyes. If thou
thinkeſt that it is ſuch a mans bodie which
thou ſeeſt, looke in the graue, and open the
ground, and there thou ſhalt ſee the bodie
where it was laide, euen while this vizard
walkes in thy ſight: therefore apparitions are
no other, then that which appeared to Saul.
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:17992:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus the Diuel hath many wayes to deceiue;
and this is one &amp; a dangerous one, to draw vs
from the word of God, to viſions, &amp; dreames,
and apparitions, vpon which many of the
doctrines of the Papiſts are grounded.</p>
            <p>They had neuer heard of Purgatorie, but
for theſe ſpirites which walked in the night,
and tolde them they were the ſoules of
ſuch and ſuch, which ſuffered in fire till their
maſſes, and almes, and pilgrimages did raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
them out: So theſe night ſpirits begate
Purgatorie, and Purgatorie begate trentalles,
as one Serpent hatcheth another.</p>
            <p>Yet a third queſtion riſeth out of theſe
wordes, and that is this; Whether a Chriſtian
may wiſh for death? As Paul deſired, ſo may
wee deſire,<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 54.</note> if wee haue Pauls ſpirit. As Chriſt
told his Diſciples when they asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhould pray for fire from heauen, as
Elias did? Chriſt anſwered, that they knewe
not of what ſpirit they were: as if he ſhould
ſay, If you were of Elias ſpirit, and did praye
with the ſame mind, and to the ſame end that
he did, then you might pray as he prayed. The
wicked wiſh to die, becauſe they would bee
rid of the croſſe, and ſuffer no more for God:
as Cain,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> ſo ſoone as he was curſed, and knew
that his life ſhould be a torment, he ſought to
dye, to preuent the iuſt iudgement of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp; ſpight him (as it were) which ſhuld puniſh
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:17992:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſinnes. So doe the people oftentimes, which
haue not to ſatiſfie hunger, &amp; the ſicke which
ſaint of an incurable diſeaſe, and the wearie
captiues in priſon, galleis, and bonds. As for
the faithfull, if they at any time wiſh to die,
they pray for death, as the laſt remedy againſt
ſinne and Sathan: euen as they pray in the
Reuelation, for the haſtening of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to iudgement,<note place="margin">Reu. 22. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come
quickly,</hi> for the ſhortening of the daies of
ſinne, leaſt all fleſh ſhould periſh. But they
which wiſh for death in this ſorte, would dye
as the will of God hath ordained, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their fleſh to abide theſe troubles, and ſtill
by fayth ſuppreſſe the doloruos griefe of ſin,
by frequent meditation of inward ioy, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by grace in Chriſt, and therein reuiue
themſelues, as with the earneſt pennie of their
inheritance, which they ſhall receiue at the
fit time, when it ſhall comfort them much to
haue ſuffered ſo long. Much therefore haue
they to anſwere, which are not contented to
die in peace, and ſtay till they bee diſſolued,
but as though themſelues were the authors
of life &amp; death, from cruell heart giue wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commiſſion to the bloodie hand, to cut
aſunder that which God hath ioyned, the
louing ſoule and their body; as Iudas, Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,<note place="margin">2. Macc. 14 37.</note>
Saul, and Pilate did: not one of theſe
was good in life or death. Yet the Author of
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:17992:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Macchabees commendeth Raz is moſt of
all, for that which was the greateſt ſinne that
euer he did, for killing himſelfe. Man was not
borne of his owne pleaſure, neither muſt hee
die at his owne luſt; or elſe it had been good
for Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 2.</note> which ſuffered more than any Saint,
except Chriſt, to make away himſelfe, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das

                  </gap>
               </note> But why is it commanded then, thou
ſhall nor kill? If thou maiſt not kill another,
much leſſe maiſt thou kill thy ſelfe. As for the
example of Sampſon, Iud. 16. 30. which may
ſeeme to oppoſe againſt this, in that he killed
himſelfe, when as he pulled the houſe vpon
his owne head, and all that were with him:
vnderſtand, that hee was a figure of Chriſt,
which vanquiſhed moe in his death than in
all his life; and it appeareth that he had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from God, in that his ſtrength being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him, was (for the acte) in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reſtored to him vpon his prayer. And
the Epiſtle to the Hebr. 11. 13. to cleere that
fact, ſaith, that he did it of faith; that is, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had deſerued to die, and that by
theſe meanes the enemies of God ſhould bee
deſtroyed, he ſubmitted himſelfe to the good
will of GGD, like a good Captaine which
ventured his life to kill his enemies: therefore
we muſt not looke to particultr examples,
but to the generall law. Wherfore let no man
doe this euill, that any good may come of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:17992:282"/>
it, but rather follow the aduiſe of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
as it becommeth vs, with patience let
vs runne out the race which is ſet before vs.</p>
            <p>Here I might ſhew you that they are guiltie
of their owne death, that kill themſelues with
ſurfetting, intemperance, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c.
although they loue their life too deare, yet
they take all meanes to haſten their deaths.
Thus much of Purgatorie, &amp; night ſpirits, and
praying for death.</p>
            <p>Nowe it remaneth, that as the Leuites ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
their brethren before they did eate the
Paſſeouer, ſo I would prepare you, before yee
eate this holy Sacrament, of which the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
was but a ſigne, The Iewes were taught
of God before they did eate the Paſſeouer to
put away leauen out of their houſes the daie
before, Exod. 12. 15. Hath God care of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?
No: this is it which the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
1. Corinth. 5. before ye come to the Lords
Supper, <hi>Purge the olde leauen of maliciouſnes
and wickedneſſe out of your hearts:</hi> that is the
leauen which you ſhould purge out of your
houſes. Therefore marke what the Apoſtle
writeth to the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 11. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it is a matter which you did neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<hi>For this cauſe many are weake and ſicke
among you, and many ſleepe or die.</hi> For what
cauſe? Becauſe they receiued this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
vnworthily, and vnreuerently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:17992:282" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they were prepared with faith, and hope,
and repentance: <hi>for this cauſe many are weak,
and ſicke among you, and many die.</hi> Who did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thinke that his ſicknes, or his wants, or his
infirmities did grow, for that he receiued the
Lords ſupper vnworthilie? Many cauſes haue
bin ſuppoſed, but this cauſe was neuer thoght
of. Haue any of you ſaid in diſtreſſes of bodie
or minde, This is come vnto me, becauſe I
did receiue the bleſſed Sacrament of Chriſt
vnworthilie, becauſe I came not prepared
with that minde, as they which beleeue and
know God? Yet the Apoſtle, which by his
diuine ſpirit knewe the cauſe of theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
among the Corinthians, dooth depute
their ſtrange diſeaſes &amp; ſodain death, to none
other cauſe but to their vnworthie and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent
receiuing of this holy Sacrament. Nay
hee ſaith further, That hee which eateth and
drinketh this Sacrament vnworthilie, eateth
and drinketh his owne damnation; that is, he
taketh poſſeſſion of death,<note place="margin">1. Co. 11. 29</note> hell, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
euen while he eates, as the diuell entred
into Iudas while he receiued. Nowe, if your
Phiſitian ſhould warne you of ſuch a thing,
that you take it in ſeaſon &amp; in meaſure, or els
it is poiſon, &amp; wil kil you; I ſuppoſe you wold
obſerue the ſeaſon and meaſure, and take it in
ſuch order as he preſcribeth, as neere as you
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:17992:283"/>
could, if you beleeue him: ſo, if yee beleeue
the Apoſtle, that you receiue the Sacrament
to your damnation, if you receiue it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie,
I am ſure you will not take it vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
or raſhly for all the world. If I had the
words of motion to ſpeak that which might
be ſpoken of this matter,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> it would fright Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
himſelfe, that no man would come to this
holy banquet without his wedding garment.
Conſider but this, how you would come into
the preſence of God, how would you prepare
your ſelues to come before the maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth, which ſearcheth the reynes, &amp;
knoweth euery corner of the heart? If euer
ye did approach vnto God, if euer yee came
neere vnto the Lord, you neuer came ſo neere
as now, when you come to receiue his bodie

by Chriſts ſeale. Chriſt hath not ordained Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
in his church for a faſhion or dumb
ſhew, that you ſhould feele, or ſee, or taſt, but
as the woman which had a bloodie flix, when
ſhe touched the hem of Chriſts garment, hee
ſaid, that vertue was gone out of him: that is,
all the graces which theſe ſignes repreſent,
that is, all the bleſſings that Chriſt Ieſus hath
purchaſed vnto man by his death. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if you receiue this Sacrament rightly,
you are vnited vnto Chriſt, as the members
with the head: if euer you did beleeue, or
loue, or repent before; this requireth you to
beleeue, and loue, and repent more, becauſe
now you are Chriſts body, which ſhewes that
ye muſt obey Chriſt the head like members
of the bodie, for the bodie is ruled by the
head. What haue you now to receiue al theſe
bleſſings? If ye haue not faith, how can you
lay hold of any promiſes or merits of Chriſt,
to ſay this is mine? If you had a hand to take
and a fayth to apprehend, now you might eat
of that bread which is better then Manna,

before you, the holieſt meat that euer you did

did eate, and yet the dangerouſt meate that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
you did eate: you ſtand vpon life or death,
you eate to ſaluation or damnation; there is
nothing in this world which you can receiue
with greater benefite, or with greater perill.
Adam did not eate the forbidden fruite with
greater danger,<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> Adam could not taſt the tree

make their enemies ſlaie them, becauſe they
were not circumciſed for Religion, but for
lucre: ſo if ye receiue for cuſtome, and not
for deuotion, this Sacrament ſhall bee to you
as Circumciſion was to them. Therefore take
heede how you receiue as they receiued, leaſt
you meere with a curſe, when you looke for a

hath numbred our daies, ſo we muſt learne to

ſee what a preſeruatiue Moſes vſed againſt
ſin and pleaſure, he kept a calendar as it were
of his daies which called vpon him, <hi>Be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
for thou haſt but a ſhort time.</hi> Fiue things
I note in theſe words: firſt that death is the
hauen of euerie man, whether hee ſit in the
throne, or keepe in a cottage, at laſt he muſt
knock at deaths doore, as all his fathers haue
done before him. Secondly, that mans time is
ſet, and his bounds appointed, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
paſſe, no more then the Egyptians could
paſſe the ſea: and therfore Moſes ſaith, <hi>Teach
vs to number our daies,</hi> as though there were a
number of our daies. Thirdly, that our daies
are few: as though we were ſent into this
world but to ſee it, and therfore Moſes ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of our life, ſpeaks of daies, not of yeeres,
nor of moneths, nor of weekes: but <hi>teach vs
to number our daies,</hi> ſhewing that it is an eaſie
thing euer for a man to number his daies they
be ſo few. Fourthly, the aptnes of man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
death rather then any thing els, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Moſes praieth the Lord to teach him to
number his daies, as though they were ſtill
ſlipping out of his minde. Laſtly, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how ſhort a time we haue to liue, wil
make vs applie our harts to that which is
good. The firſt point is, that as euery one had
a day to come into this world: ſo he ſhal haue
a day to goe out of this world. When Moſes
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:17992:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had ſpoken of ſome which liued 700. yeeres,
and other which liued 800. yeeres, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which liued 900. yeeres, ſhewing that
ſome had a longer time, and ſome a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet,
yet he ſpeakes this of all, <hi>mortuus eſt,</hi> at
laſt comes in <hi>mortuus eſt,</hi> that is, <hi>he died,</hi>
which is the Epitaph of euery man. We are
not lodged in a caſtell, but in an Inne, where
wee are but gueſts, and therefore Peter cals
vs <hi>ſtrangers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 11.</note> We are not Citizens of the
earth, but Citizens of Heauen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 19.</note> 
               <hi>we haue here no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
City, but we look for one to come.</hi> As Chriſt
ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 36.</note> 
               <hi>my kingdom is not of this world:</hi> ſo we may
ſay, My dwelling is not in this world, but the
ſoule ſoareth vpward whence ſhe came, &amp; the
body ſtoopeth downward whence it came:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> as

Euery man is a tenant at wil, &amp; ther is nothing
ſure in life, but deth: as he which wrote this is
gone, ſo I which preach it, &amp; you which heare
it, one comming in, &amp; one going out is to all.
Although this is daily ſeene, yet it had need be
prooued, nay euery man had need to die, to
make him beleeue that he ſhall die. When A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
&amp; Eue became ſubiect to death becauſe
of their ſin to teach them to think on death, ſo
ſoon as they were thruſt out of paradiſe, God
clothed them with the skins of dead beaſtes,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:17992:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which ſhewed them that now they were
cloathed with death, and that as the beaſtes
were dead whoſe skins they wore: ſo they
ſhould die alſo: therefore Dauid ſaith, <hi>Man
being in honour became like the beasts which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:</hi>
when he ſaith, that hee did become like
the beaſts which periſh, he implieth that man
ſhould not periſh like the beaſts, but when he
did like a beaſt, hee died like a beaſt. From
that day euery man might ſay with Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 17. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
was my father, and the worme was my
mother.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 22.</note> For the rich glutton is lockt in his
graue as faſt as poore Lazarus. Therfore God
ſpeaking of kings,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 6.</note> ſaith, <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods, but
ye ſhal die like men.</hi> If kings muſt die like men,
then the expectation of men is death: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when this king was readie to die, he ſaid
to Salomon,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2 2.</note> 
               <hi>that he ſhould go the way of all the
earth,</hi> calling death <hi>the way of all the earth:</hi> to
which Eſay be ares witneſſe,<note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 6.</note> crying, <hi>all fleſh is
graſſe,</hi> that is, it falleth, and is cut downe like

world we liue &amp; muſt die:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 21.</note> in heauen ſhe ſhall
liue and not die. Before ſinne nothing could
change vs: now euery thing doth change vs.
For when winter comes wee are cold, when
age comes wee are withered, when ſickneſſe
comes we are weak, to ſhew that when death
comes we ſhal die. The clothes which were

time when to exalt him,<note place="margin">Pſa. 105. 19</note> and before that time
came, hee could not bee exalted: therefore
Chriſt ſaith ſo often,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>My time is not yet come,</hi>
ſhewing that he knew the time of his bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
the time of his preaching, the time of his
working, the time of his riſing, and the time of
his aſcending.<note place="margin">2 King. 20. 1</note> As for that which is obiected of
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:17992:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ezechias, becauſe Eſaie ſhewed him that hee
ſhould die, and after tolde him that fifteene
yeres were added to his life: it is like the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of Ionas to the Niniuits,<note place="margin">Ionath. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Fortie daies and
Niniue ſhall be destroyed,</hi> and yet Niniuie was
not deſtroied, becauſe they repented: ſo Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias
was not abridged, becauſe he repented.
Therefore you muſt vnderſtand the phraſe of
God, as when we ſay that wee will iourney to
morrow, we vnderſtand <hi>If God will:</hi> ſo when
God ſaith, <hi>I will destroie,</hi> he vnderſtands, if we
perſiſt. As al the promiſes of God are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to take place if we repent, ſo all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of God are conditionall to take place if
we repent not: and therefore ſome time this
woord <hi>if,</hi> is put in, as where there is no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
nor curſing without an <hi>if.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Den. 28.</note> I may anſwere
againe, that God is a iudge, and ſpake like a
iudge to Ezechias: a iudge dooth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all whom he ſaith he will condemne,
nor a Schoolemaſter beate euerie one whom
he ſaith he will beat, to make him learne, yet
the iudge and ſchoolemaſter doe not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but menace: this is not lying but threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
But you will ſay, if any time be ſet, thus
long I ſhal liue, and I cannot paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, then I will
take no phiſicke. You may as well ſay, I will
take no meat. God hath not ordained the end
without meanes, but the meanes as well as
the end. If he haue appointed one to die in his
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:17992:291" rendition="simple:additions"/>
youth, he hath appointed ſome meanes to
ſhorten his life,<note place="margin">2 Sa. 18. 6.</note> as he did Abſolons: if he haue
appointed one to liue long, he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
alſo ſome meanes to preſerue his life, as
Ioſeph cheriſhed Iacob in his age. Therefore
though God had promiſed Paul that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſhould not be drowned,<note place="margin">Acts 27. 21.</note> yet he told the
marriners, that vnleſſe they kept in the ſhip
they ſhould bee drowned: as if their ſafety
ſhould not bee without meanes: but a good
minde dooth neuer quarrell about theſe
things.</p>
            <p>The third point is, that our life is but a ſhort
life: as many little skuls are in Golga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ha, as
great skuls: for one apple that falleth from
the tree, ten are pulled before they bee ripe,
and the parents mourne for the death of their
children, as often as the children for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
of their parents. This is our Aprill and
May wherein we floriſh, our Iune and Iuly are
next when wee ſhall bee cut downe. What a
change is this, that within foureſcore yeares
not one of this aſſemblie ſhall bee left aliue:
but another preacher, and other hearers ſhall
fill theſe roomes, and tread vpon vs where our
feete tread now?</p>
            <p>The Rauen and the Phoenix, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and the Lyon, and the Hart fulfill
their hundreds, but man dieth when he thinks
yet his ſunne riſeth, before his eye bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:17992:291" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with ſeeing, or his eare with hearing
or his heart with luſting, death knockes at
his doore, and will not giue him leaue to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
an excuſe before hee come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To ſhew the ſhortneſſe of mans life,
Moſes vſed the ſhorteſt diuiſion in nature to
expreſſe it by, he might haue ſaid, <hi>Teach me, O
Lord, to number my moneths, or my yeares,</hi> but
he ſpeakes of dayes: ſo the Scripture is woont
to number our life by dayes, and houres, and
minutes, to ſhewe vs that wee ſhall giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for houres, as well as for daies, for daies
as well as for weekes, for weekes as well as for
moneths, for moneths as well as for yeares,
which warneth vs to make vſe of all our time,
and euerie daie to thinke vpon the laſt.</p>
            <p>This was the Arithmeticke of holie men in
former times to reckon their dayes, ſo that
their time might ſeeme ſhort, to make them
<hi>applie their hearts to wiſdome:</hi> The Hebrewes
did number their dayes thus: firſt they did
deduct the time of ſleepe, ſo that if our yeeres
bee threeſcore and tenne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 10</note> as the Prophet
ſaith, fiue and thirtie of theſe yeares are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off at one blow, becauſe wee ſpend halfe
our time in ſleepe: then they did deduct the
time of youth,<note place="margin">Eccle. 11. 10</note> which Salomon calleth <hi>vanity,</hi>
as though it were not worthy to be called life
but vanitie: Then they did deduct the daies
of ſorrow, becauſe in ſorrow a man had
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:17992:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather dye then liue: ſo when the houres of
ſleepe, &amp; the houres of youth, and the houres
of ſorrowe are taken away, what an Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
is mans life come to? The Fathers vſed an
other account: Firſt they did deduct all the
time which is paſt, for the time which is paſt
is nothing: then they did deduct the time to
come, becauſe the time to come is vncertain,
and no man can ſay that he ſhall liue. Now,
when the time paſt, and the time to come is
ſet aſide, there is nothing left but the time
preſent, that is, a moment, which is not ſo
much in reſpect of eternitie, as a little mote to
the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Dauid numbered his daies by a meaſure,
<hi>My life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is like a ſpan long,</hi> Pſal. 39. 5.
when he meaſured his life, he took not a pole,
nor an ell, nor a yard to meaſure it by, but a
ſhort meaſure, his ſhort ſpan, <hi>My life is like
a ſpan long.</hi> Thus you haue learned to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your daies, or rather the houres of your
daies: as ſome came into the Vineyard in the
morning, and ſome at noone, and ſome at
night: ſo ſome goe out of this Vineyard in
the morning, ſome at noone, &amp; ſome at night:
ſome mans life hath nothing but a morning,
ſome haue a morning and noone, he which
liueth longeſt, liueth all the day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the yongeſt of all pray, but for this day: &amp;
if he liue till to morrow, then he prayeth for
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:17992:292"/>
that day, ſaying ſtill, <hi>Giue vs this day our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
bread:</hi> So that a pleaſant life may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
but to a glorious day, and a ſorrowfull
life to a clowdie day, and a long life to a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
day, and a ſhort life to a winters day.
How comes it to paſſe, that when a man dies,
all his yeares ſeeme but ſo many dayes, and
before hee dyes, all his daies ſeeme ſo many
yeares?<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 1.</note> Iob ſpeaketh of all a like, <hi>Man which
is borne of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath but a ſhort time to liue,</hi>
Iacob was 130. yeares old, and yet when hee
came before Pharaoh, he ſayd, <hi>Fewe and euill
haue my daies been.</hi> Though Pharaoh did not
ſpeake of daies, but asked him <hi>how old he was,</hi>
yet he anſwered of daies, to ſhew that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his yeares but his <hi>daies were fewe.</hi> Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
marueiling to ſee how ſodainlie men
are, and are not, compared life to a dreame in
the night, to a bubble in the water, to a ſhip in
the ſea, to an arrow which neuer reſteth till it
fall, to a player which ſpeaketh his part vpon
the ſtage, and ſtraight he giueth place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to a man which commeth to the market
to buy one thing, and ſell another, and then is
gone home againe: ſo the figure of this world
paſſeth away. This is our life, while we enioy
it we looſe it:<note place="margin">Gen. 47 9.</note> as Iacob ſayd, <hi>that his daies had
been fewe:</hi> ſo wee may ſay, that our daies ſhall
be few.</p>
            <p>Now, why hath GOD appoynted ſuch a
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:17992:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhort time to man in this world? Surely, leaſt
he ſhould deferre to doe good, as his manner
is: for though his life is ſo ſhort, yet he thinks
it too long to repent.<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 10.</note> The Prophet ſaith, <hi>that
our yeares are but threeſcore and ten,</hi> as though
this were but a little time to liue. But why
ſhould we liue ſo long? for if our life were but
a yeare, yet a yeare is more then we vſe, al the
reſt is loſt: for wee deferre till that weeke
which we thinke will be laſt. It is ſayd of the
diuell,<note place="margin">Reu. 12. 12.</note> 
               <hi>that he is buſie becauſe his time is ſhort:</hi>
but the time of man is ſhorter: and therefore
Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 42.</note> 
               <hi>In this thy day:</hi> as though no day
could bee called thy daye, but this daye: and
therefore all that thou haſt to doe, thou muſt
doe this day. Conſider this, all which trauell
toward heauen: had wee not neede to make
haſt, which muſt goe ſuch a long iourney in
ſuch a ſhort time? How can he chooſe but
run, which remembreth that euery day run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
away with his life?</p>
            <p>The fourth poynt is our aptneſſe to forget
death rather then any thing els, and therefore
Moſes praieth the Lord to teach him to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his daies, as though they were ſtill ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out of his minde. He which hath num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
our daies, muſt teach vs to number our
daies: for when Moſes prayeth the Lorde to
teach him to number his daies, he ſignifieth
that he would very faine remember them, but
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:17992:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtill his minde did turne from them, and that
he could not thinke vpon them longer then
he thought on the Lord, which taught him to
number them: ſuch is the rebellion of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wee cannot remember that which wee
ſhould, becauſe we reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ſo many things
which we ſhould forget. How often doth the
Scripture cal death to our minds? Yet we read
how they put the day of death from them,<note place="margin">Amos. 6. 3.</note> &amp;
would not remember it. Salomon bids vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that we ſhal come to iudgement, &amp;
yet we reade how they pleade againſt the day
of iudgement, and ſyllogize to their ſinnes,
<hi>That all things ſhall continue as they be,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 11. 9.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe
there hath been no chaunge yet:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 4.</note> euen ſo it is
with vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1.</note> 
               <hi>as the foole ſaith in his hart, there is no
God:</hi> ſo we ſay in our hearts there is no death,
or at leaſt death will not come before we bee
old. Of al numbers we cannot skill to number
our daies: we can number our ſheepe &amp; our
oxen, &amp; our coyn: but we think that our daies
are infinite, &amp; therfore we neuer go about to
number the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We can number other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s daies
and yeres, &amp; think they wil die ere it be long,
if we ſee them ſick, or ſore, or old, but we can
not nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber our own. When two ſhips meet on
the ſea, they which are in one ſhip thinke that
the other ſhip doth ſaile exceeding faſt: but
that their ſhip goeth faire and ſoftly, or rather
ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſtil, although in truth one ſhip ſaileth
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:17992:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as faſt as the other: ſo euery man thinkes that
other poſt, and run, and flye to the graue, but
that himſelfe ſtandeth ſtocke ſtill, although
indeede a yeare with him is no longer then it
is with other: beſide that, we are giuen to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
death, wee ſtriue to forget it, like them
which ſay, <hi>we may not remember. Teach me to
number my daies:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos. 6. 10.</note> nay, teach me to multiplie
my daies, teach me to remember death, nay,
teach me to prolong death: or if I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
death, teach me to forget death, that I
may ſinne without feare: for the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of death maketh a man to ſinne fearefully, &amp;
takes away the pleaſure of ſinne. Therefore if
ye mark, there is a kind of men which cannot
abide to heare of death, they are ſick with the
name of it: the reaſon is, Achab cannot abide
Michaiah,<note place="margin">1. King. 22.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe hee neuer prophecied good
vnto him but euill:</hi> ſo death neuer prophecied
good to the wicked but euill, for which they
cannot abide it. Therefore as Pharaoh bad
Moſes goe out of his ſight: ſo they bid death
goe out of their ſight, and ſay when he comes
as Achab ſaid to Eliah, Art thou here my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould ſay, welcome my frend?
For as the diuels thought Chriſt was come to
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them: ſo the vngodly think that death
comes to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them. Is it peace, when they
ſee death, they doubt it is not peace, becauſe
they neuer loued the God of peace. O that I
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:17992:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could bring you into their hearts, that yee
might ſee more then tongue can expreſſe: for
I doe not thinke that any Epicure, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or Nonreſident, haue any ioy to thinke
of death, or deſire to be diſſolued, but rather
that hee might neuer bee diſſolued, becauſe
death coms to the wicked like a iayler, which
comes alwaies to hale vnto priſon: therefore
their care is not to remember death, that <hi>they
might apply their hearts to wiſedome:</hi> but to
forget death, leſt they ſhould <hi>apply their harts
to wiſedome,</hi> and looſe their pleaſures before
the time: for he which is not purpoſed yet to
leaue his ſinnes, would not be troubled with
any thought that might make him take his
pleaſure fearefully, leaſt he ſhould leaue ſinne
before ſinne leaue him. Therefore the diuell
doth neuer teach a man to number his daies,
becauſe he gains by the forgetfulnes of death:
but the Lord which would haue a man <hi>to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
his heart to wiſedome,</hi> it is he which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs to number our daies: and therfore Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
praieth vnto him, &amp; becauſe we pray not
vnto him as he did, to teach vs <hi>to number our
daies,</hi> therefore we die like wormes before we
be aware. So farre we are from that which he
ſhooteth at, <hi>to apply his heart to wiſedome,</hi> that
we are not in the way vnto it, that is, to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that wee ſhall die. The laſt poynt is the
cauſe why Moſes would learne to number
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:17992:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his daies, <hi>that he might apply his heart to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, vntill men think vpon
death, they neuer applie their hearts to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but buſie themſelues with worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as though they were fethering a neſt that
ſhould neuer be pulled down. Wiſedom hath
alwaies carried that ſhew of excellencie, that
the very wicked haue laboured to put on this
vizard: as we reade of Pharao, who to couer
his fooliſhnes,<note place="margin">Exod. 1. 10.</note> ſaith, <hi>Come let vs do wiſely.</hi> And
again, it is ſaid, that the Grecians ſought after

               <hi>They do not ſauor the things of God.</hi>

Yes, yes, if they were not taught to be
ſimple as doues.<note place="margin">Matt. 10. 6.</note> But this wiſdome comes not
by the remembrance of death, but by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes
of death. Men do not vſe to think of

ſay like the ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">Gen 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>We ſhall not die.</hi> Two things

her: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of death makes
vs applie our harts vnto it. Touching the firſt,
Moſes found ſome fault with himſelfe, that
for al he had heard &amp; ſeene, and obſerued, and
was counted wiſe: yet he was new to begin,
and had not applied his heart to learne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 2.</note>
like the wiſe man which ſaith, <hi>I am more
fooliſh then any man, I haue not the wiſedome of
a man in me.</hi> So vnſatiable and couetous (as I
may ſay) are the ſeruants of GOD, the more
wiſedome, and faith, and zeale they haue, the
more they deſire. Moſes ſpeaketh of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as if it were Phiſicke, which doth no
good before it be applied, and the part to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
it too is the heart, where all mans affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are to loue it and cheriſh it like a kind
hoſteſſe: when the heart ſeeketh, it findeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
though it were brought vnto her like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams
Ramme. Therefore GOD ſaith,

way to get wiſedome, is to applie our hearts
vnto it, as if it were your calling and liuing to
which you are bound prentiſes. A man may
applie his eares, &amp; his eyes, as many trewants
doe to their bookes, &amp; yet neuer proue ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
but from that day which a man begins
to applie his heart vnto wiſedom, he learneth
more in a moneth after, then he did in a yeare
before, nay, then euer he did in his life. Euen
as you ſee the wicked, becauſe they applie
their hearts to wickednes, how faſt they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,
how eaſily and how quickly they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
perfect ſwearers, expert drunkards,
cunning deceiuers: ſo if ye could applie your
hearts as throughly to knowledge and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
you might become like the Apoſtle
which teacheth you. Therefore when Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſheweth men the way how to come by
wiſedome, he ſpeakes often of the heart, as
<hi>Giue thine heart to wiſedome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Let wiſedome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into thine heart, Get wiſedome, Keepe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 45. 13. 8.</note>
               <hi>Embrace wiſedome:</hi> as though a man
went a wooing for wiſedome. Wiſedome is
like Gods daughter, that he giueth to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that loueth her, and ſueth for her, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to ſet her at his heart.</p>

Thus we haue learned how to apply know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that it may do vs good, not to our eares
like them which heare Sermons onely; nor
to our tongues, like them which make table
talke of religion; but to our hearts, that wee
may ſay like the virgin,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> 
               <hi>My heart doth magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Lord:</hi> and the heart will applie it to the
eare,<note place="margin">Mar. 12. 14</note> and to the tongue, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi>
The laſt poynt is, that the remembrance of
death makes vs to applie our hearts to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Moſes commended not many bookes
to make a wiſe man learned, but as Dauid
commends one booke in ſtead of many:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
in the Law of God day and night:</hi> for, <hi>the
reading of many bookes</hi> (ſayth Salomon) <hi>is
but wearineſſe to the fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 12.</note> Therefore as though
Moſes had marked what did moue him moſt
to ſeeke after GOD, hee prayeth that that
thought may run in his mind ſtill, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of death. As many benefits come vnto
vs by death: ſo many benefites come vnto vs
by the remembrance of death, and this is one,
It maketh a man to applie his heart to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
For when he conſidereth that he hath
but a ſhort time to liue, he is carefull to ſpend
it wel,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 26.</note> like Moſes, of whom it is ſaid, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered how he had but a ſeaſon to liue,
he choſe rather to ſuffer afflictions with the
ſeruants of God, than to enioy the pleaſures
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:17992:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſinne for a ſeaſon. This is that which makes
the olde men faſt, and watch, and prepare
themſelues more than young, becauſe they
thinke themſelues neerer the doore, like olde
Iſaac, which when he was blinde for age, ſaid
vnto Eſau,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I am now old, and know not
the day of my death;</hi> that is, becauſe I am old,
I looke to die ſhortly. And therfore as Eſay
taught Ezechias,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 20. 1</note> to ſet all things in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died: ſo he called his eldeſt ſonne, to
whom hee thought that the inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
that he might bleſſe him before he
died. This wiſdome the Fathers called, <hi>the
wiſdome of the croſſe,</hi> which wee call the beſt,
becauſe it was deereſt bought. It is hard for a
man to think of a ſhort life, and think euil; or
to think of a long life, and thinke wel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieremie had numbred al the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

to this,<note place="margin">Lam. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> 
               <hi>She remembred not her end:</hi> ſo if I may
iudge why natural men care for nothing but
their pomp, why great men care for nothing
but their honour and dignitie, why couetous
worldlings care for nothing but their gaine,
why voluptuous Epicures care for nothing
but their pleaſure? I may ſay with Ieremie,
<hi>They rememember not their end.</hi> We neuer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
the ſame things liuing and dying: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when Salomon had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of men, at laſt he oppoſeth this Memora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:17992:298"/>
as a counterpoyſe againſt them all;<note place="margin">Eccl. 11. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that for al thoſe things thou ſhalt come
to iudgement:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Men would
neuer ſpeake as they ſpeake, nor doe as they
doe, if they did but thinke that theſe ſpeeches
and deeds ſhould come to iudgement. As the
bird guideth her flight with her traine: ſo the
life of man is beſt directed by a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
vnto his end. The thoght of death hath
made many ſinnes auoid like the diuel, when
Chriſt alleaged Scripture:<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> it is like a ſtrainer,
all the thoughts, and ſpeeches, and actions
which come through it are clenſed and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
like a cloth, which commeth out of the
water. Seeing then that ſo much fruit growes
of one ſtalk, which is the numbring of our
daies, let vs conſider what an harueſt we haue
loſt, which happily before this day neuer
prayed with Moſes, that the Lord wold teach
vs to number our dayes. What if we had died
in the dayes of our ignoraunce, like Iudas
which hanged himſelfe before he could ſee
the Paſſion or Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Mat 27. 5.</note> or aſcenſion of
Chriſt? But God hath cared for vs more then
we haue cared for our ſelues. We ſhould haue
numbred our dayes and ſinnes too, but
alas, howe many dayes haue wee ſpent, and
yet neuer thought why any day was giuen
vs? But as the olde yeere went, and a newe
yeere came, ſo we thought that a new would
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:17992:299"/>
follow that, and ſo we think that another will
come after this, and ſo they thought, which
are dead already. This is not to number our
dayes, but to prouoke GOD to ſhorten our
daies: there are few here which haue not ſeen
twentie years; now if we had but euery yeare
learned one vertue ſince we were borne, we
might by this time haue been like Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men: but the time is yet to come when
we muſt applie our hearts to wiſdome. To ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
&amp; pleaſures we haue applyed our harts,
and our eyes, and our eares, and our handes
too, but to wiſdome we haue not applyed our
hearts.</p>
            <p>There may be many cauſes, but there ſhuld
be no cauſe if wee had numbred our dayes.
For ſurely if a man could perſwade himſelfe
that this is his laſt day, as it may be, he would
not deferre his repentance vntill to morrow.
If he could think that this is his laſt meale that
euer he ſhall eate, hee would not ſurfet: if he
could beleeue that the words which he doth
ſpeake to day, ſhould be the laſt that euer he
ſhould ſpeake, he would not offend with his
tongue: if hee could be perſwaded that this
ſermon ſhould be the laſt ſermon that euer he
ſhould heare, he would heare it better then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he heard any yet. Yet breath is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and the heart may applie it ſelfe, and the
eye may applie it ſelfe, and the eare may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:17992:299"/>
it ſelfe, and the hand may applie it ſelfe.
<hi>Worke while it is light.</hi> I can but teach you
with words, as Iohn Baptized with water. As
Moſes prayed the Lord to teach him <hi>to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his dayes:</hi> ſo you muſt pray the Lord to
teach you to number your dayes. And now I
lead you to number your dayes. It may bee
that thou haſt but twenty years to ſerue God,
wilt thou not liue twenty yeares like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
that thou maieſt liue a thouſand yeares
like an Angel? It may bee that thou haſt but
tenne yeeres to ſerue him, wilt thou not ſerue
tenne yeares for heauen, which wouldſt ſerue
twenty yeares for a farme?</p>
            <p>It may be, that thou haſt but fiue yeares to
ſerue God, wilt thou ſpend fiue yeares wel to
redeeme all thy yeares for fiue? Yet GOD
doth knowe whether many here haue ſo long
to repent for all the yeares which they haue
ſpent in ſinne? If thou were borne but to day,
thy iourney is not an hundred yeares? If thou
be a man, halfe thy time is ſpent already: if
thou be an olde man, then thou art drawing
to thy Inne, and thy race is but a breath: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Chriſt ſaid vnto his Diſciples when he
found them ſleeping,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 40</note> 
               <hi>Could ye not watch one
houre?</hi> So I ſay to my ſelfe, and to you, can we
not pray? can we not ſuffer a little while? He
which is tyred can crawle a little way, a little
farther, one ſteppe more for a kingdome. For
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:17992:300"/>
this cauſe God wold not haue men know whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they ſhall die, becauſe they ſhould make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
at all times, hauing no more certaintie of
one houre than another. Therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
ſaith, watch becauſe you know not
when the Lord will come to take you, or to
iudge you, <hi>Happy are they which hear the word
and keepe it.</hi> Thus you ſee that death is the laſt
vpon earth, that the time of man is ſet, that
his race is ſhort, that he thinkes not of it, that
if he did remember it, it would make him
applie his minde to good, as he doth to euill:
and nowe I ende as I began. The Lord
teach vs to number our dayes, that
wee may applie our hearts
to wiſedome, Amen.</p>

<hi>Then</hi> (ſayth Moſes) <hi>Noah began to bee an

<pb n="576" facs="tcp:17992:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is giuen to Noah after the flood, hee is called

is mentioned, was the planting of a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.
One would thinke, when all men were

a King goe to plough, a Noble man driue the

therein; which may teach vs humilitie,
though we learne to diſdaine husbandrie: of
whom will we learne to be humble, if Kings
giue examples, and the ſonne of GOD

yet we contemne the example of Kings of
the earth, and the example of the King of

            <p>The time was when Adam digged and
delued, when Dauid kept ſheepe, and all the
houſe of Iacob were called men occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
cattell: but as they for this were abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
to the Egyptians (as Moſes ſaith in

are abhorred of their brethren: &amp; they which
liue by them, ſcorne them for their worke,
which would be chaſtened themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they worke not: There was no Arte
nor Science, which was ſo much ſet by in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

bringing leſſe profit vnto it ſelf,
that may ſo iuſtly complaine of her fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

liue by her, as this painfull Science of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie:
that it is marueil that any man will
take paine for the reſt, to be contemned for
his labour, and be a ſcorne for the reſt, which
might hunger and ſtarue, if he did not labour
for them more then they do themſelues. No
maruel then though many in the poore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,

murmure &amp; complaine that other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

but it is maruell if their complaint doe
not growe in time of rebell on, and pull other
as lowe as themſelues: for why ſhould the
greateſt payne yeeld the leaſt profit? yet this
is their eaſe, for if you marke, you ſhal ſee that
the husband-man doth bate the price of his
fruits ſo ſoon as the dearth is paſt, though he
rayſeth it a little, while the dearth laſteth:
but they which raiſe the price of their wares
with him, ſeldome fall againe, but make men
pay as deere when the dearth is paſt, as if it
were a dearth ſtil. Thus a plentiful yeere doth

the law neerer: that is, thou ſhalt gette
thy liuing in the ſweate of thy browes; then
this poore ſonne of Adam, which pickes his
crums out of the earth: therfore he ſhould not
be mocked for his labor, which hath vexation
enough, though all men ſpake well of him, &amp;
in my opinion, if any deſerue to be loued for
his innocencie, or for his trueth, or his paine,
or the good which he brings to the common
wealth: this Realme is not ſo much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:17992:302"/>
to any ſorte of men (but thoſe that feede
the ſoule) as thoſe which feede the body, that
is, thoſe that labour the earth: yet you ſee how
they liue like drudges, as though they were
your ſeruants to prouide foode for you, and
after to bring it to your doores: as the beaſts
ſerue them, ſo they ſerue you; as though
you were another kinde of men. I cannot
thinke vpon their miſerie, but my thoughts
tels me, that it is a great part of our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
that we neuer conſider what an eaſie
life and liuing God hath giuen vnto vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of them. If the Apoſtles rule were kept,
they which doe not worke ſhould not eate:
but now they which do not work eate moſt:
and the husband-men which worke eate not,
but are like Bees, which prepare foode for
other and pyne themſelues. Let vs conſider
this, for they had not one lawe and wee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but the ſame curſe which was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vpon Adam, was denounced vpon all
his children, that euery man ſhould get his
liuing in the ſweat of his browes. Although I
knowe there bee diuers workes, and diuers
gifts, and diuers callings to worke in; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prouided, they which doe not worke
ſhould not eat, for in the ſweat of thy browes,
that is, in labor and trauel, thou king, and thou
Iudge, and thou Prelate, and thou Land-lord,
and thou Gentleman, ſhalt gette thy liuing
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:17992:303" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as Adam thy Father did: or elſe thou doeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
the curſe, and a greater curſe ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
that is, they which wil not ſweat in earth,
ſhall ſweate in hell.</p>
            <p>Adam had foode as wel as thou, and ſo had
Noah, and more then thou, vnleſſe thou hadſt
all, for they had all, and yet they might not be
idle, becauſe their handes were not giuen
them for nothing. Some worke with their
penne, ſome with their tongues, ſome with
their fingers: as nature hath made nothing
idle, ſo God would haue no man idle, but that
he which is a Magiſtrate, ſhould do the work
of a Magiſtrate: hee which is a Iudge, ſhould
doe the worke of a Iudge: he which is a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
ſhould doe the worke of a Captaine:
he which is a Miniſter, ſhould doe the worke
of a Miniſter: as when Noah was called an
husband-man, he did the worke of an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man.
This contempt of the Countrey,
doth threaten danger to the land as much as
any thing els in our daies, vnles their burthen
bee eaſed, and their eſtimation qualified in
ſome part to their paines. Thinking that you
haue not heard of this theame before, ſeeing
the wordes of my Texte did lie for it, thus
much haue I ſpoken to put you in mind how
eaſily you liue in reſpect of them, &amp; to certifie
your mindes towards our poore brethren,
which in deede ſeeme too baſe in our eyes
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:17992:303"/>
and are ſcorned for their labours, as much as
we ſhould be for our idlenes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith Moſes) <hi>Noah began to bee an
huſbandman.</hi> In that it is here ſayd that <hi>Noah
began,</hi> it doth not diſproue that he gaue not
himſelfe to husbandrie before, but it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that Noah began to ſet vp husbandrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
after the floud, before any other: ſo this
good man recomforted with the experience
of Gods fauour, (which had exempted him &amp;
his ſeede out of all the world) and reioycing
to ſee the face of the earth againe after the
waters were gone, though then an olde man,
and weake he was, yet he returneth to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
afreſh, and ſcorned not to till and plant
for all his poſſeſſions, as though hee were an
husbandman: ſuch a lowlines is alwaies ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the feare of GOD, that they that
are humbled with Religion, doe not thinke
themſelues too good to doe any good thing.
Heere note by the way, that none of Noahs
ſonnes are ſayde to begin this worke: but
Noah himſelfe, the olde man, the hoary head
and carefull Father begins to teach the reſt,
and ſhewes his ſonnes the waye how they
ſhould prouide for their ſonnes: and how all
the world after ſhould liue by labour and
trauell, till they returne to duſt: ſo the olde
man whom age diſpenſeth withall, to take
his eaſe, is more willing to prouide for the
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:17992:304" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wants of his children, then they are which are
bound to labour for themſelues and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to: as the Storke doth feede the damme
when ſhe is olde, becauſe the damme fed her
when ſhe was young: what a ſhame is this
to Shem and Iapheth, that is, to vs which
are yong &amp; ſtrong, that the father ſhould be
called a labourer, when the ſonnes ſtand by.</p>
            <p>Now, the grounde was barren becauſe of
the floud, and could not bring forth fruite of
it ſelfe, becauſe of the curſe: therefore it pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
Noah to ſee deſolation and barrenneſſe,
and ſlime vpon the face of the earth, which he
had ſeene ſo glorious and ſweete, and fertill,
with all manner of hearbes, and fruites, and
flowers before. Therefore he ſetteth himſelfe
to manure it, which wanted for nothing now
but a painful labourer to till and dreſſe it, that
it might bring forth delights and profites for
ſinfull man, as it did before.</p>
            <p>By this wee may learne to vſe all meanes
for the obtayning of Gods bleſſings, and not
to looſe any thing which wee might haue or
ſaue for want of paines, for that is ſinne, as
Salomon noteth in the foure and twentith of
the Prouerbes, when he reproueth the ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
husbandman, becauſe his fielde brought
forth Nettles and Thiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les in ſtead of grapes:
not becauſe the grounde would not beare
grapes, but becauſe the ſlouthfull man would
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:17992:304"/>
not ſet them. Shall God commaund the earth
and all his creatures to encreaſe for vs, and
ſhall not wee further their encreaſe for our
ſelues? As we encreaſe and multiplie our
ſelues, ſo wee are bound to ioyne hand and
helpe, that all creatures may increaſe and
multiplie too, or els the Fathers ſhould eate
the childrens portion, and in time there
ſhould bee nothing left for them that come
after: this regard Noah ſeemeth to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his poſteritie, and therefore he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnto husbandrie, which is commended
in him vnto this day, and ſhall be recorded of
him, ſo long as this booke is read: whereby
we are warned, that he which liueth onely to
himſelfe, is not to bee remembred of them
which liue after.</p>
            <p>But as Dauid cared how the Realm ſhould
bee gouerned after his death, as well as he did
during his life: ſo though we dye and depart
this world, yet we ſhould leaue that example,
or thoſe bookes or thoſe workes behinde vs,
which may profite the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
when wee are dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
as much as we did when we liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them: euen as Noah planted a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde,
not for himſelfe, but for the ages to
come after.</p>
            <p>Some doe thinke that Noah planted the
firſt Vineyard, and drunke the firſt wine, and
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:17992:305"/>
that there was no vſe of grapes before: which
opinion they are led vnto, that they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
Noah and mittigate his fault, if hee did
ſippe too deepe of that cup, the ſtrength and
operation whereof was not knowne vnto
him, nor vnto any man before: but it is not
like, that the excellent licour and wholeſome
iuice of the Grape, did lye hidde from the
world ſo many hundreth yeres, and no doubt
but there were Vines from the beginning,
created with other trees: for how coulde
Noah plant a Vineyard, vnles he had ſlippes
of other Vines, or Grapes that grew before,
ſeeing hee did not create fruites, but plant
fruites as we doe? For this is principally to be
noted, that ſo ſoone as he had opportunitie
to doe good, he omitted no time, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the floud was gone, and the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to drie, hee plied it with ſeedes, and
wrought it, till hee ſawe the fruites of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
By this we learne to omit no occaſion
to doe good, but whenſoeuer wee may doe
good, to count it ſinne if we doe it not. But
if we be ſo exerciſed, then all our workes ſhall
proſper like the Vineyard of Noah, becauſe
the fruite of the Vine dooth cheere the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
and glad the heart of man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome haue gathered vpon the planting
of this Vineyard, a ſignification of gladneſſe
and thankefulneſſe in Noah for his late
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:17992:305" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliuerance, as the Iewes by their ſolemne
feaſtes did celebrate the memoriall of ſome
great benefite: but I rather iudge, that God
would haue vs ſee in this example, what men
did in thoſe daies, and how we are degenerate
from our parents, that wee may prepare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the fire, as Noah prepared againſt the
water. This is worthie to bee noted too, that
God did not ſo regarde his husbandrie, but
that hee had an eye to his drunkennes, and
ſpeakes of his fault as wel as his vertue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are warned, that though God bleſſe vs
now while wee remember him, yet hee will
chaſten vs ſo ſoone as we forget him: though
we be in good name now, infamie will ariſe
in an houre: though we be rich at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
pouertie may come ſuddainely: though
we be well while wee are here, yet we may
fall ſicke before night, euen as Noah is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in one verſe, and diſprayſed in another:
euen now God commends him for his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
and now diſcommends him for his
drunkenneſſe: as though he had forgot all his
righteouſnes ſo ſoone as he ſinned, &amp; would
cal in his praiſe againe. This was to ſhew, that
Noah was not ſaued from the floud, becauſe
hee deſerued to be ſaued; but becauſe God
had a fauour vnto him: for he which was
not drowned with water, was drowned
after with Wine. As the Phariſies when
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:17992:306"/>
they had doone well, were proud of it, and
loſt their reward: ſo when Noah had done a
good worke hee ſpotted it with ſinne, and
was diſpraiſed where hee was praiſed, as
though God repented him that he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. He planted well, but he drunke not
well: therefore that which was good did
him hurt: then ſeeing hee was trapped with
a good worke, whatſoeuer we doo, we may
remember how eaſie it is to ſinne, if wee
miſſe in the matter, or in the manner, or time,
or the place, or the meaſure, as Noah did. He
which planteth the vineyard, is worthy to
taſte of the grape, but if thou haue found hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
(ſaith Salomon) eate not too much leaſt
thou ſurfet. So if thou haue found Wine,
drinke not too much, leaſt thou ſurfet. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Wine is better than a great deale, and if
thou wilt follow the Apoſtles counſell, thou
muſt drinke it but for thy ſtomacks ſake, leaſt
that happen to thee, which thou ſhalt heare
of this noble Patriarch. Though he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo righteous before GOD and men,
though hee eſcaped the deſtruction, which
lighted vppon all the worlde, though hee
had all the foules of the ayre, and beaſtes
of the land at his commaund, though hee
paſſed the pilgrimage of man nine hundreth
yeares, yet Noah was but a man, ſo aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
ſo righteous, ſo mightie, ſo happie: Noah
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:17992:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhewed himſelfe but a man for drinking the
Wine which himſelfe had planted: hee was
drunken. This is Noahs fault, he was drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with his owne Wine, as Lot was defiled
with his owne daughters. If Cham his ſonne
had taken too much, and ſtript himſelfe as
his father did, the holy Ghoſt would ſcarce
haue ſpoken of it, becauſe hee was a man of
no note: but when the father forgat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and gaue this offence, marke the manner
of the holy Ghoſt, as though he would ſhew
you a wonder: hee diſplayeth Noahs drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
as Cham diſplayed his nakedneſſe:
as if he would ſay, come and ſee the ſtrength
of man. Hee which was counted ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
hee which beleeued the threatning, like
Lot when the reſt mocked, he to whom al the
foules of the ayre and the beaſtes of the earth
flocked in couples, as they came to Adam He
which was reſerued to declare the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of God, and to begin the world againe. Noah
the example of ſobrietie, the example of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
is ouercome with drinke, as if hee
had neuer been the man. How eaſily, how
quic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, the iuſt, the wiſe, the prudent, hath
loſt his ſence, his memorie, his reaſon, as
though he had neuer been the man. And how
hard it is to auoyd ſinne, when occaſion is at
hand, and pleaſant opportunitie tempteth to
ſinne? It is eaſier for the bird to go by the net,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:17992:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than to breake the net: ſo it is eaſier for a man
to auoyde temptations, then to ouercome
temptations. Therefore God forbad Balaam,
not only to curſe the people, as Balaac would
haue him, but he forbad him to goe with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laacs
ſeruants, knowing that if he went with
them, and ſawe the pompe of the court, and
heard the King himſelfe ſpeake vnto him, and
felt the tickling reward, it would ſtraine his
conſcience, and make him doubt whether
he ſhould curſe or bleſſe. Peter but warming
himſelfe at Caiphas fire, was ouercome by a
ſilly damſell to doo that which hee neuer
thought, euen to forſweare his Lord God:
therefore Daniel would not eate of the Kings
meate, leaſt hee ſhould bee tempted to the
Kings will, ſhewing vs that there is no way
to eſcape ſinne, but to auoyd occaſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Dauid prayeth, <hi>Turne away mine eyes
from vanitie:</hi> as though his eyes would draw
his heart, as the baite tilleth on the hooke.
Noah thought to drink, he thought not to be
drunke: but as hee which commeth to the
fielde to ſound the Trumpet, is ſlaine as ſoone
as he which commeth to fight: ſo the ſame
wine diſtempereth Noah, which hath diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
ſo many ſince. Where he thought to
take his reward, &amp; taſte the fruite of his owne
hands, God ſet an euerlaſting blot vpon him,
which ſticks faſt till this day, like a bar in his
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:17992:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
armes, ſo long as the name of Noath is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, that we cannot reade of his vertue, but
wee muſt reade of his ſinne, whereby euerie
man is warned, to receiue the gifts of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently,
to vſe them ſoberly, and to ſanctifie
himſelfe, before he reach forth his hand vnto
them that they may comfort and profite vs,
with that ſecret bleſſing, that God hath hid in
them, or elſe euery thing the beſt gifts of God
may hurt vs: as this pleaſant wine ſtayned
and confounded the great Patriarch, when
hee delighted too much in it, which hee
might haue drunke as Chriſt did at the laſt
Supper, and this diſgrace had neuer beene
written in his ſtorie; but God would haue a
fearefull example, like the piller of Salt, to
ſtand before thoſe beaſts, whoſe onely ſtrife is
to make triall who can quaffe deepeſt, and
ſhew all their valiantneſſe in wine. Becauſe
there is ſuch warning before vs, now we haue
the drunkard in ſchooling, I will ſpend the
time that is left, to ſhew you the deformity of
this ſin, if any heare me which haue bin ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken

him till hee bee a foole, and ſtealeth away his
ſence &amp; wit, his memory, his health, his credit,
his friends, and when ſhee hath ſtripped him
as bare as Noah, then ſhee expoſeth him like
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:17992:308"/>
Noah to Cham, &amp; all that ſee him do mocke
him: it is wonder almoſt that any man ſhould
be drunke that hath ſeene a drunkard before,
ſwelling, and puſſing, and foming, and ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and groueling like a beaſt for who would
be like a beaſt, for all the world? Looke vpon
the drunkard when his eies ſtare; his mouth
driuels, his tongue faulters, his face flames,
his handes tremble, hys feete reele? how vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
how monſtrous, how loathſome doth he
ſeeme to thee, ſo loathſome doſt thou ſeeme
to others when thou art in like taking. And
how loathſome then dooſt thou ſeeme to
God? Therfore the firſt law which Adam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of God, was abſtinence, which if hee
had kept, he had kept all vertues beſide, but
intemperancie loſt all. In abſtinence the law
came to Moſes, &amp; he faſted when he receiued
it, to ſhew that they which receiue the word
of God, receiue it ſoberly.</p>
            <p>A temperate man ſeldome ſinneth, becauſe
the fleſh which dooth tempt is mortified,
leaſt it ſhould tempt: but when the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
is aboue the miſtres, and a man hath loſt
the Image of God and ſcarce retayneth the
image of man, all his thoughts and ſpeeches,
and actions muſt needs be ſinne, and nothing
but ſinne, becauſe ſobrietie the bond of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is broken; which kept all together. When
didſt thou want diſcretion to conſider?
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:17992:308"/>
When didſt thou want patience to forgiue?
When didſt thou wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie to refraine?
When didſt thou want hart to pray, but when
ſobrietie is fled away, and intemperancie
filled her roome? If ſhame let to ſinne, it caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out ſinne: if feare let to ſinne, it caſteth out
feare: if loue let to ſinne, it expulſeth loue: if
knowledge let to ſinne, it expulſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
like a couetous Land-lord, which
would haue all to himſelfe and dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>There is no ſinne but hath ſome ſhew of
vertue, onely the ſinne of drunkennes is like
nothing but ſinne: there is no ſin, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it hurt the ſoule, it beautifieth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or promiſeth profite, or pleaſure, or glory,
or ſomething to his ſeruants, onely drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is ſo impudent, that it deſcryeth it ſelfe:
ſo vnthankful that it maketh no recompence:
ſo noyſome, that it conſumeth the body,
which many ſinnes ſpare, leaſt they ſhould
appeare to bee ſinnes. Euery ſinne defileth a
man, but drunkenneſſe makes him like a

taketh away the image of a man:
euery ſinne robbeth a man of ſome vertue,
but drunkenneſſe ſtealeth away all vertues at

drunkenneſſe vpbraids a man while the wine

               </gap> in his ſtomacke; and though hee would
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:17992:309"/>
diſſemble his drunkenneſſe, yet hee is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſet a countenance of it, but the childe
deſcryeth him, the foole knowes that he is
drunke, becauſe his face bewraieth him, like
the leproſie which burſt out of the forehead:
ſo worthily hath he loſt the opinion of ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
which hath loſt it ſelfe. His ſonne
thinkes himſelfe more maiſter now than his
father: his ſeruant makes him a foole, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
leades him like a childe; his wife vſeth
him like a ſeruant, and although his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
leaueth him when he hath ſlept, yet no
man ſeckes to him for counſell after, no man
regards his word, no man reckons of his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no man is perſwaded by his counſell,
no man accounts of his learning, no man hath
any glorie to accompany with him, but ſo
ſoone as drunkenes hath made him like a
beaſt euery man abhorreth him like a beaſt,
as they did Nabuchadnezzar: the ſpirit flyeth
from him leaſt he ſhould greiue it, his friends
goe awaie leaſt he ſhould ſhame them, and
no vertues dare come neere, leaſt he ſhould
defile them. How many things flie out when
wine goes in? How is it then, that hee
which loueth himſelfe, can be ſo cruell to
himſelfe? that he ſhould loue his life, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his life? that he ſhould loue his health, and
deſtroy his health? that hee ſhould loue his
ſtrength, and weaken his ſtrength? that hee
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:17992:309"/>
ſhoulde loue his wealth, and conſume his
wealth? that he ſhould loue his credite, and
cracke his credite? that hee ſhould loue his
vnderſtanding, and ouerturne his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
that he ſhould loue his beautie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his beautie? The Poets neede fayne no
more, that men are transformed into beaſts,
for if they were liuing now, they ſhould ſee
men like beaſts: ſome like Lyons, ſome like
Wolues, ſome like Foxes, ſome like Beares,
ſome like Swine: who is the beaſt, when the
beaſts ſatisfie nature, and man ſatisfieth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite?
when the beaſts keepe meaſure, and
man exceedes meaſure? when the beaſts are
ſound labouring, and man found ſurfetting?
who is the beaſt? I haue read of a bird which
hath the face of a man, but is ſo cruell of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that ſometime for hunger ſhee will ſet
vpon a man and ſlaye him: after, when ſhee
comes for thirſt vnto the water to drinke ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the face in the water, like the face of him
whom ſhee deuoured, for griefe that ſhee
hath killed one like her ſelfe, takes ſuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
that ſhee neuer eateth nor drinketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but beates and frets and pines her ſelfe
to death. What wilt thou doe then which
haſt not ſlaine one like thy ſelfe, but thy ſelfe,
thy verie ſelfe, with a cup of wine, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereſt
ſo many graces &amp; vertues in an houre?</p>
            <p>As Eſau ſolde his lande and liuing for a
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:17992:310"/>
meſſe of pottage, ſo the drunkard ſelleth his
ſenſe, and wit, and memorie, and credite, for a
cuppe of wine. Thou haſt not murthered thy
brother like Caine, but thou haſt murthered
thy ſelfe, like Iudas: as the Rechabites abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               </gap>all

which was hid ſixe hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>Ten times more might bee ſayd agaynſt
this vice, but if I haue ſayd enough to make

hee was an olde man, and therefore
might ſoone bee taken cup-ſhot: ſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Wines were hotter in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
then they are with vs: ſome, becauſe of
his change of drinkes, which had not wonted
himſelfe to wine before: ſome, becauſe as
moſt men delight in that which by great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
they haue brought to paſſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felues,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:17992:310"/>
ſo no maruel though Noah had a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his owne grapes? following herein the
example of a curious Cooke, which dooth ſip
and ſip his broth, to taſte whether it bee well
ſeaſoned, that he may amend it if he can, or
amend the next: but as the flye by often
dallying with the candle, at laſt ſcorcheth her

and at laſt was drunke: yet this is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him for his fault, that he was drunke, as
the puniſhment which followes doth witnes.
Such is the prouidence of God, that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
might bee glorified in all, he hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all vnder ſinne, and ſuffered the beſt to
fall, that no man might truſt in his owne
ſtrength, and that we ſeeing their repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance,
may learne to riſe againe, how grieuous ſo
euer our ſinnes bee. If we haue been Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if adulterers, if perſecutors, if murmurers,
if murtherers, if blaſphemers, if drunkards: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
and Moſes, and Lot, and Abraham, &amp; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
and Salomon, and Peter, and Paul, and
Noah haue been the like, who raigne now in

ſo may we if we repent like them. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
(ſaith Paul) are not written for our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,

haue ſeene Noah ſober, and Noah drunken:
whereby wee may ſee, that a man may bee
drunk with his own wine, he may ſurfet with

owne honor may make him proud, his owne
riches may make him couetous, his owne
ſtrength may make him venturous, his owne
wit may make him contentious: therefore as
the childe pluckes out the ſting before hee
takes the honey; ſo let euery man before hee
receiue the gifts of God, ſit downe and looke
what baites, what ſnares, what temptations
ſathan hath hid in them, and when hee
hath taken out the ſting, then eate
the honey, and he ſhall vſe the

Adam which began the world at firſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> was

parents knowledge,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> tooke their knowledge
from them: ſo euery ſinne giueth other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
then it promiſeth. Little thought Noah
that wine would make him naked: but now
hee is naked and ſtripped too, as though hee
were firſt ſtripped and then whipped. Hee
which beleeued the threatning (like Lot)
when others mocked,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> he which eſcaped the
floud when others were drowned, he to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all the fowles of the ayre, and the beaſts of
the earth flocked in couples, as they did to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
hee which was reſerued to declare the
iudgements of GOD,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> and begin the world
agayne; Noah, the example of temperance,
the example of moderation, the example
of ſobrietie, lyeth naked in his Tent for
drinking the wine which hee himſelfe hath
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:17992:313" rendition="simple:additions"/>
planted: the operation of wine was drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
the ſequell of drunkenneſſe was naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
the effect of nakedneſſe was deriſion.
As the Serpents ſting is in his taile, ſo the end
of ſinne is bitterneſſe, leaſt he ſhould loue
the vice wherewith hee was once defiled, as
they which are once drunke, hardly get out
of the ſellar. God giueth him a Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
like Iacobs limping, that he was neuer
drunken after, but learned temperancie of
intemperancie: therefore it is good a little to
feele the ſting of ſinne, that we may handle it
like a hornet.</p>
            <p>Now when Noah the father was drunken,
Cham the ſonne becommeth a ſcorner: the
father deſerued to bee deſpiſed of his ſonne,
becauſe he had diſfigured the image of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore it followeth, <hi>When Cham the
father of Canaan ſawe the nakedneſſe of his
father, he tolde his two brethren without, &amp;c.</hi>
Drunkennes was his fault, and ſhame muſt be
his puniſhment. Wherby you may note, how
God doth proportionate &amp; match ſins and
puniſhments together, that a man may looke
vpon his puniſhment like a glaſſe, and ſee his
ſinne. Againe, by this you may ſee, how God
doth bring forth the faults of the iuſt aſwel as
the vniuſt, or els other would ſay as Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Ioh. 8. Who can accuſe me of ſinne?</hi> What
a griefe was this to Dauid, that his ſon ſhould
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:17992:313" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bee his traytor? So to increaſe the griefe of
Noah, his ſonne was his ſcorner. He may ſay
as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal. 54. 12. <hi>It is thou O
man, euen my companion and familiar, which
delighted together.</hi> If mine enemie had defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
me, I could haue borne it, or I woulde
haue fled from him: but he whom I haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
nay he whom I brought into the world,
made me a ſhame to the world, like the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
which killeth the damme that beareth it.
So, oftentimes the prophecie of Michaiah
proueth true, <hi>A mans enemies are they of his
owne houſe,</hi> Chap. 7. 6. As Iudas betrayed his
Maſter. Who can reclaime a wicked diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
how deepe was the roote of euill hid in
his heart, that Noah could neuer know it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhewed it. Vntill now Cham ſeemed
as good as Shem, and if Iaphet had ſaid, thou
ſhalt be curſed, he would haue ſaid, thou ſhalt
be curſed. Hipocriſie is ſpun with ſuch a fine
thred, that we may liue as long with a man,
as Noah did with Cham, and ſcarce diſcerne
him.</p>
            <p>Heere are two ſinnes, which goe before
Chams curſe; one that he did ſee his fathers
nakednes, the other, that he did reueale it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Brethren.</p>
            <p>When he ſayth, that <hi>Cham ſaw his fathers
nakednes:</hi> he meaneth that he looked vpon it
with a pleaſure,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.</note> as Dauid vpon the nakednes
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:17992:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Bethſheba, for he might haue ſeene it by
chaunce, and not offended, as a man ſeeth an
Image and deteſteth it.</p>
            <p>The Edomites are reproued for looking
vpon the affliction of their brethren,<note place="margin">Obad. 11.</note> becauſe
they reioyced to ſee it. But the friends of Iob
looked vpon his afflictions, and are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
becauſe they ſorrowed to ſee his
ſorrowes. Therefore Cham did not ſinne in
ſeeing, but in gazing, and reioycing, like the
Edomites.</p>
            <p>There is a wiſe eye,<note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 14.</note> and there is a fooliſh
eye,<note place="margin">Pro. 17. 24.</note> the wiſe eye is like the Bee, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
honie of euerie weede: the fooliſh
eye is like the ſpider which gathereth poyſon
of euery flower. Therefore God licenſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
to ſee the flames of Sodome, which
he forbad Lot, becauſe that which teacheth
one, tempteth another: it is a true Prouerbe,
the eye is a ſhrew; although it ſhewe light,
yet it leadeth many into darkeneſſe. If Eue
had not ſeene, ſhe had not luſted, for it is ſaid,
<hi>Seeing that the tree was pleaſant to the eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ſhe
tooke and eate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioſu. 7. 21.</note> If Achan had not ſeene, he had
not ſtolne. For he ſaith, firſt I ſaw, and then I
coueted. If Dauid had not ſeene, hee had not
luſted, for it is ſayd firſt, That he did ſee her,
and then hee ſent for her.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 2</note> So when Cham
had ſeene the temptation, he was ſnared with
the ſin: therefore it followeth, <hi>He told his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="603" facs="tcp:17992:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which were without, &amp;c.</hi> Thus ſin groweth
of ſin from the eye to the heart, and from the
heart to the tongue, a man may goe into a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth
eaſilie, but when he is in hee cannot
get out: ſo Cham did ſee a temptation eaſily,
but when he had ſeene it, he could not looke
from it. Therefore when Eſayah ſpeaketh of
vanitie,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 18.</note> he named <hi>Cart-ropes of vanitie,</hi> to
ſhew how one ſinne draweth on another, as
it were with Cart-ropes,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and one ſinner ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
another,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> as Eue did Adam. When Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
was caſt out himſelfe, hee ſought euer
after whome hee might deuoure, ſo when
Cham had ſtrained reuerence himſelfe, hee
laboured to bring his brethren into the ſame
diſobedience. All men ſeeke after fellowes,
and we thinke it euill to be euill alone, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the theeues before they goe to ſteale, call
their mates, and ſay, Come with vs, Prou. 1.
10.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>It is enough</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>that we haue ſpent
our former time in luſts:</hi> ſo it was enough that
Cham had faulted himſelf, but when hee had
ſeene, he would haue his brethren ſee too:
When he was become a ſcorner, he would
haue his brethren ſcorners too: therefore as
Andrew called Simon, and Philip called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note>
to ſee the Son of God: ſo Cham cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his brethren to ſee the nakednes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The ſins of men are like a plume of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for itching eares, and an euil diſpoſition
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:17992:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
breedeth an euill ſuſpition: therefore Cham
thinking that his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bin as ſhameles
as himſelfe, thought this a merrie may-game
to make them ſporte. Come with me ſaith he,
and I will ſhew you my Father naked: they
ſay it is an euill bird which will defile his own
neſt: ſo it is an euill ſonne that will ſhame his
owne father, he ſhould haue couered his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
nakedneſſe ſo ſoone as he ſaw it, leſt his
brethren ſhould ſee it too, but he was readie
to make it worſe, like them which heare a
ſuſpition and make it a report, he ſhould haue
taken the beame out of his owne eye, when
he ſpied a moate in his fathers eye: but as the
eye ſeeth all things, and cannot ſee it ſelfe, ſo
wee can ſee others mens faults but not our
owne.<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 1.</note> When Agur had conſidered the follies
of others, he conſidered his owne follies, and
ſaid, I am more fooliſh then any man: When
Iudah had conſidered Thamars ſinnes,<note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
his owne and ſaid, <hi>She is more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then I.</hi> But when Cham did ſee a fault in
his father, al his owne faultes were hid vnder
a buſhel, he cared not that he was his father,
nor that hee was ſaued for his righteouſneſſe,
nor that he had planted a Vineyarde for him
and his brethren, nor that he was neuer drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before, nor that he had committed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſinnes himſelfe, but like them which make
their ſport, that which ſhould be their ſorrow,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:17992:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo he laughed at that which might make him
weepe. Often did I well might Noah ſay, and
thou didſt neuer honour me for that: but once
did I euill, and for that thou wouldeſt ſhame
me.</p>
            <p>There is a kinde of men which are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of other mens faults, but not of their
owne: they are like flies which alwayes light
vpon the ſore, if they finde any ſinne, there
they talke, that is their ſporte, like a Tennis
ball, when they come to their ordinaries, and
though they did neuer well in all their life, yet
that fault ſeemeth greater to them then all
their owne, theſe men are ſo like the diuell,
that in Reuelat. 12. 10. The diuel is called by
their name, An accuſer of the brethren, and
that you may knowe that ſuch tongues ſhall
burne in the fire of hell, Saint Iames ſayth,
<hi>That their tongues are kindled with the fire of
hell already.</hi> Iames 3. 6. This was euer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of bad men, to ſeek faults in good men,
to obiect againe, that they may ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reproofe of them.<note place="margin">Tit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. 8.</note> Therefore ſaith Paul,
<hi>So behaue your ſelues, that they which would
ſlaunder you, may be aſhamed, hauing nothing
to ſpeake euill of you:</hi> If Noah had not been
drunken, Cham had loſt his ſporte.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe this fact of Cham was ſo
hainous, when he is accuſed of it, he is called
the Father of Canaan, as if he ſhould ſay, think
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:17992:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what he deſerueth, which being a father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
would ſo diſhonour his father. It was
meete that hee which had Children ſhould
knowe the duetie of a Childe, and euer think,
that as he behaued himſelfe toward his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo his ſonnes would behaue themſelues
to him againe, but all this did nothing moue
him, therefore the greater was his ſinne.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, as Cham was worſe then
Noah whom hee derided, ſo if you marke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they which are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſpeake hardly of others
haue greater faults the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to couer, but by diſgracing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Thus much of the wicked ſonne, now
of the good ſonnes it followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then tooke Shem and Iaphet a garment, and
put it vpon both their ſhoulders, and went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 1. 10.</note>
               <hi>and couered the nakedneſſe of their father,
&amp;c.</hi> Salomon ſaith, <hi>If ſinners tempt thee, yet
conſent thou not:</hi> So though Cham tempted
them, they conſented not, but when he ſaid,
Come and ſee, they went and hid: Noah ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
himſelfe, but hee could not couer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſo we can corrupt our ſelues, but wee
cannot amend our ſelues. As Cham is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of two faults, for beholding his fathers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
and for reuealing it: ſo Shem and
Iaphet are commended for two things, that
they would not ſee their fathers nakedneſſe
and that they couered it. All came of one
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:17992:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
roote, and all had one duetie, &amp; yet ſee what
difference was between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, one was glad of
his fathers ſhame, and the other were ſorye
for it: one publiſhed it, and the other ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it. Theſe two, ſaith Moſes, ſawe not their
Fathers nakedneſſe. Once it was no ſhame
to be naked: for it is ſayd, that Adam and
Eue were both naked,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 25.</note> and were not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But as ſinne made labour irkeſome,
which was not irkeſome before, and made
heate offenſiue which was not offenſiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and made colde hurteful, which was
not hurtfull before, ſo it made nakedneſſe
ſhamefull which was not ſhamefull before,
that rather then a man would be naked now,
he wil couer himſelfe, as Adam did with fig
leaues. Therefore we neuer read that Noah
was naked before he was drunken, ſhewing
that a ſober man wil neuer open that which
nature hath hid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>This is a difference between men &amp; beaſts;
men are not only aſhamed to be ſeen naked
themſelues, but vnles it be ſome Cham, they
are aſhamed to ſee another naked. Shem and
Iaphet ſaw not their fathers nakedneſſe, who
is ſo blind as he which will not ſee? Nay who
is ſo blinde as he which will ſee? the light of
the eyes oftentimes draweth the ſoule out
of light into darkeneſſe, knowing therfore
that it was hard to ſee like Cham, and not
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:17992:317"/>
to ſinne like Cham, they would not ſee leaſt
they ſhould offende. As they would not ſee
it themſelues, ſo they were carefull that none
other ſhould ſee it, and therefore they coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it with their cloakes. For we muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refraine ſinne, but reſtraine ſinne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that, Leuit. 19. 17. <hi>Suffer not thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſinne,</hi> ſo Shem and Iaphet ſeeing how
their brother had ſinned, ſtopped the cauſe
that no more might ſinne, they were loath
that he ſhould ſee that which he would haue
them to ſee, their griefe and modeſtie it was
ſuch, that they did not ſtay to make him any
anuſwere, or aske him any queſtion, but
ſtraight they thought what was beſt to bee
done, and as a Nurſe taketh the milke out of
her own mouth to giue to the Childe, ſo they
tooke off their cloakes from their backes to
couer their fathers. Such a reuerence is in
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toward their parents, if they haue but
nature, that they will not ſuffer the maieſtie
of their Father to waxe vile, but rather they
will heare any reproch againſt themſelues,
then abide a word againſt their Father. Now
if wee doe ſuch reuerence to earthly Fathers
which bring vs into miſerie, that we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhame our ſelues then they ſhould beare
any ſhame, why are wee ſo aſhamed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide
to ſpeake for our father which calleth
vs out of miſerie into happineſſe: if Cham b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

curſed for diſhonouring a man, let them feare
which diſhonour God.</p>
            <p>You knowe that the Papiſts doe couer the
ſpottes of their Biſhoppes with this cloake
of Shem and Iaphet, and not onely they
but others too, for if any ſpeake of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Rulers, or briberie in Iudges, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
in Biſhops, or non-reſidencie in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
he is ſaid to diſcouer his fathers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
like Cham, but as we may not reueale
all ſinnes, leaſt the vncircumciſed reioyce,
ſo wee may not couer ſome ſinnes, leaſt the
vncircumciſed encreaſe: For if ſome mens
drunkenneſſe were not reprooued, they
would bee drunken ſtill, and make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale of drunkards: therefore they
which will bee conuerted, firſt let them
prooue themſelues fathers, as Noah was,
and after let them amend as Noah did, and
they which couer them, let them diſtinguiſh
betweene Noah and Cham, and betweene
errour and obſtinacie. For ſome, Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
admonition, for others reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
for others Excommunication, and for
others correction: therefore euerie mans
nakedneſſe muſt not bee couered as Noahs
was: wee will couer the firſt drunkenneſſe,
as Shem and Iaphet did, if they will repent
as Noah did, and bee drunken no more.
But ſhall wee followe them like a blinde
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:17992:318"/>
mans Boye, to ſtay them ſo often as they
fall, when they ſay that they ſtumble not,
though they lye on the ground? This is not
the cloake of reuerence, but the cloake of
flatterie. Therefore as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Let the
dead burie the dead:</hi> So I may ſay, let the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
couer the wicked; the Wolues are not
the Lambes fathers, but the Lambes But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
therfore if they would bee couered,
let them ſpeake to their Children to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them, for this is our rule, <hi>They which ſin
openly, reprooue openly, that the reſt may
feare, 1. Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus you haue heard what the badde
Sonne did, and what the good ſonnes did:
now wee come to Noah againe:</hi> Then Noah
awoake and knew what his yonger ſonne had
done vnto him, and ſaid vnto him, Curſed be
Canaan, a ſeruant of ſeruants ſhall he be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his brethren. He ſaid moreouer, Bleſſed be
the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan bee
his ſeruant, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſheweth, how Noah commeth
to himſelfe, then how he knew what his
ſonnes had done vnto him; then how he
curſeth one and bleſſeth another. As his
ſonnes were aſhamed of his nakednes when
he was drunken, ſo now he is ſober, he is
aſhamed of it himſelfe, therefore he is ſaid
to awake from his wine, as though hee had
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:17992:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beene a ſleepe; for <hi>The drunkard</hi> (ſaith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)
<hi>is as one that ſleepeth, Prouerbs</hi> 23.
34. When the belly is full, the boanes are
at reſt, ſo when Noah was full, his thoughts
were at reſt: therefore beeing as it were lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a ſheepe, with ouermuch wine, hee may
be ſaid to awake. Here Moſes would exhort
all them that ſleepe with Noah, to awake
with Noah. Noah was once intemperate,
and many follow him in that, Noah was
but once intemperate, and few follow him in
that: Dauid was once incontinent, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
follow him in that; Dauid was but once
incontinent, and few follow him in that:
Peter was once vnfaithfull, and many follow
him in that; Peter was but once vnfaithfull,
and few follow him in that. This the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene the faithfull and the wicked,
both fall, and but one riſeth againe. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
<hi>He knew what his yonger ſonne had
done vnto him:</hi> either by the ſpirit of God,
which ſuggeſted him, or els by ſome other
that tould him; for a drunken man dooth
not remember what is ſaid or done: and
therefore the drunkard ſaith, <hi>I was beaten, but
when I awaked, I knew it not, Pro.</hi> 23. 35. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when Lot was drunken, his daughters
laye with him, and it is ſaid, <hi>Gen. 19. 33. that
he perceiued not when they lay downe, nor when
they roſe vp:</hi> therefore Noah knew either by the
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:17992:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpirit which informed him, or by others which
told him.</p>
            <p>Now, as Moſes (declaring Chams ſinne)
called him <hi>the father of Canaan:</hi> ſo Noah
repeating his ſinne againe, called him <hi>his
younger ſonne.</hi> He diſdaineth to name him,
but calleth him a younger ſonne; to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
his fault, becauſe we will ſuffer our elder
ſonnes to bee more familiar with vs, but of
the younger wee looke for more reuerence;
or elſe becauſe parents are woont to make
more of the youngeſt, and dandle them, as
Iacob did Beniamin, and ſo hee might ſay,
My yonger ſonne, which for his yeares ſhould
haue ſhewed mee moſt duetie, and for my
affection ſhould haue borne mee moſt loue;
my younger ſonne hath ſought my diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and not content to ſcorne mee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
hath publiſhed my ſhame, and as much
as in him lay, prouoked his brethren to ſcorne
me too.</p>
            <p>Of whome is a man ſo often deceaued, as
of his neereſt friend? Lightly the younger
ſonne is better than the elder, as Ioſeph was
better than his elder brethren, Dauid was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than his elder brethren, Abell was better
than his elder brother, Iſaac was better than
his elder brother, Iacob was better than his
elder brother; but here the youngeſt is worſt:
ſo neither vertue nor vice goeth by age.

Now, as Chriſt when he awoke, rebuked the
windes, and comforted his Diſciples: ſo No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
when he awoke, curſed the ſcorner, and
bleſſed the other. Moſes doth not ſet downe
his wordes of choller, but bringeth him in,
ſpeaking by the ſpirite of prophecie, what
ſhould come vpon all his ſonnes. It is like
that the good Patriarch had bewailed his
owne ſinne before, and now hauing repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and got pardon for it, he commeth forth
like a proclaymer of Gods iudgement, and
thundreth againſt this mocker. What a griefe
was this to the father, to bee conſtrained to
condemne his owne ſonne, and with his own
mouth to pronounce him baniſhed from the
Church of God: for though Cham had not
the nature of a ſonne, yet Noah had not loſt
the nature of a father, and he ſaw what a ſmall
number was left vpon earth, like Adams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for to repleniſh the whole world againe:
therefore it grieued him to curſe his ſonne,
as much as it reioyced his ſonne to ſcorne
him. Yet as Abraham would ſacrifice his
ſonne, rather then diſpleaſe GOD; ſo Noah
did curſe his ſonne, rather then he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
GOD: ſhewing that wee ſhould not
ſpare our owne bowels, when God would
haue them puniſhed, but doe as the fathers
and mothers of Idolaters and blaſphemers
did in the law,<note place="margin">Dan. 13.</note> who brought the firſt ſtone to
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:17992:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preſſe their ſonnes to death, ſhewing that
as the ſonne of God died for them, ſo their
ſonnes ſhould die for God, if they would
not ſerue him. Now the curſe goeth foorth:
<hi>Curſed be Canaan,</hi> that is, curſed be ſcorners,
curſed be all they wich diſhonour their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and mother, <hi>A ſeruant of ſeruants ſhall
hee be:</hi> this is the firſt mention of ſeruants
in all the ſcripture, man was not made to
ſerue but to rule, but ſinne maketh them
ſerue which ſhould rule: therefore as you
ſaw ſinne bring in the firſt nakednes, ſo you
ſee ſinne bringing in the firſt ſeruant, <hi>A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of ſeruants ſhall he bee.</hi> This curſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
with great vehemencie: for he ſaith
not ſimplie, A ſeruant ſhall he be, but <hi>A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of ſeruants ſhall he be:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay,
a ſeruant, and more than a ſeruant, that is of
a ſeruile condition, and ſeruile minde. As the
Sabbaoth of Sabbaoths ſignifieth a high Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth;
and as the Song of Songs, ſignifieth
an excellent Song; and as the Holie of holieſt
ſignifieth the holieſt place, and as the Lord of
Lords ſignifieth the chiefeſt Lord: ſo Vanitie
of Vanities ſignifieth the greteſt Vanitie, and
<hi>ſeruant of ſeruants,</hi> ſignifieth the vileſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.
Seeing then that the Pope taketh this
name vnto him, and writeth himſelfe <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of ſeruants,</hi> in all his Indulgences, as
thogh he did ground vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this curſe of Cham
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:17992:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it ſeemeth that the Lord would ſhew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
who is like Cham, and who is curſed:
therefore let not vs denie him that which
the holy Ghoſt dooth giue him, but as hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Chams name, ſo let him take his curſe
too, <hi>Curſed be Canaan, &amp;c.</hi> It was not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan
which tempted Shem and Iaphet, to
gaze vpon their fathers nakedneſſe, but it
was Cham. How commeth it then that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
dooth curſe Canaan, and not Cham? In
the 22. verſe Cham is called the father of
Canaan, ſo that Canaan was Chams ſonne,
therefore God not content with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Cham alone, ſaith, <hi>Curſed be Canaan</hi>
alſo; ſhewing, that both Cham and Canaan,
the father and the children, ſhall bee curſed
for this impietie: becauſe Cham had ſhewed
himſelfe a rebellious childe to Noah, God
ſheweth that his children ſhall doo the like
by him. Heere is to bee noted, that whereas
Cham had elder ſonnes then Canaan, and
Canaan was his yongeſt, yet God for a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
nameth the yongeſt in the curſe, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his wrath ſhould laſt, euen to the
yongeſt, and be a great while before it were
forgotten. Here is to be noted againe, that
whereas the countrey of Canaan was ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
&amp; ſo bleſſed a countrey, that it was called
the land that floweth with milk &amp; honny, yet
vnder the name of Canaan, Chams youngeſt
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:17992:321"/>
ſonne (of whome the countrey of Canaan
tooke the name) God ſheweth that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites
ſhall be curſed in this bleſſed land,
as Cain was a vagabond vppon his owne
ground:<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> to ſhew, that the ioye of heart, and
peace of conſcience commeth from God, and
nothing elſe. Now the iſſues which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon this curſe, doe ſhew that Noah ſpake
not from the ſpleen, but from the ſpirite of
God: For firſt you read how the Canaanites,
who came of Canaan, were ſlaine of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;
then you reade how the Gibeonites
which came of Canaan were made ſlaues to
the Iſraelites; then you reade how the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
and Ethiopians which came of Canaan,
were taken captiue by the king of Aſhur:<note place="margin">Eſay 20. 4.</note> then
you reade, how Nemrod and his complices,
that came of Canaan, were confounded at
Babel, when they went about to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
Beſide, where as length of daies, is a
bleſſing to them which honour their father,
Cham which diſhonoured his father,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> had not
one ſonne of his line which liued aboue an
hundreth yeares: ſo, as Iſaac ſaid, <hi>Iacob haue
I bleſſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and hee ſhallbee bleſſed,</hi> ſo Noah may
ſay, Cham haue I curſed, and he ſhall be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
for he was curſed indeede; curſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and curſed in his children, curſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and curſed in earth, curſed with God,
and curſed with men: for after this he began
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:17992:321"/>
to bee abhorred, and they that came of him.
Therefore Abraham commaunded his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
that hee ſhould not chooſe a wife for
his ſonne, of the Canaanites, Iſaac giueth
the like commaundement to his ſonne Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
becauſe they were a curſed nation, and
hated of God euer ſince Noah ſaide, <hi>Curſed
bee Canaan.</hi> Thus when Cham ſaide vnto
his brethren, <hi>Come and I will ſhew you my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
naked:</hi> he might haue ſaide; Come and
I will ſhew you my ſelfe accurſed. If GOD
haue ſuch wrath againſt a ſcorner, think whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou followeſt not ſome ſinne worſe
then ſcorning.</p>
            <p>Now after Noah had curſed Cham, hee
bleſſed his brethren, <hi>Bleſſed bee the Lord God
of Shem, &amp;c.</hi> Of Shem came the Iewes
which had the firſt bleſſing, and therefore
Shem is bleſſed firſt: of Iaphet came the
Gentiles, which had the latter bleſſing, and
therefore Iaphet is bleſſed after: the forme
of Shems bleſſing is; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of
Shem, &amp;c.</hi> One which heareth this bleſſing
would thinke that Noah did not bleſſe Shem,
but that hee bleſſed God, for he ſaith not, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be Shem, but bleſſed bee the Lord God of
Shem. This is to ſignifie that as curſed Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
came of Cham, ſo the bleſſed Meſſias
ſhould come of Shem, which though he were
Shems ſonne, yet heere hee is called Shems
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:17992:322"/>
Lord, as hee was called Dauids ſonne, and
Dauids Lord. Then to ſhew that Noah dooth
not bleſſe Shem, but God dooth bleſſe him,
and Noah prayed that hee might bee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as Chriſt gaue the ſpirite, and Iohn mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
but the water. Thirdly, to ſhew that
God for bleſſing vs, ſhould be bleſſed of vs;
and therefore Noah ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed bee the Lord
God of Shem, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, bleſſed
bee the Lord which bleſſeth Shem. Further
this ſheweth the difference betweene Shems
bleſſing, and Iaphets bleſſing, that is the Iews
and the Gentiles, for he ſaith, <hi>God perſwade
Iaphet to dwell in the tents of Shem,</hi> as though
Iaphet were not bleſſed yet, but ſhould bee
bleſſed; but he ſaith of Shem, <hi>Bleſſed bee the
Lord Gods of Shem:</hi> as if hee ſhould giue him
poſſeſſion, and ſay, take thy bleſſing: for to
aſſure him of Gods bleſſing, he calleth God
Shems God: As were ſay, my landes, or my
goods, ſo hee might ſay, my God, and my
Lorde: ſuch a propertie the faithfull haue in
God. As Paul ſaith, <hi>God is not the God of the
dead, but of the liuing:</hi> ſo I may ſay, God is
not the God of the wicked, but of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and therefore he is called, <hi>The God of
Abraham, the God of Iſaak, and the God of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
which were all good and righteous and
holy men. The next bleſſing is Iaphets, the
forme of his bleſſing is, <hi>God perſwade Iaphet
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:17992:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to dwell in the tents of Shem,</hi> that is, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the Gentiles which come of Iaphet, to
imbrace the Religion of the Iewes, which
come of Shem. See how God counteth it
for a bleſſing, to be in the true Religion, and
how men ſhould bee perſwaded vnto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is loue which cannot bee forced: this
is the firſt prophecie in ſcripture of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Gentiles, that is of our calling to
Chriſt. And to put vs in minde that we were
once out of the couenant, and but added to
the couenant, the name of Iaphet, which was
the father of the Gentiles, dooth ſignifie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
or inlarged, as it were added to the
Church, as though the time were when
wee were out of the Church: therefore firſt
wee are indebted to our good mediatour,
which added vs to the kingdome, when we
were out of the kingdome; and then that
hee did it by perſſwaſion, not by compulſion.
As Noah prayed God to perſwade Iapheth,
ſo he hath perſwaded vs by his word, and not
forced vs by his roddes: ſhewing how wee
ſhould perſwade one another to the truth,
in the ſpirite of mildnes, remembring that
wee come of Iapeth, which ſignifieth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.
Nowe after Shems bleſſing, and
after Iaphets bleſſing likewiſe, hee ſaith,
<hi>Let Canaan bee his ſeruant;</hi> this is thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in three verſes together, as if God
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:17992:323"/>
had ratified it, &amp; ſworne it with a treble vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
For when Ioſeph told Pharaoh why his
dreame was doubled, he gaue this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſhould ſurely come to paſſe,<note place="margin">Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 41. 22.</note> ſo Cham
might be ſure his curſe would come to paſſe.
Heere is a ſweete obſeruation beſide, how
Shem and Iaphet are bleſſed in Chams curſe,
and how Cham is curſed in their bleſſing: for
when he ſaith, Let Canaan be Shem and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſeruant; he implieth this, that beſide
they were bleſſed in their owne children,
becauſe they were obedient to them, they
ſhould be bleſſed in Chams children, becauſe
they were ſeruants to them: ſo Shem and
Iaphet were bleſſed in Chams curſe. Againe
beſide that Cham was curſed in his owne
children, becauſe they were rebellious to him,
he is curſed alſo in Shems &amp; Iaphets children,
becauſe they were Lordes ouer hym, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this ſaying, <hi>Let Canaan be their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant;</hi>
ſo Cham is curſed in Shem and Iaphets
bleſſing, as the Egyptians were drowned in
the waters which ſaued the Iſralites. Theſe
are the notes which I could picke out of this
ſtorie: heere you ſee how Cham was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
but for dooing euill, and how Shem and
Iaphet were bleſſed but for dooing well;
therefore as the Angell ſayd to them which
ſought Chriſt at the ſepulcher; <hi>Feare not
you,</hi> ſo I may ſay to all which ſeeke Chriſt,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:17992:323" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feare not you, for when Cham is curſed
Shem and Iaphet are bleſſed; ſo when the
wicked are curſed, the godly ſhall bee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as the ſheepe went to the right hand,
when the goates went to the left hand. This
is enough to ſhew what wee are, that when
God ſaued but eight perſons in the flood,
yet you ſee one of them drinke vntill he bee
drunken; and another ſcorne vntill he be
curſed. If two among ſo few did ſo, when
the flood was by them, what meruaile though
ſo many do ſo now the flood is gone, and the
weather calme: As there was a Cham in the
Arke, ſo looke alwaies to haue Cham in the
church. Shem did not go out of the Arke,
becauſe Cham was in the Arke, neither let
the faithfull go out of the church, becauſe
wicked are in the church. As Cham ſcorned,
and Noah was ſcorned: ſo there ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
one that perſecuteth, and one which is
perſecuted: if the ſonne perſecute the father,
thinke it not ſtrange to be perſecuted of any,
for they which are not perſecuted, lightlie are
perſecutours themſelues. Thus you haue ſeen
Noah drunken and ſcorned, Cham ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and curſed, Shem and Iaphet reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
and bleſſed. In this ſtorie is the firſt
mention of planting of Vineyardes, the firſt
ſpeech of drinking of wine, the firſt example
of drunkennes, the firſt bleſſing and curſing
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:17992:324"/>
of parents, the firſt name of ſeruant, and the
firſt prophecie of the calling of the Gentiles.
Noah is a warning to all drunkards, Cham is
a warning to all ſcorners, Shem and Iaphet
are an example for all ſubiects to reuerence
their rulers, and for all children to reuerence
their parents. Now as Noah prayed,
<hi>God perſwade Iaphet to dwell with
Shem,</hi> ſo God perſwade
vs to dwell with
Chriſt.</p>

trick in ſtead of applying the doctrine which
we ſhould follow, he turnes vs to praiſe and

ſtay and are remembred, but hee which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his eares in his pillowe, goeth home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
like the childe which he leadeth in his
hand, and ſcarſe remembreth the preachers
texte. A diuine tongue and a holy eare make
ſweete muſicke, but a deafe eare makes a
dumb tongue. There is nothing ſo eaſie as to
<hi>heare,</hi> and yet there is nothing ſo hard as to
<hi>heare</hi> well. You come not hitherto learne
how to <hi>heare,</hi> but you come hitherto <hi>heare</hi> as
you were wont: for there is none but thinkes
before he come to <hi>heare,</hi> that he knowes how
to <hi>heare</hi> already. But when I haue ſhewed you
Chriſt meaning in this caueat, you ſhall
iudge whether you haue <hi>heard</hi> or not <hi>heard,</hi>
before you learned how to <hi>heare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſeuenteenth Chapter and the fifth
verſe of Saint Mathewes Goſpell, the Father
teacheth you how to <hi>heare,</hi> nowe the Sonne
teacheth you how to <hi>heare:</hi> ſhewing (as
Iames ſaith) that <hi>hearers</hi> only are not bleſſed,
for many ſhall ſay vnto Chriſt, <hi>Haue not wee
heard thee in our Synagogues?</hi> whom hee will
anſwere, with <hi>I know you not:</hi> and therefore it
is not inough to <hi>heare,</hi> but you muſt care how
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:17992:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hou <hi>heare,</hi> it is not enough to <hi>pray,</hi> but you
muſt care how you <hi>pray,</hi> it is not enough to
<hi>receiue,</hi> but you muſt care how you <hi>receiue,</hi> it
is not enough to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> but you muſt care
how you <hi>ſuffer,</hi> it is not enough to <hi>giue,</hi> but
you muſt care how you <hi>giue,</hi> it is not enough
to <hi>beleeue,</hi> but you muſt care how you <hi>beleeue:</hi>
for God hath appointed the way as wel as the
ende. Becauſe Cain regarded not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note>
God regarded not his Sacrifice. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to doe well than to doe good: for a man
cannot offend in doing well, but he may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in doing good, if hee doe not well.
Therfore Chriſt (whom the Father bade vs
<hi>heare</hi>) teacheth vs not only to <hi>heare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 17. 5</note> but how
to <hi>heare:</hi> in the fourteenth chapter of Marke
and the foure and twentieth verſe, teacheth vs
not onely to <hi>reade,</hi> but how to <hi>reade:</hi> in the
foure and twentieth of Saint Mathew, and the
fifteenth verſe, teacheth vs not onely to <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>
but how to <hi>ſuffer:</hi> in the fifth of Mathew,
and the tenth verſe, teacheth vs not onely to
<hi>receiue,</hi> but how to <hi>receiue:</hi> Luke 22. 19. tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs not only to <hi>pray,</hi> but how to <hi>pray:</hi>
Luk. 11. 1. ſignifiyng, that more ſinne in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
and <hi>reading,</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> &amp;
<hi>receiuing,</hi> amiſſe, than in not <hi>hearing, reading,
praying, ſuffering,</hi> or <hi>receiuing</hi> at all. Therfore
Paul takes the Chriſtian before his race, and
giues him this watch-word. <hi>So run that thou
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:17992:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mayſt obtaine.</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 24. that is, ſo ſeek that
thou mayſt finde, ſo aske that thou mayſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
ſo knocke that it may bee opened, ſo
giue that thou maiſt doe good, ſo ſuffer that
thou maiſt haue comfort, ſo <hi>heare</hi> that thou
mayſt profite. How many haue faſted, and
watched and prayed more than we, and yet
loſt al their deuotion? becauſe they thought
not of this rule, <hi>to doe good in a good ſort.</hi> The
Papiſts ſo they pray, care not how they pray,
for they thinke it enough to pray: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they haue gone ouer their beads,
their prayer is done, although they neuer
thought what they asked. But Ieremie ſaith,
<hi>Curſed be he that doth the buſines of the Lorde
negligently,</hi> whether hee <hi>heare negligently,</hi> or
<hi>pray negligently,</hi> or <hi>receiue negligently,</hi> or
<hi>preach negligently.</hi> The Scribes, and Phariſies
did faſt, and watch, and pray, and heare, and
reade, and giue, and doe all that we can doe,
and yet Chriſt rewardeth al their works with
a woe; <hi>Woe be vnto you Scribes and Phariſies.</hi>
The Diſciple which betraied Chriſt, heard ſo
much as the Diſciples that loued Chriſt, yet
he had no feeling, nor comfort, nor profite of
all his companie with Chriſt, becauſe he did
not vſe it as the reſt did. The Iewes did heare
more then all the world beſide, yet becauſe
they tooke no heed to that which they heard,
therefore they crucified him which came to
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:17992:329"/>
ſaue them, and became the curſedſt people
vppon the earth, which were the bleſſedſt
Nation before: therefore the A b c. of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
is to learne the Arte of <hi>hearing.</hi> We care
how wee ſow, leſt our ſeed ſhould be loſt:
ſo let vs care how we <hi>heare,</hi> leaſt Gods ſeede
bee loſt. There is no ſeede which groweth
ſo faſt as Gods ſeede if it bee ſowne well:
therefore that I may ſhewe you that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
of <hi>hearing,</hi> which Chriſt commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
heere to his diſciples, it is neceſſarie to
obſerue fiue things.<note place="margin">Fiue partes of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> Firſt, the neceſsitie of
<hi>hearing:</hi> ſecondly, the fruite which commeth
by <hi>hearing:</hi> thirdly, the kindes of <hi>hearers:</hi>
fourthly, the danger of <hi>hearing</hi> amiſſe: fiftly,
that manner of <hi>hearing,</hi> which will make
you remember that which is ſaid, and teache
you more in a yeare than you haue learned all
your life.</p>
            <p>Touching the neceſſitie of <hi>hearing:</hi> When
Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Take heede how you heare,</hi> hee
implieth that all his Diſciples ſhould heare,
nay they which were excommunicate from
the prayers, and from the councels, and from
the Sacraments for their ſinnes, yet were not
excommunicate from <hi>hearing,</hi> becauſe they
ſhould learne to repent.</p>
            <p>Here that large commaundement of our
Sauiour Chriſt ſtandeth,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>That which I ſay
vnto you, I ſay vnto all,</hi> therefore it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:17992:330" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Proclamation, <hi>Whoſoeuer hath an eare to
heare let him heare.</hi> The place implyeth that al
ſhould heare, though it importeth that al can
not heare. When the voyce ſpake from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
it ſaid nothing,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 5.</note> but <hi>This is my beloued ſon,
heare him:</hi> as thongh all the duties of man
were compriſed in <hi>hearing.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſpake
but of one thing which is neceſſarie, he ſpake
of <hi>hearing,</hi> Luke 10. 22. As though it were ſo
neceſſarie to <hi>heare,</hi> that all neceſſities ſhould
giue place vnto it. When men would not
<hi>heare,</hi> God ſpake to the ground; <hi>Oh earth,
earth, earth heare the word of the Lord:</hi> Iere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
22. 29. ſhewing that GOD ſo contemneth
them which will not <hi>heare,</hi> that he regardes
the earth and the trees, and the ſtones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſeleſſe creatures aboue them.</p>
            <p>When GOD ſtroke Zacharias hee made
him dumbe,<note place="margin">Luk 1. 5.</note> but not deafe; When GOD
ſtroke Saul, hee made him blinde, but not
deafe;<note place="margin">Act. 9. 3. 4.</note> When GOD ſtroke Mephiboſheth,
hee made him lame,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 4. 4.</note> but not deafe. Thus
GOD would haue them <hi>heare</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee, nor ſpeake, nor goe. But there is
a diuell which is called the deaffe diuell,
Marke 9. 25. ſhewing that the diuell would
haue vs deaffe, becauſe hee that heareth
inſtruction is in the way to life, but <hi>Hee
which heares not inſtruction goeth out of the
way.</hi> Prouerbs tenne-ſeauenteenth. To ſhew
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:17992:330"/>
the neceſſitie of <hi>hearing the worde</hi> which we
ſhould <hi>heare</hi> is called <hi>meate</hi> in the fifth
Chapter and the eleuenth verſe of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the Hebrues, and the want of the
<hi>Worde</hi> is called a <hi>famine</hi> in the eight chapter
of Amos Prophecie and the eleuenth verſe,
as though it were as neceſſarie for vs to
<hi>heare,</hi> as it is to eate.</p>
            <p>Although our heartes are contrarie to the
<hi>Worde</hi> more than to any thing beſide, yet
no man can thinke that this is the <hi>Word</hi> of
GOD, but hee thinkes it neceſſarie to bee
heard. Beſides, if Chriſt bee the <hi>Word</hi> (as
Saint Iohn calleth him in the firſt chapter
and fourteenth verſe) and the <hi>Worde</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by no other meanes, but by <hi>hearing</hi>
onely can anie man then receiue Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>hearing?</hi> Let not anie bee thus fonde
ſo vainely to dreame: for that were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the <hi>Worde</hi> without the <hi>Worde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, as Iohn wept vntill the Booke
was opened, and ſo ſoone as it was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
all the Elders ſung: ſo wee ſhoulde
coumpt it the greateſt cauſe of weeping
when the worde is taken from vs that wee
cannot heare it, and the greateſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing
when it is open to vs that wee may
heare without let. Thus much of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of <hi>hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, touching the fruite that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:17992:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>hearing:</hi> Of all our ſences, <hi>hearing</hi>
is the ſence of learning, and therefore Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
begins his Wiſedome, with <hi>Hearken
my ſonne,</hi> Prouer. 1. 8. opening as it were the
doore where Wiſedome muſt enter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
except in <hi>praying,</hi> temptations neuer
trouble a man ſo much as in <hi>hearing,</hi> which
ſheweth that theſe two are the deſtroyers of
the deſtroyer: therefore as the tempter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
could not abide to heare the <hi>Word</hi> when
Chriſt ſpake, ſo hee cannot abide that wee
ſhould heare the <hi>Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> It muſt needes bee
good for vs which our enemies would keepe
from vs.</p>
            <p>Many hearing the <hi>Worde</hi> haue met with
knowledge, haue met with comfort, haue
met with ſaluation, but without the <hi>Worde</hi>
neuer any was conuerted to GOD. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whenſoeuer the <hi>Worde</hi> is preached, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one may ſay to himſelfe, as the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

comfort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 49.</note> 
               <hi>hee calleth thee:</hi> bee of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

heard a woman ſay,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are the breastes
which gaue thee ſucke,</hi> Chriſt replied, <hi>Bleſſed
are they which heare the Worde of God:</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that his Diſciples were more bleſſed for
hearing him, than his Mother for bearing
him. As Iſaac gaue Iacob a double bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
ſo Chriſt bleſſeth them againe: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="637" facs="tcp:17992:331"/>
in Matthew. 16. 17. hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are the
eares which heare the things which you heare:</hi>
ſhewing that the Iewes were more bleſſed
than all the worlde, becauſe they had this
one bleſſing to <hi>heare</hi> the trueth. If they be
bleſſed which <hi>heare,</hi> then you come hither
for a bleſſing, and hee which is bleſſed,
wanteth nothing. Euery priuiledge dooth
importe ſome ſpeciall good to him which
hath it: but it is the priuiledge of man to
<hi>heare the Worde,</hi> and therefore <hi>the Worde
became man,</hi> becauſe it belongeth onely to
man.<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 14.</note> God hath giuen life and light and food
to fowles, and fiſhes, and beaſtes, but his
<hi>Word</hi> is the prerogatiue of man. As to ſpeake
is the propertie of man, ſo to <hi>heare</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of man. To ſhewe the fruite which
commeth by <hi>hearing,</hi> Chriſt calleth the <hi>Word</hi>
which wee ſhould <hi>heare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Verbum Regni, The

               <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> there is another fruite.
As Chriſt with fiue loaues and two fiſhes fed

Chriſt but once, gaue halfe his goods to
the poore: ſo I doubt not but ſome goe from
our Sermons almoſt Chriſtians like Agrippa,
ſome whole Chriſtians like the Eunuch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
their faith like Zacheus. Now a
little and then a little the ſoule groweth
like the bodie. If you heare well, our voyce
is like the ſounde of the <hi>Rammes hornes</hi> that
made the Walles of Iericho to reele,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 6.</note> nay it
will make the walles of hell to reele, for the
ſame <hi>Worde</hi> made the Prince of hell giue
backe, Matthew 4. 7. Although at all other
times we are as plaine and ſimple as Iaacob,
yet at this time wee haue a promiſe, and it is
giuen to vs (for your ſake) to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
that which we conceiue not our ſelues,
becauſe the houre is come wherein GOD
hath appointed to call ſome of you as hee
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:17992:332" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath done ſome of you before. Therefore as
the princelie ſpirite came vpon Saul when
hee ſhould raigne,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 11. 6.</note> to teach him how hee
ſhould rule: ſo the Propheticall ſpirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vppon Preachers when they ſhould
teach, to teach them how they ſhould ſpeake.
Therefore, as Chriſt was contented to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
of Iohn,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 15.</note> ſo be you content to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of vs, that if we be more ſimple than you,
the glorie of God may appeare more in
conuerting you by vs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, touching the kinde of <hi>hearers:</hi>
If all which come to <hi>heare,</hi> did <hi>heare</hi> as
they ſhould, Chriſt neede not warne vs,
<hi>Take heede how yee heare.</hi> But as we pray, ſo
wee <hi>heare,</hi> the one is a lip-labour, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is an eare-labour. As children play the
trewantes in the ſchoole, ſo men play the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wantes
in the Church: how many come to
<hi>heare</hi> mee, and yet (peraduenture) ſome doe
not <hi>heare,</hi> while I ſpeake of <hi>hearing?</hi> One
hath no pitcher, another hath left his pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
behinde him, another hath brought a
broken pitcher which will holde no water,
therefore Chriſt calleth vs <hi>Fiſhers:</hi> for as a
Fiſher taketh but a few in reſpect of thoſe
which goe by, ſo we reforme but a few in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of them which goe as the came. Firſt of
Pauls <hi>hearers,</hi> and then of Chriſts <hi>hearers,</hi> and
after our <hi>hearers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 32.</note> When the Athenians heard
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:17992:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> preach of the reſurrection, it is ſaid,
that <hi>ſome mocked;</hi> there is one ſort, <hi>the chaire
of ſcorners:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> ſome ſaid, <hi>we will heare thee of
this againe;</hi> there is another ſort, which are
not yet reſolued, but deſire to bee better
inſtructed: ſome did aſſent vnto him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
his doctrine, as <hi>Dioniſius Areopagita,</hi>
and <hi>Damaris</hi> a woman; there is the beſt ſort:
wee neuer preach but wee haue all theſe
<hi>hearers,</hi> ſome mocke, ſome wauer, and
ſome beleeue. Now of Chriſts <hi>hearers:</hi> Wee
finde in the Goſpell that Chriſt had foure
ſorts of <hi>hearers:</hi> while I count them to you,
thinke of what ſort you are, for I doubt not
but that there bee here of all ſortes. Some
heard him to wonder at him, like Herode,
which was mooued with the fame that went
of him: ſome came to <hi>heare,</hi> becauſe they
would know all things, that they might be
able to talke of them. It ſeemes that Iudas
was ſuch a ſcholler, for he had learned to
preach but not to follow: ſome came to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and to trip him in his ſpeeches, of theſe
<hi>hearers</hi> were the Scribes and Phariſies which
would make him an enemie to Caeſar: ſome
were like to the good ground, which came
to know what they might doo, and how they
ſhoulde beleeue, like the humble Scribe
which inquired the way to heauen. Now to
our <hi>hearers.</hi> As there were wiſe Virgins and
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:17992:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fooliſh Virgins: ſo there are wiſe <hi>hearers,</hi> and
fooliſh <hi>hearers.</hi> Some are ſo nice that they
had rather pine then take their foode of any
which is licenſed by a Biſhop, as if Helias
ſhould refuſe his food becauſe a raue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought
it to him and not an Angel: ſome come vnto
the ſeruice to ſaue forfeiture, and then they
ſtay the Sermon for ſhame: ſome come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would not bee counted Atheiſts:
ſome come becauſe they would auoyde the
name of Papiſts: ſome come to pleaſe their
friends, one hath a good man to his friend, &amp;
leaſt he ſhould offend him he frequents the
Preachers, that his friend may thinke well of
him: ſome come with their maſters and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
for attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: ſome come with a fame,
they haue heard great ſpeech of the man, and
therefore they will ſpend one houre to heare
him once, but to ſee whether it be ſo as they
ſay: ſome come becauſe they be idle, to paſſe
the time they go to a Sermon, leſt they ſhould
bee wearie of doing nothing: ſome come
with their fellowes, one ſaith, let vs goe to the
Sermon: content ſaith he, and hee goeth for
companie: ſome heare the ſound of a voyce,
as they paſſe by the Church, and ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be aware: another hath ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of buſines, and he appoynts his friend to
meete him at ſuch a Sermon, as they doe at
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:17992:334" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pauls: all theſe are accidentall <hi>hearers,</hi> like
children which ſit in the market, and neither
buy nor ſell. But as many foxes haue been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
when they came to take: ſo they which
came to ſpye, or wonder, or gaze, or ſcoffe,
haue changed their minds before they went
home, like one which findes when he doth
not ſeeke.</p>
            <p>As ye come with diuers motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſo ye heare
in diuers manners: One is like an <hi>Athenian,</hi>
and he hearkeneth after newes: if the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
ſay any thing of our Armies beyond ſea,
or counſell at home, or matters of Court, that
is his lure: another is like the Phariſie, and he
watcheth if any thing bee ſayd that may bee
wreſted to be ſpoken againſt perſons in high
place, that he may play the diuell in accuſing
of his brethren, let him write that in his tables
too: another ſmackes of eloquence, and hee
gapes for a phraſe, that when he commeth to

to grace and worſhip his tale: another is
male-content, and he neuer pricketh vp his
eares till the Preacher come to gird agaynſt
ſome whom he ſpiteth, and when the Sermon
is done, hee remembreth nothing which was

the Church, he hath an euill eye, which

of his ſuite, ſometimes of his dinner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of his ſport after dinner, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is done before the man thinke where he
is: another commeth to heare, but ſo ſoone
as the Preacher hath ſayd his prayer, he falles
faſt a ſleepe, as though he had been brought
in for a corps, &amp; the Preacher ſhould preach
at his funerall.</p>
            <p>This is the generation of <hi>hearers:</hi> is not the
ſaying of Chriſt fulfilled now, <hi>Hearing you
heare not?</hi> becauſe wee heare and heare not,
like a couetous churle, which goeth by a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
when he cryeth in Chriſtes name for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
and heareth him crye, but will not heare
him, becauſe he craueth that which he will
not part with.</p>
            <p>May we not ſay againe with Chriſt, <hi>What
went ye out to ſee,</hi> rather then <hi>What went ye out
to heare,</hi> ſeeing ye remember that which ye
ſee, and forget all which ye heare? So you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from our ſermons like a ſlidethrifts purſe
which will hold no money, and as you goe
home one ſaith he doth not edifie: another
ſaith, I cannot profit by him: another ſaith, he
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:17992:335" rendition="simple:additions"/>
keeps not to his text: another ſaith, he ſpeaks
not to the heart: as if the ground ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of the ſeede which will not receiue the
ſeede. Is not this the cauſe why your Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
about the Citie care not how they
preach, becauſe their flockes haue no care to
<hi>heare?</hi> Is not this the cauſe why God doth not
heare vs, becauſe we wil not heare him? Is not
this the cauſe why ye are ſuch Doctors in the
world, and ſuch Infants in the Church? Yee
learned your trade in ſeauen yeares, but you
haue not learned religion in all your yeares.
Can you giue any reaſon for it but this? you
marked when your maſter taught you your
trade, becauſe you ſhould liue by it: but you
marked not when the Preacher taught you
religion, becauſe you do not liue by it. Come
now to the daunger by hearing amiſſe. Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Take heed how you heare:</hi> In Deut. 4. it is
ſaid, <hi>Take heede how ye forget that which yee
heare.</hi> This <hi>Take heede</hi> awaies goeth before
ſome daunger: therefore as Paul ſaith, that
men receiue the Sacrament to their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or to their damnation, 1. Cor. 11. ſo Chriſt
ſaith, that men heare the Word to their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or to their damnation, <hi>The word which I
haue ſpoken ſhall iudge you in the latter day.</hi>
Ioh. 12.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note> It is called <hi>the ſauour of life,</hi> becauſe
it ſaueth, and it is called <hi>the ſauour of death,</hi>
               <pb n="645" facs="tcp:17992:335" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becauſe it condemneth. An euill eye ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
luſt, &amp; an euil tongue ingendreth ſtrife:
but an euil eare makes an heretike, and a ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike,
and an Idolater. This careleſſe <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
made GOD take away his worde from
the Iewes: therefore you may heare the word
ſo, as it may bee taken from you, as the talent
was from him that hid it,<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> for GOD will not
leaue his pearles with ſwine: but as he ſaith,
<hi>What haſt thou to doe to take my words in thy
mouth ſeeing thou hateſt to bee reformed?</hi> So
he will ſay, what haſt thou to doe to take my
word in thy eare, ſeeing thou hateſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?
If any of you goe away no better
then you came, you are not like <hi>hearers,</hi> but
like cyphers, which ſupplie a place, but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
nothing, ſo you take a roume but learne
nothing: and they which are cyphers in the
houſe of GOD, ſhall bee cyphers in the
kingdome of GOD. Therefore, if thou haue
an euill eye, and an euill tongue, and an euill
hand, and an euill foote, yet haue not an euill
eare too: for then all is euill, becauſe the eare
muſt teach all. If the eare hearken to euill,
then the heart muſt learne euill. Therefore
an euill eare is compared vnto a bad Porter,
which lets in euery one in a gay coat, though
hee bee neuer ſo bad; and keepes out him
that goes bare, though he be neuer ſo good:
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:17992:336" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo an euil eare lets al that is euil enter into the
hair, but al that is good ſhuts the dore againſt
it, leſt it ſhould ſet the ſpirit &amp; the fleſh at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance.
Oh, if the Adder had not ſtopped his
eare, how lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince had he bin charmed? But
the ſhorteſt time in Gods ſeruice is the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt
time in al the day. The beaſt came to the Arke
to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; men wil not come to the
Church to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. <hi>It is too far,</hi> ſaith Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but it were not too far if Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were

&amp; the loue of ſaluation is ſo cold, that we will
not reade ouer one book for it, for al we ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ſo many idle times while we liue. If Samuel
had thought that God had ſpoken to him; he
would not haue ſlept, but becauſe he thought
it was not God but Eli, therefore he ſlept: ſo,
becauſe, you reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber not <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> it is God which
ſpeaks, therefore you mark not: but if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred
Chriſts ſaying, <hi>He which heareth you
heareth me, &amp; he which deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:17992:336" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me,</hi> you would heare the voyce of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Preacher
as you would heare the voyce of God. Surely
(beloued) we know no other way to ſaue you
nor our ſelues: if we did, how wretched were
we to keepe it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, which haue no other
calling, but to ſhew you the way of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
If this be the way &amp; no other, if this be ſhewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you &amp; no other, &amp; yet you will not take it but
chuſe another, then are you not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by
any other, but you condemne your ſelues. He
which wil not heare is worſe then Herod: for
as bad as he was, yet it is ſaid of him, that he
heard Iohn. Nay, euen thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Sauiour
Chriſt in the Parable before this text compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to the barren, the ſtonie, and the thornie
ground, were al <hi>hearers,</hi> &amp; therfore he which
wil not heare, is worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. It is ſaid
of Saul, that though he were haunted with an
euil ſpirit, yet when he heard Dauid play vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Harpe, the euill ſpirit departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: ſo
they which <hi>heare,</hi> haue ſome eaſe of their ſins;
ſome peace of conſcience, ſome intermiſſion
of their feare, as Saul had when he heard the
Harpe, but they which wil not <hi>heare,</hi> haue no
intermiſſion of their feare, nor of their griefe,
nor of their ſinnes, becauſe the euill ſpirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
departeth from them. Therefore as all the
beaſts tremble when the Lyon roareth, ſo let
all men hearken when God teacheth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ende hereof is prooued,
that none ſhould preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
due meditation: which is a
common preſumption in theſe
daies, and makes the Word and
Miniſterie deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Now it remaineth that I ſhould teach you
ſo to heare, that you may remember that
which is ſayd, and learne more by one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
then you reape by tenne. Chriſt calleth
none vnto him but them which hunger and
thirſt, as if none were fit to heare the Word,
but they which hunger after it, &amp; bring a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is written of the Hart, that
when he lifteth vp his eares, hee is quicke of
hearing, &amp; heareth euery noiſe: but when he
laieth down his eares, he is deafe and heareth
nothing: So it is, when you marke and when
you mark not. They which are quicke of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
are ſure of remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but they which
are dull of hearing, are ſhort in keeping:
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:17992:337" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore before I teach you howe to <hi>heare,</hi>
giue me leaue againe to ſay as my Text ſayth,
<hi>Take heede how ye heare,</hi> that both our labors
be not loſt.</p>
            <p>As there be two ſpirites, ſo there be two
doctrines, two wiſdomes, and two counſels.
In 1. Timothie 4. 1. There is a doctrine of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
if you <hi>heare</hi> that doctrine, you hearken
to the Diuell, as Saul did to a Witch. In the
fifteenth of Math.<note place="margin">Mar. 10.</note> there is a doctrine of men,
which Chriſt calles <hi>Leauen:</hi> if you hearken to
that, you ſhal erre like men, becauſe the blind
lead the blinde. In Gen. 3. there is a counſell
of the ſerpent: if you hearken to that, you ſhal
periſh like Eue. In the 2. Sam. 18. there is a
wiſdom of Achitophel: if you hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that,
you ſhall ſpeed like Abſolon. Of all theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
ſaith, <hi>Hearken no more to the wordes
which make thee to erre.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 16. 27.</note> But there is another
doctrine, Act. 13. 12. which is called, <hi>The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Lord</hi> of this it is ſayd. Luk. 8. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
hath an eare to heare let him heare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſhew you how you ſhould <hi>heare,</hi>
When Peter &amp; Iohn would make the cripple
attentiue,<note place="margin">Act. 3.</note> they ſaid vnto him, <hi>Looke vpon vs:</hi>
ſo, many to ſharpen their attention, deſire to
ſtand before the preacher, that they may look
him in the face. by this little help Peter ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that we had need to vſe many helpes to
make vs heare well. In the thirteenth chapter,
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:17992:338" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; fifteenth verſe of the Propheſie of Ieremie
when the Lord ſpeaketh, it is ſaide: <hi>Heare
and giue eare,</hi> as though we ſhould heare and
more than heare. This more than heare, is to
marke, and vnderſtand, and remember, and
beleeue, &amp; follow that which we heare: Like
the Iewes which ſaid, <hi>All which thou ſpeakest
from the Lord, we will doe it: Exod.</hi> 24. So all
that which wee ſpeake vnto you from the
Lord, you ſhould do it: Therfore all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
but the laſt are commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of doing. And Salomon in the twelfth
Chapter of Eccleſiaſtes, and thirteenth verſe,
concludes his doctrine with this, which hee
calleth the ſumme of all: <hi>Feare the Lord and
keepe his commandements.</hi> In the third Chap- of
Exodus, and the fifth verſe, God teacheth
vs how to heare, when he ſpeakes to Moſes
and bids him <hi>put off his ſhooes:</hi> So we ſhould
put off our luſts, &amp; our thoughts, &amp; our cares,
and our fancies, and all our buſineſſe, when
God ſpeaks, for he which thinks or doth any
thing elſe, when he ſhould doe that which is
better, though it be good which he doth, yet
he doth ſinne in doing it.</p>
            <p>In the 10 of the Reuelation, an Angell tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs how to heare, when he willed Iohn
to eate the Booke: ſhewing that we ſhould
hunger after the word, and digeſt it into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
parte as we digeſt meate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="651" facs="tcp:17992:338" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In Math. 15. Chriſt teacheth vs howe to
heare, when he ſaith, <hi>Heare and vnderstand.</hi>
And againe in Mark. 4. when he ſaith, <hi>Take
heede what ye heare.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 42. 23.</note> And Eſay teacheth you
how to heare, when he ſaith: <hi>Heare for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi>
ſhewing, that more doe heare for the
preſent then for afterwarde, becauſe they
forget it againe, and after a while are neuer
the better. In 1. Cor. 6. 1. Paul teacheth vs how
to heare, when he ſaith, <hi>Receiue not the grace
of God in vaine,</hi> ſhewing that many heare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and are not comforted, many heare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and are not inſtructed. Iames tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs how to heare, Cap. 1. 22. when hee
ſaith: <hi>Be not hearers only, but dooers:</hi> ſhewing
that you ſhould do as you heare, as you would
haue vs to do as we teach.<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> In the 10. of Luke,
Marie teacheth vs howe to heare, when ſhe
leaues all to ſit at Chriſts feete and marke his
doctrine: ſhewing that wee ſhould not ſay
like the churliſh gueſtes, we haue other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
but that this is our buſineſſe, as Chriſt
anſwered his Parents, <hi>I must goe about my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
buſineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Luke 2. the virgine teacheth vs how to
<hi>heare;</hi> when ſhe heard the ſayings of Anna
and Simeon, and Chriſt, it is ſaid that <hi>ſhe pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them, &amp; laid them vp in her heart:</hi> ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
that our eares ſhuld be but meſſengers
to the heart: for our treaſure ſhould be where
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:17992:339"/>
the heart is, as the heart is where the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is. In the 17. of the Actes, the men of
Boerea teach vs how to <hi>heare,</hi> when they went
home and ſearched the Scriptures ſo ſoone
as they had heard Paul preach, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Moſes and the Prophets did teach the
ſame, ſhewing that the worde is our Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
to trie the Doctrines if wee will not
crie.</p>
            <p>In the 8. of Luke, all the Diſciples teach
vs how to <hi>heare,</hi> when they noted Chriſts pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
&amp; repeated it againe vnto him, to know
the meaning: ſhewing that we ſhould not
onely heare, and the preacher onely preach:
but if you doubt of any thing, you ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and they ſhould inſtruct you againe.
In the third of Luke, the Souldiers and the
Harlots and the Publicanes teach vs how to
<hi>heare,</hi> when they come to require, and aske,
<hi>Master, what ſhall we doe?</hi> ſhewing, that we
ſhould come to heare ſome thing which may
incourage vs to this vertue, or arme vs againſt
that vice, that we goe from hearing to doing
as Iohn taught them: all theſe are glaſſes in
the ſcripture for the <hi>hearer</hi> to addreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by, before he come to the ſermon.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe, other things doe teach vs
too. As Salomon ſayth, <hi>Go to the Piſmire, and
learne to labour:</hi> ſo Chriſt in the beginning of
this Chapter ſends vs to the husband-man to
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:17992:339" rendition="simple:additions"/>
learne to <hi>heare,</hi> as he prepareth the ground
before he ſow his ſeede, leſt his ſeed ſhould be
loſt: ſo we ſhould prepare our hearts before
we <hi>heare,</hi> leſt Gods ſeede be loſt. In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0.
of Iohn he ſends vs to the ſheep: as they know
the voice of their ſhepheard, and will not
heare a ſtranger, ſo we ſhuld know the voice
of Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voice of Popes, or Doctors,
or Counſels, or Traditions, leſt we goe like
Samuel from God to Eli. When you haue bin
in the ſheep-folds, go to the woods, &amp; learne
of the birdes: for they will ſo liſten to him,
which teacheth them to ſing, that they learne
to ſing the ſame note after him, ſo we ſhould
learne to ſing the tune of the ſpirite: for they
which heare the word aright, learne to ſpeake
euen as the <hi>Worde</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe ſchoolemaſters, we haue other
Teachers too, all the titles which are giuen to
the <hi>Word,</hi> doe teach vs how we ſhould <hi>heare
the Word</hi> The Apoſtles call their writings <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
The Epiſtle to the Romanes, The Epiſtle to
the Corinthians, &amp;c.</hi> ſhewing that the <hi>Word</hi> is
like an <hi>Epistle</hi> ſent from God to man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he writes his mind familiarly vnto vs, and
therefore we ſhould read it, heare it, marke it,
and ſcanne it, as we would ſcanne a Letter
which comes from ſome of our familiar and
deare friends.</p>
            <p>In Mark. 14. the Goſpel of Chriſt is called
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:17992:340" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Teſtament or Will, ſhewing, that our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
are written in it, and that wee ſhoulde
heare it, and marke it, and plie it till wee
bee as cunning in Gods will, as we are in our
Fathers will. In the firſt Epiſtle of Saint Paul
to Timothie the ſixt chapter, the <hi>Word</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a charge,</hi> and in the ſecond to Timothie
the fourth chapter, GOD is called a <hi>Iudge,</hi>
ſhewing that we ſhuld hear the word of God
as we hearken to a Iudge, when hee giues a
charge, or pronounceth a ſentence: for euery
ſentence in this booke is a charge to the King
or the Counſeller, or the Lawyer, or the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
or one, or other, let euery one heare his
charge.</p>
            <p>In the fift Chapter of the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,
ver. 14. the <hi>Word</hi> is called <hi>meat,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that we ſhould deſire and hunger to hear
it. And as the ſtomacke ſends the ſtrength of
the meat into euery member of the body: ſo
we ſhould ſend to the eye, that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the eye: and to the eare, that which is
ſpoken to the eare: and to the tongue, that
which is ſpoken to the tongue: and to the
hande, that which is ſpoken to the hande. If
thou heare comfort apply that to thy feare. If
thou heare a promiſe, apply that to thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt.
If thou heare a threatning, applie that
to thy preſumption, and fill vp the gap ſtill
where the diuell entreth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="655" facs="tcp:17992:340"/>
In the parable before my texte, the word is
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to ſeede: the preachers to ſowers, &amp;
the hearers to the grounde, ſhewing, that ye
come hither to be watered and dreſſed, and
manured: therefore if Gods ſeede be ſowne,
and the diuels fruits come vp: you are like
the Iewes, which brought Chriſt vineger
when he thirſted for wine.</p>
            <p>As the little birds perke vp their heads
when their damme comes with meate, and
prepare their beakes to take it, ſtriuing who
ſhall catch moſt; now this lookes to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and now that lookes for a bit, and euery
mouth is open vntill it bee filled: ſo you are
here like birds, and we the damme, and the
worde the foode, therefore you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a mouth to take it. They which are
hungry wil ſtriue for the bread which is caſt
amongſt them, &amp; think this is ſpoken to me,
this is ſpoken to me, I haue neede of this, and
I haue neede of this: comfort goe thou to
my feare, promiſe goe thou to my diſtruſt,
theatning goe thou to my ſecuritie, and the
<hi>Word</hi> ſhall be like a perfume, which hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
for euery one.</p>
            <p>Theſe are good remembrances for all
<hi>hearers</hi> to thinke that the <hi>Word</hi> is an Epſtle
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God vnto them, that it is the Will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Legacies are written, that it is a
charge from the Iudge of life and death, that
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:17992:341"/>
it is the meate whereby they liue, that it is
the ſeede which if it growe they are fruitfull,
if it growe not they haue no fruite, but theſe
are generall matters, my deſire is to teach
you a compendious way of <hi>hearing,</hi> which
you haue not heard before, that as the <hi>Word</hi>
is called a briefe worde, ſo you may learne it
briefly: for it is not gainfull vnto vs as it is to
Lawyers, Phiſitians and Surgeons, to keepe
you long in hand, but to heale you and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
you quickly as Chriſt healed the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
This Age hath deuiſed diuers Methods
to learne many things in ſhorter time than
they were learned of old: A man may ſpend
ſeauen yeares in learning to write, and he
may meet with a Scribe which will teach him
as much in a moneth. A Prentice may ſpende
nine yeares in learning a trade, and ſome
maiſter (if hee were diſpoſed) would teach
him as much in a twelue moneth. A man may
fetch ſuch a compaſſe that he may be a whole
moneth in going to Barwicke, and another
which knoweth the way will goe it in leſſe
than a week: ſo to euery thing there is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way and a neerer way, and ſo there is to
knowledge. You do not remember the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
part of that which you haue heard, &amp; to
morrowe you will not remember the tenth
note which you <hi>heare</hi> this day. It may be that
ſome wil remember more: and why not thou
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:17992:341" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as well as hee? becauſe one vſeth a helpe
for his memorie, which the other vſeth not.
If you will vſe his policie, you ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as wel as he: for let him neglect his help,
and the beſt memorie here ſhall not carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
halfe which he marketh now, vntill it be
night. When the woman of Samaria heard
Chriſt ſpeake of a water, <hi>of which he that drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
ſhall thirſt no more, Oh</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>giue me
of that water:</hi> ſo now you heare of ſuch a way,
you would faine know it: but will you vſe it?
I wiſh that I were ſuch a meſſenger,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> that I
could compell you vnto it: for truely vntill
you vſe it, you ſhall neuer learne faſter then
you doe. Now I thinke you haue a deſire to
heare it, I will ſhew it vnto you. Firſt in mine
opinion, two things out of euery Sermon are
ſpecially to bee noted, that which thou didſt
not know before, and that which ſpeaketh to
thine owne ſinne: for ſo thou ſhalt encreaſe
thy knowledge, and leſſen thy vices.</p>
            <p>Now if thou wouldeſt remember both
theſe a yeare hence as freſh as now, this is the
beſt policie that euer thou ſhalt learne, to put
them preſently in practiſe, that is, to ſende
them abroad to all the parts of thy ſoule, and
members of thy bodie, and reforme thy ſelfe
ſemblably to them, and thou ſhalt neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
them, for thy practiſe remembreth them:
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:17992:342"/>
but before this, you muſt vſe another helpe,
that is, record euery note in thy minde as the
preacher goeth, and after before thou doeſt
eate, or drinke, or talke, or any thing elſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
all to thy ſelfe. I doe know ſome in the
Vniuerſitie, which did neuer heare good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but aſſoone as they were gone, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
it thus, and learned more by this (as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſayd) then by their reading and ſtudie:
for recording that which they had heard
when it was freſh, they could remember all,
and hereby got a better facilitie in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then they could learne in bookes. The
like profite I remember I gained when I was
a ſcholler by the like practiſe.</p>
            <p>The Philoſophers and Orators that haue
written ſuch volumes, haue left in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that this was the keeper of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
like the bagge which beareth the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
Therefore I may ſay with Chriſt, that
the wicked are wiſer then Chriſtians: for the
Orators and Philoſophers vſed this helpe in
hearing of earthly things, and wee will not
vſe it in hearing of heauenly things. The onlie
cauſe why you forget ſo faſt as you heare, and
of al the ſermons which you haue heard haue
ſcarce the ſubſtance of one in your hearts, to
comfort or counſaile you when you haue
neede, is becauſe you went from Sermon to
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:17992:342" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dinner, and neuer thought any more of the
matter, as though it were enough to heare,
like ſieues which hold water no longer then
they are in the Riuer.</p>
            <p>What a ſhame is this to remember euerie
clauſe in your Leaſe, and euery poynt in your
Fathers will, nay, to remember an old tale ſo
long as you liue, though it bee long ſince you
heard it, and the leſſons which ye heare now,
will bee gone within this houre, that you
may aske what hath ſtollen my ſermon from
me? Therefore that you may not heare vs in
vaine, as you haue heard others, my exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
vnto you, is, to recorde when you are
gone, that which you haue heard. If I could
reach you a better way, I would: but Chriſts
Diſciples vſed this way when their thoughts
ranne vpon his ſpeech,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> and made them come
againe to him to aske the meaning: the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
his Mother vſeth this way when ſhee
pondered his ſayings,<note place="margin">Luk 1.</note> and laide them vp in
her heart:<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> the good hearers of Beroea vſed
this waye, when they carried Pauls Sermon
home with them, that they might examine
it by the Scriptures. This difference is noted
between Iacob and his ſonnes, when Ioſeph
vttered his dreame, his brethren gaue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
to it: but it is ſayd that Father <hi>Iacob no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſaying.</hi> Therefore this muſt needes be
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:17992:343" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an excellent way.<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 11.</note> For if Ioſeph, and Marie,
and Chriſtes Diſciples ſhould ſpeake vnto
you as I doe, and ſhewe you a way to heare,
they would ſhewe you the ſame way that
they vſed themſelues. You cannot tell how
much it will profite you vntill you practiſe it:
doe but trie it one moneth, and if you loue
knowledge, I am ſure you will vſe it while
you liue. But if you will not vſe it for all that
can bee ſaid, truely you ſhall be like the olde
women which S. Paul ſpeakes of, which were
alwaies learning, and were neuer the wiſer.</p>
            <p>This is our firſt leſſon vnto you, <hi>Take heede
how you heare:</hi> I may ſay now, Take heede
how you reade too. For there are bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
like Iſmaels ſcoffes,<note place="margin">Eſa. 36.</note> like Rabſhekeh
his railings, like the ſongs which were made
againſt Dauid, which may write for the title
of their Bookes,<note place="margin">1. King. 16. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Fooles in print.</hi> If Hiel had
not built Iericho againe, theſe might bee fit
worke-men for ſuch a frame. If you muſt
<hi>Take heede how you heare:</hi> then we muſt take
heede how wee preach, for you heare that
which wee preach.<note place="margin">Of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> Therefore Paul putteth
none amongſt the number of Preachers, but
they which cut the Worde aright: that is, in
right wordes, in right ſenſe, and in right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode:
and becauſe none can doe this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtudie and meditation, therefore he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:17992:343" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Timothie to giue attendance to Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that is, to make a ſtudie and labour of
it: for as Paul ſaith, that in Peters Epiſtles
there bee many things hard to vnderſtand:
ſo in Pauls Epiſtles, and Iohns Epiſtles, and
Iames Epiſtle, there bee many hard things
too, which Dauid before called, <hi>The wonders
of the Lawe,</hi> and Paul calleth <hi>The mysterie of
ſaluation,</hi> and Chriſt calleth <hi>A Treaſure hid
in the ground.</hi> Therefore Salomon confeſſeth
that he ſtudied for his Doctrines, Eccl. 12. 10.
Although hee was the wiſeſt and learnedſt
man that euer was, yet he thought, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtudie he could not doe much good. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
was a Prophet, and yet he deſired reſpite
to interpret Nabuchadnezzars Dreame.<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 16.</note> Is
the Scripture lighter then a Dreame, that we
ſhould interpret it without meditation? It
ſeemes then that Salomon and Daniel would
not count them Sermons, which come foorth
like vntimely births from vncircumciſed lips,
and vnwaſhen hands, as though they had the
ſpirit at commandement. Wheate is good,
but they which ſell the refuſe thereof, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued:
Amos. 8. 6. So preaching is good, but
this refuſe of preaching is but like ſwearing:
for one takes the name of God in vaine, and
the other takes the word of God in vaine. As
euery ſound is not muſicke, ſo euery Sermon
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:17992:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not preaching, but worſe then if he ſhould
reade an Homily. For if Iames would haue vs
conſider what wee aske before wee come to
pray, much more ſhould we conſider before
we come to preach: for it is harder to ſpeake
Gods words, then to ſpeak to God. Yet there
are preachers riſen lately vp, which ſhrowde
euery abſurd ſermon vnder the name of the
ſimple kinde of teaching, like the Popiſh
Prieſts, which made ignorance the mother
of deuotion: but indeede to preach ſimply,
is not to preach vnlearnedly, nor confuſedly,
but plainly and perſpicuouſly, that the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt
which doth heare, may vnderſtand what
is taught, as if he did heare his name.</p>
            <p>But if you will know why many preachers
preach ſo barely, looſely, &amp; ſimply, it is your
owne ſimplicitie which makes them thinke
that if they goe on and ſay ſomething all is
one, and no fault will be found, becauſe you
are not able to iudge in or out: and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they giue no attendance to doctrine, as
Paul teacheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is almoſt come to paſſe,
that in a whole Sermon, the hearer cannot
picke out one note more then he could gather
himſelfe: and many loathe preaching, as
the Iewes abhorred the ſacrifice, for the ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
Prieſts which cared not what they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
and the greater ſort imagine that there
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:17992:344"/>
is no more wiſedome in the word of GOD,
then their teachers ſhewe out of it. What a
ſhame is this that the preachers ſhould make
preaching bee deſpiſed? In the 48. of Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,
there is a curſe vpon them which doe
the buſineſſe of the Lord negligently: if this
curſe doe not touch them which do the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
buſineſſe of the Lord negligently, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take holde of any other. Therefore let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
preacher firſt ſee how his notes dooth
moue himſelfe, and then he ſhall haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to deliuer them to other, like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienſt
medicine, which himſelfe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>Thus much of preaching: nowe to you
which <hi>heare.</hi> Thinke that you are gathering
Manna, and that it is God which ſpeakes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and that you ſhall giue account for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
leſſon which ye <hi>heare:</hi> and therefore
record like Marie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are gone,
and the ſeede which wee ſowe,
ſhall grow faſter then the
ſeed which you ſow.</p>

to the words before, viz. <hi>Take heede how you

and flouriſheth like a twigge which hath

taketh no heede how he heareth, fadeth and
withereth like a ſtocke which is dead, vntill
hee hath not onely loſt the giftes which hee
had, but till the ſpirite doe leaue him too,
and he ſeeme as naked to men as Adam did
to GOD. The like ſentence in the twentie
one of Mathew, where it is ſaid, <hi>The kingdom
of heauen ſhall bee taken from you, and ſhall bee
giuen to a Nation which will bring foorth the
fruites thereof:</hi> there is a taking from them
which bring no fruites, and a giuing to them
which bring fruites. The like is in the 22. of
the Reuelat. where it is ſaid, <hi>Let him which is
iust be iust ſtill, and let him which is filthie bee
filthy ſtill:</hi> whereby it is meant, that the iuſt
ſhall bee more iuſt, and the filthy ſhall bee
more filthie. The like is in the 15. of Iohn, 2.
where it is ſaide, <hi>Euery branch which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no fruite, he taketh away, but euery branch
which bringeth foorth fruite, he purgeth, that it
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:17992:346"/>
may bring foorth more fruite.</hi> The likeis in
the 25. of Matthew, where this ſentence is
repeated agayne after the Parable of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents:
as to one ſeruaunt were committed
fiue Talents, and to another two, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
one, to increaſe and multiplie, and
hee which vſed his Talent doubled it, and
hee which hid his Talent, loſt it: euen ſo to
euery man GOD hath giuen ſome gifte, of
Iudgement, or tongues, or interpretation, or
counſell to employ and doe good, and hee
which vſeth that gift which God hath giuen
him to the profite of others, and Gods glorie,
ſhall receiue moe giftes of GOD, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
which vſed two Talents, receiued two
more: but he which vſeth it not, but abuſeth
it, as many doe, that gifte which he hath ſhal
be taken from him, as the odde Talent was
from the ſeruant which had but one: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that one gifte is too much for the wicked,
and therefore it ſhal not ſtay with him. One
would thinke it ſhould be ſayd: Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath not, to him ſhall be giuen: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
hath, from him ſhall bee taken: for,
God biddeth vs giue to them which want.
But this is contrarie: for he taketh from them
which want, &amp; giueth to them which haue.
It is ſayd, that our thoughts are not like Gods
thoughtes: and ſo our giftes are not like
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:17992:347"/>
Gods giftes: for he giueth ſpirituall things,
and we giue temporall things. Temporall
things are to be giuen to them which haue
not, but ſpirituall things to them which
haue. Therefore Chriſt calleth none to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his worde, and ſpirite, and grace, but
them which hunger and thirſt, which is
the firſt poſſeſſion of heauen. When it is
ſaide, <hi>It ſhall be giuen:</hi> GOD ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
rich and bountifull, becauſe he giueth
to them which haue: that is, hee giueth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hath giuen: for <hi>What hath any which
hee hath not receiued?</hi> Therefore none can
ſaie as Eſau ſayd to Iſaac: <hi>Hast thou but one
bleſſing my Father?</hi> For he bleſſeth when he
hath bleſſed, as a ſpring runneth when it
hath runne. Firſt, marke the growthe of
Gods giftes in them which vſe them, how
he watereth his ſeede like a Gardener, vntill
it ſpring in the earth: and then he watereth
it agayne, vntill it ſpring aboue the earth:
and after hee watereth it agayne, vntill it
bring foorth fruit vpon the earth: therefore
GOD is called <hi>The Lord of the Haruest,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

dooth betray them, as ſtrength went

vſeth this talent in the twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty fiue of Mathew,
<hi>Good and faithfull ſeruaunt, I will make thee

Iacob ſhall not be curſed, becauſe Eſau is
curſed. Neither ſhall Eſau bee bleſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Iacob is bleſſed: But the Lord Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
who are his, and who are not: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſaith, <hi>woſoeuer hath,</hi> and <hi>whoſoeuer
hath not:</hi> as though he knew them all, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
they bee. This Scripture was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before it was written. For when Adam
ſerued GOD, God ſerued him: he conſulted
for a Manſion for him: he conſulted for meat
for him: hee conſulted for a companion for
him, vntill Adam rebelled againſt God, wee
read of nothing that God did, but his workes
for Adam ſixe dayes together, as though he
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:17992:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had beene hired to labour for him. But when
hee left his innocencie, then God began to
take againe that which he had giuen: he loſt
his wiſdome, he loſt his quietneſſe, hee loſt
his libertie, hee his glorie, hee loſt his
dwelling, like the man which fell amongſt
theeues. Thus while Adam had righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it might bee ſayde of him: <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath, to him ſhall bee giuen.</hi> And when
he had not righteouſnes, it might be ſayd of
him too: <hi>From him which hath not, ſhall be
taken.</hi> God is called a <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe he is
like a Father, which taketh a pleaſure to ſee
his ſonne thriue, and grieueth to ſee him an
vnthriſt. Firſt he giueth vs a ſtock, to prooue
our husbandrie: and then, if wee thriue with
that, hee dooth adde more vnto it, now a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and then a little, vntill at laſt the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
come too: As they which trie a veſſell,
firſt put water into it, to ſee whether it will
holde water, then they commit wine vnto it:
ſo, firſt God giueth vs one grace, if wee vſe
that wel, then he giueth another, &amp; another,
and another according to that, <hi>He which is
found faithfull in a little, ſhall bee made Lorde
ouer much. My Father</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>is an
huſbandman,</hi> Iohn 15. ſhewing that as wee
dreſſe the ground, that it may bring foorth
fruite, ſo God dreſſeth vs, that we may bring
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:17992:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foorth fruite. All commeth not at once, but
as the body groweth, ſo the ſpirite groweth:
firſt good thoughts, and then good ſpeeches,
and then good workes: as the blade fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the ſeede, and the eare the blade, and
the corne the eare. Looke howe in our firſt
generation one thing comes after another,
ſo it is in our ſecond generation: As the child
ſpringeth in the mothers wombe, from a
gellie vnto milke, and from milke to blood,
and from blood to fleſh, and ſhe knoweth
not how it groweth till it come foorth: ſo the
ſpirite groweth in vs, and we ſee not how it
groweth, but that it is growen. Fayth calleth
to loue, and loue calleth to obedience, and
obedience calleth to conſtancie, and one
grace is the foundation of another. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paul ſayth, <hi>Whome hee predeſtinated, them
he called: whom he called, them he iustified, &amp;
whom hee iuſtified them he glorified.</hi> Thus as
the rich eaſily growe richer, ſo the good ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
growe better: hee which hath power to
aske, hath power to receiue; for it is ſayde,
<hi>Aske, and you ſhall receiue:</hi> hee which hath
power to ſeeke, hath power to finde: for it
is ſaid, <hi>Seeke and you ſhall finde:</hi> he which hath
power to knocke, hath power to enter, for
it is ſayde, <hi>Knocke, and it ſhall be opened vnto
you.</hi> As Gods riches are infinite, ſo he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:17992:349" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wearie of giuing: when a man ſerueth
God, at laſt it commeth to this, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
(as it were) to doe him good, as it is
ſayd, Ieremiah 32. and Micah. 7. <hi>I will delight
to doe them good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when it commeth to this paſſe, that
God hath a delight to doe a man good, then
<hi>Aske what thou wilt</hi> (ſayth Salomon to his
Mother) <hi>and I will not ſay thee nay:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 2. 20</note> ſo, Aske
what thou wilt, and GOD will not ſay thee
nay. He which hath the Sonne, may haue the
Father, hee that hath the <hi>Wedding garment,</hi>
may haue the Wedding feaſt, he which hath
the ſpirite of Eliſha, may haue the ſpirite of
Eliah, he which commeth vnto Chriſt, may
make Chriſt come vnto him: as when the
Sonne came toward the Father, the Father
met him in the way, ſhewing that God is as
ready to giue, as wee to aske. When Dauid
did well, Nathan ſayd vnto him, <hi>The Lord
hath giuen thee this, and this, and this: and if

<pb n="673" facs="tcp:17992:349"/>
me to be bleſſed? What letteth mee to
be ſaued? And as Philip ſaid, <hi>Nothing:</hi> ſo
Chriſt ſaith <hi>Nothing,</hi> but <hi>Bee it vnto thee, as
thou beleeuest.</hi> From that day righteouſneſſe
ſtandeth ouer their heades, as the Sunne did
ouer <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and they renewe their vertues,
as the Eagle reneweth her youth. Therefore
when Iſaac had ſaid, <hi>Iaacob haue I bleſſed:</hi>
he addeth, <hi>and he ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> as if he ſhould
ſay, he beginneth to be bleſſed now, but hee
ſhall bee more bleſſed: ſo they which are
bleſſed of God, ſhall be more bleſſed, riſing
and riſing like the Sunne, vntill it come to
the height.</p>
            <p>When God hath begun to bleſſe, he ſaith
as hee ſaid to Abraham, <hi>What ſhall I hide
from him? What ſhall I keepe from him?</hi> As
though one of his giftes did binde him to
giue another: therefore his mercies are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>euerlasting mercies,</hi> becauſe when they
begin, they haue no end. So ſoone as hee had
mooued Salomon to pray for wiſdome, he
gaue him wiſedome: ſo ſoone as he had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Abraham to goe from his Countrey, hee
began to guide him: ſo ſoone as he had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Gedeon to fight, he began to ſtrengthen
him. Gods mercies are reſembled to raine,
firſt it raines ſmall drops, and after fall great
drops, and the ſmall are ſignes of the great.

Firſt, you ſee Eliſha with a ſingle ſpirit, and
after you ſee him with a double ſpirite: firſt
you ſee Paule ſitting at Gamaliels feete, and
afterward you ſee him preaching in Moſes
Chaire: firſt you ſee Timothie a ſtudent, and
after you ſee him an Euangeliſt: Firſt you
ſee Cornelius praying, and after you ſee Peter
inſtructing: firſt you ſee Dauid repenting, and
after you ſee Nathan comforting: firſt ye ſee
the Diſciples worſhipping, and after you ſee
the holy Ghoſt deſcending: firſt you ſee the
Wiſemen ſeeking Chriſt, and after you ſee
them together with Chriſt: firſt you ſee the
Sonne comming toward the Father, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you ſee the Father comming toward the
Sonne: firſt you ſee the Eunuch reading, and
after you ſee him vnderſtanding, and after
you ſee him beleeuing, and after you ſee him
baptiſed. Moſte notable is the example of
Nathaniel, ſo ſoone as he beleeued, Chriſt
remembred this promiſe, and ſaid, <hi>Beleeuest
thou for this, thou ſhalt ſee greater things than
theſe:</hi> ſo hee gaue more to him which had
ſome. That which he ſaid to Nathaniel, he
ſaith to all which are like Nathaniel, Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
thou this Sermon, thou ſhalt heare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sermons than this, repenteſt thou for
this example, thou ſhalt ſee other examples
than this, loueſt thou for one benefite, thou
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:17992:350"/>
ſhalt receiue moe benefites than one, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureſt
thou God for his giftes vpon others,
thou ſhalt feele his giftes vpon thy ſelfe: for
<hi>Hee which keepeth Iſrael dooth not ſleepe, but
watch.</hi> What dooth he watch? He watcheth
who ſeeketh for comfort, and who looketh
for wiſdome, and who prayeth for faith, and
who intreateth for patience, that hee may
giue aboundantly, to him which deſires fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentlie.</p>
            <p>If hee ſee one pray like Cornelius, he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
another to ſtrengthen him like Peter: if
he ſee one ſtudie like the Eunuch, he ſendeth
another to inſtruct him like Philip: if hee ſee
one mourne like Dauid, hee ſendeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to comfort him like Nathan: if hee ſee
one willing like Eſay, he ſendeth another to
able him like the Seraphim: if he ſee one that
thinketh well, hee teacheth him to ſpeake
well: if hee ſee one that ſpeaketh well, hee
teacheth him to doe well: if hee ſee one doe
well, he teacheth him to continue well: if
hee ſee one meeke like Moſes, hee maketh
him wiſe like Salomon: if he ſee one wiſe like
Salomon, hee maketh him righteous like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:
if he ſee one righteous like Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
he maketh him patient like Iob: if hee
ſee one patient like Iob, he maketh him pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
like Peter: if hee ſee one loue one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:17992:351"/>
he maketh him loue another vertue: if
hee ſee one hate one vice, hee maketh him
hate another vice: if he ſee one like one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
hee maketh him like another Sermon:
when hee hath him in his ſchoole, and hee
commeth once to this, to ſay like Samuel,
<hi>Speake Lord for thy ſeruant heareth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3.</note> then hee
taketh him vp to the mount like Moſes, and
openeth his heart vnto him, teaching him a
waie to make vſe of all that he ſeeth, and of
all that hee heareth, and of all that hee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
and of all that hee feeleth. Thus when
God hath ſtrayned and fined him, he is apt
to euerie good worke, and takes all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to doe them. If hee but ſee one praye,
his heart burneth to praye too: if hee ſee one
reading, he hath a minde to reade too: if hee
ſee one meditating, he hath a zeale to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
too: if hee ſee one ſorrowing, hee hath
a deſire to ſorrowe too: like the Diſciples,
which when they heard Peter ſay, wee goe
a fiſhing, they ſaid, we will goe a fiſhing too.
After this, euery benefit maketh him thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
euery inſtruction maketh him fearefull,
and he is neuer well, but when he is walking
with God like Enoch, or when Chriſt is ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to him, or when he is ſpeaking to Chriſt,
for when God meeteth with his children, like
a nurſe hee emptieth himſelfe of his milke,
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:17992:351"/>
according to this text which we now handle,
<hi>To him which hath, ſhall be giuen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when you vſe thoſe giftes well
which you haue, the Lorde will come vnto
you, and ſay that your heart may heare him,
<hi>Good ſeruant and faithfull, I will make thee
Lorde ouer much:</hi> thy ſeede ſhall become a
tree, thy ſpirite ſhall be doubled. Firſt, thou
ſhalt haue a loue to heare, reade and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:
after thou ſhalt haue a little knowledge
to iudge and ſpeake of Gods Worde, of the
ſpirite, and of doctrines: then thou ſhalt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to faith, which will bring thee vnto
peace of conſcience: then thou ſhalt meete
with good bookes, and God will ſend thee
Teachers to inſtruct thee, and incourage
thee like the Angels which came to Chriſt
when hee hungred. Thus a Trauailer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from towne vnto towne, vntill hee come
to his Inne: ſo a Chriſtian paſſeth from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to vertue, vntill hee come to Heauen,
which is the iourney that euery man muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to goe till death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It followeth:</hi> And whoſoeuer hath not from
him ſhall bee taken; euen that which it ſeemeth
that he hath.</p>
            <p>As the Lorde ſaith to his faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
<hi>Thou ſhalt bee ruler ouer much:</hi> ſo hee
ſaith of his ſlothfull ſeruant, <hi>Take his talent
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:17992:352" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from him.</hi> Heere is one like Iaacob whome
God loueth, <hi>to him</hi> (hee ſaith) <hi>ſhall bee giuen:</hi>
here is another like Eſau whome God hateth,
<hi>from him</hi> (hee ſaith) <hi>ſhall bee taken:</hi> ſo one
may ſay like Iob, <hi>The Lorde hath giuen:</hi> and
the other may ſay like Iob, <hi>The Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
But from whom dooth he take? <hi>From him
which hath not.</hi> And to whom dooth he giue?
<hi>To him which hath.</hi> In this God ſeemeth not
to deale his giftes charitablie: for he, ſhould
giue to them which want, Ioſeph maruailed
to ſee Iaacob lay his left hand vpon Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and his right hand vpon Ephraim, as
though the younger ſhould bee more bleſſed
than the elder. Iſhai maruailed to ſee Samuel
chooſe the leaſt of his ſonnes before the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt,
as though the vnfitteſt were the fitteſt:
ſo it is maruaile that hee which commandeth
vs to giue vnto them which want, ſhould
take from them which want, and giue to
them which haue. Iſaac would not haue bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Iaacob but Eſau, but God would haue
him bleſſe Iaacob and not Eſau: Ioſeph
would that Manaſſeth ſhoulde haue more
than Ephraim, but God would that Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
ſhould haue more than Manaſſeth. As
God loueth not as man loueth, ſo hee giueth
not as man giueth. Why ſhould Abraham
haue three Angels, and Lot but two, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:17992:352"/>
but one, and Balaac none? Why ſhould
not Philip goe vp the mount, as well as Iames?
Why ſhould not Aaron behold God, as well
as Moſes? Why ſhould not Moſes go to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
as well as Caleb?</p>
            <p>According to our loue is Gods loue, and
according to our hatred is Gods hatred.
Reuben ſhould haue had as good a bleſſing
as Iudah, but when Iaacob bleſſed him, (Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis
the 35. chapter &amp; 22. verſe) he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
his ſinne with Bilhah, and therefore
curbed his bleſſing: for when he bleſſed him
he ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not be excellent:</hi> as if hee
ſhould ſaye, Reuben thou ſhalt haue ſome
thing, but thou ſhalt not haue ſo much as
thou ſhouldeſt haue, becauſe of thy vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with Bilhah. So Moſes ſhould haue
gone to Canaan as well as Caleb: but GOD
remembred his murmuring at the waters of
bitternes. And when he deſired to goe vnto
it, God would not heare him, but let him ſee
it from an hill, and ſo hee dyed. So the third
ſeruant ſhould haue receiued as many Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
as his fellowes: but the Lorde remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
how hee hid the Talent which hee had,
and therefore would giue him no more, leaſt
he ſhould hide them too: ſo wee ſhould haue
more vnderſtanding, more iudgement and
more knowledge, but God ſeeth what wee
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:17992:353" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe with this, and therefore ſtayeth his hand,
leſt we ſhould abuſe any more. This is Saint
Iohns meaning when hee ſaith, <hi>God Giueth
grace for grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> That is, where he findes one
grace, there he giueth another. This is Saint
Paules meaning Rom. 1. where he ſaith, <hi>The
righteouſneſſe of God is reuealed from faith
to faith:</hi> ſignifying that they which haue
faith ſhall haue more faith. Therefore this
is the fearefulleſt ſigne, that wee haue no
faith nor grace, if God do not increaſe our
faith and his graces in vs: For <hi>to him which
hath, ſhall be giuen:</hi> Therefore, if we had faith,
wee ſhould haue loue: if wee had loue, wee
ſhould haue knowledge: if wee had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
we ſhould haue zeale: if we had zeale,
we ſhould haue holines. As he which hath
broken one commaundement, is made guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of all: ſo hee which hath one vertue, is
made partaker of all. It is ſaid: ſo long as
Iehoiada liued,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 24.</note> Ioaſh proſpered and did well;
becauſe Iehoiada inſtructed &amp; guided him,
but when Iehoiada dyed, Ioaſh goodnes died
with him, and he was neuer like himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but turned like his fathers: So there is a
ſeed in the heart, which while it liueth and
is foſtered, wee ſprowt and proſper as Ioaſh
did; but when that ſeede dyeth for want of
cheriſhing, then wee beginne to droope and
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:17992:353"/>
fade, and decay againe as loaſh did. If one
vertue bee offended ſhe lureth all her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

ſhronke with Abner.</p>
            <p>Dauid ſetteth forth the godly man <hi>like a

Straight vpon this, he ſaith: <hi>It is not ſo with
the wicked.</hi> When hee ſpake of <hi>growing and
flouriſhing, and fructifying,</hi> hee ſaith: <hi>It is not
ſo with the wicked.</hi> That is, it is contrarie with
the wicked: therefore their gifts are not like

Chaffe which the winde bloweth away.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 5.</note> Nay

               <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> If they bee <hi>Chaffe,</hi>
then their fruite is <hi>Chaffe.</hi> The Gluttons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was for the vngodly, but the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was for the holy.<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> Therfore he which had
not the <hi>Wedding garment,</hi> had not the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
feaſt. For if the Lord would caſt pearles
vnto Swine, why doth he forbid vs to doe ſo?
Therfore it is not ſaid, <hi>Be it vnto thee as thou
deſireſt,</hi> leſt all ſhould looke to receiue: but
<hi>Be it vnto thee as thou beleeueſt,</hi> that all might
care to <hi>Beleeue.</hi> It is not ſaid to them which
ſeeke not, <hi>yee ſhall find:</hi> but <hi>Seeke, and you ſhall
find.</hi> How ſhould they <hi>Enter</hi> which haue not
a hand to knocke at the doore? How ſhould
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:17992:354"/>
they <hi>Receiue,</hi> which haue not a tongue to

which haue not <hi>the feare of the Lorde,</hi>
which <hi>is the beginning of wiſedome?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 1.</note> Thus as
Iames ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith, and I will ſhew
thee my faith:</hi> So God faith, ſhewe mee thy
loue, and I will ſhew thee my loue: as Chriſt
was knowne at Emaus by breaking of bread,
ſo you may knowe him heere by dealing his
giftes. It is ſaid when Ioſeph feaſted his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note>
Beniamins meſſe had fiue times more
than any of his brethren, becauſe Ioſeph lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him more than the reſt: ſo the mercy and
graces of God will ſhew to whome his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſtandeth. If you ſee Chriſt leaning on
a mans breaſt as Iohn did on Chriſts breaſt,
then may you ſay, this is a beloued Diſciple:
For as Lidia perſwaded Paule and Silas to
come to her houſe,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 13.</note> ſaying, <hi>If you iudge me to
bee faithfull, come to my houſe:</hi> ſo you may
iudge them to be faithfull to whoſe houſe the
Lord commeth.</p>
            <p>If you aske Salomon to whome the Lord
giueth wiſedome and knowledge, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth,
<hi>To a man which is good in his ſight,</hi>
Eccleſ. the ſecond Chapter, and twentie ſixe
verſe: ſhewing that thoſe men are gracious
in Gods ſight, as Ioſeph was in Pharaohs.
Contrariwiſe, if you ſee God flying from a
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:17992:354" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man, as Dauid fled from Saul, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
his ſpirite as the Maſter did his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
then you may ſaie, this is not a faithfull
ſeruant to his Maſter: for if he had vſed his
Talent well, the Lord would increaſe it as hee
promiſed, but becauſe he doth abuſe it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lorde dooth withdrawe it againe as
he threatned.</p>
            <p>To ſome God giueth, and neuer recalleth
againe, to ſome he giueth and after taketh it
from them: As ſome Angels went vp the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and ſome went downe: ſo ſome mens
gifts increaſe and ſome decreaſe. To the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians

In Geneſ. 1. you haue God bleſſing. In
Geneſ. 4. you haue God curſing. In Acts 26.
you haue God opening eyes. In Eſay 6. you
haue God ſhutting eyes. In Dan. 2. you haue
God making wiſe. In Eſa. 44. you haue God
making fooles. In Iohn 15. you haue God
dreſſing trees. In Matthew 3. you haue God

Thus wee are riſing, or ſetting: getting, or

As Eliſha his ſpirite was doubled; ſo Saules
ſpirit departed. As the Gentiles become be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,

Euen as the thornes burne while the Vines
fructifie. When Iſhboſheth was a ſleepe vpon

gifts. It was neuer ſaid, Sampſon hath loſt his

and wiſdome like Iaacob, thou ſhalt
thriue in graces, and one daye ſhall teach
another, but when that ſteward departeth
from thee, then looke that thy wiſedome,

as faſt as the widowes oyle increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
the world will winne the fleſh, and the
fleſh will winne the ſpirit, and one ſinne will
crie to another as the Moabites did at the
riuer, <hi>Now Moab to the ſpoyle,</hi> now ſinnes to

as though it were afraide to bee taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
of ignorance, thy loue ſhall not abide
thy hatred, thy humilitie ſhall not abide thy
pride, thy temperaunce ſhall not abide thy
concupiſence. As thou ſeeſt the leaues fall
from the trees in a boyſtrous winde: ſo thy
graces ſhall drop away one after another,
as though thou were in a conſumption. As
the Arke would not ſtaye with the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
ſo the grace of GOD will not ſtaie
with ſinners, but flieth from them like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.
Dauid was not ſo readie to flie from
Saule, but the ſpirite was as readie to flie
from him too. This muſt come vppon all
which ſinne like Sampſon, their ſtrength
muſt departe from them vntill they learne
like Nabuchadnezzar from whence it came.<note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note>
This ſentence is ſuch a meditation, that hee
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:17992:356" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which would preach it to the quicke, had
neede to haue an eie in all mens hearts, to
ſee how one vertue dieth after another, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the ſoule die too. As there is a fall of
leaues, and an Eclipſe of the ſunne, and a
conſumption of the bodie: ſo there is a fall of
giftes, and an Eclipſe of knowledge, &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the ſpirit. It is ſtraunge to ſee,
how wiſdome, and knowledge, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doe ſhun the wicked, as though they
were afraid to be defiled. As Barach would
not goe, vnles Deborah would go with him:
ſo knowledge will not ſtay vnles vertue will
ſtay with her. To this Ieremy poynted when
he mocked the Iewes for ſaying,<note place="margin">Iere. 18. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Knowledge
ſhall not depart from the prieſt, nor counſel from

Eſay pointed when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſa. 26. 14.</note> 
               <hi>The wiſdome of

one day Chriſt will tell you, that <hi>Whoſoeuer

that ſaying, then remember theſe examples
how he hath fulfilled it before. After come
the apoſtles, and they ſhew ſome <hi>hardened</hi>
ſome <hi>bewitched,</hi> ſome <hi>blinded.</hi> Paule tels how
Demas <hi>fel away,</hi> and Iohn ſheweth how <hi>many

on either ſide, and Chriſt in the mids hold vp
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:17992:356" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this threatning as if it were a pit, which all
are falling into.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 16.</note> The ſoule of man is called <hi>the
temple of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> As God pulled downe
his <hi>temple</hi> when it became <hi>a den of theeues,</hi> ſo
he forſaketh <hi>the temple of the ſoule,</hi> &amp; taketh
his graces with him (as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a diuorſed ſpouſe)
when it luſteth after other loues. With any
Talent he giueth this charge, <hi>Vſe &amp; increaſe
it vntill I come:</hi> being left, at laſt the commeth
againe to ſee what we haue done. The ſeede
was ſowen, this yeere the Lord cals for fruite
&amp; none will come, the next yeere, &amp; the next
after, and none comes: at laſt the curſe goeth
foorth, <hi>Neuer fruit grow vpon thee more.</hi> Then
as the figtree began to wither: ſo his giftes
begin to paire, as if a worme were ſtill gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at them: his knowledge leeſeth his reliſh

ruſtes like a ſworde which is not vſed: his

his faith withereth as though it were bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and the image of death is vpon all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
After this, he thinketh like Sampſon
to pray as he did, and ſpeake as he did, and
hath no power, but wondereth like zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kias
how the ſpirit is gone from him. Now
when the good ſpirit is gone, then commeth
the ſpirit of blindeneſſe, and the ſpirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the ſpirite of feare, and all to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:17992:357" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſpirite of man. After this, by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little firſt he falles into error, then he
comes vnto hereſie, at laſt hee plungeth into
diſpaire: after this if he enquire, God will
not ſuffer him to learne: if he read, God will
not ſuffer him to vnderſtand, if he heare, God
will not ſuffer him to remember, if hee pray,
God ſeemeth vnto him like Baal, which
could not heare: at laſt hee beholdeth his
wretchednes, as Adam looked vpon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
and mourneth for his gifts as Rachel
wept for her children, <hi>becauſe they were not.</hi>
All this commeth to paſſe, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might bee fulfilled, <hi>Whoſoeuer hath not
from him ſhall be taken that which he ſeemeth
to haue.</hi> As the ſhip ſinketh vpon the Sea,
while the merchant ſporteth vpon the Land
and makes him a banquerout when he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that his goods are comming in: ſo while
wee are ſecure, and the heart ſpendeth, and
the eare bringeth not in, by little and little
the ſtocke decaieth, and moe become ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querouts
in Religion, than in all trades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.
When a man ſinneth, he thinketh with
himſelfe I will doe this no more, after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinne promiſeth as much profite as that,
and hee ſaith againe I will doe this no
more, preſently another ſinne promiſeth as
much profite as that, and hee ſaith againe, I
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:17992:357" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will doe this and no more. There goeth
ſtrength and there commeth a wound, ſo the
ſoule bleedeth to death and knoweth not
her ſickneſſe till ſhe be at the laſt gaſpe. Euen
as a man vndreſſeth himſelfe to bed, firſt hee
caſteth off his cloake, and then his coate, and
then his dublet: ſo when GOD rifleth our
hearts, he pulleth away one feather after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
firſt he wounds his faith, after he ſtrikes
his loue, then he blindeth his knowledge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſhall haue no delight to heare the word,
after he ſhall growe to hate the Preachers of
the word, at laſt he ſhall euen hate the word
it ſelfe. This is the bleeding of the ſoule, or
the ſpiritual conſumption, when graces drop
away, as the haires fall from an hoarie head
before death. Let Achitophel be a ſpectacle
for all to feare, he was counted a wiſe man
and a deepe Councellor, yet becauſe it was
the wiſedome of the fleſh, the ſtorie ſaith,
that GOD turned his wiſedome into follie,
and that he might ſeeme fooliſh (as he was
in deede) God made him to hang himſelfe,
whereby his follie was more notorious then
his wiſedome. But moſt notable is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of perſecuting Saul, when he began to
fall, he ran headlong. Firſt he fell in hatred of
Dauid, then he fell in hatred of GOD, after
God fell in hatred of him: Anon the ſpirit
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:17992:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>
departed from him: At laſt, hee ſought for
helpe at Witches, which he had condemned
before. This is the propertie of ſin to ſpurre
a man forward, vntill he commit that which
he condemneth himſelfe, that he may be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
of his owne conſcience. Now, if I
might applie this ſcripture as Chriſt ſayth,
are there no mo ſinners but they, vpon whom
the Tower of Shilo fell? So I may ſay, is the
Talent taken from none but from him which
hid it in the ground? Nay, Saul was but a
type of many which ſhould looſe the ſpirit,
Sampſon was but a type of manie which
ſhould loſe their ſtrength, Demas was but a
type of many which ſhoulde imbrace the
world: as Dauid cryeth, <hi>How are the mightie
ouerthrowne?</hi> So wee may mourne and ſay,
how are the zealous cooled, how are the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
tired? They which ſhould ſeaſon others
are become like the white of an egge which
hath no taſte: once they ſeemed to haue
fruite, but now they are not hanged with
leaues. As God cryed vnto Adam, <hi>Adam
where art thou?</hi> ſo they may cry Zeale where
art thou? Learning where art thou? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
where art thou? Loue where art thou?
They which ſhined like the Sun when they
roſe, ſeeme now to be eclipſed of their light.
The world hath won the fleſh, the fleſh hath
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:17992:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>
won the ſpirit, and <hi>Iordaine is turned backe.</hi> As
God tooke heat from the fire when it would
burne his Children, ſo he taketh knowledge
from the learned when they turne it to euill.
Now, when they ſee ſuch ruines of their gifts,
with what heart can they thinke, I am the
tree whom Chriſt accurſeth, or I am the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of whom it is ſayd, <hi>Take his Talent from
him?</hi> Therefore I ſay to you as Chriſt ſayd,
remember Lots wife, as her bodie was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into ſalt: ſo your wiſedome may turne
into follie, your knowledge may turne into
ignorance, your vnderſtanding may turne
into blindneſſe; your zeale may turne into
coldnes: therefore let al which haue a Talent
take heede how they vſe it. Three thinges I
note in theſe words, &amp; then end. Firſt, Chriſt
ſaith not, It ſhall be taken from them which
haue, but from them <hi>which ſeeme to haue:</hi> Leſt
they which ſtande ſhould feare to fall. Paul
ſaith not, Let him which ſtandeth, take heed
leſt he fall, but <hi>let him which thinketh he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:</hi>
ſo leſt they which haue the Spirit ſhuld
feare, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It ſhall bee taken from them
which ſeeme to haue.</hi> Marke how warilie the
Scripture ſpeaketh, for this ſpeech doth ſhew
that many ſhall fall, and yet it doth ſhew that
none ſhall fall but they which ſeem to ſtand,
that none ſhall loſe the ſpirit but they which
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:17992:359" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeeme to haue it. For if Chriſt woulde take
from them which haue, as he giueth to them
which haue, hee woulde not ſay, they <hi>which
ſeeme to haue</hi> at his taking, no more then he
ſayd it at his giuing. So we haue a comfort in
this terrour, like the Honey which Sampſon
found in the Lions iawes: for if God will take
from none but them which ſeeme to haue,
then we neede not feare vnleſſe we be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:
for the threatning is made to none
but them which ſeeme. Secondly, this ſpeech
doth ſhewe that many haue that ſhew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
which Paul ſpeaketh of, wherewith
they would deceiue God and deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
you haue Pilate waſhing his hands in
hypocriſie, as well as you haue Dauid waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his hands in innocencie: you haue the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemits
with their circumciſion, aſ well as the
Iſraelites with their circumciſion: you haue
the Sadduces with their doctrine, as well as
the Apoſtles with their doctrine: you haue
the Phariſie with his prayer, as well as the
Publican with his prayer: you haue the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoniſt-with
her confeſſion, as well as Peter
with his confeſſion:<note place="margin">Act. 19.</note> you haue the Exorciſts
with their Iesus, as well as Paul with his Ieſus:
you haue Sathan with his ſcripture,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> as well as
Chriſt with his ſcripture: you haue Iudas with
his kiſſe, as well as Ionathan with his kiſſe:
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:17992:359"/>
you haue Caine with his ſacrifice, as well as
Abel with his ſacrifice: you haue Eſau with
his teares, as well as Marie with her teares:
you haue Achitophel with his wiſedome, as

with his ſpirite: you haue Ieſabel with her
faſts, as well as Anna with her faſts: you haue
the harlot with her vowes; as well as Iacob
with his vowe. Of all theſe this ſcripture is
fulfilled, <hi>That which they ſeemed to haue was
taken from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt note, the verie ſhewe of
goodneſſe ſhall bee taken from them which
haue not goodneſſe it ſelfe: leſt men ſhould
content themſelues with ſhewes and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That which he ſeemeth to
haue ſhall be taken from him:</hi> As if he ſhould
ſay, take away his Talent and his napkin too,
that hee may not ſeeme to haue a Talent. As
Moſes ſaith, <hi>I will not leaue a hoofe behinde.</hi>
Thou ſhalt not ſeeme iuſt, nor wiſe, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt,
but I will make thee as naked to men, as
Adam was to me. Euen as the Fig-tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it had no fruit was ſpoyled of his leaues
which ſhewed like fruit: ſo they which haue
made ſhipwracke of honeſtie, ſhall make
ſhipwracke of credite too: Their name ſhall
goe with a brand vpon it like Caine the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:17992:360" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Achan the theefe, Abſolon the rebell,
Magus the ſorcerer; Iudas had for his title,
<hi>Iudas which betrayed the Lord,</hi> Acts. 1. Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam
had for his title, <hi>Ieroboam which made
Iſrael to ſinne.</hi> Demas had for his title, <hi>Demas
which imbraced the world.</hi> Marke how ſinne
doth perſecute and vexe the ſinner. Indeede
Demas had imbraced the worlde, but hee
would not haue all the worlde to knowe it:
but ſee firſt how God makes Paul to knowe
it, and after hee makes him to proclaime it,
that now Demas is not onely an hypocrite,
but knowne to be an hypocrite, like a Rogue
which is burned in the eare. When Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams
wife came to the Prophet to enquire
of her ſonne, ſhe diſguiſed her ſelfe becauſe
ſhe would not bee knowne, yet the Prophet
knewe her, for ſo ſoone as ſhe knockt at the

though men diſguiſe themſelues with ſober

yet when GOD ſeeth an hypocrite, he will

Conſidering the ſtate of

hee had another meſſage vnto them, and tels
them that though they be aboue other, yet
they ſhall die like other, and though they

and giue account of their Stewardſhip howe

God,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>There are no more Gods but
hee?</hi> Eſa. 44. 5. and 45. 21. <hi>I haue made thee
Pharao his God,</hi> ſaith God to Moſes. Exod. 7.
1. becauſe he had giuen him power to ſpeake
vnto Pharao in his name, and to execute his
iudgements vpon him: ſo hee calleth Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe hee hath giuen them
power to ſpeake to the people in his name,
and to execute his iudgements vpon them.
Out of this name, Rulers may learne howe
to gouerne, and ſubiects how to obey. As
the inferiour Magiſtrates doe nothing but
as the ſuperiour Magiſtrate preſcribeth: ſo
they which rule vnder God for God, muſt
rule by the preſcript of God, and doe nothing
but as their conſcience tels them, that God

would doe himſelfe. Therefore they which

            <p>
               <hi>I haue ſayd ye are Gods &amp;c.</hi> Firſt this name
enformes vs what kinde of Rulers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
we ſhould chooſe: thoſe which excell
all other men like Gods amongſt men. For a
king ſhould be a man after Gods owne heart
like Dauid, as appeareth in the firſt booke of
Samuel, the thirteenth Chapter &amp; fourteenth
verſe. As all thoſe whom God ſet ouer his
people in his mercy and not in his anger, had
ſome note of excellencie aboue the reſt,
which God choſe them by, as it were the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
marke: the mildeſt man, Numb. 12.
3. or the wiſeſt man, 1. Reg. 4. 31. or the iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
man, Heb. 7. 2. as though if all theſe had
met in one, the inquiſition ſhould haue ſtaied
there, and all giue place to him: but our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are ſo ſingled, that he which was called
the mildeſt is not called the wiſeſt, and hee
which was called the wiſeſt, is not called the
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:17992:362"/>
iuſteſt, as though God found ſome defect in
his owne election. For when hee choſe one
milde, another wiſe, &amp; another iuſt, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that hee would haue one which is milde,
and wiſe, and iuſt like himſelfe, that is, (as I
may ſay) a man made euen in print.</p>
            <p>As Paul biddeth to <hi>chooſe widdowes which
were widdowes indeed.</hi> 1. Tim. 5. 3. ſo we ſhould
chooſe Magiſtrates which are Magiſtrates
indeed, that is, ſuch as ſeem to be ſent of God
for that purpoſe, as Pharaoh choſe Ioſeph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was the fitteſt in all the Land.<note place="margin">2. Kin. 2. 9.</note> Gen.
41. 38. Eliſha thought that the ſingle ſpirite
was not enough, but required that the ſpirite
of Eliah might be doubled vpon him, becauſe
he was a Prophet which ſhould teach others:
ſo we ſhould picke out them which haue a
double ſpirit to be Magiſtrates, becauſe they
muſt gouerne others, as God picketh foorth
Ioſua in Moſes roome: hee might haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
many out of all Iſrael which had the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of widome:<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 9.</note> but he choſe Ioſua, of whom
he ſayth, that <hi>hee was full of the ſpirite of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi>
Deut. 24. 9. ſhewing, that if one bee
better than another, he ſhould be choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the reſt, becauſe the beſt haue ſaid, <hi>Send
another:</hi> Exod. 4. 14. as though none were fit:
but for want of Angels we are faine to make
Magiſtrates of men. Therefore as Samuel
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:17992:363"/>
went ouer all the ſonnes of Iſhai to annoint a
ſucceſſour to Saul,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 5.</note> and put back one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
which thought themſelues fit, yet there
was but one amongſt them which pleaſed
God, and the Prophet could ſcarce diſcerne
him: ſo neceſſarie it is that this choyce bee
committed to none but to the godly, becauſe
he which would haue choſen the beſt, yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
another before him. Therefore there was
ſuch a ſcrutinie amongſt the tribes to finde
out the man whom God had choſen,<note place="margin">Exo. 18. 21.</note> as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro
taught Moſes to cull out of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thoſe which had beſt courage, and feared
God, and dealt truly, and hated couetouſnes.
Therefore a wicked man may not ſupply the
place of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 2.</note> as the Scribes and Phariſies
ſate in Moſes Chaire:<note place="margin">Act. 1. 20.</note> but as it is ſaid of Iudas,
<hi>Let another take his place:</hi> ſo let better take
their place, for they which are called <hi>Gods,</hi>
muſt be like God. If all ſhould be <hi>holy as he is
holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 3.</note> how much more ſhould they be pure as
he is pure, wiſe as he is wiſe, iuſt as he is iuſt,
which beare his name, which ſupplie his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and guide the world vnto good or euill?
If the race ſhould be to the ſwift,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 11.</note> and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
to the ſtrong,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 9. 2.</note> then as Saul did exceed all
the men of Iſrael from the ſhoulders vpward,
ſo he which commaunds others, ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
other in giftes of grace, that they may
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:17992:363"/>
know him from the reſt, and ſay, this is hee,
for he exceedes the reſt in vertue, as Saul did
in ſtature, like the King of Bees, which is fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of all the hiue. Therefore if Pharao would
let none but Ioſeph gouerne Egypt, Pharao
ſhall riſe vp againſt thoſe Kings,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 28.</note> which care
not whom they place ouer their people, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
Rehoboam, which made them his
companions, whome he ſhould haue expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from his Court. 1. King. 12. 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Gen. 48. 16.</note> this extolleth the calling of
Magiſtrates. As Iacob honored Ioſephs chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when he ſaid they ſhould bee called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his name: ſo God honoureth the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
when he giues them his owne name,
calling them <hi>Gods,</hi> as though there were a
kinde of Godhead in them.<note place="margin">Pro. 24. 23.</note> Theſe things
pertayne to the wiſe, and they themſelues do
not alwayes ſee it, yet he which hath a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eye, and carries the patterne of GOD
in his hart, may ſee another like neſſe of God
in Magiſtrates, than in common perſons. As
the builders of the Temple had a ſpeciall
wiſedome and ſpirit,<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 3. &amp; 35. 31.</note> which God gaue them
for that worke which they were choſen too:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
ſo when Samuel had anoynted Dauid, hee
ſaith, <hi>that the ſpirite of the Lord came vppon
Dauid from that day forward:</hi> as though hee
had anoeher ſpirite after than he had before.
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:17992:364"/>
There is difference betweene Kings &amp; inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Magiſtrates:<note place="margin">1. Sa. 28. 26</note> for the Prince is like a great
Image of God, the Magiſtrates are like little
Images of God, appoynted to rule for God,
to make lawes for God,<note place="margin">2. Cro. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> to reward for GOD,
to puniſh for God,<note place="margin">Numb. 9. 8.</note> to ſpeak for God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 6.</note> to fight

their Battelles are called <hi>the Lordes battailes,</hi>
and their Iudgements <hi>the Lordes Iudgements,</hi>
and their Throne <hi>the Lords Throne,</hi> and the

peace, by ſome counſel, as Chriſt diſtributed
the loaues and the fiſhes by the hands of his

as he would iudge, correct as he would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,<note place="margin">2. Cro. 9. 8.</note>

                  </gap>
               </hi>
that is, to doe as he would doo, as a Scholler
writes by a Copie. This is a good ſtudie
for Magiſtrates in all their iudgementes, to
conſider what GOD would doo, becauſe
they are in ſteede of <hi>God,</hi> I rule for <hi>God,</hi> I
ſpeake for <hi>God,</hi> I iudge for <hi>God,</hi> I reward for

When the King, or Iudge, or Magiſtrate,

If this were obſerued, we ſhould ſee ſuch
a change, that diuers which take ſhould giue,

know that the lawes of God are not obeied,
that his will is not regarded, but the poore

Deut. 3. 28. Moſes encourageth Ioſhua, in
Ioſ. 1. 18. the people encourage him, in ver. 9.
God doth encourage him, ſaying that hee
will be with him: but here he is with him: for
hearing GOD call them <hi>Gods,</hi> ſhewes that
God is there, nay, that they are hee: which
ſhould ſtrike a wonderfull minde into them,
As a princely ſpirite came vpon Saul ſo ſoon
as he hee was king, ſo hearing that they are

then ſpeake or doe any thing for him, but the

fitter then with King Agrippa, who thought
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:17992:366"/>
it better to be a Chriſtian almoſt, than alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
This is the Religion of theſe times,
they feare nothing more then to be counted
too preciſe: but God doth call them more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
preciſe, for he calles them <hi>Gods,</hi> of all men
then they ſhould not forget his name. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Rulers haue many names of honour,
but this is the honourableſt name in their
Titles, that they are called <hi>Gods:</hi> other names
haue been giuen them of men for reuerence
or flatterie, but no man could giue them
this name but God himſelfe. Therefore their
name is a glaſſe wherein they may ſee their
duetie, how God doth honour them, and
how they ſhould honour him. What am I
more than he, that God ſhould ſet me in his
owne Chaire, and giue me his owne name
more than others? he hath not done ſo to all:
but if they which are called his <hi>children</hi> are
<hi>happie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth 5.</note> they which are called his <hi>diſciples</hi> are
<hi>happie,</hi> they which are called his <hi>ſeruants</hi> are
<hi>happie:</hi> how <hi>happie</hi> are they whom he calleth
<hi>Gods?</hi> It ſeemes, that if GOD could haue
called them by a higher name than his owne,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 23</note>
he would haue called them by ſome other
name, but this worde is enough to put them
in minde of all that they ſhould doo. Thinke
that <hi>yee are Gods,</hi> and it will make you aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

is liker God than you. Are they <hi>Gods</hi> which
oppreſſe Gods children? Nay, dooth not he

If ſuch deſerue not their titles, how can Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
of Rome thinke of his vſurped names,
and not be abaſhed? Can he ſit downe in

            <p>Againe, for another ſorte of <hi>Gods:</hi> Doth

But they which regarde this honourable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of God,<note place="margin">Nehe. 6. 11.</note> as Nehemiah ſayd when he
was tempted to flie, <hi>Should ſuch a man as I

ſuch a man as I doe wrong? ſhould ſuch a

<pb n="708" facs="tcp:17992:367"/>
take their example, and would harken ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than to <hi>God</hi> himſelfe? Then he reſolueth
to rule according to his name, knowing that
all the ſoules which might be wonne by him,
ſhall be required of him, as the ſinnes of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
were imputed to Ieroboam. Thus GOD
doth catechize them in their owne names,
and calles them <hi>Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 15. 30.</note> to teach them their
duetie to God. All ſhould be godly, but they
ſhould bee like <hi>Gods:</hi> that is, (as I may ſay)
more then godly, or the nexte to GOD in
godlyneſſe. If any come betweene them,
they loſe of their honour, and would thinke
themſelues put downe, like a gueſt which is
ſet lower, or a Iuſtice which is turned out of
office. For ſo GOD doth humble them and
diſgrace them, which diſhonour their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as he did Saul: when the princely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
departed from him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 7.</note> his ſonnes, and his

more than him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 4</note> that he could do nothing
with them,<note place="margin">1. Sa 18. 7.</note> becauſe God did not loue him,
hee would not let his ſeruaunts loue him.
But when Dauid came to the Crowne,<note place="margin">1. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 22. 17.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had grace with God,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 10</note> he proſpered
in all that he went about, and euer reformed
what he would: for <hi>the Lord</hi> (as hee ſaide)
<hi>ſubdued the people vnto him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 48</note> that is, made
them incline to his will: as wee reade of Saul
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:17992:367"/>
in the beginning of his raigne before hee had
rebelled,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 10. 26</note> 
               <hi>a band of men did cleaue to him,</hi> of
whom it is ſayd, <hi>whoſe hearts God hath touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
as though while the Rulers hearts doe
ſtand toward God, the peoples hearts ſhould
ſtand toward them, and they ſhould carrie
them like God to all their deſires: as it is ſaid
of Dauid,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 32. 6.</note> 
               <hi>What ſoeuer the King did, pleaſed all
the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore looking into this Diuine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
what a power they haue ouer the
people, which they ſhoulde neuer haue got
from men, if GOD had not giuen it them,
I haue thought it an eaſie matter to redreſſe
an hundred things which trouble Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
without reaſon, and none would kicke
agaynſt it, if theſe Gods would caſt downe
their Crownes, and begin to the reſt, for all
ſtay vpon them, like the alarme which ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
firſt to the battell: for our experience
ſhewes, that there will bee no great good
done, if the example of the beſt giue not light
vnto the reſt.</p>
            <p>Oh, woulde that Princely ſpirite woulde
once come vpon them to go before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Numb. 27. 17.</note>
which Moſes appoynted for the Kings
place, and not lagge after them like Herod
which ſayde,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 8.</note> he would come after the wiſe

night, no maruaile though the reſt come not

ſhould rule, and by conſequence teacheth
how we ſhould obey: God calles them <hi>Gods,</hi>
therefore he which contemneth them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth
God: God cals them <hi>fathers,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt reuerence them like <hi>Fathers:</hi>
God cals them <hi>Kings, Princes, Lords, Iudges,
Powers, Rulers, Gouernours,</hi> which are names

God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 24. 21.</note> the next is, <hi>Honour the King:</hi> that is, (as

               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> As none could

               <pb n="711" facs="tcp:17992:368" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <note place="margin">Ier. 27. 12</note>
this is their patent (as the Queene of

               <note place="margin">2. Cro. 9. 3.</note> As he

ye are no Lords, no Iudges, no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of GOD. And therefore the Pope
and his Cleargie to whom God neuer ſayd,
yee are Lords, or Iudges, or Magiſtrates, are
no Lordes, no Iudges, no Magiſtrates of
GOD, but that which the Lorde ſayth they
are, that they are, and no more, though they
put on a triple crowne. If they were worthie
to bee called as others, Paſtors, Doctors,
and Teachers, wee woulde giue them thoſe
titles. They which giue them more then the
Lord giues them, make them proud, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
and tyrannous, more then they which
are Lords; Iudges, and Magiſtrates indeede.
But for theſe vſurped titles and baſ-borne
honour which they haue encroached from
men (which puffe them vp, and trouble them
like Sauls armour) they woulde haue inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the duetie of Miniſters and Teachers,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 17. 39.</note> as
the Apoſtles did, whereas nowe they are ſo
cumbred and mingled by their vſurping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Princes, that they are neither good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,

nor good Magiſtrates, but Linſie
wolſie, a mingle mangle betweene both, nay
vtterly falne from both, being no ſhepherds
but woolues, of whoſe ſlaughters all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kingdomes haue been the ſhambles, who
ſeeking a ſuperfluous title, they haue for gone
all neceſſarie dueties: and but for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,
a man could not knowe of what
profeſſion they are, for they neuer preach
nor write, but to maintaine their kingdome
which falles (like the Tower of Babel) faſter
then they build.<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> Therefore as Naomi ſayd,
<hi>Call me no more Naomi,</hi>

ſo they may ſay, Call vs no more Biſhops,
or Paſtors, or Doctors, or Preachers, but
call vs robbers, and ſleepers, and giants, and
Phariſies, whom we ſucceed. For why ſhould
they be called Biſhops which doe not watch,
or Paſtors which doe not feede, or Doctors
which doe not teach, or Iuſtices which doe
not Iuſtice? except this bee the reaſon, The
Idols were called Gods,<note place="margin">Exo. 20. 23.</note> though they were
vnlike God. If their bodies had growen as
farre out of ſquare ſince Chriſts aſcenſion, as
their titles, pompe and honour, they might

It followeth: <hi>But yee ſhall die as a man.</hi>
Heere hee diſtinguiſheth betweene mortall
<hi>Gods</hi> and the immortall <hi>God.</hi> Yee haue ſeene
their glorie, now behold their ends, <hi>They ſhall
all die like others.</hi> Though they be neuer ſo

while their date laſteth, yet they may as

               <note place="margin">Iob. 17. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and
the worme their mother: for the graue ſhall be
the last bed of all fleſh.</hi> As they were borne
like men, ſo they <hi>ſhall die like men,</hi> the ſame
comming in and going out is to all: nay, if
ye reſpect but the bodie, hee might ſay, yee
ſhall die like beaſtes: for <hi>Man being in honor,</hi>
(ſaith Dauid) <hi>may well be compared vnto beaſts
that periſh:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note> though hee bee in honour, yet he
periſheth like the beaſts which haue no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and death will not take his kingdome
for a raunſome, when GOD dooth but ſay,
his time is come. When Eſay had ſaide,
that <hi>All fleſh was graſſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 40.</note> as though hee
would correct his ſpeech, hee addes, <hi>and
the glorie of it is as the flower of the field.</hi> As if
he ſhould ſay, Some men haue more glorie
than other, and they are like <hi>flowers,</hi> the other
are like <hi>graſſe:</hi> no great difference, the <hi>flower</hi>
ſhewes fairer, but the <hi>graſſe</hi> ſtands longer,
one ſieth cuttes both downe, like the fatte
ſheepe and the leane that feede in two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:17992:370"/>
but are killed in one ſlaughter. So
though the great Man liue in his pallace, and
the poore man dwelles in his cottage, yet
both ſhall meete at the graue, and vaniſh
together. Euen they which are Lordes and
Iudges and Counſailers now, are but ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
to them which are dead, and are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to death now than when I beganne to
preach of this theame. It had been a great
Seſſions for all other to <hi>die:</hi> but for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
for Princes, for Kinges, for Emperors
to <hi>die</hi> as they <hi>die:</hi> What a battell is this, that
leaues no man a liue? Shall the Gods <hi>die too?</hi>
Hee giues them their title, but he telles them
their lot. Though their power, though their
wealth, though their honour, though their
titles, though their train, though their friends,
though their caſe, though their pleaſures,
though their diet, though their cloathing
be not like other, yet their ende ſhall be like
other: nay, their endes are like to bee more
fearefull than other: For GOD makes him
examples of great men, as he did of Pharaoh,
and therefore wee ſee ſo many ſtrange and
ſodaine deathes of Princes,<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 16.</note> more than of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Therefore hee ſpake heere with the leaſt
when hee ſaide, <hi>Yee ſhall die like other,</hi> for
verie fewe of them eſcape the Swoorde,
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:17992:370"/>
or knife, or poyſon, which other neuer or very
ſeldome feare. But if all your ſubiectes were
your friendes, yet <hi>yee ſhall dye like them:</hi> for
are yee not colde when Winter comes, are
yee not withered when ages comes, are yee
not weake when ſickeneſſe comes, and ſhall
yee not goe (aſwell as the meaneſt) when

            <p>Therefore bee not proud of thine honour
as though it would laſt alwaies, for thou
ſhalt <hi>dye,</hi> and then all thine honour ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

as great as thou: and when his glaſſe is run,
another ſhall follow him, and ſo another, till

            <p>Bee not cruell in thine authoritie, as

aliue, will ſende infinite curſes after thee,
becauſe thy life was as a ſcourge vnto

            <p>Be not ſecure for thy wealth, as though it

laye downe his feathers when hee
thinkes vpon it, though he pricke them vp
againe: whereby the holy ghoſte woulde
haue them learne, that nothing will make
them liue, and rule and deale ſo well in their
thrones, as to remember that <hi>they ſhall die,</hi>
and ſhortlie giue account for all: ſignifying,
that proſperitie makes vs forgetfull of our
endes, and that theſe mortall <hi>Gods,</hi> liue as
though they were immortall. A hard thing
for Princes to remember death: they haue
no leaſure to thinke of it, but chop into the
earth before they beware, like a man which
walketh ouer a field couered with ſnow, and
ſees not his way, but when hee thinketh to
runne on, ſodainly falles into a pit: euen ſo
they which haue all things at will, and ſwim
in pleaſure, which as a ſnowe couereth their
waie, and dazeleth their ſight: while they
thinke to liue on, and reioyce ſtill, ſodainely
ruſh vpon death, and make ſhipwrack in the

            <p>Therefore, as it is good for them to heare
they are <hi>Gods:</hi> ſo it is meete to knowe they
<hi>ſhall die.</hi> Wherefore <hi>ye ſhall die,</hi> ſaith he, in the

which hee caſt out before, hee cooles them

<hi>Gods,</hi> there hee calles them wormes meate,

ſhall die, &amp;c.</hi> but for this <hi>die,</hi> manie would
liue a merrie life, and feaſt, and ſport, and let
the world ſlide: but the remembrance of
death is like a dampe, which puts out all the
lightes of pleaſure, and makes him rub and
frounce and whine which thinkes vpon it,
as if a moate were in his eie. O how heauie
tidings is this, to heare thou ſhalt <hi>die</hi> from
him which hath life and death in his owne
handes, when the meſſage is ſent to them
which raigne like <hi>Gods,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay,
Euen you which gliſter like Angels, whom
all the world admires, and ſues, and bowes
to, which are called honourable, mightie,
and gracious Lords, I will tell you to what
your honour ſhall come: Firſt ye ſhall wax
olde <hi>like others,</hi> then ye ſhall fall ſicke <hi>like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
then <hi>ye ſhall die like other,</hi> then ye ſhall
be buried <hi>like other,</hi> then ye ſhall bee conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>md
<hi>like other,</hi> then ye ſhall bee iudged <hi>like

one dies, the other dies, one rots, the other
rots, looke in the graue and ſhewe me which
was <hi>Diues,</hi> and which was <hi>Lazarus.</hi> This is
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:17992:372"/>
ſome comfort to the poore, that once he ſhall
be like the rich, one day he ſhall bee as weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
as mightie, and as glorious as a King,
one hower of death will make all alike: they
which crowed-ouer other, and looked downe
vpon them like Oakes, other ſhall walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them like worms, and they ſhall be gone,
as if they hadde neuer beene. Where is
Alexander that conquered all the worlde,

What woulde he thinke, that had ſeene Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon

no reſpect of perſons, made them paie the

Cedar in Libanus, to daie like a broken

Then woe to them which had the names of

they goe to priſon to trie the mercie of hell,
and take what the ſpirites of darkenes will
heape vpon them: there lie many of the men
which were called <hi>Gods,</hi> and thus endes the
pilgrimage of Kings, Princes, and Rulers.
This is our life, while we enioy it, we loſe it,
like the Sunne which flies ſwifter than an
Arrowe, and yet no man perceiues that it
moues: Hee which laſted nine hundred
yeares, could not holde out one houre lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and what hath hee now more than a
childe, which liued but a yeare?<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 27.</note> Where are
they which founded this goodlie Cittie,
which poſſeſſed theſe faire houſes, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
theſe pleaſant fieldes, which erected
theſe ſtately Temples, which kneeled in
theſe ſeates, which preached out of this
place but thirtie yeares agoe? Is not earth
turned to earth, and ſhall not our Sunne
ſet like theirs when the night comes? yet
wee cannot beleeue that death will finde
out vs, as he hath found out them: though
all men <hi>die,</hi> yet euery man dreames I ſhall
ſcape; or at the leaſt I ſhall liue till I bee
olde. This is ſtrange, men cannot thinke
that God will doe againe that which hee
dooth dailie, or that he will deale with them,
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:17992:373"/>
as he deales with other: tell one of vs that all

<hi>ſhall die,</hi> and we beleeue it ſooner of all than
of one, though we bee ſore, though wee bee
weake, though we be ſicke, though wee bee
elder than thoſe whome wee follow to the

or riches, or fauour, could haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
death, thoſe which haue liued before vs
would haue kept our poſſeſſions from vs, but
death would take no bale, wee are all Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants

whenſoeuer the Landlord will put an

at a weekes, at a daies, at an houres warning,
or leſſe: the cloathes which we weare vpon
our backes, the graues which are vnder our
feete, the Sunne which ſets ouer our heades,
and the meates which go into our mouthes,
doe crie vnto vs, that we ſhall weare, and ſet,
and <hi>die</hi> like the beaſtes, and fowles, &amp; fiſhes
which now are dead in our diſhes, and but
euen now were liuing in the Elements. Our
Fathers haue ſummoned vs, and wee muſt
ſummon our children to the graue. Euerie
thing euerie daie ſuffers ſome Eclipſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtandeth at a ſtay, but one creature
cals to another, <hi>Let vs leaue this world.</hi> While
wee play our Pageants vpon this ſtage of
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:17992:374"/>
ſhort continuance, euerie man hath a part,
ſome longer, and ſome ſhorter, and while
the Actors are at it, ſodainelie death ſteps
vpon the ſtage like a hauke which ſeparates
one of the Doues from the flight, he ſhootes
his dart, where it lights, there fals one of the
Actors dead before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and makes al the reſt

and then to the ſport againe: While they
ſing, play, and daunce, death comes againe,
&amp; ſtrikes another, there he lies, they mourne
him, and burie him as they did the former,
and play againe: ſo one after another, till
the plaiers bee vaniſhed like the accuſers
which came before Chriſt, and Death is the
laſt vpon the ſtage, ſo <hi>the figure of this worlde
paſſeth away.</hi>

But thou thinkeſt, It is not I, and hee
thinketh, It is not he: but he which thinkes
ſo, commeth ſooneſt to it. If I could make
you beleeue, that ye haue but a yeare to liue,
and that all which heare mee this day, ſhall

your ſelues to <hi>die,</hi> and leaue your ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
you, and depart Chriſtians out of the

haue you, that when the tweluemoneth is
ended, ye might liue with Angels in heauen,
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:17992:374"/>
and eſcape that fierie lake, where the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
begs but a drop of water to coole the tip
of his tongue, and it will not bee graunted
him, leaſt it ſhould eaſe him. But nowe wee
know not whether we ſhall liue a weeke to
an end, we will doe nothing that he bids vs,
but abide the venture, and trie the marker
what God wil giue for ſinne, ſo one is taken
after another,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note> and becauſe we are not ready,
we go againſt our will, like <hi>Lots</hi> wife out of

till we can neither forſake our ſin, nor hope
of mercie. Thus I haue proclaimed to all
Kings,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 20. 1.</note> Princes, Iudges, Counſellors and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
that which <hi>Eſay</hi> foretold to one, <hi>Set

him to ſet al things in order. But I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
promiſe you 15. yeeres, for many Princes do
not raigne ſo long, for one that doth. That
which <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpake to one, God here pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
of all, <hi>yee ſhall die,</hi> therefore the meſſage
is ſent to you, and when ye think of your <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
think of your <hi>end.</hi> Theſe 2. notes, <hi>that ye
are Gods,</hi> and <hi>that yee ſhall die,</hi> the holy Ghoſt
thought enough to teach you how to liue,
and how to rule. And that wee may bee all
like Gods hereafter, let vs prepare before the

that left the world, before it left them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="818" facs="tcp:17992:375"/>
Therefore let vs praie that GOD would
keepe vs in remembrance of his iudgements
that the ſubtiltie of ſinne neuer ſteale our
hearts from him, but that we may count this
life a reſpite to repent before the Iudge ſit to
deuide betweene the ſheepe and the goates,

and neuer know perfectly that we are vaine,
vntill wee repent with <hi>Salomon.</hi> Therefore

               <pb n="820" facs="tcp:17992:376" rendition="simple:additions"/>

as though men did not knowe their

<hi>He beleeueth not that he is vaine,</hi> which makes
euerie man deferre his repentance, vntill the
verie houre come that ſinne maketh prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to leaue him, and then fainting hee is
vnwilling to depart, becauſe he is not readie.
Therfore I haue choſen this ſentence; which
ſpeakes of nothing but <hi>vanitie,</hi> to ſhew how
wee take the waie to miſerie for the waie to
happines, and turne the <hi>day of ſaluation</hi> to
the <hi>day of vanitie.</hi> Let euerie man thinke as
I goe in this matter, why he ſhould loue that
which <hi>Salomon</hi> repented, if he think <hi>Salomon</hi>
happier after he repented, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was before.
This verſe is the ſumme or contentes of all
this booke, and therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> beginnes
with it, and ends with it, as if he ſhould ſaie,
Firſt this is the matter which I will prooue,
and after, this is the matter which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
now you ſee whether I tolde you true,
that <hi>All is vanitie.</hi> I may call it <hi>Salomons

               </gap>dle of vanities, which when
he hath bound in a bundle, he bids vs caſte it
into the fire: for after hee hath done with
them in his laſt chapter and thirteenth verſe
as though hee would haue no more thought
of them, he turnes away from them, as if hee
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:17992:376" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had buried them &amp; goes to another matter,
ſaying, <hi>Now let vs heare the end of all, Feare
God and keeep his commaundements: for this is
the whole dutie of man:</hi> as though hee were
exceeding glad that after ſo many daungers
through the rout of vanitie, yet GOD let
him ſee the hauen of reſt, and brought him
to the right end, and ſet him vpon ſhoare,
where hee might ſee his vanities,<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 30.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi>
looked back vpon his enemies, &amp; ſaw them
drowned behind him.</p>
            <p>The whole narration doth ſhew that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
wrote this book after his fall. When
he had the experience of vanities, and ſeene
the folly of the world, what euill comes of
pleaſure, and what fruite groweth of ſinne,
he was bold to ſay, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, &amp;c.</hi>
which he auoucheth with ſuch proteſtation,
as though he would iuſtifie it againſt many
aduerſaries: For all the world is in loue with
that which he calles <hi>vanitie.</hi> Therefore hee
puts to his name in the middeſt of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as if hee would defend it againſt all
commers: if any man ask, who broched this
ſtrange doctrine? <hi>the Preacher</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>)
To teſtifie his heartie conuerſion to God, he
cals himſelfe a <hi>Preacher,</hi> in the witnes of his
vnfained repentance, as if God had ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him <hi>Thou being conuerted, conuert thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
and be a <hi>Preacher,</hi> as thou art a <hi>King:</hi>
               <pb n="822" facs="tcp:17992:377" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo when we are conuerted, wee ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Preachers vnto other, and ſhew ſome
fruits of our calling, as <hi>Salomon</hi> left this book
for a monument to all ages of his conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Therefore they which write, that <hi>Salomon</hi>
dyed in his ſinne, and that ſuch a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of God went to the damned, doe
great wrong to the worthie King which
giues them ſuch an example to repent, and
would correct their raſh iudgement, if they
conſidered. Firſt, that he was the cleereſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Chriſt (except <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>) which
paſſed all Kings in proſperitie, and all men
in wiſedome. Secondly that hee was inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Holie Ghoſt like the prophets,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 7.</note> to
bee one of the pennes of God to write his
holy word, the word of ſaluation, which was
not fit for a reprobate. Thirdlie, that GOD
promiſed to his father, that hee would not
take his ſpirit and his mercie from him as he
did fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Saule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 17. 13</note> nor forſake him as he did <hi>Saule</hi>
but correct him in another ſort. Fourthlie,
that GOD is ſaid to loue him,<note place="margin">2. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7. 13.</note> therefore as
<hi>Paule</hi> concludes that <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,<note place="margin">Nehe. 13. 6</note>
God ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Iacob haue I loued:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> So we
may conclude, that <hi>Salomon</hi> was elected,
becauſe God ſaith; <hi>Salomon</hi> haue I loued.
Fiftly, that in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. Al the Prophets
of God are ſaid to be in heauen: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Salomon</hi> being an holie Prophet muſt
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:17992:377" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beholden to be in heauen. To ſhew that he
was a holy prophet, in 2. <hi>Pet. 3, 2. Peter</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all the Prophets which wrote the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Holie Prophets.</hi> Laſtly we may gather
out of the ſeauenth Chapter of this booke
and the thirtieth verſe, and out of the 5. of
the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> and the fourteenth verſe that
<hi>Salomon</hi> had left his concubines and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
before he wrote this booke.<note place="margin">1 King. 11. 45</note> Therefore
to ſay that the figure of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 31</note> the penne of
the holie Scripture, the man whom God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
the wiſeſt man that euer was, and one
of the holie prophets died a reprobate, is
preſumption againſt the Word, impietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God,<note place="margin">1. King. 11. 4. 5</note> and wrong to the dead. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
becauſe of his grieuous fal in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 12.</note>
and vncleanneſſe, GOD left him in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and makes no mention of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
where hee ſpeakes of his death, that
<hi>they which ſtand, may take heed leſt they fall,</hi>
and ſee how eaſie it is to ſlip, by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple
of him which was wiſer than they. <hi>Salomon</hi>
being wicked and yet ſaued, was a figure of
the Church whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen. Thus
hauing found as it were the Mine: now let
vs digge for the treaſure. <hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi>
&amp;c. This is <hi>Salomons</hi> concluſion, when hee
had gone through the whole world &amp; tried
all thinges like a ſpye ſent into a ſtraunge
country, as if he were now come home from
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:17992:378"/>
his pilgrimage, they gather about him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what he hath heard and ſeene abroad,
and what he thinks of the world, and theſe
things which are ſo loued among men, like a
man in admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which he had ſeen
and not able to expreſſe particularly one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, hee contracts his newes into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word:
you aſke me what I haue ſeene, and
what I haue heard: <hi>Vanitie</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon:</hi> &amp;
what els? <hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> and what els?
<hi>All is vanitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 11</note> This is the hiſtory of my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
I haue ſeen nothing but <hi>vanitie</hi> ouer the
world. Carrie this for the newes from the
Preacher: <hi>vanitie of vanities, Al is vanitie,</hi>
as if hee ſhould ſay <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and greater <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
and more than <hi>Vanitie:</hi> ſo the further
hee did goe, the more <hi>Vanitie</hi> hee did ſee,
and the nearer he looked, the greater it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
till at the laſt he could ſee nothing but
<hi>vanitie.</hi>

            <p>When he was come to this, that he did ſee
all things vaine, vpon which men ſet their
heartes, he was moued with compaſſion and
could be ſilent no longer, but needes hee
muſt write to them which ſeeke felicitie (as
he did in tranſitorie things, to warne them
that they ſeek it not any longer in theſe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
things, which haue no ſtability nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
but flie from them to <hi>The feare
of God,</hi> which hath the promiſes of this life
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:17992:378"/>
and the life to come.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 8.</note> Therefore he beginnes
with <hi>All is vanitie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 15.</note> as if he ſhould ſay: <hi>Loue
not the world nor the things of the world, For</hi>
I haue tryed that there is no certaintie in
them.</p>
            <p>Thus hee withdraweth them, Firſt, from
the wrong way,<note place="margin">Eccl 12. 13</note> and then ſets them in the
right way to happines, which he defineth at
laſt, to <hi>Feare God and keepe his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
When he had gone through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>vanities,</hi> then that comes in at the ende,
euen like our repentance which ſtaies till
death: So his drift is to ſhew that mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
is not in theſe things which we count
of, but in thoſe which we deferre: his reaſon
is, they are all <hi>vanitie:</hi> his proofe is, becauſe
there is no ſtabilitie in them, nor contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of minde: his concluſion is, therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the world, and looke vp to Heauen
from whence ye came, and whither yee ſhall
goe.</p>
            <p>This is the ſcope which <hi>Salomon</hi> aymes
at, as though wee did all ſeeke happineſſe:
but we goe a wrong waie vnto it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſounds a retyre, ſhewing that if wee
holde on our courſe, and goe forwards as we
haue begun, wee ſhall not finde happineſſe,
but great miſerie, becauſe we goe by <hi>vanitie.</hi>
Therefore to fright vs out of this way, hee
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:17992:379"/>
breakes forth into an exclamation, <hi>Vanitie of
vanities, All is vanitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Salomon</hi> full of wiſedome, and ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with experience, is licenſed to giue his
ſentence of the whole world.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 15</note> For <hi>the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
man iudgeth all things,</hi> his iudgement is ſo
certaine, that it runnes before the Euidence,
and condemnes al for <hi>Vanitie,</hi> before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
them to be vaine, whereas wee prooue
firſt and condemne after, becauſe our words
are no authorities: hee concludes firſt and
prooues after: neuer any iudge did condemne
ſo manie together. <hi>Salomon</hi> reſolued all the
queſtions of the Queene <hi>Shebah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 9. 2.</note> yet <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
neuer aunſwered ſo many queſtions at
once as now: for what can you enquire, but
heere you haue an anſwere? Aske him as the
Souldiers, and harlots, and Publicans asked
<hi>Iohn,</hi> What is <hi>ſinne? Vanitie</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi>
What is <hi>Pleaſure?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Vanitie</hi> too. What is <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
Vanitie</hi> too. What is <hi>Riches? Vanitie</hi>
too. What is <hi>Honour? Vanitie</hi> too. What is
<hi>Long life? Vanitie</hi> too. This is the ſtate of all
things after the fall, all turne to <hi>Vanitie.</hi>
This is no reproch to the things, but ſhame
to him which ſo abuſed them, that all things
ſhould be called <hi>Vanitie</hi> for him. What a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
is this of him which ſhould bee the
onely ſeruant of God on earth, whome hee
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:17992:379" rendition="simple:additions"/>
created in holines and righteouſnes whom
he framed to his owne Image, whom he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in Paradiſe, and woulde haue raiſed to
heauen to heare that he hath ſo polluted his
life with euerie ſinne, that now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Vanitie?</hi> That is a lamentable ſong
which will make him weepe that tunes it, if
hee thinke what he ſaith, how his ſtate is
chaunged ſince <hi>Adam</hi> his father died. Once
God ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> that <hi>all was good,</hi> and now he ſaith
that all is nought and vaine, as though he
forbad man, that which he created for man.
That is not <hi>Salomons</hi> meaning to debarre
men from the vſe of creatures:<note place="margin">Rom 8. 20.</note> although all
things changed with man, &amp; became worſe
than they were: yet hee dooth heere rather
ſhewe, that man reapes nothing but <hi>Vanitie</hi>
out of theſe things, by reaſon of his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than that the things themſelues are
vaine, if they were well vſed. For euen ſince
the creation, <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith 1. <hi>Tim. 4. That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
creature of God is good, and nothing is to be
reiected, if it be receiued, or vſed with thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,
for it is ſanctified by the worde of God
and praier.</hi> That is it, which maketh them
profitable to vs, which becauſe it is wanting
for the moſt part, therfore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith that
all are vaine to vs, not vaine of themſelues,
but becauſe they are not ſanctified as they
ſhould be, therefore in the 2. 24. the 3. 12.
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:17992:380"/>
and 22. the 5. 17. the 8. and 15. he ſhewes a
way how we may make profit of all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in our labours and finde a lawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in earthly things, ſo often he cals to the
vſe leſt wee ſhould erre as the Monkes and
Eremits haue done before, miſtaking theſe
wordes, when he ſaith that <hi>All is vanity,</hi> they
haue forſaken all companie, &amp; gouernement
and office and trade, and got themſelues into
the wildernes amongſt beaſts, to liue in quiet
and ſilence, ſaying, that men could not liue in
the world, and pleaſe God, becauſe <hi>All is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:</hi>
ſo while they counted all things vaine,
they became vain themſelues, and left thoſe
bleſſings which <hi>Salomon</hi> inioyed after his
knowledge, more than he did before. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is vaine man which <hi>Salomon</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
which is not onelie called <hi>Vanitie,</hi> but
<hi>lighter tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vanitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 62. 9.</note> If he did not things vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nothing ſhould bee vaine in the worlde,
whereas now by abuſe we may ſe ſometime
as great <hi>vanitie</hi> in the beſt things, as in the
worſt: For are not many vaine in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
vaine in their pollicies, vaine in their
learning, as other are vaine in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
Was not the wiſedom of <hi>Achitopel</hi> a
vaine thing? The ſwiftnes of <hi>Hazael</hi> a vaine
thing? The ſtrength of <hi>Goliah</hi> a vaine thing?
The treaſures of <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> a vaine
thing? The honour of <hi>Ammon</hi> a vaine thing?
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:17992:380" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The beautie of <hi>Abſolon</hi> a vaine thing? The
knowledge of the <hi>Scribes</hi> a vaine thing? The
deuotion of the <hi>Phariſies</hi> a vaine thing. And
ſo is the learning of all thoſe a vaine thing,
that do no good with it, but either it lies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a buſhell and mouldes, or elſe it prattles
like <hi>Tertullus</hi> alwaies againſt <hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24. 5.</note> ſtriuing
to make warre betweene them which loue
dearer than any brethren.</p>
            <p>By this you may ſee that <hi>vanitie</hi> is bolde
when ſhe breaks into houſes and Churches
and Pallaces, and ſometime <hi>vanitie</hi> may
come to infect, where <hi>Trueth</hi> may not come
to reprooue: Is it not high time then to
ſounde this Alarum againe, <hi>Vanitie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we could heare how vehementlie, and
how pittifullie <hi>Salomon</hi> pronounced this
outcrie, happilie it would moue vs a little to
heare how hee did exclame of his owne life
and condemned himſelfe, as it were by the
ſounde of a Trumpet that all might heare:
For we are all by nature ſuch deafe Adders,
that whether the Prophets come piping, or
mourning, or crying, they goe away from vs
againe mourning like <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>we would haue
cured Babel, but ſhe would not be cured.</hi> Nay
<hi>the Citie of Ieruſalem would not</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Chriſt) when hee wept for his Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="830" facs="tcp:17992:381" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes thrice, like a
Cryer, <hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> as the mother
which would faine make her ſonne to heare,
ſhe doubles and trebles her wordes: <hi>What
my ſonne</hi> and <hi>what the ſonne of my wombe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 31. 1</note> and
<hi>what the ſonne of my deſires?</hi> So when GOD
would ſtirre vs vp to heare, he crieth thrice
to the earth and ſaith, <hi>Earth, earth, earth,
heare the word of the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 22. 39.</note> ſo when <hi>Salomon</hi>
would diſſwade from the companie of the
wicked: reade <hi>Prouerbs 4. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4: how often he
repeates the charge: <hi>Enter not into the waie
of the wicked, walke not in it, auoid it, goe not by
it, turne from it, and paſſe by,</hi> as though hee
would neuer haue done, or as though wee
woulde neuer heare. So Chriſt when hee
taught <hi>Peter</hi> what was his duetie, rehearſed
it thrice:<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Feede: Feede: Feede. Ioſeph</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the reaſon of theſe repetitions, when hee
telles <hi>Pharaoh</hi> why his dreame was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note>
becauſe the matter was important and
certaine. Therefore when <hi>Salomon</hi> repeates
this ſaying ſo often, he calles for audience,
as though hee had ſome waightie and great
matter to vtter. Such a point of wiſedome
it is for euerie man to knowe that <hi>All is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
if we direct not things to their right
end, as when the Holy Ghoſt would ſignifie
that God is all holie, he repeated thrice, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 6.</note>
               <hi>holie, holie:</hi> So when hee ſhoulde ſhewe
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:17992:381"/>
that man is al vaine thrice he repeateth <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
to ſhew how hardlie man beleeues that
he is <hi>vaine:</hi> therefore he brings in three aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions,<note place="margin">Iob. 15. 31.</note>
as it were three witneſſes to prooue
it. All agree vppon the ſame words, but that
the laſt is more plaine, and ſaieth that <hi>All is
vanitie:</hi> that is, that man is not onely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and become vaine: but for the vanitie,
of man,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20</note> as the Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>The creatures
are ſubiect to vanitie, and haue not the glory and
libertie which they ſhould haue, for the ſinne of
man.</hi> A ſpirituall eie doth ſee ſome vanitie
or other in euery thing, as appeareth betwixt
Chriſt and his Diſciples at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> They
gazed vpon the building of the Temple as a
braue thing,<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 5.</note> and would haue Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it with them: but he did ſee that it was
but <hi>vanitie,</hi> and therfore ſaide: <hi>Are theſe
the things that yee looke vpon?</hi> as if he ſhould
ſay: How vaine are you to gaze vppon this?
If Chriſt thought the beauty of his Temple
a vaine thing, &amp; not worth the ſight, which
yet was beautified and built by his owne
preſcription: how ſhould <hi>Salomon</hi> expreſſe
all the <hi>vanitie</hi> of the world,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 1</note> to which all men
haue added more and more ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?<note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 5.</note>
Therefore as if he wanted wordes to
expreſſe it, as hee did ſee it, hee breakes
foorth into an exclamation, and repeates the
ſame often, <hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> as if hee
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:17992:382"/>
ſhould ſay I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſpeak how vain the world
is, but vaine it is, and very vaine, and nought
but vaine, ſpeaking as if hee had the feeling
and ſenſe of it, as though the worlde ſtoode
naked before him, and it grieued him to ſee,
he cuts his words in chiding maner, &amp; makes
ſhort riddance, as if it irked him to ſpeake all
that he knewe, therefore that which hee
ſpeakes he ſpeakes roundly, that if they read
no more, but ſleepe all the Sermon after:
yet the firſt ſentence ſhall ſtrike a ſting into
their heartes, and leaue a ſounde behinde to
waken them when they are gone, as manie
(you know) remember this ſentence, which
remember no ſentence in all his booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.
Who hath not heard <hi>Vanitie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
&amp;c.</hi> Though fewe haue conceiued it?
This is the phraſe of Scripture, when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt would commende the ſong of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
aboue all other ſongs, hee calles it <hi>the
ſong of ſonges,</hi> ſo called in the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and
mentioned 1. <hi>King.</hi> 4. 32. When he woulde
exalt the heauenly king aboue all, hee calles
him <hi>the King of kings,</hi> ſo when he woulde
note a greate <hi>vanitie,</hi> and yet a greater, and
a greater than that, which is the greateſt of
all, he calles it <hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi> as when we
would note a great foole, we will ſay a foole
of fooles, a ſin of ſins, a ſeruant of ſeruantes,
Theſe are ſcornefull names to the worlde,
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:17992:382" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and homelie titles, to giue our pleaſures, to
call them <hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi> and againe
<hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi> and yet againe <hi>Vanitie,</hi>
as though wee woulde prouoke them to fall
out with vs, like a man which ſharpens his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
with taunts, when he woulde egge
him to fight. Hee might haue mollified his
tearmes, before hee condemned the worlde
thriſe, but the worlde is no changling that
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſhoulde change his iudgement, but
vaine it was, vaine it is, and vaine it will bee,
and therefore a thriſe vaine worlde hee may
call it: Firſt, <hi>Vanity,</hi> ſtraight <hi>Vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and ſodainelie <hi>All is vanitie</hi> What a
tranſcendent is this? as though it increaſed
while he ſpake, ſo faſt groweth this weede
to worſe and worſe, like the Image which
appeared to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> the firſt part
was of Golde, the ſecond of Siluer, the
third of Braſſe, the fourth of Iron, the fifth of
clay, ſo by many changes the world growes
worſe and worſe, and all they which folow
it. When a man begins to like of pleaſure, &amp;
opens the doore to one <hi>vanitie</hi> which hee
loues, ſtraight as many vanities floch to him,
as <hi>Salomon</hi> had Concubines, till the <hi>Temple
of God</hi> be like <hi>a den of theeues.</hi> Therefore
when <hi>Salomon</hi> beheld ſuch apluralitie, and
Totquot of Vanities,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foldes, he ſpake as though he would ſhewe
vs <hi>Vanity</hi> hatching vanities, <hi>Vanity of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all is Vanity.</hi> The firſt ſaying dooth
paſſe without let, but the laſt rubs and ſinks
not into the heartes of men ſo eaſilie as it is
ſpoken. Me thinkes I heare ſome diſpute for
<hi>Baal,</hi> and bid <hi>Salomon</hi> ſtay before he come to
<hi>All is Vanity.</hi> It may bee that ſinne is <hi>vanity,</hi>
and pleaſure is <hi>vanitie:</hi> but ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all for ſinne and pleaſure? What ſay
you to Beautie which is natures dowrie, and
cheareth the eie, as ſweete meate doeth the
taſte? Beautie is like a faire picture, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
the colour and there is nothing left.
Beautie in deede is but a colour and a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the colour fadeth, and the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſnareth. But what ſaie you to Riches
which make men Lordes ouer the reſt, and
allow them to goe braue, and lie ſoft, &amp; fare
daintilie, and haue what they liſt? Riches
are like painted grapes, which looke as
though they would ſatisfie a man, but doo
not ſlake his hunger, nor quench his thirſt,
Riches in deede to make a man couet more,
and get enuie, and keepe the minde in care.
But what ſay you to Honour, which ſets a
man a loft, and makes the knee bowe, &amp; the
tongue ſooth and the heade ſtand bare, as
though they were other kinde of creatures
aboue them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="835" facs="tcp:17992:383" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Honour is like a King in a play: when his
part is done, his ornamentes are taken from
him, and hee which helde the baſon to him
is as good as hee. Honour in deed may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
all but life: hee makes a faire ſhewe
now: but when death comes, all is one.</p>
            <p>But what ſay you to profound Knowledge
in deepe myſteries, which makes men ſought
vnto,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.</note> and called deepe Clarkes, and great
Doctours? Knowledge is like the Letters
which <hi>Vriah</hi> carried againſt himſelfe: ſo
Knowledge draweth a greater iudgement,
and oftentimes condemnes the bearer.
Knowledge without Vertue, leaues a man
without excuſe, and is a witnes againſt him,
becauſe hee vnderſtandes what is good, and
will not doe it. Yet there is another darling
of account behinde:<note place="margin">Pſal. 128.</note> what ſay you to Long
life, which cauſeth a man to ſee his <hi>childrens
children,</hi> and makes him reuerent before the
people? Long life is like a long night, when
a man cannot ſleepe: ſo age is weariſome
with ſicknes, and ſtriues with it ſelfe becauſe
it cannot walke, nor talke, nor heare, nor ſee,
nor taſte, nor ſleepe, as it was wont: therfore
wiſheth often the night were gone, that the
paine were paſt. Indeede hee that ſees many
daies, ſees many miſeries: and therefore what
is not vayne in life, ſith life it ſelfe is vayne?
Shewe mee the light which will not darken,

not paſſe, and I will reclaime that <hi>All is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie?</hi>
but if all things vaniſh, then all things
are vaine, yet this will not goe for truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men haue ſmarted for the triall. Some
are ſo vaine that they count nothing <hi>vanitie.</hi>
but that which is vainer than the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes
them moſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 12.</note> for there is as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
weale of vaine perſons,<note place="margin">Pro. 14. 9.</note> and hee

<hi>all is vanitie</hi> but that which they loue, and
therefore they call them vaine,<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 4.</note> and curious,
and phantaſticall, which ſpeake againſt their
vanities, and ſay that it is neceſſarie to bee
vaine, for they cannot liue vnleſſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
they cannot pleaſe vnles they flatter,
they cannot bee beleeued vnles they ſweare
they cannot be eſteemed vnles they roiſt, as
<hi>Demetrius</hi> thought that hee ſhould beg vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he might ſell Images.<note place="margin">Act. 19. 24.</note> There is another
ſort like the buier in <hi>Pro.</hi> 20. which ſayth. <hi>It

hee boaſteth.</hi> So they will ſay of the
worlde, <hi>It is naught, It is naught,</hi> before men
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:17992:384"/>
and ſweare that <hi>all is vanitie,</hi> but when they
are gone apart, they reconcile themſelues
vnto it and kiſſe it, and promiſe to be vaine
ſtill, but they cannot abide to be counted
vaine, the vaineſt man that is. This ſhewes
that the follie of the worlde is ſo open and
ſhamefull, that her loues muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
her. You ſhall heare them ſay often
times: It is a vaine world, a wicked world,
a naughty world, yet they will not forſake
it to die, like daſtard ſouldiers, who raile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemie, but dare not fight againſt
him. <hi>Al is vanitie,</hi> but this is <hi>vanitie of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi>
that men wil follow that which they
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne. But this is that euery ſinner might
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne himſelfe: for the conſcience muſt

            <p>Oh that here were a full ende or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Vanities,</hi> but beholde, a greater
<hi>Vanitie</hi> is behind:<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 27</note> for our Religion is <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
like the Scribes and Phariſies, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
ſaieth in the 23. Chapter, and 27. verſe
hauing a bare <hi>ſhew of holines,</hi> as hee ſaieth,
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:17992:385" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he could call it but <hi>a ſhew of holines,</hi> &amp; ſcarce
that: our <hi>vanitie is vanitie,</hi> but our <hi>holines is</hi>
but <hi>a ſhew of holines</hi> not worthie to be called
<hi>holines</hi> but like <hi>holines:</hi> yet the moſt part
haue not ſo much as the <hi>ſhew of holines,</hi> as
the Phariſies had, but are vaine in ſhew, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
and outſide too. Thus wee finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet but <hi>vanitie.</hi> I cannot leade you
from one vnto another, to ſhew you the
ſeuerall vanities of euerie perſon, or euery
thing, becauſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>All is vanitie.</hi>
How many ſins then haue we to condemne
vs, whoſe vanities are ſprinkeled in euerie
thing? Which haue not onelie ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
as there be things, but many vanities
in euery thing. As in our fare, how many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
be there, which makes vs riſe ſomtime
ſicke, ſometime ſleepy, ſometime drunke?
Yet are there more <hi>vanities:</hi> in our ſportes,
our laughing, and ſwearing and ieſting, and
ſcoffing, and dallying, and playing with the
Scriptures, which oftentimes leaues ſuch a
ſting behinde, that we had rather haue loſt
our ſport, than feele the worme that gnaws
vs for it. And yet there bee more vanities in
our apparrel, ruffe vpon ruffe, lace vpon lace
cut vpon cut, 24. orders to the 3. and 4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as though our apparrell were apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
vntil the woman be not worth ſo much
as her artire, that if we would ſee <hi>vanitie</hi> her
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:17992:385"/>
ſelfe how ſhe would goe if ſhe did weare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel,
ſhe would euen goe like our women:
for ſhe could not goe, nor ſpeake, nor looke
vainer. Who dooth not know that theſe are
vanities, and that they might leaue them, if
they would? But that ye might ſee there is a
heart within vainer than the apparel is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Therefore when theſe <hi>vanities</hi> re worn
out, they wil haue new, and ſtill new, til all
be ſpent vpon <hi>vanitie,</hi> and then they begin
like the prodigall childe to ſee how vaine
they were,<note place="margin">Luke. 15. 12</note> when they haue bought Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with ſorrow. What would <hi>Salomon</hi>
ſay, if he ſhould ſee how <hi>vanitie</hi> is growen
ſince his time, what a hight ſhe is mounted,
what a traine followes her, that there is no
prince in the world hath ſo many attendants
as <hi>vanitie?</hi> She was but an Impe then, but
now ſhe is a mother, and who can number
her ſonnes and daughters: the child is vaine
in playing the mother vaine in dandling, the
father vaine in giuing, the Courtier vaine in
ſpending, the ſouldier vaine in boaſting, the
ſuter vaine in ſtriuing, the trauailer vaine in
talking, the merchant vaine in ſwearing, the
gentleman vaine in building, the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
vaine in carking, the olde man vaine in
coueting, the Seruingman vaine in ſoothing,
the young man vaine in ſporting, the Papiſt
vaine in ſuperſtition, the proteſtant vaine in
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:17992:386"/>
conuerſation. Euery vanitie is ſo pleaſant to
one or other, that they cannot miſſe one. So
ſhe gads by Sea &amp; by land, and ſtill mo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
flock vnto her of gamſters &amp; ſwearers
and players, and tiplers, and hakſters, and
Courtiers, as thicke as the flies of <hi>Aegipt,</hi>
which buzzed in their eares, and their eies,
and their necks before,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 30.</note> and behind, that a
man cannot ſet his foot but vpon <hi>Vanitie.</hi>
As the waters couered the earth, when but
eight perſons were ſaued:<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 27.</note> ſo <hi>vanitie</hi> hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
it again, a worſe deluge than the firſt,
becauſe it hath not ſuffered eight perſons to
eſcape, but euery man is tainted with ſome
<hi>vanitie</hi> or other, which God ſeeing in that
place and Citie which ſhould be beſt in the
world,<note place="margin">Eſa. 24. 10.</note> (that all men in the citie were vaine)
cals it <hi>the Citie of vanitie:</hi> So wee may ſay
the world of <hi>vanitie,</hi> becauſe ſhe hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in euery perſon of it, ſhee ſits vpon the
earth like a Serpent, and hatcheth all the
ſinnes which you ſee amongſt men. As ful as
Heauen is of bliſſe, ſo the world is fraught
with <hi>vanitie,</hi> Court, Citie &amp; countrey, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth not <hi>vanitie</hi> goe, but to Heauen?
Seeing then that <hi>vanitie</hi> is ſo extolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
men,<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 40</note> 
               <hi>Salomon</hi> giues his ſentence,
that <hi>all is vanitie.</hi> Chriſt like a Mediatour
concludes vpon it that <hi>there is but one thing
neceſſarie:</hi> therefore let our ſentence be like
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:17992:386"/>
theirs: For ſure, if wee had <hi>Salomons</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
we ſhould ſee ſuch an image of <hi>vanity</hi>
before vs, as would make vs crie againe and
againe as often as <hi>Salomon: Vanitie of vanities,
vanitie of vanities, and all is vanitie.</hi> What a
ſweet ſentence is this from a King, who may
liue as they liſt by authority, to ſay, that <hi>all is
vanitie?</hi> Oh, that we might heare Kinges
ſpeake ſo againe: for it is a ſpeech which had
neede of ſome to countenance it, for none
are counted vaine now but they that ſpeake
againſt <hi>vanitie.</hi> Then <hi>Salomon</hi> cryed it, but
now we muſt whiſper it. You may ſee how
times are changed: Once this was ſounde
diuinitie, now it is flat railing: to ſay that <hi>all
is vanitie,</hi> is euen the vpſhot of a diſturber. If
ye aske the Athieſt or Epicure, or theſe ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
plaiers, what is a diſturber? you ſhall ſee
that they will make <hi>Salomon</hi> one, becauſe he
ſpeaketh againſt <hi>vanitie:</hi> for this is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
hee which will not allowe men to
prophane the Saboth but ſaith, that Cardes
&amp; dice, &amp; ſtage plaies, &amp; Mai-games &amp; May
poales, &amp; May fooles, and Morris-dauncers
are <hi>vanitie,</hi> is a pratler, a diſturber, and an

               </note> by the lawe which the Iewes
had to kil Chriſt. The reaſon is,<note place="margin">Pro. 13. 1.</note> becauſe men
cannot abide to be controlled of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
Therefore they hold it is an offence, to
ſpeake againſt their ſports, or their cuſtoms,
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:17992:387"/>
or their follies, or their pleaſures, or their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
or their toyes: and they which woulde
not be counted preciſe in theſe times, muſt
take heede that they goe not ſo farre as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
to tearme all <hi>Vanitie.</hi> But they muſt
ſay, that the vanities of great men are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
recreations, &amp; the vanities of the people
are meanes to make vnitie. Greater bookes
are written to maintaine this than <hi>Salomon</hi>
made to refute it, ſo they haue made their wit
and their learning <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and are vaine in
Printe. But they that would knowe nowe of
what ſtanding ſuch preciſe reproouers are,
and how ancient this reproofe is, may ſee
heere, that if this bee a crime to call <hi>Vanitie,
Vanitie:</hi> the wiſeſt man that euer was before
Chriſt was herein criminate, not when hee
ſtrayed, but when hee repented, in his beſt
minde (when he became like a Preacher) he
preached this firſt, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:</hi>
yet many had rather trie it with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
then beleeue it of <hi>Salomon:</hi> and while
they are wondring with him, ſome are taken
out of their way, and cut ſhorte of the time
which they ſet to repent: from others God
taketh away his grace,<note place="margin">2. King. 17. 13</note> ſo they neuer returne
becauſe their guide is gone. This the holie
Ghoſt pointed at, when he ſaith, <hi>They follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vanitie, &amp; became vaine,</hi> ſhewing that the
things wee followe, will make vs like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:17992:387"/>
and lead vs whether they belong, to
heauen or hell. In <hi>Rom. 8. 20. vanitie</hi> is put
for <hi>deſtruction,</hi> but it is neuer put for <hi>ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
If other creatures are ſubiect to a kinde
of deſtruction for the ſinne of man, as <hi>Paul</hi>
ſheweth, what deſtruction ſhall light vpon
man for his owne ſinne? Therefore let our
ſentence runne with <hi>Salomon, Vanitie of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
all is vanitie.</hi> Wee coulde affoord the
worlde better wordes and fairer titles, than
<hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> but call it what we will,
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſhewes what it is, and what we will
ſay in the end when we haue tried it, then
<hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> yet it is comfort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
glory of glories, and life of liues. But as
<hi>Laban</hi> ſhewed himſelfe at parting:<note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> ſo at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you ſhall ſee how it will ſerue you, They

which gaue <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel.</hi> If they be

if we be not come to <hi>Salomons</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to thinke that <hi>All is vanitie,</hi> it is becauſe
our owne <hi>vanitie</hi> will not ſuffer vs to ſee the

<pb n="844" facs="tcp:17992:388"/>
like <hi>Salomon,</hi> as faſt as euery man grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

one pleaſure after another, till at laſt we
count <hi>All is vanitie,</hi> and then we are come

vnto other. Thus I haue ſhewed vnto you as

I will leaue you to examine theſe ſayinges,
whether all things haue not beene in vaine
vnto you yet. If they haue been vaine to you
and yet are good in their owne nature, then
think how vaine you are who haue turned ſo

third, <hi>in all things giue thankes.</hi> All three are of
one laſt, for wee muſt <hi>reioice continually</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaith, <hi>reioyce euermore,</hi> and we muſt
<hi>pray continually,</hi> becauſe he ſaith <hi>pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
and wee muſt <hi>giue thankes continually</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaith, <hi>in all things giue thanks.</hi> Theſe
are the three things which one ſaith, Al men
doe, and no man doth, becauſe euerie man
doth them, and ſcarce one doth them as hee
ſhould. Therefore the Apoſtle to ſhewe vs,
how we ſhould doo them well, doth put <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually</hi>
vnto them, as though continuance
were the perfection of al vertues. I choſe this
ſcripture for a conſolation to them which are
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:17992:391"/>
afflicted in conſcience, which is commonly
the diſeaſe of the innocenteſt ſoule: for they
thinke that they doo wel to mourne <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Reioice continually:</hi> and
therefore I will ſpeake a little more of theſe
wordes than I did before. If you marke it,
it may well be called, <hi>The Ladder of Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
for it ſtands vpon three ſteps, and euery ſtep
is a ſtep from trouble to peace, from ſorrow
to ioy, for hee which can <hi>Reioyce,</hi> is paſt his
griefe: &amp; he which can <hi>pray,</hi> is paſſing from
his griefe, &amp; he which can <hi>giue thankes,</hi> hath
obtained his deſire. A man cannot <hi>reioyce</hi> &amp;
mourne, a man cannot <hi>pray</hi> and deſpaire, a
man cannot <hi>giue thankes,</hi> and bee offended,
therefore keepe ſtill vpon one of theſe three
ſteps, and you ſhall neuer ſorrow too much.
If thou canſt not reioyce as if thy paine were
paſt, then <hi>giue thankes,</hi> becauſe thy paine is
profitable: if thou canſt not thinke that thy
payne is worth <hi>thankes,</hi> then <hi>pray</hi> that thou
maiſt haue patience to beare it: and it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that in <hi>praying</hi> or <hi>thanking</hi> or <hi>reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi>
that any greefe ſhould want patience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to beare it. But when you forget to
<hi>reioyce in the Lord,</hi> then you begin to muſe,
and after to feare, and after to diſtruſt, and at
laſt to deſpayre, and then euery thought
ſeemes to be a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.
How many ſinnes doth the afflicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:17992:392"/>
recorde againſt it ſelfe, repenting for
breaking this commaundement, and that

            </p>
            <p>It is not an indifferent thing to <hi>reioyce</hi> or
not to <hi>reioice,</hi> but wee are commaunded to
<hi>reioyce,</hi> to ſhew that wee breake a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement

is this when the comforter himſelfe ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Who hath required theſe things of
you?</hi> GOD doth require no ſorrowe but the
ſorrow for ſin, no feare but the fear to ſin, no
care but the care to pleaſe him, nay hee hath
forbidden al other care: and therefore <hi>Peter</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">1. pet. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Caſt your care vppon him.</hi> As though

God did not allow vs to care, he ſent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
with this charge, <hi>Caſt your care vppon
him,</hi> As wee doo caſt our ſinnes vpon Chriſt
ſo we muſt caſt our cares vpon him: for God
hath commaunded vs to labour, but not to
care, becauſe care hindereth our labour, like
the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> which ſeemed to helpe the
<hi>Iewes</hi> to build the Temple &amp; hindered them
to build the Temple:<note place="margin">Ezra. 9. 2.</note> ſo care, and ſorrow, &amp;
thought ſeeme to helpe vs in our labours, &amp;
our ſtudies, &amp; our prayers, and our ſtrife, but

ſaid vnto Sathan. <hi>Auoide Sathan,</hi> auoide care

and we may not beare that which God

I haue ſinned, as <hi>Iudas</hi> hanged himſelf?
The Scripture ſaieth not, let him which hath
ſtolne deſpaire of mercie,<note place="margin">Iohn. 41.</note> but <hi>Let him which
hath ſtolne ſteale no more,</hi> and it is enough. As
we are taught to diſcerne of <hi>ſpirites</hi> &amp; of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10</note>
ſo we muſt diſcerne of cares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes:
for when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
not to be repented of:</hi> Hee ſheweth that
there is a repentance to be repented of, that
is, a repentance which is a ſin like the teares
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:17992:394"/>
of <hi>Eſau,</hi> which wept not for his ſins, but for
his patrimony.<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 33</note> When wee ſorrowe for any
thing but ſinne,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 34</note> as <hi>Eſau</hi> did, then our ſorrow
is murmuring: and when wee ſorrow more
for ſinne then wee ſhould as ſome doe: then
our ſorrow is diſtruſt, which hurteth vs more
than the thing which wee ſorrow for:<note place="margin">Pro. 17. 22.</note> For,
<hi>The ſorrowe of the heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) is the
conſuming of the bones:</hi> not onely the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the ſoft fleſh, but the conſuming of
the hard bones, that is, it will pull down the
ſtrongeſt man that is: and hee which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
it,<note place="margin">Ruth. 1. 10,</note> ſhall quickly ſay with <hi>Naomi: Call
me no more beautifull, but bitter.</hi> Call mee no
more ſtrong, but weak, for it wil change him
like a ſicknes: therefore as Chriſt refuſed the
vineger &amp; would not drinke it when he had
taſted it:<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 6.</note> So let no man drinke of ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he taſte it: But if anie thing eat thee vp,
let the zeale of Gods houſe eate thee vp: for
thy charge is not to get thy liuing with the
care of thy minde, but with <hi>the ſweate of thy
browes.</hi> Now (as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith) <hi>Reſiſt the deuil, &amp;
hee will flie from you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> So reſiſt ſorrowe, and it
will flie from you. This is all the care, and all
the feare, and all the repentance, which euer
I could find in the Scripture.<note place="margin">Iames. 4. 7.</note> Therefore let
vs pray God euery day to tourne all our ioye
into the ioy of the Holy Ghoſt, and all our
peace into the peace of conſcience, and all
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:17992:395"/>
our ſorrow into the ſorrow for ſinne, and all
our feare into the feare to ſinne, that ſo wee
may ſorrow &amp; <hi>reioyce</hi> together, feare &amp; hope
together: that is, haue one eie to the Law to
keepe vs from preſumption, and another eie
to the Goſpel to keepe vs from deſpaire, and
then this comfort is ſent to vs, <hi>Reioyce euer
more,</hi> or els we haue nothing to do with it.</p>
            <p>It followeth:<note place="margin">1. Kin. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Pray continually. As Eliſha</hi>
would not prophecie vntill the Muſitian
came, and while the Muſitian played <hi>Eliſha</hi>
prophecied: ſo when the heart reioyceth in
God, then it is fitteſt to call vppon God, and
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> putteth <hi>reioyce</hi> before <hi>pray,</hi>
like the Muſitian which played before <hi>Eliſha</hi>
prophecied. After <hi>Reioyce continually,</hi> hee
biddeth vs <hi>Pray continually:</hi> ſhewing that
it muſt be ſuch a <hi>reioycing continually,</hi> that we
may <hi>pray continually too,</hi> or els he doeth not
allowe vs to <hi>reioyce.</hi> How can theſe two
ioyne together, <hi>Pray and Reioyce.</hi> Some if
they ſhould <hi>praye</hi> cannot <hi>reioyce</hi> for theyr
heartes: Nay their harts are ſicke vntill their
prayers bee done, although they praye not
themſelues, but heare another praye for
them, this is the difference betweene the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing
of the wicked, and the reioycing of
the godly. The comfort of the wicked, is
like a compound medicine made of many
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:17992:395"/>
mixtures: for there muſt be piping and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and leaping, and feaſting, and dallying,
at their game, or elſe they cannot be merry.
but the comfort of the faithfull is like a
light in the aire, which ſhines when no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſeene: So the godlie reioyce when no
cauſe is ſeene: if they doo but thinke vppon
God, they reioice ſtraight. If there bee but
a praier, and a thankefulnes, and a meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there are inſtrumentes inough for them,
and they can bee as merry as birdes in May.
The reaſon of it is this,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 32.</note> as Chriſt ſaid: <hi>I haue
another meate which you knowe not of,</hi> ſo the
godlie haue another ioy which the worlde
knoweth not oft of this ioy, a man may <hi>reioice
continually.</hi> And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaieth, <hi>A
good conſcience is a continuall feaſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 15. 15.</note> that is, a
continuall ioy. But of the wickeds ioy hee
ſaith, <hi>In laughter their hearte is ſorrowfull:</hi>
that is, their laughter is ſorrowe: as if hee
ſhould ſay: the wicked neuer reioice indeed
but counterfait ioy, as they counterfait ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ioineth, <hi>Reioyce continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>
with <hi>Praie continually,</hi> as if hee ſhoulde
ſay: by this thou ſhalt knowe whether thou
<hi>reioice</hi> well, if thou canſt <hi>pray</hi> too: that is, if
thy <hi>reioicing</hi> mooue thee to <hi>praier,</hi> as the ioy
of the Angels makes them praiſe GOD and
ſing, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> vnto him. This is
according to that in the 5. of <hi>Iames.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>If anie
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:17992:396"/>
man bee merry let him ſing Pſalmes:</hi> marke
how <hi>Iames</hi> ioyneth mirth &amp; Pſalmes, as <hi>Paul</hi>
ioineth <hi>Reioicing</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> all this doth
conclude, that as we ſhould do Gods <hi>Wall in
earth as it is done in heauen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 2.</note> ſo we ſhoulde <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice</hi>
in earth as they <hi>reioyce</hi> in heauen, and
then this ioy is a ſigne of another ioy, but if
we cannot <hi>reioice</hi> in <hi>praying,</hi> how ſhall wee
<hi>reioice</hi> in ſuffering; I am now in a large field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where I might ſhewe you to whome wee

               </gap> but I will keepe my ſelfe
within my Text, which ſaieth no more but
<hi>pray continually.</hi> Firſt wee are commaunded
to <hi>pray,</hi> and then we are commanded to <hi>pray
continually,</hi> of all our dueties this is our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            </p>
            <p>Secondlie, it is ſuch a pleaſant thing, that
<hi>Paule</hi> ioineth, <hi>Pray continually;</hi> with <hi>Reioice

               <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 10</note> to ſhewe that no man hath ſuch

            <p>Thirdlie, it is ſuch a neceſſarie thing that

to ſhewe that as we ſell in our ſhops, and

Laſtly, as <hi>prayer</hi> is excellent in reſpect of

<hi>Peter</hi> prooueth in his firſt Epiſtle: and

            <p>This <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle prooueth againe in

            <p>This <hi>Paule</hi> witneſſeth againe when hee

is a ſigne that the Spirite is within, if he can
<hi>pray</hi> and therefore one ſayth: ſo long as
God doth not take away thy <hi>praying,</hi> he hath
not taken away his mercie. Seeing then that
<hi>prayer</hi> is ſuch a ſacrifice, as is offered to none
but GOD: and none can offer it but they
which haue faith,<note place="margin">Exo. 29. 4.</note> and loue, and repentance,
to bring it to him: As <hi>Aaron</hi> did not ſtande
before the Lorde before he was waſhed: ſo
let no man call vppon GOD before hee be
ſanctified. For as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did firſt taſte <hi>Iacobs</hi>

which pleaſeth him before he giue the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

charged his ſonnes when they went vnto
<hi>Ioſeph: Take the beſt fruites of the land and giue

               <note place="margin">Gen. 43. 11</note> So I aduiſe my ſelfe and you, when
we go to GOD, let vs take the beſt fruites

As <hi>Abraham</hi> left his Aſſes at the foote of

he doth not meane a <hi>lip-prayer:</hi> neither

and further, it ſeemes that the Iewes
were not appointed to <hi>praie</hi> at all times, for
they had ſet times of <hi>praier,</hi> and therefore
we reade how <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> went vp to the

and conſulted how to ſaue them,
and at midnight they inſtitued their treaſon
and conſulted how to deſtroy him. The time
which they choſe, and the Iudge which they
choſe, are ſpecially to be noted, the time, <hi>In

            </p>
            <p>This therefore is not to be expounded of
the beginning of their counſell, but of the
end of their counſell: for they tooke counſell
in the night and executed it in the morning.
When they agreed to goe vnto Pilate it was
night, but when they brought him to Pilate
it was morning. But marke how vniuſtly they
handled him before they brought him to
the Iudge. They ſhould haue done nothing
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:17992:407"/>
againſt him before he came to his iudgment:
but they did all againſt him except condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, and crucifying him, before they
came to the Iudge. For all that is ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of examining him, and mocking him,
and reuiling him, and buffeting him, &amp; ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in his face, was done before they came
to the Iudge, which ſhewes that they were
euen angry that they could not kil him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Iuge too.</p>
            <p>All this was done in the night, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt ſaide to his Diſciples in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<hi>This night all of you ſhall bee offended for

               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 31.</note> Shewing that all theſe things ſhould be

and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> where a ſleepe, when <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
and his companions came againſt him,
which ſheweth that it was the time of ſleep:
and in the one and fiftieth verſe, hee ſayth,
that a yong man ran after with a linnen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon his bare bodie: which ſheweth
that hee hearing a tumult and an vprore to
grow in the night, ran forth of dores in great
haſt without his clothes, as they doe in a fire
(to ſe what was doone) and it is added that
they ſtroue to take him, and that hee was
fayne to ſlippe of his Linnen and runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from them naked, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did when
hee left his Cloake with his light Miſtreſſe,
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:17992:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he ſlipt from her, which ſheweth how
voyde of ſhame and modeſtie they were to
offer ſuch violence to a ſtraunger, that hee
coulde ſcarſe ſcape their handes naked, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had nothing againſt him. This
I note to ſhew that their conſpiracie againſt
Chriſt was a night worke, like them which
hate the light becauſe they doe euill. It was
not their woont to ſit in counſayle in the
night but in the day. It would haue troubled
them to watch ſo long for a good cauſe. but
it was fit that the worke of darknes ſhoulde
be done in draknes, &amp; therefore Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>This is the houre of darkneſſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 53.</note> the houre of
darkenes, and the power of darknes, and the
worke of darknes met together. When they
ſhould reſt, malice would not ſuffer them to
reſt, but they became like Owles which
watch in the night and cannot ſleepe. Heere

They ſay that hee cannot ſtay which rideth
vpon the Diuell: for malice draweth him,
and furie ſpurres him. Therefore <hi>Zacheus</hi>
went not ſo haſtely to receiue Chriſt, as his
enemies haſt to deſtroy him. Nay rather I
may ſay, to deſtroy themſelues.</p>
            <p>For as they prayed at Chriſtes death, ſo it

if he haue right in a yeare, it is counted quick

ſuch a ſpeedie Lawyer.</p>
            <p>How then when they take a bad cauſe in
hand, and prolong it too, which keeps their
Clients in ſuſpence from day to day, and
from weeke to weeke, in great charge and
ſinne together. I would to GOD that
ſome did not ſit in counſaile againſt good
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as theſe Prieſts did againſt Chriſt,
but GOD in his mercie dooth daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde
and bring to nothing the accurſed
counſailes of the wicked Antichriſt, and all
his rebellious confederates. So when the
wicked tooke counſaile together, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
was the ende of their counſayles:
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:17992:409"/>
for there is nothing woorſe to the vngodlie
than to meete together: for before they
meete, their wickednes is a little hid like the
poyſon in a Serpent: but when they meete
together, one ſetteth on another, and the
poyſon breakes forth into vile ſpeeches, and
deteſtable workes, and vngodly practiſes, as
we ſee in Tauernes and ſuch like aſſemblies
as this.</p>
            <p>For now they are met together, they haue
conſpired amongſt themſelues to accuſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gouernour the moſt innocent man
in the world, as if he were the worſt man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
they abuſed him, and mocked him, and
reuiled him, and buffeted him, before they
brought him to the Gouernor, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that they woulde haue killed him too,
if they durſt without the Gouernour, but ſin
is craftie, and therefore they obſerue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of lawe, and forme of iudgement, leſt
they ſhould be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſnare which they
made for him.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> had the authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
iudgements of death, and not they:
Therefore they are inforced to ſeeke vnto
his iudgement ſeat to ſaue themſelues from
blame, and to be deliuered out of trouble, if
they did vſurpe any thing vpon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Office.</p>
            <p>Then becauſe they might not runne vnto
<pb n="887" facs="tcp:17992:409"/>
the gouernour before daye without ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of tumult, they ſtaide vntill it was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
but ſo ſoone as they coulde come,
they came poſt haſt, for the Sunne did no
ſooner peepe, but euen at the verie breake
of day, they were all readie to flocke vnto
the Iudge againſt him.</p>
            <p>This they did without knowledge: but
God directed euery thing vnto a right end.
For it was meete that the Sonne of GOD
ſhoulde bee cleered in a ſolemne manner,
by an earthlie Iudge, to ſhewe how wee
ſhalbe cleered by the heauenlie Iudge: and
therefore, as it appeareth in the ſeuen and
twentieth Chapter, and foure and twentieth
verſe of Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpell, <hi>Pilate</hi>
ſaide: that <hi>he found no euill in him</hi> before he
gaue ſentence againſt him, which ſheweth
that he died not for his owne ſinnes but for
our ſinnes, and therefore though they went
to the Iudge to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from blame,
yet God ſent them to the Iudge, that his
worde might be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this <hi>Pilate</hi> was a Roman gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which ruled for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as <hi>Zacheus</hi>
was a <hi>Romane</hi> collectour which gathered
for <hi>Caeſar:</hi> For at that time the <hi>Romanes</hi>
had brought much of the worlde vnto their
ſubiection: as ſince that time, they haue
brought much of the worlde vnto Idolatry:
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:17992:410"/>
and therefore God would haue his ſonne to
be iudged by the Romane policie, and to be
condemned by a Romane Iudge, and to be
ſlaine with a Romane death, as it were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Iewes and the Romans in impietie
together, to ſhewe, that theſe two Nations
ſhoulde be the odiouſt people vnto him in
all the worlde, and how his ſeruaunts ſhould
be crucified there, where hee was crucified
himſelfe: for as the Romanes then did cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
Chriſt vpon a Croſſe, ſo they crucifie
him nowe vpon their Altar, and reſemble
the Dragon,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> which when he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
againſt <hi>Michaell</hi> himſelfe, then hee
fought againſt the woman and her ſeed, that
is, the Church and her children, which are
ſlaine in <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Prophets were in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
Thus <hi>Rome</hi> began with the heade,
and ends with the members. So much of
the Prieſts and the Scribes, and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and the elders &amp; <hi>Pilate,</hi> what they did
againſt Chriſt,<note place="margin">Sam. 15. 31.</note> of whome was fullfilled <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
praier: <hi>Lord turne the counſell of Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophell
vnto follie:</hi> So their counſell was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto follie. For as <hi>Paule</hi> reuiued when
he was ſtoned, ſo Chriſt roſe againe when he
was buried, to ſhewe, that there is no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
againſt God, and therefore let all our
counſels be for God.</p>
            <p>Now we come to <hi>Iudas</hi> to aggreuate this
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:17992:410"/>
tragicall counſell. The Euangeliſt annexeth
vnto it, the deſperate end of the curſedſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that euer was. Three things are ſpeciallie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of this Traitor: his death, the cauſe of his
death, &amp; the confeſſion which hee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death. His death in the fift verſe: <hi>Hee
went &amp; hanged himſelf:</hi> The cauſe of his death
in the 3. verſe: <hi>For that hee had betrayed his
Lord, &amp; now did ſee him condemned &amp; had no ioy
of the money which was giuen vnto him for his
Treaſon.</hi> His confeſſion in the thirde verſe: <hi>I
haue ſinned betraying innocent bloude.</hi> I will
ſpeake of euerie worde as they lie for your
memorie. Therefore, firſt of his Treaſon.
When <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor: before hee was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Iudas</hi> the Apoſtle, now he is called <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
the traitor, to diſtingiſh him from other
of that name, leſt anie of his name ſhoulde
be defamed for him, a brand is ſet in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
like the letter <hi>Tau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> or <hi>Caines</hi> marke, to

burned in the eare: ſo <hi>Eſau</hi> was called <hi>Edom</hi>
which ſignifieth Redde, to keep his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

is called the Sorcerer, as though GOD
would note him for the worſt of that name:
So God knoweth <hi>Simon Peter</hi> from <hi>Simon

his betrayer: and therefore, as <hi>Ieroboam</hi>

comes in with his trayne after him:<note place="margin">

how hee woulde diſhonour them which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, and therefore this name is a word
of reproach vntill this day: and all Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
are called <hi>Iudaſſes</hi> for his ſake: that the
Propheſie might bee fulfilled: <hi>The names of
the wicked ſhall rot:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 7.</note> that is, they ſhall be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with lothſomnes, and remembred with
diſdayne, as a man paſſeth by a rotten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
and ſtoppeth his noſe vntill hee be paſt
it: This is the iuſt wrath of God. As Chriſt
promiſed that <hi>Maries</hi> good worke ſhoulde
bee ſpoken of to the worldes ende: So hee
hath cauſed <hi>Iudas</hi> euill worke to bee ſpoken
of vnto the worldes ende too. For there were
three euilles in one: Firſt his practiſe was
impudent, becauſe hee offered himſelfe to
bee a Traytour before he was asked. Then
it was Couetous, becauſe hee was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to betray his Lord for 30. pence. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was craftie, becauſe hee betrayed him
with a kiſſe, which is a ſigne of loue. Like this
traitour do all other traitours, and therefore
are all called <hi>Iudaſſes,</hi> that is, impudent, and
couetous, and craftie like their maſter.</p>
            <p>The next conſideration is: how <hi>Iudas</hi> his
<pb n="891" facs="tcp:17992:411"/>
repentance came vpon him, in theſe wordes:
<hi>When hee ſawe that Ieſus was condemned, &amp;c.
Peter</hi> heard three crowes before he felt any
remorſe, ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaw his Lord apprepended,
&amp; yet he repented not, then he ſaw him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
and yet he repented not, then he ſawe
him mocked, &amp; yet he repented not, then he
ſawe him buffeted, &amp; yet he repented not, at
laſt he ſawe him condemned, and then ſaith
<hi>Mathew</hi> he repented, like one which ſlayeth
his friend in his rage, and ſorroweth when it
is paſt. In the ſixt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> God is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but GOD repenteth not like men: ſo
here the wicked are ſaid to repent, but the
wicked repent not like the faithfull: But as it
is ſaid of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that he ſought repentance, ſo
they may bee rather ſaide to repent, than to
repent in deede. For if <hi>Iudas</hi> had repented
like <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſhould haue been forgiuen like
<hi>Peter:</hi> but to ſhewe that hee did not repent
well, when he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted one ſinne, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
another to it: for when he had murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his maiſter, hee murthered himſelfe too.
Therefore, if you aske how hee repented? I
thinke he repented ſo as moſt vſurers repent
vpon their death-beds. There is a ſhame of
ſinne, &amp; guilt of conſcience, &amp; feare of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
euen in the reprobate, which is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte
of hell which the wicked feele: euen as
peace of conſcience &amp; ioy in the holy Ghoſt
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:17992:412" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is a foretaſte of heauen, which the godly feele
before they come thither. So <hi>Iudas</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with the vglines of his trecherie, and
had a miſhapen ſorrowe like a Beares whelp,
but without any conuerſion to God, or hope
of mercie, or praier for pardon, or purpoſe
to amend. Onely hee felt a ſhame and guilt,
and anguiſh in his heart: which was rather
a puniſhment of his ſinne, than a repentance
for his ſinne, and a preparatiue to Hell which
he was going vnto: for hardnes of heart, and
deſpaire of mercie are ſinnes &amp; puniſhments
for ſinne too: but true repentaunce is ſuch
a ſorrow for one ſinne as breedeth a diſlike of
all ſinnes, and mooueth to pray, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to amende, which falleth vpon none
but the elect, and therefore <hi>Paule</hi> calleth
the heart of the reprobate,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>A heart which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
repent.</hi> But if the Papiſtes doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
be true, there is nothing wanting
in <hi>Iudas</hi> repentance: for in him may bee
found all the partes of their repentance. For
we ſee in this reprobate, contrition of heart,
confeſſion of mouth, and ſatisfaction of
worke which is all the Papiſtes repentance:
For contrition it is ſaide, <hi>Hee repented:</hi> For
Confeſſion, he ſaith, <hi>I haue ſinned:</hi> For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
hee <hi>reſtored his money againe,</hi> and
yet he is <hi>Iudas</hi> the ſonne of perdition: and
therefore, as Chriſt tolde the Lawyer, that
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:17992:412"/>
one thing was wanting in his obedience: ſo
<hi>Iudas</hi> telleth the Papiſtes, that one thing is
wanting in their repentance, that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
of a man to God, &amp; change of mind:
when a ſinner renounceth himſelf for ſhame
of his ſinne, and yeeldeth to righteouſneſſe
with as great loue as euer hee loued wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
If <hi>Iudas</hi> had repented ſo, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue ſuffered paine like <hi>Iob,</hi> than by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
meanes ridde himſelfe out of paine,
like <hi>Caine</hi> which thought to preuent Gods
iudgments againſt him. This was not a ſigne
of repentance, but a ſigne of deſpaire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let euerie one learne this, that ſo long
as Gods mercie is greater than mans iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
there is no cauſe to deſpaire, but to hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For why did our Sauiour ſaue <hi>Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
which had ſeuen deuils, and ſpare the
theefe which neuer did good, but leſt as
great ſinners as they ſhould deſpaire of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
if they repented. If thou canſt knocke,
his promiſe bindeth him to open. Therefore
ſay not, God will not giue, but, I doe not
aske: for God is readier to giue then wee to
aske. The next conſideration is, how <hi>Iudas</hi>
reſtored his bribe againe. In the firſt of the
<hi>Prouerbes 31. Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wicked ſhall
bee filled with their owne deuiſes.</hi> And in
the 14. Chapter 14. verſe, hee ſaith, <hi>They
ſhall be ſatiat with their owne wayes:</hi> For <hi>Iudas</hi>
               <pb n="894" facs="tcp:17992:413" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath ſinned ſo long, that now he is wearie of
his ſinne, &amp; would reſtore his bribe againe,
euen the ſame daie that he tooke it. It was
giuen him in the night, and in the morning
hee brought it backe: So ſoone is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſinne ecclipſed. Euen nowe his thirtie
pence was the ſweeteſt ſiluer that euer hee
fingured, and now it is the bittereſt money
that euer he purſed. Therefore let all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what <hi>Abner</hi> ſayde vnto <hi>Ioab, Knowest
thou not that it will bee bitternes in the latter
end? 2. Sam.</hi> 2. 26. The ſting of the Serpent is
in his ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le: ſo the taile of ſin hath the ſting
that is the ende. There is no ſinne but it hath
three puniſhmentes which followe it like
bondmaides: Feare, Shame and Guilt: Feare
of iudgement, ſhame of men, and guilt
of conſcience. All theſe did ſurpriſe <hi>Iudas</hi>
at once, ſo ſtuddenlie as <hi>Adam</hi> ſpyed his
nakednes: and though they come after eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſinne, yet they are neuer looked for. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſi</hi>
tooke his bribe merrilie, but hee did
weare it heauilie. <hi>Iezabel</hi> thought that ſhee
had got a Vineyarde for nothing,<note place="margin">1. King. 21.</note> but ſhee
payed more for it than ſhee woulde giue for
all the world. So <hi>Iudas</hi> thought that hee was
made for euer, when hee was vndone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
Heere was the ſcripture fulfilled: <hi>The
bread of deceit is ſweete to a man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but his
mouth ſhall be filled with grauell:</hi> So this gaine
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:17992:413"/>
of treaſon was ſweete to <hi>Iudas,</hi> but when hee
digeſted it, it cracked like grauel in his teeth.
Who woulde ſuffer for millions of gold that
which <hi>Iudas</hi> ſuffereth for thirtie pence? and
yet manie are contente to ſinne for leſſe,
<hi>Iudas</hi> was a traitour for thirtie pence, but a
thouſand are liars, and deceiuers, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
for a penie. If they can get anie thing
by lies, or oathes, or wiles, it is like the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
of their occupation. Bee not deceiued,
the time commeth, when you would reſtore
this gaine againe, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
you ſhall not find the owners where
to make reſtitution. How many at the houre
of death haue offered their praiers and their
ſupplications, and ſeruice vnto God, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
offred his money to the Prieſts, and God
woulde not accept it: but they dyed as they
liued, and went from deſpaire vnto deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Therefore, to day heare his voyce. If
you will not be ſo good as <hi>Zacheus</hi> to reſtore
foure folde for all that you haue gotten by
vſurie, or briberie, or extortion, or deceite,
yet be ſo good as <hi>Iudas</hi> to bring againe ſo
much as you haue taken, and if you doo
it not with <hi>Iudas</hi> minde, but with <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
minde, it ſhall be accepted as <hi>Zacheus</hi>

they die which ſeeke her death. <hi>Iohn</hi> cals
the <hi>Phariſies</hi> a generation of Vipers, which
neuer are borne, but their mother dyeth for
it.</p>
            <p>How right this fitteth with the papiſtes,
for they cannot liue without the death of
their mother. For the Spaniard which would
ſlaughter them, they woulde ſlaughter the
Nurſe which cheriſheth them. Had <hi>Zimri
Peace</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iezabel) which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="898" facs="tcp:17992:415"/>
So I may ſay, haue they died in peace which
would haue ſlaine their miſtreſſe? they which
haue not hanged themſelues like <hi>Iudas,</hi> haue
beene hanged by others like <hi>Hammon,</hi> as
though they had beene ſent ouer but to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Tyborn. So God hath bleſſed them that
bleſſe her, and curſed them which curſe her.
Therefore ſome Traitoures haue confeſſed,
that they had ſinned in betraying the Lords
annointed, as <hi>Iudas</hi> confeſſed that hee had
ſinned in betraying the Lord himſelfe. He
betraied him, as though he had not beene
innocent, and nowe hee muſt die, he ſaith, I
haue betraied innocent bloud. Innocent
in deede: For when he asked his enemies
which of them coulde accuſe him of ſinne?
they had nothing to anſwere: Innocent in
life: Innocent in ſpeech: and Innocent in
thought. The infants which be called inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
were not ſo innocent: therefore howe
ſhould he bee innocent which betraied the
innocenteſt of all? We are taught to be good
vnto al, but eſpecially to the good: but <hi>Iudas</hi>
was naught to all, but worſt to the beſt. If
he had betraied anie, he might ſay, I haue
ſinned, becauſe all diſſimulation and guile
is condemned. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. But when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents
are betrayed, nay when the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſt
is betraied, it ſeemeth more than
ſinne, becauſe neuer any betraied innocent
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:17992:415" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt but <hi>Iudas.</hi> Thus Chriſt was iuſtified of
his Diſciples, and his enemies. He which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him ſayd, he was innocent. He which
condemned him ſaid hee was innocent. And
the Diuels which made <hi>Iudas</hi> betray him, &amp;
<hi>Pilate</hi> condemne him, ſayde before, that hee
was the ſonne of God, and called him holy.
Thus euery ſinner ſhall bee condemned of
himſelfe before hee be condemned of God
that the Lord may bee iuſtified when he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.
If <hi>Iudas</hi> coulde haue ſayde, <hi>I beleeue,</hi>
when hee ſaide, <hi>I haue ſinned:</hi> God woulde
haue aunſwered him as <hi>Nathan</hi> aunſwered
<hi>Dauid: Thy ſinne is forgiuen:</hi> But hee confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and amended not. What ſhall be to them
which doe not confeſſe, but defende their
ſinnes? Is not thy ſinne worſe then <hi>Iudas?</hi>
when <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaith <hi>I haue ſinned,</hi> and thou ſaiſt,
I haue not ſinned. This is our manner to
pleade not guiltie ſo long as we liue. Sinnes
and excuſes are twinnes, borne at a birth, &amp;
one followeth the other, <hi>Zarah</hi> came after
<hi>Phares</hi> out of the wombe. <hi>Gen. 38. 30. Iudas</hi>
ſayth, <hi>I haue ſinned,</hi> but wee ſay, I haue not
ſinned, or I haue ſinned but a little, or I haue
ſinned againſt my will, ſo wee minſe our
ſinnes, as though they needed no forgiuenes.
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſayd, <hi>I am more fooliſh then anie man:</hi>
but wee would bee counted wiſer than anie

but we would be iudged the leaſt ſinners: ſo
we are aſhamed of ſinne, and yet not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſinne. If we would iudge our ſelues
wee ſhould not be iudged. Be not deceiued,
for ſinne doth not ende as it begins. When
the terrours of <hi>Iudas</hi> come vppon the ſoule,
the tongue cannot hide his ſinne: for deſpaire
and horror will not bee ſmothered: But hee
which hath <hi>Sauls</hi> ſpirite haunting him, will
rage as <hi>Saul</hi> did. There is a warning conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp; a gnawing conſcience. The warning
conſcience commeth before ſinne: The gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
conſcience followeth after ſinne. The
warning conſcience is often lulled a ſleepe:
but the gnawing conſcience wakeneth her
againe. If there bee anie hell in this world:
they which feele the worme of conſcience
gnawing vpon their hearts, may truely ſay,
that they haue felt the torments of hell. Who
can expreſſe that mans horror but himſelfe?
Nay, what horrors are they which he cannot
expreſſe himſelfe? Sorrowes are met in his
ſoule as at a feaſt: feare, thought, &amp; anguiſh,
deuide his ſoule betweene them. All the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of hell leape vpon his heart like a ſtage,
Thought calleth to Feare: Feare whiſtleth
to horror: horror beckeneth to deſpaire, and
faith; come and helpe mee to torment this
ſinner. One ſaith, that ſhee commeth from
this ſinne: and another ſaith, that ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:17992:416" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from that ſinne: ſo he goeth through a
thouſand deaths &amp; cannot die. Irons are laid
vpon his bodie like a priſoner. Al his lightes
are put out at once: hee hath no ſoule fit to
be comforted. Thus he lieth, as it were vpon
the racke &amp; ſayth, that he beares the world
vpon his ſhoulders, and that no man ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that which he ſuffereth. So let him lye
(ſaith God) without eaſe vntil he confeſſe &amp;
repent, &amp; call for mercie. This is the goodlie
waye which the Serpent ſayde would make
you Gods, and made him a diuel. Therefore
at laſt, learne the ſleight of Sathan in this
wretched traytor. His ſubtilties are wel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the depth of Sathan:<note place="margin">Ap. 2. 24.</note> for is ſo deepe,
that few can ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him. Now he lets <hi>Iudas</hi> ſee
his ſinne, before he hid it from him. Vntil he
had ſinned, hee made as though it were no
ſinne, but with promiſes and bribes mufled
his face and couered the vileneſſe of his fact,
leſt ſhame ſhould keepe him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he had done, he made it ſeeme as vile as hee
could, to make him deſpaire for it. All his
baites are made of this faſhion, that the ſinne
is done before the puniſhment bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Let vs not looke for <hi>Iudas</hi> to come out
of hell to warne vs, for this is written for our
learning: &amp; therefore, <hi>Be as wiſe as Serpentes,</hi>
that the Serpent may not deceiue you.</p>

What this Mountaine <hi>Lebanon</hi> is, ſurely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
meaneth the place where the Temple
ſhoulde bee built, and God honoured: For
after that <hi>Ioſua</hi> had quietly poſſeſſed the

               <note place="margin">Ioſu. 22. 10.</note> he builded a Tabernacle,

            <p>So ſoone as <hi>Moſes</hi> changed his praier, God

<pb n="906" facs="tcp:17992:419" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So ſoone we make God to forſake vs, if wee
doe not according to his will: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the cauſe why God woulde not heare
him, although he were a great man and in
high authority, yet he is not aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
his fault, which hee might haue kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
if he would: for the people knewe not
that he had ſinned, becauſe the ſinne which
he committed was not open but ſecret: yea,
it was but a little repine, as in the eleuenth
of <hi>Numbers</hi> the eleuenth verſe, &amp; therefore
<hi>Moſes</hi> might haue kept it from them,<note place="margin">Num. 1. 11. 12. 13.</note> but
becauſe hee woulde not iuſtifie himſelfe, hee
telleth them that the Lorde was angry with
him,<note place="margin">Exo. 5. 22</note> and becauſe hee would not haue the
people to iuſtifie themſelues, he telleth them
it is for their ſakes. Thus when <hi>Moſes</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
his prayer, God will no longer heare
him: ſo wee ſee that where ſin is, their prayer
is not effectuall: ſo that if wee will hope to
receiue by prayer any thing at Gods handes,
wee muſt firſt remooue and take a way the
cauſe of our hinderance (which is ſinne) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee can receiue the thing wee pray for.<note place="margin">Num. 14. 19.</note>
For here we ſee that prayer which before pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified

quite ouerthrowne euen like a greate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke
poyſoned with a little Spider. But
the Lord was angrie with me for your ſakes
and would not heare me. God when <hi>Moſes</hi>
had prayed did not graunt his requeſt, but
was angrie with him: but leſt <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould
be quite diſcouraged, he ſtraight wayes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth
his anger &amp; biddeth him be content
and ſpeake no more vnto him of that matter.
God doth not bid him that hee ſhoulde not
praie any more vnto him, but that he ſhould
pray no more for that thing. Firſt God bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him to be content, as if he ſhould haue
ſaid, although thou maiſt not enter into the
land, yet I will content thee other waies: thus
God woulde haue vs in what eſtate ſoeuer
we be, to be content with our calling, for it is
his appointment. And ſeeing he hath in ough
to content vs all, therefore wee ſhoulde not
murmure nor grudge one at another, but be
thankfull vnto him, becauſe it is his good will
and pleaſure it ſhoulde bee ſo. And ſurelie
<hi>Moſes</hi> woulde, and was willing that the
Iewes ſhould profite by his Doctrine, for he
hath ſet it downe in the 20. of <hi>Numbers,</hi>
               <pb n="908" facs="tcp:17992:420" rendition="simple:additions"/>
twiſe,<note place="margin">Num. 20. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. 27. 13.</note> and in the 27. 13. in the 32. <hi>Deut.</hi> 49.
and in this place, all to the intent to ſhewe
that God is able to content all.<note place="margin">Deu. 32. 49.</note> He is not like

               <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 33</note> who when hee had bleſſed one of
his ſonnes, could not bleſſe the other: but he
when hee had bleſſed the poore, bleſſed the
hungry, and when hee had bleſſed the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie,
he bleſſed them that wept, when he had
bleſſed them that wept, he bleſſed them that
were reuiled, and ſuffered for Chriſtes ſake.
There is no ende of his bleſſing, <hi>becauſe his
mercie indureeh for euer.</hi> God is ſo mercifull,
that though we are nor able to praie aright,
yet he conſidereth of our praiers, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the beſt for our good,<note place="margin">Pſal. 135.</note> not graunting
our requeſt manie times, but a better thing
than we doe deſire of him: as when <hi>Dauid</hi>
praied that the Childe gotten in adultery,
might liue, God heard him and did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, yet did not graunt his requeſt but
a better thing, that was, that his Sonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſhould raigne after him: And when our
Sauiour Chriſt praied that that houre might
paſſe ouer him, God heard him and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of it, yet did not grant his requeſt, but a
better thing, that his death ſhould take away
the ſinnes of the world, and here in this place
where <hi>Moſes</hi> priaeth, God heareth his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and doth conſider of it, yet doth not grant
his requeſt, but a better thing, that is, <hi>that he
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:17992:420"/>
ſhall goe into heauenly Canaan.</hi> Thus wee ſee
that God is ſo mercifull that hee can ſcarce
puniſh ſinners, hee is ſo louing that often he
giueth vs better things than wee can deſire,
who then will offend ſo merciful and louing
a father? Let vs, ſeeing God is ſo merciful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, take heede that we abuſe not his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
leſt in ſo dooing we prouoke him vnto
iudgement. Now God hath told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that
he ſhall not goe into the Land, he beginneth
to teach him how hee ſhall doe to ſee it, <hi>and
biddeth him goe vp into the top of Piſgah, and
caſt his eies Eſtward, and weſtward, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and Southward, and behold it, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Bird ſtaied with a little ſtring, or a
ſtrong man in ſwimming held backe by a
ſmall twig: ſo a little ſinne ſtaieth this great
Captaine that he cannot come within the
land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Firſt God is angry with him
&amp; enuies him altogether, as though hee were
not worthy ſo much as to go vp the mount:
thus we may ſee how one of the leaſt ſinnes
is able to turne from vs all the goodnes, &amp; all
the fauour which God beareth to vs.</p>
            <p>After God commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to go vp the
mount. Here <hi>Moſes</hi> obeieth Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but if he had bin like many a murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
man, he would haue denied to go vp the
mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſaying, what banquet is this to me, but
a dainty diſh ſet before one forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eate?
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:17992:421" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but <hi>Moſes</hi> had rather die than anger the
Lorde againe, when he had bid him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Thus we may learne of <hi>Moſes</hi> to bee
content with our calling whether wee haue
little or much: For God contented <hi>Moſes</hi>
as wel with the ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as thoſe who
poſſeſſed it. So when GOD hath not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vs to ſee great ſubſtance as he hath ſome
of our brethren: yet becauſe we ſhould not
be diſcontent, he will giue vs as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
at the ſight of them in others, as though
we our ſelues enioyed them. So GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and he contenteth <hi>Ioſua:</hi> for
as <hi>Ioſua</hi> came into the land as <hi>Moſes</hi> could
not, ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> saw it as <hi>Ioſua</hi> coulde not. So
I ſay God contenteth all, that <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſhould
not enuie <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Moſes</hi> enuie <hi>Ioſua.</hi>
And this was the great power of God: who
although <hi>Moſes</hi> were very old, yet was his
eie-ſight moſt perfect, inſomuch that hee
could ſee farther than any of all his company:
For,<note place="margin">Deut. 34. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>being vpon the Mount, hee ſawe all the land
of Gilead vnto Dan, and all Nepthalie, the
land of Ephraim &amp; Manaſſes, and all the lande
of Iuda, vnto the vttermoſt Sea, &amp;c.</hi> The like
to this did neuer any ſee beeing of the age
of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was 120. yeares olde. Manie
things might <hi>Moſes</hi> haue obiected which
might haue hindered him from going vp

griefe to him when he conſidered that great
paine which he had taken in bringing them
through the wilderneſſe, and conducting
them 40. yeares together, and nowe when
he had no further to goe but euen ouer Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
to be taken a waie then: and another
which neuer tooke any paines, poſſeſſe all
his labours. This I ſay, muſt bee a great and
intollerable thing to fleſhe and bloode: for
when one hath laid a foundation, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
come and build vpon it, ſurely hee will
think himſelfe hardly dealt withal: Or if one
haue drawne a picture, head and face, and all
ſauing the legges, if one come and drawe the
legges, and ſo take his labours, hee woulde
hardlie take it well. You knowe how they
which were hired and wrought all the daie
long,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 11</note> becauſe the had not more than thoſe
which began the laſt houre, murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the maiſter of the houſe. Such is our
nature, and yet notwithſtanding all this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
is content. Hee knoweth that God doth
him no wrong,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 55</note> but is iuſt and mercifull alſo.
He bleſſeth all alike, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> children were
bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo long as he was vpon the plaine
ground, could not ſee the types of heauen:
but when he was vpon the Mount, he ſaw it
before he came to heauen it ſelfe: So let vs
euen now ſeale the Mount as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, that
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:17992:422" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we may ſee and conſider theſe ioyes. Which
thing ſhall be to reclaime our heartes from
earthly matters. As <hi>Peter</hi> went vp the mount
to ſee Chriſts glory, and <hi>Moſes</hi> went vp the
mount to ſee the lande of promiſe: ſo let vs
aſcend from theſe earthly things to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of heauenly. This ſhould be our
iourney till wee come vp to heauen it ſelfe,
to clime the hill: for we are lowe men of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who cannot ſee Chriſt
before we be lifted from the earth, ſo that if
we will euer poſſeſſe heauen, we muſt pluck
our heartes from the earth, and then ſhall we
ſee God nearer than we can poſſibly, if wee
keepe our mindes vppon earthlie matters.
God ſheweth himſelfe to ſome nearer, to
ſome farther off, and to ſome in parables:
As the Prophetes ſawe God nearer than the
Patriarches: and the Apoſtles nearer than
the Prophetes:<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 18</note> As to <hi>Abraham</hi> hee ſaide <hi>In
thy ſeede:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 9. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Eſaiah</hi> came nearer and ſaid, <hi>vnto
vs a childe is borne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 36.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Iohn</hi> yet came more
neare and ſaid,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 18</note> 
               <hi>Behold the Lamb of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Get thee vp into the top of Piſgah, and lift thine
eies Weſtward, and Northward &amp; Southward,
and Eaſtward, and beholde it with thine eies, for
thou ſhalt not goe ouer this Iordaine.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> is in his proſpect, as <hi>Dauid</hi>
was in his Tower. Here he muſt prepare him
ſelfe to die, while hee is looking vpon the
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:17992:422"/>
land which ſo long he hath beene in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to. Who woulde not but haue grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at this? That after ſo long as fourtie
yeares trauaile in hope to poſſeſſe it, ſhould
now in the ende bee content with a ſight of
it, and ſo vaniſh awaie. Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> (for all
this) murmureth not, but like <hi>Iob</hi> taketh it
patiently. And as hee was vpon the Mount
where GOD vaniſhed: So heere hee is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mount and vaniſheth away himſelfe:
as it appeareth in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> the thirtie
foure Chapter, and the ſixth verſe, no man
knoweth his tombe, nor which way hee is
gone, leſt the Iewes ſhoulde haue worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
his Reliques as the Papiſtes doe theirs.
So good Rulers are taken awaie in a time
when death is leaſt ſuſpected. As <hi>Lot</hi> was
taken away before the people of <hi>Sodom</hi> knew
as is ſhewed in the nineteenth Chapter of
<hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the tenth verſe: So wee ſee
that when our time is come, and our glaſſe
run out: that neither our riches, nor our wits,
nor our friends, nor any thing that wee haue
in this world, can cary vs no further. No, no
more than <hi>Moſes</hi> coulde goe ouer this <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Charge Ioſua, and incourage him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
him, for he ſhall goe before this people, and
hee ſhall deuide for inheritance vnto them the
land which thou ſhalt ſee, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="914" facs="tcp:17992:423"/>
Now <hi>Moſes</hi> fainteth, here commeth <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua</hi>
a figure of Chriſt, who leadeth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into <hi>Canaan,</hi> as Chriſt doth lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heauen. <hi>Moſes</hi> is no ſooner dead, but God
chooſeth another to goe in &amp; out before his
people. And now God chooſeth a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
See what a man he chooſeth. O would
that God might haue the chooſing ſtill, for
then all gouernours ſhould be ſuch as <hi>Ioſua:</hi>
for ſuch is our corruption,<note place="margin">Nu. 27. 16.</note> that if we chooſe
our ſelues, that we ſtill chooſe ſuch as God
would not haue choſen, and therefore wee
had neede to pray to the Lord God as <hi>Moſes</hi>
did,<note place="margin">Deu. 27. 16</note> that hee would appoint a man which
may go in &amp; out before vs, that we be not as
ſheepe without a ſhepheard. More was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
touching this point, which I haue not
noted, becauſe I coulde not ſet it downe in
ſuch perfection as it was deliuered.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Charge Ioſua, incourage him, and imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
him, &amp;c.</hi> God would not haue <hi>Moſes</hi> to
incourage <hi>Ioſua</hi> words onely, but in deeds
too: and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> giueth him all the

            <p>
               <hi>Charge Ioſua, incourage him, &amp; bolden him.</hi>
Heere God woulde haue <hi>Ioſua</hi> incouraged

When <hi>Moſes</hi> prepared himſelfe to die:<note place="margin">Deu. 31. 7.</note> hee

all: and thus ſhould <hi>Ioſua</hi> bee encouraged
ſtill: But who encourageth <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſo? Nay,
where is that hee, that doth not diſcourage
<hi>Ioſua?</hi> Now <hi>Ioſua</hi> is contemned &amp; ſcorned
of the vileſt. And is this to encourage him?
No, <hi>Ioſua</hi> had neede of better incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
than this: elſe <hi>Ioſua</hi> and all the <hi>Ioſuas</hi> in this
land will faint, and ſo ſhall the people be left
without a guide to goe in and out before
them, and then ſhall they be readie and a fit
pray for the Wolfe. Well, we ſee that <hi>Ioſua</hi>
here is better incouraged, and it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cauſe that God would haue <hi>Ioſua</hi> thus
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:17992:424" rendition="simple:additions"/>
incouraged. For if hee had an eare at euerie
mans mouth, hee would rather wiſh to die
with <hi>Moſes</hi> vpon the mount, than take in
hand to bring ſuch wicked <hi>Caines</hi> into the
lande of <hi>Canaan.</hi> That which olde <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hro</hi>
taught <hi>Moſes</hi> (that a gouernour had neede to
be a man of courage) heere he findeth true:
for nothing more burteth Iustice than feare.
Therefore a Magiſtrate had need to be ſuch
a one as ſhall not feare the face of any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer:
which cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeake ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to <hi>Ioſua</hi> bidding him <hi>to bee of good courage.</hi>
And to that end God commaundeth <hi>Moſes</hi>
againe and againe, to incourage him, vſing
theſe three words, <hi>Charge, incourage, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
him,</hi> as the cock crowed thriſe, that if
<hi>Peter</hi> were ſleepe the firſt and the ſecond
time, yet he might at laſt awake him.</p>
            <p>Now it reſteth, that I ſhoulde incourage
<hi>Ioſua</hi> which ſucceedeth me. But how ſhould
I begin to incourage him? or where ſhoulde
I begin? ſhall I tell him, that he ſhall liue now
at eaſe and in ſecurity? No. Why, how ſhould
I incourage <hi>Ioſua?</hi> ſhall I tell him, you will
loue him, and follow him, and that hee ſhall
finde you willing and forward in euery good
action? If I promiſe it, ſhall I not lie? If I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bounden for you, ſhall I not forfeit? I
feare yes. Why, how then ſhould I incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<hi>Ioſua?</hi> ſhall I tell him, all will ſpeake wel
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:17992:424"/>
of him? or ſhall I tell him none will ſlaunder
him? No. For if he be as righteous as Chriſt,
yet ſome of the Scribes and Phariſies will
ſeeke to perſecute him. If hee will liue in
quietnes, he muſt not vtter all the Counſell
of God, though God commaund him. Nor
he muſt not reprooue ſome ſinnes, for then
he ſhall be thought to enuie againſt ſome
perſons. Nor he muſt not keepe company
with the godlie, for then ſhal he be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a partaker. No, he muſt not denie the
company of the wicked, for then he ſhall be
accounted a Preciſian, a Puritane, and I
knowe not what. But thou wilt ſaye: what
then, is there no comfort for <hi>Ioſua?</hi> I anſwer,
yes. And that is: it may be after ſome 3. or
4. yeares labour and trauaile, he ſhall winne
ſome 2. or 3. vnto Chriſte which ſhall extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
al griefe: For God will one day reward
him for his labour, &amp; glorifie him in heauen.
But if <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſhould bee in trouble, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
almoſt otherwiſe chooſe, if hee keepe a
good conſcience and reprooue the mightie
vnder his charge, then he ſhall ſee, moſt of
the great ones wil quite forſake him which
now ſeeme to fauour him, &amp; they wil ſee him
perſecuted like Chriſt, and ſtand a farre off
like <hi>Pilate,</hi> and waſh their handes, as though
they were innocent, when it is in their power
and authoritie to amend it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="918" facs="tcp:17992:425"/>
If he ſtand out like a valiant ſouldier &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
then all will draw vnto him. But if hee
faint for lack of ſtrength, although he weepe
like <hi>Peter</hi> yet none will pitie him. Therefore
ſtand you to him both in proſperity &amp; aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.
Loue him &amp; obey him in all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
as the Iewes did their <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and heere I
deliuer you vnto him, &amp; with my loue, leaue
and good will, I giue him my poſſeſſion, my
labors, &amp; my twelue moneths trauailes. And
here becauſe I woulde not keepe you ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
like as <hi>Ioſua</hi> kept the people before
his death with an exhortation to feare God:
or as one friend holdeth another by the hand
being loth to part. I wil make an end, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
you, as <hi>Ioſua</hi> beſought the people of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that you will henceforward feare the
Lord &amp; ſerue him in truth, and put away all
enuie and vngodlines, that it may not be ſaid
they haue returned, with the dog to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or with the ſwine to their puddle, but
that you may go on forward in all goodnes,
ſeruing the Lord in ſpirite and trueth. Then
ſhall the God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bleſſe &amp; proſper you

if thou doe but read <hi>the Prophets:</hi> therefore
before other queſtions, he askes, <hi>Doeſt thou

which examines his Scholler, before

<hi>Paul</hi> examines this king, when he intended
to make him a Schooller of Chriſt, hee askes
him what he hath learned already, before he
teach him farther: and poſing him, he begins
at the foundation which is faith, ſaying, tell

we <hi>know that ye beleeue,</hi> before we aske you.
Is this like the childe which Chriſt ſet in the

they came to <hi>Iohn</hi> before they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<hi>confeſſing their ſinnes, and asked, Maister,
what ſhall we doo?</hi> They were not aſhamed to
acknowledge both their ſinnes and their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
which made <hi>Iohn</hi> wonder and aske
who had taught them, as though this ſhould
be a ſtrange thing in time to come, and ſo it
is: if ye be not like Publicans, when will yee
be like Chriſtians? They confeſſed before
they were baptized, but we muſt thinke that
you know, though you know that we thinke
wrong: wee muſt take you for religious,
though you know we take you amis. Shame
of face was ordained for ſinne, but ſhame is
turned from ſinne to righteouſnes, for they
which are aſhamed of no euill, are aſhamed
of any good, this is a baſhfull Diuell.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Paul</hi> had asked him, he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
himſelfe, <hi>Doeſt thou beleeue? I knowe
that thou beleeueſt,</hi> Hee askes <hi>Agrippa</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee beleeue, and ſaith hee knoweth that
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:17992:428"/>
hee doth beleeue. What neede he aske that
which he knowes? Here you may ſee that we
haue neede to ſuſpect our iudgment, when
wee conceiue not the cauſe, when they
which are wiſer, and holier than our ſelues,
doe thus or thus, ſpeake thus or thus. Let vs
remember that the Spirituall man iudgeth
all, and is iudged of none, becauſe no man
knowes the counſeles of the Spirite, but hee
which hath it, wiſe men haue large excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and it becomes vs to conſtrue their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
and doinges better than others ſhould
conſtrue ours. As the Diſciples reuerenced
many ſayings of Chriſt when they knew not
his meaning: ſo we ſhould rather thinke that
we know not the reaſon, then that they ſpeak
without reaſon. Chriſt did know that <hi>Peter</hi>
loued him, yet that he might get a confeſſion
of him and inſtruct him farther, hee did aske
him that which he knew, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> catechizing
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> doth aske him that which he knew,
to teach him that which hee knew not. But
why doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſay flatly, that hee knowes
that which no man thought of this king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Either becauſe he did perceiue that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
did beleeue in part, and therefore hee
reioiced like the Father to ſee his Son com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
towards him: So he meetes him in the
way, and imbraceth him as it were with this
commendation: <hi>I knowe that thou beleeueſt,</hi>
               <pb n="925" facs="tcp:17992:428" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is, I knowe thou haſt a kinde of faith, &amp;
beleeueſt that the Prophets ſaide truelie, as
many of the Gentiles did, though thou canſt
not apply it vnto thy ſelfe: So to bring him
from faith to faith, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
from loue to loue: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends thoſe
ſparkes in him, which ſerued not to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
faith, but almoſt faith, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>Or elſe he ſaith, <hi>I knowe thou beleeueſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would haue him beleeue. Therefore
he preuents him and aunſweres for him, leſt
<hi>Agrippa</hi> ſhould go backe, and miſlike with
his boldenes, and ſaie no, <hi>I beleeue not the
Prophetes,</hi> as it is like he would haue ſaid, if
<hi>Paul</hi> had not ſpoken mildly to him, therefore
hee begges the queſtion and anſweres him,
<hi>I know that thou beleeueſt:</hi> As when wee will
make a man our friend and willing to doe vs
a pleaſure, as though he were willing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and as though we had no doubt of him.
<hi>Doeſt thou beleeue?</hi> yea, <hi>I knowe that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueſt.</hi>
And yet it was but <hi>almoſt beleeue,</hi> as
<hi>Agrippa</hi> confeſſed himſelfe, but if hee had
not beleeued, this was the way to make him
beleeue, for this makes many zealous to bee
counted zealous, &amp; many ſtudious, valiaunt,
&amp; bountifull, to haue a name of more than is
in them, as if ye marke ye ſhall ſee generally
to ſpeake well of a man rather than euil doth
ſtir him to vertue, &amp; incorage him in vertue
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:17992:429"/>
for no man is ſo humble but hee leanes to
Fame, and a good report dooth tickle and
pleaſe him which deſerues it, and him which
deſerues it not. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> which knewe
by long experience what baite was beſt to
catch ſouls, when he caſt forth ſuch a ſtrange
queſtion, anticipates the anſwere, leſt <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
ſhould anſwere otherwiſe than he woulde
haue him: he will not truſt him with ſuch a
queſtion, but ſpeaks for him, <hi>I know that thou
beleeuest. Salomon</hi> ſaith <hi>that hee is wiſe who
winneth ſoules, Pro.</hi> 11. 30. And ſo you may ſee
in this example, heere zeale and diſcretion
were met together, the Doues ſimplicitie,
and the Serpents pollicy kiſſed each other to
win one ſoule to God, what ſtudy <hi>Paul</hi> tooke
and how he beate his braine, and picked his
words to win a king to religion, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
turne with their head. Hee doth not ſo
much flatter <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as hee perſwades him
to doo that which he ſaith hee doth, this was
<hi>Pauls</hi> drift to drawe him as it were with the
cords of ioy, and make him confeſſe Chriſt
before hee was a ware, that ſo he might get
more &amp; more of him, euen as <hi>Nathan</hi> made
<hi>Dauid</hi> by a ſleight to confeſſe againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and repent his adultrie, when as it is
like that plaine and blunt ſpeeches, would
haue done more hurt than good. This is the
ſubtiltie of wiſedome (as I my tearme it)
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:17992:429" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which <hi>Salomon</hi> intendeth when ſhe ſaith, <hi>I
wiſedome dwell with Prudence, Pro.</hi> 12. where
prudence ſignifieth Chriſtian policie, which
Chriſt commends when hee ſaieth, bee wiſe
like Serpents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 10. Thus you haue a
patterne before you, they which conuert
ſoules to God, may ſee how <hi>Paule</hi> incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whereby no doubt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt would haue vs learne how to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
to our brethren their ſmal beginnings
and praiſe the mite which comes from them
that haue learned but a while, and take hold
of ſuch as are comming forward, and drawe
them further with all the ſignes of loue: and
not diſdaine thoſe which come at the laſt
houre to the vineyard, though we our ſelues
haue labored ſince the morning. <hi>For he which
is firſt may bee laſt, and hee which ſeemes last
may be firſt.</hi> Therefore let no man inſult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde
the liſtes of humilitie, as many make
themſelues vnprofitable ſeruants by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelues more profitable than other.
It is a fault among the beſt which are like
<hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> a little proud of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and contemne them which are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as <hi>Agrippa:</hi> whome <hi>Paul</hi> beares in his
armes like the loſt ſheepe to the ſold againe.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſpoken, <hi>Agrippa</hi> anſweres,
<hi>Almoſt thou haſt parſwaded me to become a
Chriſtian.</hi> Wherein ye may ſee how <hi>Paules</hi>
               <pb n="948" facs="tcp:17992:430"/>
ſpeech wrought with him, that hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
conuerted with a worde, when it was
ſpoken in wiſedome and loue: what power
is in one Sermon, if ye heare attentiuelie. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
was an heathen euen nowe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
Idols, and neuer heard a Preacher
before, yet one Sermon made him <hi>almoſt</hi> a
Chriſtian. As <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith of <hi>Steeuen,</hi> when he
diſputed againſt the <hi>Sirenians, Acts</hi> the ſixt
Chapter, and the tenth verſe, they could not
reſiſt the wiſedome and the ſpirite by which
he ſpake: So <hi>Agrippa</hi> coulde not riſiſt the
wiſedome and the Spiritte by which <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpake, but was ſo fettered with the holie
chaine, that as <hi>Paule</hi> was captine to <hi>Festus,</hi> ſo
<hi>Agrippa</hi> nowe was captiue to <hi>Paul,</hi> the
worde had him in bands like a priſoner, and
made him confeſſe againſt himſelfe before
<hi>Festus,</hi> that hee was <hi>almost</hi> a Chriſtian. For
<hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech to the amaſe of that obſtinate
Preſident, and wonder of all that ſtoode by,
to ſee a King, an heathen, and an Idolatour,
which ſate to iudge, to be ſo chaunged with
a worde of a captiue from his opinion, whom
they though all the wordes in Gods booke
coulde not alter, if <hi>Paul</hi> and Chriſt had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to him all his life: Then it was verified
which before was prophecied, <hi>They ſhall
binde Kinges in chaines, and Nobles in fetters
of Iron, Pſalme</hi> one hundred fortie nine, and
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:17992:430" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the eight verſe. O the Maieſtie and force of
the word, when faith dooth kindle it, and
zeale dooth vtter it, it flies like the ſtone out
of <hi>Dauids</hi> ſling, and ſtrikes ſinne and ſinner
both together at the heart.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Paule</hi> did in bondes: when hee was
bound, he was ſtronger than they that bound
him: when hee was a Captiue, he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reer
than they which kept him: and when his
Iudges examined him, hee examined them,
and made them free which are bound to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
before hee was free from them. Sende
for <hi>Paule</hi> out of priſon to inſtruct <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
and he is in bandes which ſhould conuert.
O that ſuch Doctors might preach vnto the
Romiſh Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> or that the Kings
that honour yet the moſt Antichriſtian beaſt,
would heare like this King: But they haue
ſome <hi>Anaſiahs</hi> which haue an eye to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
that hee cannot ſpeake in the Courte.
<hi>Goe thou ſeer, flie into the lande of Iuda, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie

no more at Bethel, for this is the kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
and the kings Courte.</hi> A goodlie reaſon
why none but flatterers ſhould preach to
Princes, becauſe it is the <hi>kings Courte:</hi> Should
not Kings heare the trueth as well as others?
Muſt not <hi>Bethel</hi> heare of ſaluation as well as

<pb n="930" facs="tcp:17992:431"/>
will hee conuert <hi>Agrippa</hi> which will not
preach in bands nor in libertie? Happie <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi>
not by the name of a King, but by the
name of a Chriſtian. Happie <hi>Agrippa,</hi> not
by the preſents which thou receiuedſt of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
but by the words which thou heardſt of
<hi>Paul:</hi> thou cameſt to ſee, but God brought
thee to heare: thy intent was to gratulate
<hi>Feſtus,</hi> but now thou maieſt gratulate <hi>Paule.</hi>
The Captiue is better to thee than the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
for <hi>Feſtus</hi> hath ſhewed thee but his
pompe, but <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſhewed thee his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and perſwaded thee to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Almost</hi> ſaith <hi>Agrippa,</hi> but not <hi>altogether.</hi>
Heere you may ſee your pittance, how you
meaſure God with <hi>almoſt,</hi> and ſerue him by
halfes which hath giuen all,<note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> like <hi>Ananias</hi>
which brought a part and kept a part behind.
This is our worſhip of God: though we will
not ſay for ſhame with <hi>Agrippa</hi> that wee are
but <hi>almost Chriſtians:</hi> yet wee are not <hi>almoſt,</hi>
when we would be counted <hi>altogether.</hi> We
goe before him in hypocriſie, and come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him in modeſtie, for <hi>Agrippa</hi> woulde
not ſhewe more than he had, to be counted
better than hee was. Though <hi>altogether</hi> had
been as ready as <hi>almoſt,</hi> as it is to vs, yet when
<hi>almoſt</hi> was all, hee ſaid <hi>almoſt,</hi> not <hi>altogether.</hi>
It ſeemes that the flaxe began to ſmoake,
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:17992:431" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though it did not burne. The firſt temper is
colde, the next is luke-warme, the laſt is hot:
<hi>Almoſt</hi> is firſt, and <hi>Altogether</hi> is laſt: and
many come betweene before wee can goe
from one to another. <hi>Agrippa</hi> confeſſeth
that <hi>almoſt</hi> is all, and here he ſtayes to heare
what <hi>Paule</hi> will ſay to inſtruct him farther.
<hi>Paule thou haſt perſwaded mee almoſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Chriſtian.</hi> It is like the faint confeſſion
of him that wept and ſaid, <hi>I beleeue Lord,
helpe my vnbeleefe:</hi> I am a Chriſtian, teach
me to be a Chriſtian? Therefore they which
deſcant vpon his name, doe note that <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
is as much as <hi>Aegre pario,</hi> which ſignifies
him which hardlye laboureth, and brings
forth with paine as <hi>Agrippa</hi> did. <hi>Nabal is
his name</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abigail) and folly is with him,</hi>
So <hi>Agrippa</hi> is his name and difficultie is with
him: for hard and ſcarce was his conception
in ſtead of a Chriſtian, hee brought forth <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Shall we nowe behold our face in <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paes</hi>
Glaſſe, whether wee bee <hi>altogether</hi> like
<hi>Paule,</hi> or <hi>almoſt like Agrippa,</hi> or <hi>like Feſtus
not at all?</hi> Chriſtians or no Chriſtians, or
what kind of Chriſtians are wee? There bee
many degrees vppon earth, but this is the
higheſt degree: There be many names of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but this is the honourableſt name: there
bee many profeſſours of men, but this is the
<pb n="932" facs="tcp:17992:432" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beſt profeſſion to be a Chriſtian, that is, the
Sonne of GOD, the fellowe of Angels, the
heire of heauen: yet whether we ſhould be
Chriſtians, or Chriſtians <hi>almoſt,</hi> or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>altogether,</hi> is a queſtion which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
euery man, and when <hi>altogether</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
for beſt, yet wee chooſe <hi>almoſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it.</p>
            <p>There is ſome thing alwaies behinde, like
the eye which looked to Sodome: as an
Owle peeps at the Sunne out of a barne but
dares not come to it, ſo we peepe at Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and will not come neere it, but ſtande a
loofe off pinking and winking as though we
were more afraid of GOD than the diuell:
For ſelfe-loue, and regarde of perſons, and
feare of lawes, and ſway of time, more are
afraide to be too holie, than too prophane,
becauſe holineſſe is worſe intreated than
prophaneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goe away and ſinne no more, becauſe thou
art healed.</hi> Nay, goe away and ſinne againe
becauſe thou art healed. As <hi>Naaman</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for one ſinne: that he might ſtand before
the Idoll when his Lorde leaned vppon his
ſhoulder: So this ſinne, and that ſinne will
not let vs paſſe the compaſſe of <hi>almost,</hi> leſt
we ſhould haue a perfect reward.</p>
            <p>God would haue nothing ſo perfect as a
Chriſtian, for whome he hath giuen his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:17992:432" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sonne, his ſpirit, his Lawe, and his
prophets, <hi>That the man of God may be perfect,</hi>
as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith. Yet euery thing growes vntill
it be perfect, the builder buildes till it bee an
houſe: The Tailour ſoweth till it be a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The painter paints till it be a picture:
Onely the Chriſtian leaues off before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to bee a Chriſtian, and makes a full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
at almoſt.</p>
            <p>That which GOD would haue to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt
of all, hee had rather haue vnperfect
than perfect, halfe than all, a little wealth, a
little reſt, a little honor, and a little pleaſure
ſeems nothing, but a little faith is enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be neuer ſo ſmall a mite.</p>
            <p>We haue a waight of al kinde of mettals,
a touchſtone for gold, a meaſure for grame,
and we will not take one iot leſſe than mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of any man, onely wee cut GOD of his
waight and meaſure, and waigh our ſeruice
in halfe ballances: This I will doe, and this I
will not doe, God ſhall haue one part, and the
the world ſhall haue another part, and the
fleſh ſhall haue another part, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
ſhall haue another part. Thus wee haue
brought GOD to his ſtint: aske while hee
will, hee ſhall haue no more but <hi>almoſt:
Almoſt zealous, almoſt faithfull, almoſt
righteous,</hi> as though <hi>almoſt</hi> were better than
<hi>altogether:</hi> that is, the counterfeite than the
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:17992:433" rendition="simple:additions"/>
truth, the ſhadow than the bodie. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
that <hi>the Athenians were too religious in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
an Idoll. Act.</hi> 17. 22. But where doth
<hi>Paul</hi> find that exceſſe in worſhipping God:
we are not too diligent, but too negligent
where we ſhould be diligent. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our ſinnes cals them the ſuperfluity of
our maliciouſnes, whereby he ſheweth that
though our wickednes be a ſuperfluous and
vaine thing, yet it ouerfloweth, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the bankes. But Chriſt ſpeaking of his
Diſciples progreſſe in righteouſneſſe, calles
them all by this name, <hi>O ye of little faith, &amp;c.</hi>
So he may ſay of <hi>little loue,</hi> of <hi>little zeale,
&amp;c.</hi> for all our vertues are little ones, and the
waters of life are at ſuch an ebbe, that the
leaſt temptation may wade ouer them and
not be drowned. <hi>God hath a controuerſie with
vs,</hi> as he ſaith <hi>with Iſraell:</hi> and this is it, wee
were borne when wiſedome cried in the
ſtreetes, and yet ſhe may call vs fooles and
ſay: <hi>How long wilt thou hate knowledge? Pro. 1.
For what could God doe more vnto this vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
that he hath not done?</hi> Thirtie yeares we
haue been dreſſing, and pruning, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and yet what is in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> more than
in <hi>Samaria?</hi> In th Vineyarde than in the

<pb n="935" facs="tcp:17992:433" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Our Church is in a conſumption: her heads
are ſicke, her members weake, her Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
fearefull. From little to little, our zeale
is come to the laſt gaſpe, readie to take her
leaue of all, becauſe ſhee ſee not that wee
loue religion, but chaſe it from vs. Her eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are placed about her: ſhee growes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
thornes: ſhee is fed with checkes:
ſhee mourneth in a corner: ſhee ſpeakes on

dare not defend her for her enimies. What
ſhall I ſaye? Wee had rather bee whole ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
than <hi>halfe Chriſtians.</hi> White is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no coulour: ſo zeale is counted no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But meere hypocriſie is counted true
Chriſtianitie: and true Chriſtianitie is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by hypocriſie. Our wealth is in an <hi>Epha,</hi>
our zeale is in a <hi>Gomer.</hi> Our ſinne like an
Oake, our faith like a Muſtard ſeede. They
which haue no religion are counted honeſt
men: for they count it as eaſie a mater to be
a Chriſtian as to ſaie the Lordes prayer, the
Apoſtles Creede, the tenne Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and goe to the church, this is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
Diuinitie, this is Citie Diuinitie, and I
may ſay Saint <hi>Clements</hi> Diuinitie. He which
can ſweare that the Pope is Antichriſt, and
that fleſh is good on Fridaies, is a proteſtant
at leaſt, a Chriſtian euerie inche: hee hath
zeale, knowledge and religion in <hi>Folio.</hi> This
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:17992:434"/>
is the rampier in our daies, like a Lion in the

wee can come to <hi>altogether:</hi> and they which
wil goe beyond <hi>Almoſt,</hi> are counted curious,

were more than <hi>altogether,</hi> and <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

wee may not preach like Chriſt: <hi>Bring foorth

               </gap>te ſticketh in the worlde. If one

If one worde ſauour of religion, the

taſte of grace? Howe fewe of our

which ſhoulde bee the line and leuell of all
our thoughts, ſpeeches, and actions? Tell
thy ſinnes which thou haſt committed ſince
thou diddeſt riſe in the morning, and record
thy good deedes which thou haſt done euer
ſince thou waſt borne, and the firſt ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede

Chriſtian, haſt rebelled more ſince thou roſe
than thou haſt obeyed ſince thou were
borne.</p>
            <p>Is this <hi>altogether like Paul,</hi> or like <hi>Feſtus
not at all?</hi> Now if wee bee <hi>almoſt Chriſtians,</hi>
Let vs ſee what it is to be <hi>Almoſt a Chriſtian.
Almoſt</hi> a ſonne is a baſtard. <hi>Almost</hi> ſweete,
is vnſauorie. <hi>Almoſt</hi> hote, is luke warme,
which GOD ſpueth out of his mouth. <hi>Reuel.</hi>
3. 15. So <hi>Almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> is not a Chriſtian
but that which GOD ſpueth out of his
mouth. A Chriſtian <hi>Almoſt,</hi> is like a woman
which dieth in trauaile: <hi>Almoſt</hi> ſhe brought
<pb n="938" facs="tcp:17992:435" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foorth a ſonne, but that <hi>almoſt</hi> killed the
mother and the ſonne too. <hi>Almost a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
is like <hi>Ieroboam</hi> which ſaide, <hi>It is too
farre to goe to Ieruſalem to worſhip,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
choſe rather to worſhip calues at home.
<hi>Almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> is like <hi>Michah</hi> which
thought himſelfe religious enough becauſe
he had gotten a Prieſt into his houſe. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a Chriſtian,</hi> is like <hi>the Ephraimite
which could not pronounce Shibboleth, but Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth.
Almost a Chriſtian,</hi> is like <hi>Ananias</hi>
which brought a part, but left a part behind.
<hi>Almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> is like <hi>Elyes</hi> ſonnes which
polled the ſacrifices: like the Figge tree
which deceiued Chriſt with leaues: like the
virgins which carried lampes without oyle:
like the willing vnwilling ſonne which ſaid,
<hi>He would come and came not.</hi> What is it to be
borne <hi>almoſt?</hi> If the newe man be but borne
<hi>almoſt,</hi> hee is not borne. What is it to bee
married <hi>almoſt</hi> vnto Chriſt? Hee which is
married but <hi>almoſt,</hi> is not married. What is
it to offer a ſacrifice <hi>almoſt?</hi> the ſacrifice muſt
bee killed or euer it can bee ſacrificed. Hee
which giues <hi>Almoſt,</hi> giues not but denyeth.
Hee which beleeueth <hi>Almoſt,</hi> beleeueth not
but doubteth. Can the dore which is but <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
ſhut keepe out the theefe? Can the cup
which is but <hi>almoſt</hi> whole, holde any wine?
Can the ſhip which is but <hi>almoſt</hi> ſound, keep
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:17992:435"/>
out water? The ſouldier which doth but <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
fight, is a coward. The Phiſician which
doth but <hi>almoſt</hi> cure, is a ſlubberer. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
which doth but <hi>almoſt</hi> labour, is a loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.
I cannot tell what to make of theſe
defectiues, nor where to place them, nor
howe to call them, nor vnto what to liken
them: <hi>They are like vnto children which ſit in
the market place whereis mourning and piping,
and they neither weepe nor daunce,</hi> but keepe a
note betweene both, they weepe <hi>almoſt,</hi> and
daunce <hi>almoſt.</hi> Beleeueſt thou <hi>almoſt? Bee it
vnto thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as thou beleeuest.</hi>
Therefore, if thou beleeueſt, thou ſhalt bee
ſaued. If thou beleeueſt <hi>almoſt,</hi> thou ſhalt
bee ſaued <hi>almoſt.</hi> As a pardon comes while
the theefe hangs vpon the galowes, hee is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
ſaued, but the pardon dooth him no
good: So he which is <hi>almoſt</hi> a Chriſtian, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
zealous, <hi>almoſt</hi> righteous, which dooth
<hi>almoſt</hi> loue, <hi>almoſt</hi> beleeue, ſhall bee <hi>almoſt</hi>
ſaued: that is, if hee had been a Chriſtian, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,</hi>
hee ſhould not bee damned. Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man is a Chriſtian <hi>almoſt,</hi> before he bee
a Chriſtian <hi>altogether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I muſt leade you from <hi>almoſt</hi> to <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
as it were to Chriſtians from the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Chriſtians. This is the ſtep which we
muſt treade at this time. <hi>I would to God</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Paul) that thou wert not almoſt but altogether
<pb n="940" facs="tcp:17992:436"/>
as I am.</hi> When he ſawe <hi>Agrippa</hi> comming on,
and ſaid <hi>almoſt,</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> caſt vp his lure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
Commeſt thou <hi>Agrippa?</hi> Come <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi>
I will not haue thee ſtay at <hi>almoſt,</hi> if
any thing will bring thee to <hi>altogether</hi> I did
not aske thee whether thou didſt beleeue
the Prophets, that thou mighteſt be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<hi>almoſt</hi> but a Chriſtian <hi>altogether.</hi> Art
thou come thus farre, and ſtaieſt thou at
<hi>almoſt?</hi> Nay <hi>Agrippa</hi> thou muſt take out this
leſſon, for there is no meaſure in Chriſtianity.
<hi>Come vnto me ſaith Chriſt,</hi> not come toward
mee, yet he was glad like the father to ſee his
ſonne comming toward him, for it was a
ſigne that he would come to him: hee was
comforted with <hi>almoſt,</hi> but he was not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without <hi>altogether.</hi> Is this thy offering
<hi>Almoſt?</hi> it will not ſerue <hi>Agrippa:</hi> it is
light, it is ſothered, it is crakt, correct it
againe: For our maſter ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy as I
am holie:</hi> Therefore <hi>almoſt</hi> a Chriſtian will
not pleaſe him. But if thou be <hi>almoſt</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
alreadie, how eaſie is it for thee to be a
Chriſtian <hi>altogether.</hi> Therefore come <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi>
let vs goe forwarde to heauen. The
ſeed is ſowne to growe. Euerie thing muſt
encreaſe and multiplie. <hi>Almoſt</hi> is thy firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
and <hi>altogether</hi> thy laſt. I muſt not take
this for an anſwere. Shall I tell Chriſt, that
<hi>Agrippa</hi> is <hi>almost</hi> a Chriſtian? O <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
               <pb n="941" facs="tcp:17992:436"/>
God woulde haue thee <hi>hot</hi> or <hi>colde,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in the third Chapter of the <hi>Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of S. Iohn,</hi> and the 15. verſe. Cold to him
is as pleaſing as luke-warme: he loueth <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
and he will not be loued <hi>almoſt:</hi> Who
ſhall haue the other halfe, if God haue but
<hi>almoſt?</hi> Therefore ſpeake againe good <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa.</hi>
Thus he pleadeth vnkindneſſe with
him, like an importunate ſuter with wil not
be anſwered. Shal I go with <hi>almoſt?</hi> then thou
vſeſt mee but hardlie, if thou wilt giue mee
no more. Thus he ſtands in argument with
him. What ſhall I ſay to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> if hee will
giue me but <hi>almoſt?</hi> I will praie for thee till
thou commeſt off with all. If I can get no
more of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> I will craue more of God.
He which hath made thee <hi>almoſt,</hi> can make
thee <hi>altogether. I would to God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now he conuerteth himſelfe to praier.
Thus we muſt learne to fiſh for ſoules with
praiers and intreaties, and queſtions. Change
the baite: caſt thy Lure againe: follow the
ſiege: purſue the blowe: cloſe with ſinne:
and gather more of it: at firſt hee will call
thee his enemie as <hi>Achab</hi> did <hi>Elias: Art thou
heere mine enemie?</hi> But if thou wilt not bow
to him, hee will bowe vnto thee, and hearken
what thou ſayeſt, and change his robes, and
put on ſackcloth, and mourme and faſt,
and doe all that thou wouldeſt haue him.

A Preacher muſt not looke to finde them
Chriſtians, but make them Chriſtians. Thou
ſhalt not take them conuerted becauſe thou
commeſt to conuert them. If <hi>Paule</hi> will not
yeeld to <hi>Agrippa, Agrippa</hi> will yeeld to <hi>Paul.</hi>
But if <hi>Paul</hi> had fallen to <hi>almoſt,</hi> hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
brought <hi>Agrippa</hi> to <hi>altogether.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they which fiſhe for ſoul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> muſt take
<hi>Paules</hi> net, and remember what God ſaith to
<hi>Ieremie 15. 19. Let them bee conuerted vnto
thee. But be not thou conuerted vnto them: for
then thou ſhalt neuer conuert them:</hi> Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that our conſtancie in goodnes ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
others to turne from their wickednes,
and make him which is but <hi>almoſt</hi> come to
<hi>altogether.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of <hi>Paules</hi>
replie, that it is not enough to be a Chriſtian
<hi>almoſt,</hi> that is, to haue a kinde of religion, a
little knowledge, a little faith, a cold zeale
a flattering holines, like the touch of the
hem: but we muſt march to perfection, and
<hi>doe his will vpon earth, as it is in heauen,</hi> and
contend <hi>to be holie as hee is holie.</hi> This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(ſaith <hi>Iames) to keepe thy ſelfe vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
like a glaſſe which is ſtill wiped. To this
end ſaith <hi>Paul. 2. Tim.</hi> 3. The Scripture doth
teache, and reproue, and inſtruct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<hi>That the man of God might bee abſolute.</hi>
And in the 1. <hi>to the Ephe. 41. To this ende wee
were elected, that wee might be holie and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:17992:437"/>
blame.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. He deſcribes our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<hi>from faith to faith,</hi> not from faith to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt.
As <hi>Dauid</hi> deſcribes the waie of the
righteous <hi>Pſal. 840. 7. From vertue to vertue,</hi>
as a trauailer goes from towne to towne, till
he come to his Inne. What a fooliſh thing
were it for the Scribe to ſtay there, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
Lord telles him, <hi>Thou art not farre from the
kingdome of heauen?</hi> for therefore Chriſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him, that he is not farre from heauen, to
incourage him, leſt he ſhould giue ouer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he come to it, So, if yee ſtaie at <hi>almoſt,</hi>
and repente in ſome ſort as <hi>Eſau</hi> did when
hee wept, you may hunt for the bleſſing as
<hi>Eſau</hi> did, and goe without it: for God is
not mocked: but God is mocked if colours
and ſhewes will ſerue.</p>
            <p>When GOD ſaid, <hi>Seeke my face:</hi> mine
heart aunſwered (ſaid <hi>Dauid) I will ſeeke
thy face. Pſalme.</hi> 27. 8. So wee muſt aunſwere
the Lorde to that which he asketh: and not
when hee biddes vs ſeeke his face, ſeeke his
backe: when he requireth al, giue him halfe:
God aſketh, <hi>Art thou a Chriſtian?</hi> and thou
aunſweres: <hi>O Lord, I am almoſt a Chriſtian.</hi>
What niggardlie aunſwere is this to him
which deſerueth a thouſande times more
than the beſt can giue? If thy maiſter aske
thee, art thou my ſeruant? wilt thou aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
him, I am <hi>almoſt</hi> thy ſeruant? If the
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:17992:438"/>
Prince aske thee: Art thou my ſubiect? wilt
thou aunſwere, I am <hi>almoſt</hi> thy ſubiect? If
thy father aske thee: art thou my ſonne?
wilt thou anſwere: I am <hi>almoſt</hi> thy ſonne? If
thou art but <hi>almoſt</hi> his ſon, then he is but <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
thy father: And ſo it is with God, a ſon
or no ſonne: halfe a ſonne, is a baſtard. How
doeſt thou know God to be thy God, but as
thou art his ſeruant? How doeſt thou knowe
God to be thy father, but as thou art his ſon?
By thy loue thou ſhalt know Gods loue: for
according to thy minde towards him, is his
minde of thee, whereby thou maiſt truelie
iudge whether he fauour thee or hate thee,
and no way elſe.</p>
            <p>God loueth nothing <hi>almoſt,</hi> therefore he
doth not loue <hi>almoſt.</hi> Therefore, loue as thou
maiſt be loued, or elſe thy loue is loſt. Thou
muſt ſeeke as thou maiſt finde, or elſe thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is loſt. <hi>They ſhall ſeeke and finde me</hi> (ſaith
God) <hi>becauſe they ſhall ſeeke with all their
hearts,</hi> as in <hi>Ieremie</hi> 29. Chapter, and the 13.

So man is not onely commaunded to
obey God, but to obey him while hee liues,
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:17992:438" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and then he ſhall be ſaued. <hi>Be faithfull</hi> (ſaith

thee the Crowne of life. Reuel.</hi> 2, 10.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> was commanded to kill the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
beaſts, he was commaunded to kil
all: and becauſe he ſpared ſome, God reiected
him. Yet God hath more mercie on beaſts,
than on ſins. Would he haue the beaſts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
die, &amp; their vices liue? No (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>Make cleane within:</hi> that is, leaue no filth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
Whenſoeuer Chriſt caſt out one deuill,
we read that he caſt out al, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the legion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
ſo when thou caſteſt out one vice, caſt
out all, for one is not worthier than another.</p>
            <p>The Prophet doth teach vs to power out
our ſins like water which leaueth no taſte or
colour or ſent behinde. There is a whole old
man, and there muſt be a whole newe man.
The old man muſt change with the new man
wiſedome for wiſedome, loue for loue, feare
for feare, his worldlie wiſedome for heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
wiſedome, his carnall loue for ſpirituall
loue, his ſeruile feare for Chriſtian feare, his
idle thoughts for holy thoughtes, his vaine
wordes for wholeſome wordes, his fleſhlye
workes for righteous workes. This is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<hi>altogether,</hi> as if he were caſt in a newe
mould. As a Painter woulde drawe a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
picture which ſhould bee fairer than all
women in the worlde, hee would marke the
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:17992:439" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpeciall grace of euerie one, and make one
beautie of all: ſo we muſt make vp a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and take modeſtie from him, faith from
him, loue from him, patience from him, zeale
from him, and humility from him, vntill it be
like the Image of Chriſt. This is the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a Chriſtian. Firſt his foundation is
laide, and then his walles, and then his roofe,
and then a Chriſtian like <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note>
               <hi>God made all things good:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> therefore if we bee
but <hi>almost</hi> good, all thinges are better than
wee. The wicked man ſpeaketh out of the
corruption of his fleſhlie heart, and ſhall not
the righteous ſpeake of the aboundance of
his ſpirituall heart? Hee which is merrie
would be merrier if he knew how. He which
is enuious would looke ſterner if he could.
He which is proud, would goe brauer if hee
had it: and all if wee could bee worſe, wee
would, but let them amend which looke to
die. For what kinde of man ſhould hee bee
which muſt beare the Image of God, be the
Temple of the holie Ghoſt, and inherite the
kingdome of heauen? Who is fit for theſe
things (ſaith <hi>Paul?</hi>) Nay, who is fit for theſe
things? Do ye know no enough in riches, nor
pleaſure, nor ſinne, and thinke that you haue
enough of religion, before yee haue any? The
good are knowne becauſe none but they
which are good ſtriue to be better. Wee are
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:17992:439" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inuited to a banquet, &amp; ſhall we go but halfe
the way vnto it? Were it not better that the
fig-tree had borne fruites than leaues? that
the Virgins had carried oyle than lamps? So
is it not better for vs to be veſſels of gold that
come to the Lords table, than like the image
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> part of gold, part of ſiluer, part of
braſſe, part of iron, &amp; part of clay, which was
after broken? If the crowne did lie in the
midde way, then thou needeſt run but halfe
the way: but to ſhew that there is no reward
for them that begin well, all the promiſes are
made to him that continueth to the end. Hee
is curſed not onely which doth euill, but hee
which dooth the worke of the Lorde negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
or by halfes, that is, hee which offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a maymed ſacrifice for a ſound, <hi>almost</hi>
a Chriſtian, for <hi>altogether.</hi> Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi>
before hee prayes, ſummoneth his thoughts,
his ſpeeches &amp; actions, and ſaith: <hi>All that is
within mee praiſe the Lorde,</hi> as a man giueth
that which he thinketh wil be accepted, that
he may be welcome for it. If we did ſerue an
vngratefull maſter: then we might thinke <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi>
enough. But Chriſt did not loue <hi>almost,</hi>
when he ſhed his heart bloud for vs, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot aske more than he gaue, and
yet the inheritaunce of his bleſſings is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde:
why ſhouldeſt not thou giue as much
for them as <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Simeon,</hi>
               <pb n="948" facs="tcp:17992:440" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which would haue ſerued God till this time
if they had liued, &amp; ſtill reformed themſelues,
&amp; yet thought they had done nothing, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
counted his ſeruice for <hi>Rachel</hi> nothing,
becauſe he loued her: but thou thinkeſt that
if thou giueſt thy pleaſures, thou ſhalt want
thy pleaſures. No, as <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> did not loſe his
ſon when he would haue ſacrificed his ſonne,
ſo God can keepe his pleaſures when thou
reſigneſt thy pleaſures. Thou thinkeſt that
God will not miſſe it, as <hi>Ananias</hi> thought that
<hi>Peter</hi> woulde not miſſe it: but if <hi>Peter</hi> did
miſſe it, will not God miſſe it? So we pare the
offering like <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes, which kept the
beſt and fateſt to themſelues, which made
the people abhor the ſacrifices: and ſhall not
God abhor ſuch ſacrifices? If <hi>Ely</hi> reprooued
his ſons? how wil God reproue them, which
reproued <hi>Ely</hi> for not reprouing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enough?
A ſpirituall eare can heare GOD reprouing
this land, for this mincing of his worſhip.
Can the preaching of the word, the ſignes of
heauen, the ſhaking of the earth, the victorie
of your enemies, and all the bleſſings of God
make you but <hi>almoſt</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>almoſt</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
<hi>almoſt</hi> thankefull?</p>
            <p>Is this my reward (ſaith God) as though
you were afrayde to bee too good? If you
thinke that you ſhall bee mocked if you bee
too zealous, as <hi>Micholl</hi> ſcorned <hi>Dauid</hi> when
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17992:440" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he daunced before the Arke: <hi>Dauid</hi> tels you
how you ſhal ſtop ſuch ſcorners mouthes: O
(ſaith <hi>Dauid) I will be more humble yet before
my God.</hi> When <hi>Michol</hi> ſawe his reſolution,
ſhe mocked him no more, but reuerenced
him euer after. So tell the Diuell and all his
mockers, I wil be more zealous, more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and more holy yet, vntill I be like him which
ſaid, <hi>Follow me,</hi> and they which mocke thee
ſhall reuerence thee as <hi>Michol</hi> did <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This when thou art in the way to heauen,
remember that thou muſt goe forwarde or
backward: for <hi>Iacob</hi> did ſee none ſtand vpon
the ladder which aſcended vp to heauen, but
either thy went vp or down: they which go
not forward, go backward. They which will
not come ſo forward as <hi>altogether,</hi> ſhall not
ſtay at <hi>almoſt,</hi> but fal from their faith, &amp; loue,
and knowledge and zeale, by deſcents, till
Chriſtes threatning be fulfilled. <hi>That which
they ſeeme to haue ſhall be taken from them,</hi> as
though they neuer had any taſte at al.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue ſet you a glaſſe to beholde
whether you are in <hi>almoſt</hi> or <hi>altogether.</hi> Yet
<hi>Paul</hi> lured for <hi>Agrippa.</hi> Now he ſues to the
people. When he had caught the King, hee
ſpred his net for the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would to God, that not onely thou but all
that heare mee, were not onely almoſt, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as I am.</hi> Hee might wiſh rather than
<pb n="950" facs="tcp:17992:441"/>
hope and therefore hee praies, I would to
God that all were Chriſtians: As <hi>Moſes</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
that all coulde propheſie. <hi>Peter</hi> was
taught both to feede the ſheepe and the
lambs, great and ſmall, and old an young, rich and
poore: So <hi>Paul</hi> praies for the King and for
the people too, &amp; wiſheth that they were all
Chriſtians. This prayer we may ſay for them
that doe not praye for themſelues, to make
them aſhamed, when they ſee other more
careful for their ſoules than they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.
The Paſtours care extendeth to all, although
ſome are more to be laboured, yet none is to
be deſpiſed, which is but a lamb of the flock.
<hi>Paule</hi> doth not wiſh <hi>Agrippa</hi> more honour,
or more wealth, or more frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which is the greateſt want of Princes.
Although they haue receiued a kingdome,
yet they are not ſo thankfull, as they which
haue receiued nothing, but from hande to
mouth. Though they haue done a thouſand
times more euil, yet they are not ſo penitent
as he which hath done leaſt of all: They ſit
in Gods ſeat, &amp; are called Gods, but are not
like God, but like <hi>Mammon,</hi> more than their
names, and their Crownes, except <hi>Dauid,</hi> or
<hi>Salomon,</hi> or <hi>Ioſua,</hi> a fewe which remember
whoſe perſon they bear: the reſt are like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> which
know not from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their kingdoms come.</p>

               <hi>As I am,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> directly. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhoulde
haue replied, <hi>altogether a Chriſtian,</hi> and not
<hi>altogether as I am:</hi> but who ſhall teach the
Spirit to perſwade? Hee choſe to ſay, <hi>as I am</hi>
that <hi>Agrippa</hi> might ſee his ſingle heart and
loue toward him, who went not about to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him, but wiſht it vnto him as vnto him
ſelfe: <hi>Euen as I am.</hi> If any thing will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
moſt fit is the example, when he
which teacheth vs goes before vs, for then
we ſee that hee dealeth plainly, and ſpeakes
of loue, and meanes no deceit, when we ſee
him doe as he ſaith. <hi>Saul hath ſlaine his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
but Dauid his ten thouſand.</hi> So where
another conuerts a thouſand, hee ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
ten thouſand, which can ſay like Chriſt
<hi>Follow mee.</hi> Oh what is this when a Chriſtian
and I am all one, that ye might ſay to your
children, <hi>I woulde to God thou were a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
when you ſay, <hi>I woulde to God thou were
like me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The king ſhoulde bee like <hi>Paule</hi> by this
ſaying: How then doe ſome ſay with <hi>Feſtus?
Too much zeale hath made thee mad.</hi> If the
people know the Lords prayer, the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
&amp; the Articles of beleefe, it is
enough, is this to be like <hi>Paul?</hi> No <hi>Feſtus,</hi> the
knowledge of the word doth not make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
mad, but makes him wiſe to ſaluation. Can
that which makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſe, make him mad</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="952" facs="tcp:17992:442"/>
Therefore they which ſay that we are the
worſe for knowledge, or worſe for religion,
or worſe for zeale, are like <hi>Feſtus</hi> which had
neither knowledge, zeale, nor religion in
him. And they which teach the people that
they ſhall not neede to be as <hi>Paul,</hi> but that
a mediocritie will ſerue, incurre that curſe
of <hi>Paule: Hee which teacheth another doctrine
than that which yee haue receiued of vs (which
wiſhed all as perfect as himſelfe) Let him bee
Anathema,</hi> that is, accurſed. They which
loue you like <hi>Paul,</hi> doo not wiſh you zeale
by waight, and knowledge by ounces, and
workes by number, a Sicle, or an Omer, or
an Epha: but that yee abound in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and all zeale, and let them bee luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
which will be ſpued out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Except my bands:</hi> yet <hi>Paule</hi> excepteth
ſomthing, not his knowledge, nor his zeale,
but his bands, <hi>Not altogether as I am, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
as I am, except theſe bands.</hi> He excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing but his troubles. Charity had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuffer than other ſhould ſuffer, as <hi>Dauid</hi>
prayed God to turne his wrath from the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
vpon him. Now if yee aske me, who
can loue his neighbour as himſelfe? Heere is
one that had rather ſuffer himſelfe, than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
ſhould ſuffer: he would haue him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
in all his good, but not in his troubles:
<hi>As I am, except theſe bandes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="953" facs="tcp:17992:442"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> glories in his bands, and ſhewes his
chaynes like his Enſignes: theſe are the
markes of Chriſt: this is the cogniſance of
my Lord, his ſweete yoake and eaſie burden.
But he wiſheth faith to them without a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
the battaile is to the ſtrong &amp; the Croſſe
is not to be wiſhed for, but to be borne.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſpirit of wiſdome hath ſet vs an
example how men are wonne to the trueth,
and led forward by little and little with leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and ſoftnes, putting difference betweene
them which know not the trueth, and them
which reſiſt the trueth. <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſpeak ſo
to <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer which withſtood the
truth. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 16. But <hi>ſet his eyes vppon him</hi> &amp;
ſaid, <hi>O full of all ſubtiltie and miſchiefe, the
childe of the Diuell and enemie of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
Neither did <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak ſo to <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Act.</hi> 8. 23. But as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A wiſe
man knoweth the time and place,</hi> and as <hi>Paule</hi>
ſaith, <hi>the Spirituall man diſcerneth all things,</hi> ſo
he knoweth when to be ſoft and when to be
rough. They which reſiſt the truth as <hi>Elimas,</hi>
and labour to keepe the Rulers from it as
<hi>Elimas</hi> did <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Deputie of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> and many like him now, muſt not bee
intreated like <hi>Agrippa</hi> which is comming to
the truth, but as <hi>Elimas</hi> was. Hee which hath
<hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit knoweth how to handle both in
their kind. Though we may not diſcouer the

nakedneſſe of ſome, yet wee may not hide
the nakedneſſe of other: An humble heart is
a good Schoolmaiſter both to apply comfort

after he had ſhewed
what God had done for
them in receiuing them
into his couenant which
were out of his couenaunt, and making
them his people, which were not his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the Gentiles might triumph nowe
ouer the Iewes, as much as the Iewes trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
ouer the Gentiles, becauſe the Iewes
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:17992:444"/>
were reiected, and the Gentiles receiued in
their place. Nowe hee ſheweth what they
ſhould doe for God. <hi>Giue your bodies a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to him:</hi> that is, as Chriſt gaue himſelfe
for you, ſo you muſt giue your ſelues to him:
as he was ſacrificed for you, ſo you muſt bee
ſacrificed for him, not your ſheepe, nor your
Oxen, nor your Goates, but your ſelues. You
muſt be the Sacrifice: this Sacrifice, <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>a liuing, and holy, and acceptable ſacrifice,
a liuing ſacrifice, becauſe the Iewes ſacrifices
were dead ſacrifices: an holie ſacrifice, becauſe
they might ſacrifice beaſtes and not be holy:</hi> but
they cannot <hi>Sacrifice themſelues,</hi> but they
muſt needs be <hi>holy. An acceptable Sacrifice,</hi>
before the ſacrifices of beaſts did not pleaſe
God, vnleſſe they did <hi>ſacrifice themſelues too.</hi>
But if they <hi>ſacrifice themſelues</hi> it doth pleaſe
God, though they doe not ſacrifice beaſts. It
is true that God did require this ſacrifice of
the Iewes as well as the Gentiles, for in <hi>Deu.</hi>
the tenth Chapter and the ſixteenth verſe,
he ſaith, <hi>Circumciſe your heartes,</hi> &amp; in the firſt
of <hi>Samuel</hi> the 15. Chap. and 22. ver. he ſaith,
<hi>Obedience is better than ſacrifice,</hi> which ſhews,
that euen then God did require <hi>the ſacrifice of

the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 11.</note> becauſe a Chriſt ſaith, <hi>we haue
a greater light.</hi> The Goſpell is a greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
than the law, and therefore our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
ſhould be greater than theirs.</p>
            <p>Firſt here is an exhortation to <hi>ſacrifice our
bodies to God.</hi> Then an explication what this
ſacrifice is. <hi>It is your reaſonable ſeruice, and not
faſhioning your ſelues to the World: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
of your mindes to the image of GOD, in
which they were created.</hi> Then follow two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to perſwade, one drawn from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God:</hi> The other drawn from the fruit
of our regeneration, that ye may proue what
that <hi>good and acceptable, and perfect will of God
is.</hi> The exhortation is to ſacrifice our ſelues
to God. It ſeemes that the Iewes grudged
to ſacrifice their beaſter, therefore <hi>Paule</hi>
thought that the Gentiles would grudge to
ſacrifice themſelues, and therefore marke
how he prepared himſelfe for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren I heſeech you by the mercies of
GOD.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 1. 7.</note> This is his preparatiue, Firſt, hee
calles them <hi>Brethren,</hi> which ſhewes his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to all Chriſtians, which after Chriſt

by Chriſt which makes vs brethren.
Thirdlie the dutie which we owne one to an

do not vſe this name ſo lightly as we, as you
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:17992:445" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may ſee here, for <hi>Paul</hi> made it a preamble to

made it a mediatour to keepe peace
betweene <hi>Lot</hi> and him, <hi>Are we not brethren</hi>
ſaith <hi>Abraham?</hi> as if hee ſhoulde ſay, ſhall
brethren fall out for trifles like infidels. This
was enough to pacifie <hi>Lot,</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> to
put him in minde that they were brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3. 8.</note>
when hee hearde the name of brethren,
ſtraight his heart yeelded, and the ſtrife was
ended: ſo this ſhould bee the Lawyer to end
quarrels betweene Chriſtians, to cal to mind
that they are brethren. And they which haue
ſpent all at lawe, wiſht that they had taken
this Lawyer, to thinke with <hi>Lot</hi> whether it
were meete for brethren to ſtriue like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
with ſuch reuerence then they did vſe
the name of brethren, but nowe there is no
reuerence in naming of GOD: For manie
ſpeak of him when they do not think of him,
and many neuer ſpeake of him but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
ſweare by him.</p>
            <p>When he had called them brethren, then
he beſeecheth them, <hi>Brethren I beſeech you.</hi>
This is the Apoſtles ſtile. If God did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelfe for man, much more ſhould ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
humble himſelfe for men, therefore though
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake of a matter, wherein he might
commaunde, as he ſaith to <hi>Philemon I might
commaund thee:</hi> yet as he did rather <hi>beſeech
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:17992:445" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him,</hi> ſo he doth rather beſeech them. Marke
the ſubtiltie of wiſedome (as I may call it.)
As the ſerpent did vſe pollicie to tempt, ſo
the Preacher may vſe pollicie to conuert,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1.</note> and
ſo <hi>Paule</hi> won <hi>Agrippa</hi> to beleeue, by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him that he did beleeue.<note place="margin">Acts. 26. 27.</note> It was <hi>Pauls</hi>
Office to teach the <hi>Romans,</hi> but it was <hi>Pauls</hi>
pollicie to <hi>beſeech the Romans,</hi> vntill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
need, gentlenes is better than bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
Lenitie deſerues to goe firſt, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech you brethren,</hi> we doe not vſe to
intreat and beſeech, but for our profite, but
<hi>Paul</hi> did beſeech them for their profite. Wee
would haue other humble themſelues to vs,
but <hi>Paul</hi> humbled himſelfe to his inferiours,
to make them humble themſelues to God.
Here the Preachers may take example of the
Preacher of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13</note> the louing phraſe
is the Apoſtles phraſe, and hee which beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
ſhall perſwade eaſier than hee which
thundereth. Many haue beene drawn with
the cordes of loue, which coulde neuer bee
haled with the chaines of iron. God is loue,
and his Miniſters muſt ſpeake like loue or
elſe they doe not ſpeake like <hi>Paul:</hi> he which
fiſheth for ſoules and doth not take his Net,
ſhall fiſh all daie, as <hi>Peter fiſhed all night and

be a wiſe Preacher, and this be our pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
<pb n="960" facs="tcp:17992:446" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to intreat and beſeech you like <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> yet
you ſhould not looke to be intreated like the
gueſtes which woulde not come, but to bee
compelled like the gueſts which came to the
banquet: For you muſt be intreated to your
profit. It is no reaſon that Chriſt ſhould pay,
and pray: the ſeruant praieth, but the maiſter
commaundeth.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Paul</hi> hath not done his preparatiue:
hee is loth that his ſuite ſhoulde take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
and therefore he vſeth a <hi>Mediatour</hi>
vnto them: and beſeecheth them by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God. <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the
mercies of God:</hi> mercie is a louing ſoliciter
and worthy to be heard, becauſe it heareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
God doth intreate vs by the ſame
Mediatour that we intreat <hi>God,</hi> we intreate
<hi>God</hi> for his mercie, and <hi>God</hi> intreateth vs for
his mercie. So that mercie is like a ſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs, which calleth <hi>God</hi> to heare vs, and
vs to heare him. What will not a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
doo for a mercifull Prince? Many ſweet
things are in the worde of <hi>God,</hi> but the name
of mercy is the ſweeteſt word in all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which made <hi>Dauid</hi> harpe vpon it 26.
times in one <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſixe and twentie times
he repeats this in the hundred thirtie and ſixt
<hi>Pſalme, For his mercie endureth for euer.</hi> It
was ſuch a cheerefull note in his eares when
he ſtroke vpon <hi>mercie,</hi> that like a bird which
<pb n="961" facs="tcp:17992:446" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is taught to record, when he had ſung it, hee
ſang it againe, and when hee had ſung it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he recorded it againe, and made it the
burden of his ſong, <hi>For his mercie endureth for
euer.</hi> Like a Nightingale which when ſhe is
in a pleaſant vaine, quauers and capers, and
trebles vpon it, ſo did <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<hi>For his mercie endureth for euer.</hi> But heere
<hi>Paule</hi> ſpeakes in the plural number, <hi>not by the
mercie, but by the mercies of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a plurality of <hi>Gods mercies,</hi> his leſſer
mercies in his corporall bleſſinges, and his
greater mercies in his ſpirituall bleſſinges:
his temperall mercies in earth, and his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
mercies in heauen: his preuenting
mercies in deliuering vs from ſinne, and his
following mercies in pardoning of our ſinne.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
Howe many ſinnes came with <hi>Adam,</hi> and
howe many curſes came with ſinne, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
mercies came with Chriſt to anſwere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
both. Therefore when <hi>Paule</hi> coulde not
number them for multitude, hee was faine
to laie them downe together in the groſſe
ſumme, and in a word called them <hi>mercies:</hi>
as if hee ſhould ſaie, I cannot number the
mercies of God, but the leſſe I can number
them, the more they are. Thus much why
<hi>Paul</hi> calleth them brethren, and why he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth
them, and why hee remembreth
them of Gods mercies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="962" facs="tcp:17992:447" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now he hath prepared the way, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menceth
his ſuite, <hi>that they woulde giue their
bodies to God,</hi> hee ſpeakes not heere of the
ſoule, though he would haue them giue their
ſoules too. As you may ſee in the next verſe,
but he ſpeakes heere of the bodie, to ſhewe
that the bodie is a ſeruant to God as well as
the ſoule, both are too little, and therefore
one is not enough. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Glorifie GOD in your bodies and in your ſoules
too,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 20</note> but here he ſpeakes the rather of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
to ſhewe that their battaile will be with
the fleſhe, and that the fleſhe will be vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to this Sacrifice, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is willing but the fleſh is fraile.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 26. 43.</note> That is, the
fleſhe will not afforde anie thing to GOD,
though he do neuer ſo much for her, yet ſhe
is like churliſh <hi>Naball,</hi> which will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againe. Therefore the Apoſtle vrgeth
ſo to giue the body, as if he ſhould ſay, drawe
forwarde that which he draweth backeward,
and let the conuerſion beginne where ſinne
hath his roote: if you can winne the fleſhe
which is like <hi>Nabal,</hi> the ſoule will come like
<hi>Abigail,</hi> and bring her traine with her.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew how we ſhould <hi>giue our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to God,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>giue your bodies
a Sacrifice to God.</hi> That is, you muſt giue
your bodies to God,<note place="margin">Leuit. 1. 9. &amp;. 13.</note> as if you did Sacrifice
them: The Lawe appointed <hi>a Sacrifice, in
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:17992:447"/>
which all the members were offered together:</hi>
So yee muſt giue your members to God, for
the bodie is all, all is but partes of the bodie,
therfore if you muſt <hi>giue your bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> you muſt
geue eie, &amp; eare, &amp; tongue, &amp; hand, and feete
vnto him, <hi>For the heart</hi> (ſayth <hi>Paule) doth but
beleeue,</hi> becauſe it is not enough to <hi>beleeue,</hi>
therefore hee addeth, <hi>the mouth doth confeſſe</hi>
as it is as neceſſary to confeſſe vnto <hi>Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as to beleeue vnto <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> So it is as
neceſſary to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> the tongue as the heart.</p>
            <p>What then, is the tongue enough? Nay,
(ſayth Chriſt) <hi>hee which hath an eare to heare
let him heare.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 15</note> Is the eare enough? Nay,
(ſaith <hi>Dauid) Lift vp your handes to his San<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctuarie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 134 2.</note>
Is the hand enough? Nay, (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)
Let thine eyes beholde the right.</hi>

thy foote from euill.</hi> So the worde paſſeth like
a Collectour from one member to another,
to gather tribute for GOD, vntill the body
haue paied as well as the ſoule. Therefore in
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. GOD commaundeth, not onely
<hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord with all thy ſoule, &amp;
with all thy mind: but with all thy ſtrength</hi>
that is, if thou canſt doe any thing for him
with the ſtrength of thyne hand or the
ſtrength of thyne eie, or the ſtrength of thine
eare, or any part elſe: Thou art bound by this
commaundement, to doe it with all thy
<pb n="964" facs="tcp:17992:448"/>
ſtrength. Therefore when <hi>Dauid</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſeruice of God, he called al his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
together, ſummoning them like a Cryer,
<hi>All that is within me praiſe the Lorde.</hi> If eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
parte looke to be glorified of GOD, it is
reaſon that euery part ſhould glorifie him:
for this is all that they pay. As euery ſubiect
oweth loyaltie vnto his Prince: ſo euerie
member oweth a duety vnto his Creator.
The heart to loue him, the tongue to praiſe
him, the eye to marke him, the eare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, the hand to ſerue him, the foote
to followe him, and euery parte ſhoulde
ſerue GOD as it ſerueth vs: Nay, more
than it ſerueth vs, becauſe wee are bound
<hi>to loue GOD more than our ſelues:</hi> For it is
ſaide, <hi>Loue God aboue all:</hi> therefore we muſt
giue more to Gods deſire than to our owne
deſire.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath a parte in euery parte: Nay,
euery parte is his parte, becauſe hee gaue
all for all. Shall the hande ſaye to the heart,
<hi>ſerue thou him,</hi> or the heart ſay to the tongue,
<hi>ſerue thou him,</hi> or the tongue ſay to the eye,
<hi>ſerue thou him,</hi> or the eye ſay to the foote,
<hi>ſerue thou him?</hi> Nay, if Chriſt bee the head,
euery part will ſerue him, for all the bodie is
ruled by the head: and therefore if hee bee
the head, euery parte of the bodie will ſerue
him like a head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="965" facs="tcp:17992:448"/>
Nowe if you will knowe how euery part
may be a ſacrifice,<note place="margin">Luke. 1. 46.</note> thus it is. When thou
canſt ſay with the Virgin, <hi>Mine heart doth
magnifie the Lorde:</hi> then thine hearte is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God. When thou canſt ſaie with
<hi>Samuell: ſpeake Lorde for thy ſeruant heareth,</hi>
then thine eare is a ſacrifice to God.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 9.</note> When
thou canſt ſaie with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 11</note> 
               <hi>Mine eies are
euer towarde the Lorde,</hi> then thine eie is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
vnto God. When thou canſt ſay with
<hi>Dauid: All the daye long I ſtretch out mine
hand to thee,</hi> then thine handes are a ſacrifice
to GOD. When thou canſt ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 88. 9.</note>
as it appeareth in the 25. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and the
twelfth verſe: <hi>My foote ſtandeth in vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
then thy feete are a ſacrifice to God: So
at length by following of theſe examples, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
member is a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Hee which offereth this ſacrifice, is freely
excuſed of all ſacrifices beſides. For ſince
Chriſt ſacrificed himſelfe, God hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
none other ſacrifice of Iewes nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<hi>But that they ſacrifice themſelues.</hi> Nowe
when God doth require of thee to ſacrifice
thy bodie, he doth but require thee to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
the ſinnes of thy body, as you may picke
out of the next wordes, <hi>Be chaunged,</hi> that is,
chaunge thy thoughts, chaunge thy wordes,
chaunge thy workes: Let thy tongue ſpeake
no more idelly: Let thine eies looke no
<pb n="966" facs="tcp:17992:449"/>
more to vanitie: Let thine eares hearken no
more to folly: Let thine handes worke no
more iniquitie, and then thou haſt Sacrificed
thy bodie.</p>
            <p>This ſeemes a deare ſacrifice to ſacrifice
the bodie, yet thou ſeeſt it is but a cheape ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
for it is nothing but to ſacrifice thy
ſinnes, which woulde Sacrifice thee. If
GOD had required thee to Sacrifice thy
Sonne to him as hee required <hi>Abraham Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi>
the twentie two Chapter, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
verſe: Wouldeſt thou not giue him?
But nowe he requireth nothing of thee but
thy ſinnes, it is as if he ſhould ſue vnto thee
for thy ſhame, and thy trouble, and thy
guilt, and thy feare, that he might haue all
which hurtes thee. What wilt thou parte
from if thou wilt not part from thine hurte?
<hi>Therefore ſacrifice thy bodie,</hi> and thou haſt
Sacrificed all that hurts thee.</p>
            <p>Heere <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>alter,</hi> and we the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and the fire which kindleth it, <hi>the loue of
God,</hi> and the ſmoake which goeth vp, <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of our ſinnes,</hi> but a worldly man kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and a ſpirituall man reuiued, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
is ended.</p>
            <p>This ſacrifice goeth vnder three titles, <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
holie,</hi> and <hi>acceptable.</hi> Euerie one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
with the Apoſtle, that they ſhoulde
offer it: for in it is a holie ſacrifice, it cannot
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:17992:449"/>
but pleaſe, becauſe hee is holy which takes
it: in that it is a liuing ſacrifice, it cannot loſe
them any thing, becauſe there is no death
nor loſſe in it, as there was in the Iewes ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
in that it is an acceptable ſacrifice, it
muſt needs benefite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for when the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is <hi>accepted,</hi> the ſacrificer is <hi>accepted</hi> too:
as <hi>Abel</hi> pleaſed,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> when his ſacrifice pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is called a <hi>liuing ſacrifice,</hi> becauſe
the beaſts died, when they were ſacrificed,
but men liue when they are ſacrificed, nay
they die vnles they be ſacrificed. As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did not loſe his ſonne,<note place="margin">Gen 32.</note> when he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to ſacrifice him to God, ſo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not
loſe their pleaſures, when they ſacrifice the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to God. But as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He which leaueth
father or mother for me, ſhall receiue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
folde:</hi> So he which leaueth any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort for
God, ſhall receiue an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred comforts for it.
For Gods demands are not onely demands,
but gifts. Hee bids thee ſacrifice thy bodie,
that thou mighteſt partak the ſacrifice of his
body. Here then is but one Sacrifice for an
other, one body for another, a beggers body
for a Kings body: Well may he require a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſacrifice</hi> which hath giuen a dead ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 19.</note>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for vs, but hee deſireth not
our death, but our life, that we would ſerue
him with our life. It is called an <hi>holy ſacrifice,</hi>
becauſe <hi>our bodies are the temples of the holie
<pb n="968" facs="tcp:17992:450"/>
ghoſt</hi> that is, if they are not, they ſhoulde be
<hi>the Temples of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But as the <hi>Iewes</hi>
abuſed the Temple of ſtone, ſo we haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Temple of fleſh, and there is no waie
to make it holy againe but for the holy ghoſt
to dwell in it, that is to ſacrifice it to God, &amp;
then it is <hi>holie,</hi> becauſe as vertue came out of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to heale the womans diſeaſe, ſo holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
commeth out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to heale euerye
mans ſinnes, and then they are holie.</p>
            <p>As nothing dooth pleaſe vs, vnleſſe it bee
ſome waie like vs, and agreeable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
ſo nothing doth pleaſe God, but that
which is like God, therefore becauſe God is
holy, no ſacrifice doth pleaſe him, but the
holie ſacrifice, therefore <hi>holie</hi> goeth before
<hi>acceptable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 72.</note> to ſhewe that our ſacrifice is not
acceptable, vnleſſe it be holie. <hi>Aliniug, holy</hi>
and <hi>acceptable ſacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 It is called an acceptable ſacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no ſacrifice is ſo accepted, as when we
offer our ſelues. Therefore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uel</hi> ſaith, <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
is better than ſacrifice:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 5.</note> that is, it pleaſeth
God better than ſacrifice? Now if we muſt
ſacrifice to God, we ſhould doe as we doe to
<hi>Princes,</hi> that is, offer that which may be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 5.</note>
that we may be <hi>accepted</hi> for our gift:
or els better vndone than done. When <hi>Caine</hi>
had ſacrificed to God, becauſe his ſacrifice
was not <hi>accepted,</hi> therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith that
<pb n="969" facs="tcp:17992:450"/>
               <hi>his countenance was cast downe:</hi> but if wee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
our bodies, our countenance neede
not bee caſt downe: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>this
ſacrifice is accepted.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 18. 39</note> All other ſacrifices were
kindled with the fire of the Temple: but this
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> is like the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of <hi>Eliah,</hi> which
God kindled himſelf with fire from heauen,
and therefore this muſt needes bee accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which man doth not only offer, but God
himſelfe doth offer.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle endes our <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
with this clauſe <hi>acceptable,</hi> hee meaneth that
this ſhould be the leuell of all our thoughtes,
that whatſoeuer we thinke,<note place="margin">1. Chro. 17. 1. &amp; 16.</note> or ſpeake, or do,
bee <hi>acceptable</hi> and liking vnto God. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
thought to builde the Temple, but would
not builde it,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.</note> when <hi>Nathan</hi> tolde him that
<hi>God woulde not haue him builde it:</hi> As <hi>Ananias</hi>
would not baptize <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 13.</note> but did baptize him
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vnderſtood that God wold haue him
baptized:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> As <hi>Ioſeph</hi> would not take <hi>Mary</hi> to
wife, ſo long as he thought God did diſalow
his marriage, but did marry her when the
Angell told him that he ſhould marry her: ſo
a good man will doe nothing before he doe
conſult with Gods worde: all that hee doth
hee approueth vnto God before hee doe it,
if it bee not his Worde and Will, then hee
turneth backe, as if the winde and weather
were againſt him, alwayes refourming his
<pb n="970" facs="tcp:17992:451"/>
owne will to Gods will, that his thoughtes,
and wordes, and workes may bee <hi>acceptable.</hi>
If reaſon teach vs this, that when wee offer
vnto God, wee muſt giue him an <hi>acceptable
ſacrifice,</hi> an <hi>acceptable honour,</hi> an <hi>acceptable
ſeruice:</hi> then why doe we not giue him that
which he asketh, for he knoweth what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him. If he aske the firſt fruits, we
muſt not offer him the laſt fruites, for the firſt
is acceptable: So if he appoint his diſcipline,
we may not ſet vp our diſcipline, for that is
not acceptable to him, but to vs.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes what this Sacrifice is, <hi>it
is your reaſonable ſeruice of GOD,</hi> leſt they
ſhould grudge to ſacrifice their bodies, hee
ſheweth that he meaneth but the ſins of their
bodies. <hi>For this ſacrifice</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) is your
ſeruice, your reaſonable ſeruice.</hi> He calleth it <hi>a
reaſonable ſeruice,</hi> becauſe it is not in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
like the <hi>Iewes ſeruice,</hi> but in ſpirit (as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſaith:) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe it is that <hi>ſeruice,</hi> which
euery mans reaſon and conſcience doth tell
him that he oweth vnto God, wherefore it
may well be called <hi>a reaſonable ſeruice,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſo reaſonable. Therefore if we will
not ſerue God thus, that is, as our reaſon tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs: Then we ſerue him not like me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
like beaſts voide of reaſon, whome God may
be ſayd to rule, but they cannot be ſayd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
becauſe they are ruled perforce. All
<pb n="970" facs="tcp:17992:451" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinges doe yeeld a ſeruice to God, but <hi>all
things doe not yeeld a reaſonable ſeruice,</hi> which
he requireth of man: here was no reaſon why
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhoulde ſerue vs, but there is greate
cauſe why we ſhould ſerue <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he
ſerued vs without cauſe, ſo that I may ſaie,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> requireth but <hi>a reaſonable ſacrifice,</hi>
for <hi>an vnreaſonable ſacrifice, a liuing ſacrifice,</hi>
for <hi>a dead ſacrifice, a cheape ſacrifice,</hi> for <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſacrifice,</hi> counting vs as it were like the
poore widdowe, of whome he is content to

much of our reaſonable ſeruice.</p>
            <p>The law of this ſeruice is laid down in theſe

               <hi>but I</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi>

the wicked are moſt common,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 23.</note> like a

the Deuill is called <hi>the God of this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note>
becauſe the worldes faſhions are the Deuils
<pb n="972" facs="tcp:17992:452" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faſhions, <hi>Therefore faſhion not your ſelues vnto
the world,</hi> leſt you bee in the Diuels faſhion.
Then you muſt not pranke vppe your ſelues
like Plaiers, for this is the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world:
then you muſt not reſpect perſons more than
iuſtice, for this is the faſhion of the worlde:
Then you muſt not flatter to Pleaſe, for this is
the faſhion of the world: Then you muſt not
deceiue to grow rich, for this is the faſhion of
the world, then you muſt not ſeeke reuenge
for euery word, for this is the faſhion of the
world, then you muſt not take ſcorne to bee
tolde of your faultes, for this is the faſhion of
the world, then you muſt not giue almes to
be ſeene, for this is the faſhion of the world,
then you muſt not obey for feare of the law,
for this is the faſhion of the world, then you
muſt not receiue the ſacrament for order, for
this is the faſhion of the worlde, then you
muſt not come to church for cuſtom, for this
is the faſhion of the worlde, then you muſt
not make religion but a table talke, for this is
the faſhion of the world, then you muſt not
turne with the time, for this is the faſhion of
the world, then you muſt not deferre to doe
good till you die, for this is the faſhion of the
worlde. The worlde is a badde patterne to
followe, becauſe as the fleſh followeth the
deuill: ſo the worlde followeth the fleſhe.
Therefore ſaie no more wee muſt doe as the
<pb n="973" facs="tcp:17992:452" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worlde doth, but rather we muſt not doe as
the world doth. You ſay you go ſo, becauſe
it is the faſhion, God ſaith <hi>goe not ſo,</hi> becauſe
it is the faſhion. If you come but in the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you ſhall bee in the abuſe: There is no
man that weareth the cutters faſhion, but he
is a cutter, none which cutteth his haire like
them which are proud, but he is proud: none
that coloureth her face like them which are
wanton, but ſhee is wanton: none which
ſweareth like them which lie, but hee will lie
as well as ſweare.</p>
            <p>Therefore make not your life of the
worldes faſhion,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> the <hi>wedding garment</hi> was
of an other faſhion than all the reſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou faſhioneſt they ſelfe like the reſt,
thou haſt not on thee the wedding garment,
for this was nothing like vnto the reſte.<note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 23</note>
Chriſtes garment was of another manner of
faſhion differing from the worlde, ſo thy
life muſt bee of another faſhion than the
worldes: or elſe as the faſhion of the worlde
paſſeth away, ſo thou ſhalt paſſe and periſh
with it. God doth not like the faſhion of the
worlde and ſurelie he liketh as ill the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Idolatrie, or the faſhion of Antichriſt,
as the faſhion of the worlde. He which bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs <hi>to refraine from euerie ſhewe of euill:</hi>
would haue vs refraine from the ſhewe of

<pb n="974" facs="tcp:17992:453" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are the greateſt euils. But if we bee not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours,
yet we haue the ſhewe of Idolatry.
If wee bee not of Antichriſtes religion, yet
we bee of Antichriſtes faſhion, ſo long as
wee ſhew foorth the ſame badge, and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
you know what I meane. This is to
iumpe with the world and leape to hell. This
is not to be in faſhion, but out of faſhion,
therefore nowe yee ſhall heare the beſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.
It followeth, <hi>Be you changed, by the
renewing of your mindes.</hi> This is the ſecond
part of your reaſonable ſeruice: <hi>The chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and renewing of the minde to the likeneſſe
wherein it was created.</hi> As before he required
you to giue your bodies, ſo here hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
you <hi>to giue your mindes.</hi> Outwarde ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
is like a tinckling Cimball, though it

but it pleaſeth not God.</p>
            <p>The body is a ſeruant as well as the ſoule,
but there is no promiſe made to the bodilie

heart was like an old garment ſo rotten and
tattered, that he coulde make no good of it
by patching and peecing, but muſt euen caſt
it off, and take a newe. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Caſt off the olde man:</hi> Not pick him and waſh
him till hee bee cleane, but caſt him off, and
begin a new as <hi>Dauid</hi> did. Wil yee knowe
what this renewing is? It is the repairing of
the Image of God, vntill we bee like <hi>Adam</hi>
when hee dwelt in Paradiſe: As there is a
whole olde man, ſo there muſt bee a whole
<pb n="976" facs="tcp:17992:454"/>
new man, the olde man muſt chaunge with
the new man, wiſedome for wiſedome, loue
for loue, feare for feare, his worldy wiſedome
for heauenly wiſedome, his carnall loue for
ſpirituall loue, his ſeruile feare for Chriſtian
feare, his idle thoughts, for holie thoughts,
his vaine wordes for holeſome wordes, his
fleſhly works for ſanctified works.</p>
            <p>If the minde muſt be ſo renewed, I would
know of the Papiſts where are their pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals,
if our naturals were pure, our mindes
neede not to bee renewed, for it is good to
bee pure, and euill to change it: but becauſe
there is no purenes in vs, therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
would haue vs changed. Againe, let
them tell me why our mindes ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
if we haue free will to doe good if
wee liſt: But becauſe our mindes are ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
that wee haue no free will to good,
nor will to doe good neither, therefore the
Apoſtle would haue our mindes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.
Thus one word of
God hath battered
two Caſtles of
Antichriſt.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt of the Preface, and
then of the counſell. In
the firſt verſe of this
Chapter, <hi>Paule</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the <hi>Romanes, by the
mercie of GOD towardes
them,</hi> heere hee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them <hi>By the grace of GOD towardes
him. Paul</hi> ſpeakes like a man in his deathbed.
which is ſet to giue good counſel, and goeth
from one leſſon to another, as though hee
would ſpeake al with a breath. Firſt he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
them to make their bodies ſerue God,
becauſe the bodie is a ſeruant as well as the
<pb n="978" facs="tcp:17992:455"/>
ſoule, then he forbad them to <hi>faſhion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the worlde, becauſe no man can ſerue
two contrarie maiſters.</hi> Then he aduiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
<hi>renew their mindes,</hi> becauſe except the minde
be reformed, the body will ſerue but a while.
And he ſetteth them to ſeeke Gods will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the will of man doth ſeduce him. And
now to make vp this Teſtament (as it were)
hee admoniſheth them to reſt in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods will, and not to ſearch further
nor to be proud of their knowledge, but to
vſe their knowledge to humble their pride.
This leſſon may ſeeme vaine to the <hi>Romanes:</hi>
for they were not yet come to be wiſe, and he
councelleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not <hi>to be too wiſe. Paule</hi> ſaith;
<hi>That the Gentiles ſought after wiſedome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 22</note> but
he ſaith there, <hi>That the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
ſeemed fooliſhnes vnto them,</hi> which was
wiſdom: &amp; therefore God calleth them <hi>a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
nation,</hi> becauſe they counted the true
wiſedome fooliſhnes,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 21.</note> and their owne follie
wiſedome. For this cauſe there was ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
between the Iew and the Gentile,
one deſpiſed another, becauſe they did not
accorde what wiſedome was, although both
ſought for it. Therefore that ye may not only
ſeeke wiſdome as the Gentiles did, but finde
wiſedome as <hi>Salomon</hi> did,<note place="margin">A word of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> laieth a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for wiſedome to ſtay vpon, which he
cals <hi>Sobrietie.</hi> Be wiſe according to <hi>Sobrietie,</hi>
               <pb n="979" facs="tcp:17992:455" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is this, <hi>By the grace of GOD which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to me.</hi> Becauſe he ſpeakes to all, and his
charge is of great moment, and they which
thinke themſelues wiſe, will hardly bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
but that they are wiſe: therefore he
comes with authoritie like an ambaſſadour
from GOD, and ſaith, <hi>By the grace of GOD
which is giuen to mee,</hi> that is, by the vertue of
mine Apoſtleſhip, which I haue not receiued
from men, but from GOD, nor from earth
but from heauen, <hi>I charge you that no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you,</hi> whether he be learned or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whether he bee an hearer or a teacher,
<hi>preſume to knowe aboue that which is meete to
knowe:</hi> that is, make himſelfe wiſer than he
is, or boaſt of the graces which GOD hath
giuen him, or deſpiſe the giftes of God in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or rome beyond his calling, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his head with curioſities, but <hi>that hee bee
wiſe according to ſobrietie,</hi> that is, walke
within his vocation, be humble in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and vſe his gifts to the profite of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>as GOD hath giuen to euery man the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of faith:</hi> that is, remembring that it is a
gift of God, which hath dealt gifts to other
as well as to him, that they might doe him
good, as he may do them good, ſo that if you
aske <hi>Paul</hi> as the Iewes asked Chriſt, <hi>By what
authoritie doeſt thou this?</hi> he ſheweth his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents from the King himſelfe, <hi>by the
<pb n="980" facs="tcp:17992:456"/>
Grace of God, &amp;c.</hi> Well doth he call his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip
<hi>the grace of God:</hi> for he was a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
of the ſame doctrine which hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and therefore if it had not beene Gods
meruailous grace, he ſhould neuer haue bin
an Apoſtle. It was as ſtraunge to heare that
perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Apoſtles,
as to heare that King <hi>Saule</hi> was among the
Prophets,<note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> but <hi>by the grace of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>)
ſo it is. I did not vſurpe this calling, but it was
giuen me. I came not from men, as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when I perſecuted, but I am ſent from
God. do not count mine office a labour or a
burden, but I eſteeme it a grace, <hi>The grace of
God both to me and to you.</hi> By this <hi>Paule</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs to receiue the miniſterie of the worde
as a <hi>grace from God:</hi> For if <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeake by
grace, then you heare by grace, as hee ſaid,
<hi>I ſpeake by the grace of God which is giuen to
me:</hi> ſo you may ſay, <hi>Wee heare by the grace of
God which is giuen to vs:</hi> and therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
you, as he did the <hi>Corinthians. Receiue
not the grace of God in vaine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now to his counſell: <hi>Let no man preſume
to vnderſtand aboue that which is meete to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
but let euery man vnderſtand accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ſobrietie.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
of things meete to vnderſtand, he ſignifieth,
that it is not meete to ſearch all things. It
ſeemes that many among the <hi>Romanes</hi> were
<pb n="981" facs="tcp:17992:456" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſicke of our diſeaſe, which is, to thinke our
ſelues wiſer than we are: therefore he which
taught them to bee wiſe in all his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
before, teacheth them here not to bee
ouerwiſe, <hi>but ſober wiſe.</hi> As God appointeth
the Iewes a meaſure, howe much <hi>Manna</hi>
they might gather, ſo <hi>Paule</hi> appointeth
the Romanes a meaſure, howe much wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
they might gather. The Iewes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Manna</hi> was ſo much as an <hi>Homer</hi>
would hold, the Romans meaſure of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is ſo much as <hi>ſobrietie</hi> woulde holde.
For as the <hi>Manna</hi> which the Iews gathered
ouer an <hi>Homer</hi> did them no good but mold
and fuſte: ſo the wiſedome which men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more than <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> doth no good, but
puffe them and corrupt them, and turne
them either into pride, or into enuie, or into
wiles, or into ſtrife, or one cogitation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as their ſuperfluous <hi>Manna</hi> turned into
wormes: When <hi>Paule</hi> entred into this ſage
doctrine, which I may call the lopping or
pruning of wiſedome, which muſt bee kept
lowe, like a man which is giuen to be purſie
and groſſe, hee ſummoneth all ſorts of men
to heare him, as though he ſpake of a faulte,
like the darkeneſſe of <hi>Aegipt</hi> which went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the whole land: therefore hee exceptes
no calling nor perſon, but crieth, <hi>I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euerie one, &amp;c.</hi> The wiſe and the auncient
<pb n="982" facs="tcp:17992:457" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the learned are to learne this leſſon.
<hi>One thing is behinde ſaith Chriſt to him which
thought be had done all:</hi> So one thing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
to him which thinkes that he knoweth
al. Art thou wiſe? be not too wiſe like thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Eue,</hi> which would knowe as much as
God. <hi>Paul</hi> hath two ſuites to moue vnto you,
The firſt is,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 7.</note> that ye would be wiſe, the other
is, that yee would not bee too wiſe, for too
good (we ſay) is ſtarke naught: So he which
is too wiſe, is a verie foole. Nay (ſaith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
there is more hope of a foole, than of him
which is wiſe in his owne conceit:</hi> there is hope
of a foole that he may be wiſe, becauſe he wil
heare inſtruction, but of him which is wiſe in
his owne conceit, there is no hope to make
him wiſe, becauſe hee thinketh he knoweth
that which he ſhould learne. For this cauſe
Chriſt pronounced his woes to the Phariſies,
and his doctrines to the people: <hi>Becauſe the
whole</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>haue no neede of a Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
that is, they that thinke themſelues wiſe
like the Phariſies, thinke they haue no need
of a teacher, and therefore Chriſt did not
teach them, but rate them, and teach them
which did not thinke themſelues wiſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we will be Chriſts ſchollers, we muſt
be <hi>Paules</hi> ſchollers, that is, <hi>Preſume to know
no more than is meet to know,</hi> and then he will
teach vs as much as is meet to knowe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="983" facs="tcp:17992:457"/>
There is as much need to warne men with
<hi>Paule, that they be not ouer wiſe, as to warne
them with</hi> Salomon, <hi>to ſeeke wiſedome,</hi> for
there is an errour of the left hand,<note place="margin">Prou. 4.</note> and of the
right hand. A man may bee as well too wiſe
as too ſimple, too carefull as too careleſſe,
too haſtie as too ſlacke, and therefore <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Turne not to the left hand, nor to
the right.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 4. 27.</note> And againe, <hi>Be not too iust, neither
make thy ſelfe too wiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 18.</note> And againe, <hi>If thou
haue found honie, eat not too much.</hi> All which
places doe ſhew,<note place="margin">Pro. 25. 16.</note> that men are giuen to ouer
reach, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> which when he had heard
God, would needs ſee him too, which was
not poſſible for man to beholde. This is the
laſt ſleight of Satan when hee cannot keepe
men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge, then he caſteth how to
puffe them vp with their knowledge, which
makes them as vaine, as ignorance made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
before. <hi>Feſtus</hi> did not apply truely, when he
ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> that <hi>too much learning had made</hi> Paule
<hi>mad:</hi> but it is true, that too much learning
hath made other mad, &amp; would haue made
<hi>Paul</hi> mad too, if he had beene as proud of his
learning, as <hi>Feſtus</hi> was of his honor: &amp; for all
that hee was an Apoſtle, yet it beganne to
worke vpon him:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> As he ſaith, <hi>I was almoſt
puft vp with the multitude of reuelations,</hi> hee
was not <hi>wiſe aboue ſobrietie,</hi> but he was <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
wiſe aboue ſobrietie.</hi> And therefore hee
<pb n="984" facs="tcp:17992:458" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might well ſound the retire of wiſedome:</p>
            <p>Looke to your wiſedome, and learning,
and knowledge, for I my ſelfe was almoſt
puft vp with it. If <hi>Paule</hi> might learne his
owne leſſon, then it is like that none heere
haue learned it. The Scribes and Phariſies
did not come to Chriſt, as the people came
to <hi>Iohn</hi> to aske, <hi>Maiſter what ſhall wee doe?</hi>
But theſe <hi>Rabbies</hi> might haue come to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
as well as there ſchollers came to Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
to whom hee would haue aunſwered
like <hi>Paul, Be wiſe vnto ſobrietie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiue things in my iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, are to be noted
in theſe wordes. The firſt is, that wiſedome
is a thing to be deſired, for when hee ſaith,
<hi>not aboue ſobrietie,</hi> hee woulde haue vs wiſe
<hi>within ſobrietie.</hi> The ſecond is, that euerie
man affecteth a kinde of wiſedom, <hi>either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ſobrietie,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> counſelled the
<hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>aboue ſobrietie,</hi> as the <hi>Romanes</hi>
did before. The third is, few are wiſe, as God
counteth wiſedome, &amp; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to all, as though all were to learne this
leſſon. The fourth is, that <hi>ſobrietie</hi> doth ſhew
like a glaſſe who are wiſe, and who are not
The laſt is, that the wiſedome which goeth.
beyond <hi>ſobrietie,</hi> doth hurt him which hath
it, and other. For when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>be wiſe to
ſobrietie,</hi> he implieth that who is not ſo, is in a
kind of diſtemperature, like one ſcarſe ſober.
<pb n="985" facs="tcp:17992:458" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As the meate which is not digeſted with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
doth rumble in the ſtomacke: So the
knowledge which is not digeſted with <hi>ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,</hi>
troubleth the braine.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt point, the forbidden
tree ſeemed to <hi>Eue</hi> a tree to bee deſired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it would teach them knowledge. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taught her that knowledge was a thing
to be deſired: Though the Serpent pointed
her to a wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tree. For in deed the tree of life
was the tree of knowledge. and when they
went to the other tree, they chaunged their
knowledge for ignorance,<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 7.</note> as they chaunged
their holines for wickednes. Beſide all other
vertues are called wiſedome, to ſhewe that
wiſdome is <hi>the bond of vertues,</hi> and as much
to be deſired as all the reſt. Beſide, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is called wiſedome,<note place="margin">Prou. 5. 7.</note> to ſhew, that in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we can come neerer God, than in the
ſtudie of wiſedome. Beſide, the word, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and the miniſterie, are all appointed to
teach wiſedome, becauſe other thinges are
not ſo neceſſarie,<note place="margin">Prou. 2. 15.</note> therefore they haue not ſo
many ſchool-maſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking of wiſedome, preferreth
it before ſiluer, to ſhew, that wee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it before ſiluer: then before gold, to ſhew
that we ſhould deſire it before gold: then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
precious ſtones, to ſhew that we ſhould
deſire it before precious ſtones. Therfore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
               <pb n="986" facs="tcp:17992:459" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prayed for wiſdome, and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for wiſdome, &amp; the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
for wiſedome, to ſhew that wiſedome
will requit all the laboures and paines that
are taken for her. As wiſedome is excellent
aboue all, ſo it is affected of all, as oyle was,
both of the wiſe Virgins and the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins:
Nay, the verie name to be wiſe, is ſo
plauſible, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſought
after wiſedome, they whome God called a
fooliſh nation,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 22</note> 
               <hi>The fooliſh nation</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul)
ſought after wiſdome,</hi> though hee doe not ſay
that they found wiſdome.<note place="margin">Deu. 32. 2.</note> And in the ſecond
of <hi>Mathew</hi> we find, that the Gentiles called
thoſe men that were ſingular amongſt them,<note place="margin">Math. 2.</note>
by the name of <hi>wiſe-men,</hi> as we call them <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men</hi>
which are fingular amongſt vs, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>wiſe-men</hi> ſhould be <hi>noble-men,</hi> or <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men</hi>
ſhould bee <hi>wiſe-men,</hi> according to
the ſaying of <hi>Dauid:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Beewiſe yee which iudge
the earth.</hi> And likewiſe in <hi>Paul,</hi> we read that
they which neuer knew what wiſdom ment,
yet named themſelues Philoſophers:<note place="margin">Col. 2. 8.</note> that is
<hi>Louers of wiſdome,</hi> as though there were ſuch
a thing behinde which all men ſhould loue.
Thus wiſdome hath beene a marke, which
euerie man hath ſhotte at, euer ſince <hi>Eue</hi>
ſought to bee as wiſe as her maker. But as an
hundred ſhoote, and not one hit the white: ſo
ſome come ſhort of wiſdome, and ſome flie
<pb n="987" facs="tcp:17992:459" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ouer, and ſome goe beſide, like the arrowes
which <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſhot at <hi>Dauid.</hi> Therefore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
ſpeaking of wiſe men ſaieth, <hi>I haue
ſcarce found one among a thouſand.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 71. 30</note> Therefore
<hi>Paule</hi> makes a generall charge, <hi>Iſaie to euery
one, be wiſe according to ſobrietie,</hi> as though
euerie one had too much wiſedome, or too
little. Vertue is a meane betwixt two vices,
which couch ſo cloſe beſide her, that one can
ſcarſe ſee her. <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> on the one ſide,
and <hi>prodigalitie</hi> on the other ſide, and <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
in the middeſt: <hi>pride</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie</hi>
on the other ſide, &amp; <hi>comelines</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt:
<hi>Flaterie</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>malice</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, and loue in the middeſt: <hi>carefulnes</hi>
one the one ſide, <hi>careleſnes</hi> on the othe ſide, &amp;
<hi>diligence</hi> in the middeſt: <hi>difference</hi> on the one

midſt: <hi>ignorance</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>curioſity</hi> on
the other ſide, and <hi>knowledge</hi> in the middeſt.
So that there is but one vertue ſtill for two
vices, therefore extremities beare rule in this
world. Either we crie <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> or elſe <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fige,</hi>
either Chriſt muſt not waſhe our feete,

eate and drinke for to morrowe we ſhall die.</hi> If
we loue, we do ouer-loue, if we feare, we doe

The firſt bleſſing which Chriſt pronounced
to anie,<note place="margin">Mark 3.</note> is to the poore in ſpirite. As <hi>Paule</hi>
woulde haue you rich in knowledge: ſo
Chriſt woulde haue you poore in ſpirite, that

the people their boundes, which they

in the Mount: ſo he hath appointed certaine
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:17992:461" rendition="simple:additions"/>
precinctes of wiſedome, which when wee

The Rayle or Pale of wiſedom is <hi>Sobrietie.</hi>
As wiſedome is made ouerſeer of all other
vertues, ſo <hi>Sobrietie</hi> is made ouerſeer of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to meaſure it foorth in euen portions
and due reaſons, that none of Gods gifts be
loſt, as water is vnto the wine, to delaie the
heate of it, and ſalt is to meate, to make it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie:
So <hi>Sobrietie</hi> is to wiſedom, to make
it wholeſome and profitable to him which
hath it, and them which ſeeke it of him. <hi>If
thou haſt found honie</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) take not

               <note place="margin">Pro. 25. 15</note> Nay if thou haue

               </gap>aſe, when they murmured againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
becauſe they thought themſelues fitter
to gouerne than hee. No vertue is better
than wiſedome and humilitie, but if a man
bee proude of his wiſedome and humilitie:
then the vertue is turned into a vice. <hi>If the

is that darkenes?</hi> So if our humilitie be pride,
howe great is that pride? If our knowledge
<pb n="992" facs="tcp:17992:462" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ignorance, how great is that ignorance?
Therefore as we remember, <hi>Bewiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents:</hi>
ſo let vs remember, <hi>Be ſimple as Doues,</hi>
or elſe we drowne in our wiſedome, like a

            <p>Nowe that yee may knowe howe to bee
wiſe according to <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> there be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
properties of his ſober wiſedome,
which I will ſhewe you. The firſt, is not to
arrogate to our ſelues more than GOD hath
giuen vs. As the man ſaide, <hi>I beleeue, Lorde
helpe my vnbeleefe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fiue marks of a wiſe man.</note> So the wiſe man may
ſaie, I vnderſtande, Lorde, helpe mine ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:
For one thing which wee knowe,
wee are ignorant of a thouſande thinges
which we ſhoulde knowe: yet the fooliſh
virgins woulde be thought as wiſe as their

            <p>No man can abide to be diſgraced of his

As euerie birde thinkes her owne birdes
faireſt: ſo euerie man thinkes his owne wit
ripeſt.<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 12.</note> 
               <hi>There is a generation</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon)
which are pure in their owne conceipt, but they
are not cleanſed from their filthines:</hi> So there
is a generation, which are wiſe in their owne
conceipt, but they are not cleanſed from
their fooliſhnes.</p>
            <p>There is a generation of ſuch wiſe men:
but he which is wiſe in deed ſaith, <hi>I am more
<pb n="993" facs="tcp:17992:462" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fooliſh than any man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 2.</note> He which is called <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29</note> 
               <hi>Learne of me to be humble.</hi> And hee
which was counted <hi>the wiſeſt man before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 12. 3.</note>
is called <hi>the mideſt man vpon the earth.</hi>
Therefore <hi>Iames</hi> deſcribing the wiſedome
which is from aboue, ſaith, <hi>that it is a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
wiſdome:</hi> the gentle are not arrogant but
the ſcornefull.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propertie is not to glorie of
any thing in our ſelues, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let
him which is merrie ſing Pſalmes:</hi> So <hi>Paule</hi>
ſaieth, <hi>Let him which glorieth, glorie in the
Lorde:</hi> For as wee ſaie, <hi>Thine is the kingdome,</hi>
ſo wee ſay, <hi>Thine is the glorie:</hi> and therefore
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not vnto mee Lord, not vnto mee,
&amp;c.</hi> Oh (ſaith Sathan) this is a thing to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of, knowledge and learning and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or els what ſhould a man bee proude
of? But when Chriſt heard his diſciples glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that they had the gift of miracles, which
is a greater matter than knowledge: yet hee
ſaid, <hi>Glorie not in this that yee can worke myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
therefore glory not in this, that ye know
him which can worke miracles. If thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
be giuen thee, then thou haſt receiued
it, if thou haſt receiued it, then I ſay with
<hi>Paule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Why doeſt thou glorie, as if thou hadſt
not receiued it?</hi> Wiſedome is not ſo baſe a
thing that thine owne glorie ſhould be the
ende of it: but as <hi>Heſter</hi> thought <hi>that her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="994" facs="tcp:17992:463" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was giuen her for the glorie of God,</hi> ſo the
learned ſhoulde thinke that their learning is
giuen them for the glorie of God, the rich
ſhoulde thinke that their riches are giuen
them for the glorie of God, the wiſe ſhould
thinke that their wiſdome is giuen them for
the glorie of God: the value and praiſe and
honour of wiſedome is to doe good, if we be
wiſe to doe euill, wee are not as wiſe as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
but wiſe ſerpents.</p>
            <p>The third propertie is not to deſpiſe other:
therefore <hi>Iames</hi> calleth the true wiſedome
a peaceable wiſedome,<note place="margin">Iames. 3.</note> becauſe it makes no
ſtrife, as hee which had fiue talents, did not
diſdaine him which had but one, ſo they
which haue moe giftes ſhould not contemne
them which haue fewe: For as the Vnicorne
dooth more good with one horne than other
beaſts do with two, ſo ſome man doth more
good with one gift, than other do with fiue,
becauſe they choake them with pride. When
the Phariſie ſaid, I am not like this Publican
hee ſaid true, for then hee was not like the
Publican in deede, becauſe the Publican was
better than he.</p>
            <p>The fourth propertie is to keepe within
our calling, he which medleth with that hee
hath not to doe, is compared to one that cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
a dogge by the eares, and dare neither
hold him ſtill, nor let him go, ſo he can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="995" facs="tcp:17992:463" rendition="simple:additions"/>
go forward for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of skil, nor backward
for ſhame. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, hee was ſet a part to
preach the Goſpell, ſo to euerie worke God
hath ſet ſome men apart, and fitted them to
that work, as he did <hi>Bezalred</hi> to the building
of the tabernacle, &amp; therfore vnles a man ſet
himſelfe apart to this worke, he ſhould think
of <hi>Peter,</hi> which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſtroke with the ſword
was bid to put vp his ſworde againe, for the
ſworde was not committed to him, but the

               </gap>eies. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. we finde <hi>Ioſua</hi> fighting,

vp his hands, ſo euery man ſhould haue
a ſeuerall worke. God hath giuen certaine
gifts to certaine callings, as no man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
his gifts, ſo no man ſhould exceed his
calling. It is not meet that he ſhould be a free
man, which was neuer a prentiſe, nor that
he ſhould leape into <hi>Moſes</hi> chayre, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſat at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feete: If thou doeſt neuer
ſo well, and be not called to it, the Scripture
ſaith ſtraight, <hi>Who hath required this of thee?</hi>
thou art an vſurper of anothers Office. A
foole (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) is medling, ſhewing
that a wiſe man medleth not, but where he
hath to doe. Wee are compared to a bodie,
ſome men are like the head, and they muſt
rule: ſome are like the tongue, and they muſt
teach: ſome are like the hand, and they muſt
worke: when this order is confounded, then
<pb n="996" facs="tcp:17992:464" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that commeth to paſſe which wee reade of
<hi>Eue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
               <hi>When the woman would lead her husband,
both fell into the ditch.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> Therefore as Chriſte
ſaide, <hi>Who hath made me a iudge ouer you?</hi> ſo
they which are not Iudges ſhould ſay, who
hath made me a Iudge? he which is not a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
ſhould ſay, who hath made mee a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?
hee which is not a ruler ſhoulde ſaye,
who hath made me a ruler? And this is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
peacemaker than the Lawier.</p>
            <p>The firſt propertie is not to bee curious in
ſearching myſteries: this <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſaith, let no man preſume to vnderſtand,
aboue that which is meet to vnderſtand: the
ſtar when it came to Chriſt ſtood ſtil &amp; went
no further, ſo when wee come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt, we ſhould ſtand ſtill &amp; go no
further: for <hi>Paule</hi> was content to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Chriſt crucified: It is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to know that which God hath not reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the well of Gods ſecrets is ſo deepe,
that no bucket of man can ſound it: therfore
we muſt row in ſhallow waters, becauſe our
boats are light &amp; ſmall, &amp; ſoone ouerturned.
They which haue ſuch crotchets and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in their braine, I haue marked this in
them, that they ſeldome find any roome for
that which they ſhould knowe, but goe too
and fro, ſeeking and ſeeking like them which
ſought <hi>Elias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> bodie and found it not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="997" facs="tcp:17992:464" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Let men deſire knowledge of God, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
did, but not deſire knowledge as <hi>Eue</hi>
did. For theſe aſpiring wits fall againe like
Babell, and run into doubts, while they ſeek
for reſolutions. As the Iewes when they
hard the Apoſtle preach, burnt their curious
bookes, and had no more delighte to ſtudie
ſuch toyes, ſo as men come to the truth, they
are content to leaue theſe fancies, and ſay
with <hi>Paule, I knowe nothing but Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
Curious queſtions and vaine ſpeculations
are like a plume of fethers, which ſome will
giue any thing for, and ſome will giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for. <hi>Paule</hi> rebuked them which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
their heades about Genealogies, howe
would he reproue men and women of our
daies, if he did ſe how they buſie their heads
about vaine queſtions, tracing vpon the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
where they may fal, while they might
walke vpon the pauement without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
Some haue a great deale more deſire to
learne where hell is, than to knowe any way
how they may eſcape it: to heare what God
did purpoſe before the world beganne, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to learne what hee will doe when
the worlde is ended: to vnderſtand whether
they ſhall know one another in heauen, than
to know whether they belong to heauen:
this rocke hath made many ſhipwracks that
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſearch miſteries before they know prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="998" facs="tcp:17992:465" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like the <hi>Bethſhanites</hi> which were not
content to ſee the Arke, but they muſt prie
into it and finger it: commonly the ſimpleſt
men buſie their head, about the higheſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſo that they meet with a rough &amp; crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
queſtion, like a knob in the tree, &amp; while
they hacke and hewe at it with their owne
wits, to make it plaine, their ſaw ſticks faſt in
the clift, and cannot get out againe, at laſt in
wrath they become like male contents with
God, as though the Scripture were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
&amp; either fall into deſpaire, or into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of all. Therefore it is good to leaue off
learning, where God hath left off teaching:
for they which haue an eare where God hath
no tongue, hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vnto God, but to the
tempter, as <hi>Eue</hi> did to the ſerpent. This is the
rule whereby a man may know whether his
wiſedome ſtand right: as a couetous man is
needy in the middeſt of his riches, ſo a proud
man is ignorant in the middeſt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Now, if our wiſedome were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by theſe properties, I feare, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſaide, <hi>Thou haſt examined them which
called themſelues Apoſtles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reue. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and found them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars:</hi>
ſo I might ſay, I haue examined them
which call themſelues wiſe men, and founde
them liars. In deed <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>many boaſt
of their goodnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 6.</note> 
               <hi>but who can finde a good man?</hi>
So many boaſt of their wiſedome, but who
<pb n="999" facs="tcp:17992:465" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can finde a wiſe man? They are wiſe (ſaith
he) in their owne iudgements, but he ſaith
not that they are wiſe in others iudgements,
As <hi>Paule</hi> tolde the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they
were too religious: ſo hee would tell many
now that they are too wiſe, ſo wiſe, that they
are fooles againe. The <hi>Galathians</hi> zeale
was without knowledge,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> but our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is without zeale, <hi>hauing a ſhew of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: So they haue a ſhewe of
knowledg. But as the ſhew of holines is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
ſo the ſhew of wiſedome is vanitie.
If they which thinke themſelues wiſe, bee
wiſe; then we haue more wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and peraduenture here be more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
then of any other beſide.</p>
            <p>As you haue heard the notes of them
which are wiſe according to <hi>ſobrietie:</hi> So if
you would know ſuch as are wiſe aboue <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie,</hi>
you ſhal diſcerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by theſe marks.
Firſt, they will haue all the talke whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they come, like parrats. Secondly they
contemne other like the Phariſies. Thirdly,
they ſpurne at him which tels them of their
fault, like <hi>Abner.</hi> Fourthly, they iumpe with
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> like the <hi>Herodians.</hi> Fiftly they turne
with the time, like <hi>Demas.</hi> Sixtly, they ſeeke
their owne credite by the diſcredite of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
like the enimies of <hi>Paule.</hi> Seuenthlie,
they loue to heare their owne praiſe, like

               <hi>Herode.</hi> Eightly, aboue al things they would

theſe eight markes meete, there is a
wiſe man, and a foole, a wiſe man in his own
conceit, and a foole in proofe: theſe are the
wiſemen of the north, and the Philoſophers
of <hi>Englande.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you haue heard the wiſedome which
is according to <hi>ſobrietie.</hi> If any man doe ſee
the ſpottes of his owne face in this glaſſe, let
him <hi>waſh and be cleane. Hee that is wiſe</hi> (ſaith
Salomon) <hi>is wiſe to himſelfe, but he that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wiſe, is wiſe againſt himſelfe:</hi> heere you
may ſee: that note aboue <hi>Ela</hi> is a iarring note

Chriſt would not haue vs <hi>wiſe Serpents,</hi> but
<hi>as wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> leſt they which are like
ſerpents ſhould circumuent vs, to be wiſe to
euil is an euil wiſedom, and there is no ſuch
enemie vnto knowledge, as the opinion of
knowledge: for one which is wedded vnto
his owne witte, wil neuer be counſelled of
any. Therefore how neceſſarie it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this doctrine, and God graunt wee
may remember it. I cannot tell howe, no
man can ſerue GOD, vnleſſe hee knowe
GOD: for none doe obey him excepte
they which doe knowe him, and yet it is
ſaide that there was neuer ſo much knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and ſo little goodnes. Surely as Chriſt
<pb n="1001" facs="tcp:17992:466"/>
ſaide to his Diſciples, <hi>O ye of little faith,</hi> ſo he
might ſay to vs, <hi>O yee of little vnderſtanding:</hi>
for there is not too much wiſdome, but too
much oſtentation, <hi>Humilitie</hi> is none of our
vertues. They which ſhould teach others to
be wiſe <hi>according to ſobrietie,</hi> paſſe the bonds
of <hi>ſobrietie</hi> themſelues: euerie man hath a
common-weale in his head, and trauels to
bring foorth newe faſhions. As the Iewes
were not content with ſuch rulers as God
had appointed them, but would haue a king
like the Gentiles. As the Papiſts are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with ſuch lawes as God hath appointed
them, but they will haue traditions like the
Iewes: So the wiſedome of this worlde is, to
deuiſe better orders, better lawes, better ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
better callings, better diſcipline, than
God hath deuiſed himſelfe. <hi>Euery plant</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>which my father hath not planted ſhall
bee rooted vp,</hi> that is, euerie title, and euerie
office, and euerie calling, which God hath
not planted, ſhall be rooted vp: to bee wiſe
according to this booke, is to bee wiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>ſobrietie.</hi> Therefore ſeeke the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, for the wiſedome of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is turned to a <hi>curſe,</hi> the wiſedome of the
Phariſies is turned to a <hi>woe,</hi> the wiſedome of
<hi>Achitophell</hi> is turned to <hi>folly,</hi> the wiſedome
of <hi>Nimrod</hi> is turned to <hi>confuſion,</hi> the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

               <pb n="1002" facs="tcp:17992:467"/>
the wiſdome of <hi>Iezabel</hi> is turned to <hi>death.</hi>
This is the ende of the deceiuers wiſedome,

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 14</note> to teach vs, that as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

So God will admit no ſinfull ſoule into

be wiſe, were to be holie: &amp; therefore Chriſt
is ſaid to haue expounded all thinges to his
Diſciples apart, to ſhew, that if we will haue
Chriſt to teach vs, we muſt go a part from the
world. So that as a man ſlippeth off all his
cloathes, when he goeth into a bath to waſh
him: So we muſt ſlippe off all our ſins, when
we come to the word to feed vs: for wiſedom
will not reſt in the defiled ſoule, nor in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

woulde not dwell but in a houſe that was

The Iewes reade the Scriptures daily in their
Synagogues to finde Chriſt, but all in vayne,
becauſe the vaile is not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away in reading
them: Euen ſo doe we preach in vayne, and
you heare in vaine, becauſe the vaile of ſinne
which is drawne like a Curtaine ouer your
harts, hideth and eclipſeth the glorious light
of the Goſpell from you. And therefore (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
brethren) if you will haue the Lord to
bleſſe your hearing, and to proſper our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
you muſt waſh and rince out the dregs
of ſin that are frozen in you, you muſt purge
the leauen of maliciouſnes that ſowreth your
ſoules, you muſt caſt vp your couetouſnes, &amp;
your pride, and your ſlothfulnes, &amp; your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
preiudice, like the ſerpent which ſpues
vp his poyſon when he goes to drinke: For
this is the cauſe why there are ſo many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
&amp; non-proficient hearers, becauſe there
are ſo many ſinfull and wicked hearers. It is
ſayd of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 11</note> that <hi>he did not many great works
in his owne countrey for their vnbeliefs ſake:</hi> ſo
it may be ſayd, that GOD concealeth many
great myſteries of faith from vs for our ſinnes
ſake. Our wickedneſſe ſtops Chriſts mouth
that hee will not ſpeake, as the Iewes incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie
chayned his handes that hee woulde
not worke. Will an Embroderer teach an
other mans ſeruant his trade, if he knowe he

will hurt him? No more will God teach the

they will offend him. The ſeed which fell
into the thornie groud, ſprang vp very chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for a time, that it might ſeeme to giue
great hope of a ioyfull harueſt: but becauſe
thornes grewe vp with it,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 22</note> at length they cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
it: ſo that vnleſſe wee cut vp the thornie
ſinnes which naturally ſprout and ſpring vp
in vs, they will ouerthrow all the good plants
of holy doctrine that are graffed in vs: and
therefore the Prophet Ieremie willeth vs to
<hi>breake vp the fallowe ground,</hi>

In regard whereof, I beſeech you (my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)

            <p>A man will not keepe the Sabbaoth in

to ſhewe that the Lord doth then looke for

of his ſeruice, and the duties of holy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wee approach to drawe more neere vnto

of our wickedneſſe, when we come to heare.
We muſt be <hi>as babes,</hi>

which haue a newe ſoule, a newe life, newe

When Naaman the leper had waſhed in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,

As the Adder ſlippes off her skinne, and the

and one ſinne pulles on more ſinnes, as one

therefore as the leauen was hid in the meale

            <p>Furthermore, this poynt diſcouereth and

then of dead men: and therefore
that they muſt bee quickened and <hi>new borne</hi>
againe, before they can practiſe or performe
any vitall action in the life of GOD. Chriſt

And therefore as an vncleane fountaine

            </p>

of the word of GOD, it is an vndoubted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that wee are <hi>borne</hi> agayne, that there is
breath and a ſoule within vs, and we are not
vtterly dead in the life of grace. As contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
they which haue not a ſharpe and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
appetite to bee fedde and ſatisfied with
<pb n="1014" facs="tcp:17992:473" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>the milke of the word,</hi> are but dead carcaſſes,
and skinnes full of rotten bones: ſo that this
Citie which ſhoulde bee the glorie of the
kingdome, may well bee tearmed <hi>Golgotha,
The place of dead mens skulles,</hi> in regard there
are ſo manie thouſand ſoules dead in ſinne,
dead in <hi>deſire,</hi> who haue no thirſt and hunger
for <hi>the word</hi> of God. If they haue a bare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Miniſter, as children haue a puppit to
play with, they thinke themſelues in a happy
ſtate: as if Eliſhaes ſtaffe could raiſe the dead
child without Eliſha, and the word giue life
without a preacher. It may bee they can bee
content with Micah, to accept a Leuite if
they light vpon him: But who will ſende to
Hieruſalem the ſchoole of the Prophets, as
Saul ſent to Bethelem to fetch Dauid for his
comfort? I thinke you know my meaning. I
would not wiſh you wait till preachers offer
themſelues to inſtruct you, but to ſende to
the ſchooles of learning, to prouide godly &amp;
able men, who may miniſter the word in due
ſeaſon. Balaake, becauſe he longed for Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
went to the vtmoſt coaſt of the countrey
to meete him. The father, becauſe he longed
for his prodigall ſonne, ranne to kiſſe him a
great way off. Dauid becauſe he longed for
the Arke, went and brought it vp from Kiria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaim:
So then indeed we deſire the word of
God, when we will not ſtay till it come vnto
<pb n="1015" facs="tcp:17992:473" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, but we will preuent it, and goe to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
borders of our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey to fetch it home
vnto vs. We muſt <hi>deſire the milke of the word,</hi>
and we muſt <hi>deſire</hi> it <hi>as babes,</hi> that is, in three
reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt they ſay children ſo ſoone as they are
borne into the worlde, preſently crie out for
the mothers dugge: ſo muſt wee ſo ſoone as
wee feele the grace of God to haue renewed
vs, while wee are yet hote from the wombe,
hunger and thirſt for <hi>the milke of the word.</hi> If
the mother ſhould deferre to giue her childe
ſucke, were it able to liue a moneth, or a
weeke, or a day? No more is our faith able to
ſuſtaine and ſupport it ſelfe, vnleſſe it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
nouriſhed with the foode of life.<note place="margin">Mar. 5. 46.</note> Chriſt
ſo ſoone as he had rayſed vp Iairus daughter,
commanded her meate, as if it were in vaine
for vs to be quickned by the finger of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
vnles we be fed by the <hi>word</hi> of his grace:
and therfore Eden was watered ſo ſoone as it
was planted,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 6.</note> to ſhew that we muſt be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
ſo ſoon as we are inſtructed: ſo that it
is a great fault among vs, when GOD hath
quickned vs with his ſpirit, &amp; we perceiue his
graces to budde and to bloſſome in vs, that
we preſently prouide not moyſture to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and to preſerue them. We count it a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
that Elias liued fortie dayes without
foode: and yet we after many yeares of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="1016" facs="tcp:17992:474" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtill poſte off the feeding of our ſoules.
We thinke it alwayes too ſoone to beginne,
though we begin then when we are ready to
end, as the rich man, who then went in hand
to inlarge his barnes, when hee was euen at
deaths doore to reſigne his life. As Chriſte
was then ſent for to heale the Rulers daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Mar. 7. 23.</note>
when ſhe was ready to departe: ſo, manie
neuer deſire the preachers company till they
be ready to die. They ſay that the time is not
yet come that the Lords houſe ſhoulde bee
built: not yet time to ſanctifie their ſoules
for God; not yet time to prouide for <hi>the milke
of the word.</hi> And thus we poſte off from day
to day, from yeare to yeare, till wee bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
by death: As the bad Lawyer driues
off his Client from terme to terme, till the
ſuite be loſt. Lot was ſo long loytering and
trifling in Sodome, that the Angell was
fayne to plucke him out with violence; and
certainly vnleſſe the Lorde by the good
meanes of his prouidence ſhould plucke vs
out of ignorance and darkeneſſe wherein we
vſe ſuch trifling, and plunging, and delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that ſcarce one of a thouſand would bee
ſaued.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (beloued in Chriſt) if Paule
haue planted you in the true fayth, deſire
alſo an Apollo to water you: If the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be layde by a maiſter builder: ſeeke
<pb n="1017" facs="tcp:17992:474" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out a skilfull workeman, who may roofe it
alſo: if ye haue receiued one grace, ſpeedily
deſire the preaching of <hi>the word,</hi> that it may
increaſe and grow vp by dreſſing and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vnto a double grace: for euen the beſt
giftes will wither and decay in you, vnleſſe
they be preſently watered with <hi>the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe we knowe, that children are ſo
greedily carried with a deſire of the foode,
that when hunger aſſayles them, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regarde leiſure, nor neceſſitie, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes
of the mothers, but all excuſes &amp; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
ſet apart, ſo ſoone as they crie for it,
they muſt be fedde; Euen ſo wee muſt not
thinke it enough to deſire <hi>the worde,</hi> but we
muſt bee earneſt and feruent, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in calling and crying for it. A notable
parable is in Luke,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 5.</note> how one called for bread
in the night, the other anſwered that he was
in bed; which ſeemed a reaſonable anſwere,
and yet it would not ſerue: So we haue long
called (my brethren) and wee haue a great
while craued the bread of life, though it may
ſeeme a reaſonable anſwere, that they cannot
giue it vs without impoueriſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and their children, who are fat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with the Miniſters mayntenance: yet
we ought not to be daunted and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
ſo, but to continue asking ſtil, as Peter
continued knocking til the doore was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note>
               <pb n="1018" facs="tcp:17992:475" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For as Iehu was knowen by his furious
marching; ſo you may know a faythfull and
true Chriſtian, by his zealons perfecting of
holy purpoſes. The mother doth not alwayes
feede her childe for loue, but many times to
keep it ſtill and quiet, is conſtrayned to leaue
all, and giue it ſucke: So if our mother ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reuerenced God, nor feared men, yet if
we would be earneſt and importunate with
her, if we would continually crye and call
for it, as babes doe for the <hi>milke,</hi> ſhe would
feede vs at laſt, if not of loue, yet at leaſt to be
eaſed of vs. It is an olde ſaying, that he which
asketh faintly teacheth vs to denie him: If
we will teach men to graunt vs, we muſt aske
it with courage and conſtancie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Iacob wreſtled with the Angel and
ſaid, <hi>I will not let thee goe vntill thou bleſſe me:</hi>
ſo muſt our requeſts wreſtle with the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of our land, and ſay, I will not let you
reſt vntill you heare me.</p>
            <p>This doctrine enditeth and conuinceth a
great number of vs, who though we haue a
deſire to the worde, yet we are ſo chill and
ſo colde, and ſo looſe in it, that in euery croſſe
euent, we ſtand ſtone ſtill. If it be but a ſtraw
it is a blocke in our way,<note place="margin">Ier. 9. 3.</note> becauſe as Ieremie
ſpeaketh, <hi>We haue no courage for the truth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth:</hi> we haue ſome loue to the trueth,
but we haue no courage to labour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
<pb n="1019" facs="tcp:17992:475" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for it, as a merchant that would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gaine, but dares not venture the ſeas for
feare of drowning. If the people be ſomwhat
backward or a Preacher cannot be procured
at the firſt daſh, while the fitte is freſh vpon
vs, we take our diſcharge, and caſt off the care
for euer after. The ſlouthfull man ſayes, <hi>There
is a Lyon in the way:</hi> And ſo we diſcourage
our ſelues in ſeeking good things, becauſe
there is paines in the way. But if we <hi>deſire the
word, as babes</hi> doe milke, we muſt neuer reſt to
<hi>deſire</hi> it, vntill we haue it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we know, children are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crauing foode; a little pauſe, and then to
the breaſt againe: and therefore we muſt not
bee gorged and glutted with once ſeruing,
but continually deſire it: We muſt be of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias
diet, bread and fleſh in the morning, and
at euening too; So morning and euening
our ſoules muſt bee fedde. The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth,
<hi>Let the worde of GOD dwell in you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>
becauſe it muſt not take vp a nights lodging
and ſo be gone, but it muſt be a continuall
reſidence and abode in our hearts. Though
the ground be good, yet it muſt haue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and the latter rayne to make it fertile,
and yet many of vs thinke to grow greene
with one ſhower, and to goe vnto heauen
with one ſermon. It is reported of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that they continued daylie in the temple,
<pb n="1020" facs="tcp:17992:476" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as if a Sabbaoth dayes exerciſe would not
ſerue the turne,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 6.</note> vnleſſe we had ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
repaſt in the worke dayes alſo: and
therefore as the lampe burned continually in
the Temple without quenching: So the word
muſt continually ſound in our eares without
intermiſſion. Thus you ſee (beloued) that
if you wil <hi>deſire the milke of the word as newe
borne babes,</hi> you muſt <hi>deſire</hi> it preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay, importunately without fainting, &amp;
continually without loathing, and being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with it.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the matter and obiect
which we muſt deſire; namely, our food and
nouriſhment in Chriſt, which is here called
<hi>the milke of the worde.</hi> To this our Sauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calleth

that it flowed with milke and honie; and this
incouraged the Iſraelites to trauail to it, in

to attaine it.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 45.</note> God hath many names in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

and <hi>the keye</hi> to open and vnlocke heauen

of all things. And ſurely therefore <hi>the worde</hi>
is in ſo ſmall requeſt among vs, becauſe wee
<pb n="1022" facs="tcp:17992:477" rendition="simple:additions"/>
know not what bleſſings it bringeth with it.
It is the word of ſaluation, becauſe it ſaueth
the ſoule from pyning, as the corne which
Ioſeph ſent, did Iacobs houſe from famine.
So that as Eliſha ſayd of Iordan, <hi>waſh and be
cleanſed;</hi> ſo may we ſay of the <hi>word,</hi> Heare
it and be ſaued. It is called <hi>the worde of life,</hi>
becauſe it reuiueth the ſpirite, as Eliſhaes
bones reuiued the Iſraelites. It is called <hi>the
worde of reconciliation,</hi> becauſe it is like a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
chayne to linke GOD and vs together.
And in regarde hereof,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 16</note> it is called <hi>a iewell of
ineſtimable price,</hi> as if all the treaſure in Egypt
were not wealthy enough to buy it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as Dauid longed for the Well of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem;

            <p>The <hi>Word</hi> is reſembled to <hi>milke</hi> in three

I tremble to thinke how oft you haue heard

If we ſee not all thinges, the fault is not in the

            <p>It muſt be <hi>ſincere. Sincere</hi> both in his ſauor,

one hundred ſermons a goe, as if wee were

with all the ſope of the Goſpel. Though
wee haue long heard and ſtil deſire to heare,
yet we doe not <hi>grow</hi> by our hearing, wee are
verie dwarfes in Chriſt ſcant able to goe, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in faith, little in loue, little in patience, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in obedience, little in zeal, like Zacheus,
ſo little that wee cannot ſee Chriſt. This is an
vndoubted euidence that we haue not fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="1031" facs="tcp:17992:481" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but ſtony hearts, which though they bee
waſhed, yet they cannot be watred with the
ſweete ſhowers of the Goſpell: For, is there
not in euery tauerne, and in euery ſhop, and
in euery houſe, and in euery hall, as much
couetouſnes, as much briberie, as much coſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as much wantonnes, as much malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
after this long ſhine of the <hi>word,</hi> as
ther was before? Are we not now as ſlothfull
in Gods ſeruice, as diſſolute in the practiſe
of Chriſtian dueties, as diſhoneſt in our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
between man and man, as proud in our
attire, as light in our behauiour, as hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
abroad, as ſinnefull at home, as we were
before? And what is the reaſon hereof, but
that we come to the fountayn rather, to draw,
than to drinke: rather to heare, than to bee
bettered, and ſanctified, and increaſed by
our hearing? One ſort heareth not at all, like
Eutichus which was ſleeping when Paul was
preaching:<note place="margin">Act. 20. 9.</note> another ſort forgets all as Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar

all, but will make no practiſe of it
as a Carpenter which ſhoulde ſquare all by
rule, and ſticks it at his backe, and workes all
by aime. But aſſuredly (my beloued) it were
better you neuer heard, then thus in deſpight
of God to abuſe your hearing. <hi>If I had not
ſpoken vnto them</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>they ſhoulde
haue had no ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 22.</note> 
               <hi>but now haue they no cloake for
<pb n="1032" facs="tcp:17992:482"/>
their ſinne.</hi> What cloake can yee haue when
God offereth grace, and ye wilfully refuſe it?
As meat, the more a man receiueth, the more
it diſtempereth, if it be not digeſted; ſo the
more yee learne, and the more yee heare, the
greater is your ſin if ye grow not by it: if the
ſeruant which hid his talent in a napkin was
ſo handled, what ſhalbe done to them which
ſuffer their talent to periſh? And therefore
euery man muſt <hi>beware how he heareth,</hi> euery
man muſt <hi>take heede that he receiue not the
grace of God in vaine, that he deſire the milke of
the word,</hi> to bee bettered and increaſed by it.
Wherefore whoſoener thou bee that heareth
this, and will heare other; ſearch thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whether thou be growne in any vertue
ſince thou heardeſt the laſt ſermon: conſider
what ſinne thou haddeſt the laſt Sabboath,
which thou haſt not this Sabboath? If thou
finde no change, then the <hi>Word</hi> hath not had
his working in thee: thou art not inereaſed
by the food which thou receiuedſt. Will not,
a man be angry to ſet his childe to ſchoole,
and finde him alwaies at his A, B, C. or the
firſt principles of ſanctification? So will God
be diſpleaſed, if wee be negligent and ſlacke
and neuer take out his leſſons, but ſtand at
a ſtay.</p>
            <p>I know many of you will giue me the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this, as you haue done many of my
<pb n="1033" facs="tcp:17992:482"/>
brethren heretofore: but as the worme ſtroke
<hi>Ionahs guord,</hi> and it died in the morning: ſo
by the next morning a greedy worme of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,

the doore ready euery houre to ſummon
you by death, to make your appearaunce at
the barre of iuſtice, and to giue vp your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for euery talent, yea, for euery leſſon
that ye haue learned and left vnpractiſed.</p>
            <p>As for you, (if any of you) walke in dutifull
obedience to the word, I beſeech you in the

                  <p>5 And when the daies of their banquetting
were gone about, Iob ſent and ſanctified them,
and roſe vp early in the morning and offered
burnt offerings, according to the number of

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His booke is a ſtory of patient
Iob, to ſhew how God can deale
with all, and how they ſhoulde
receiue all thinges at his hand,
ſeeing the moſt innocent man
in the world, when God ſhould try him, was
brought ſo low, that the Diuel had power to
lay vpon him what torment he would, death
onely excepted, and yet he ſtoode to it with
<pb n="1035" facs="tcp:17992:483"/>
ſuch conſtancy, that he ſaith, <hi>though the Lord
kill mee, yet will I trust in him,</hi> the thirteenth
Chapter of Iob, and fifteenth verſe. Such
power was giuen vnto his faith, and loue, and
patience, that they ouercame the Diuell,
which ſaide that if hee might haue leaue to
plague him, hee would <hi>make him blaspheme
God to his face,</hi> verſe, 11. Therefore God
would haue this victory to bee recorded for
all ſuch as are ſicke, or ſore, or needy, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
that whatſoeuer paine we ſuffer, wee
may remember that Iobs paine was ſharper
than this, and yet it coulde not make him ſo
impatient: but when like a man hee was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with his torments; like an holy man
he was more offended with himſelfe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
with his anger. Therefore at laſt God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to him, and remoued his troubles and
made his end more honourable than his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
as if he ſhuld ſay, <hi>Thus it ſhal be done
to the man which is not offended with my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſementes.</hi>
Now to our purpoſe, in the firſt
verſe of this Chapter, the holy Ghoſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what a good man Iob was, ſaying; <hi>that
hee was an vpright and iust man, one that
feared God and eſchewed euill.</hi> In the ſecond
verſe, he ſheweth what ſtore of children Iob
had: ſaying, <hi>hee had ſeauen ſonnes and three
daughters.</hi> In the third verſe hee ſheweth
what ſtore of riches Iob had: ſaying, <hi>his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="1036" facs="tcp:17992:484"/>
was ſeuen thouſand ſheepe, and three
thouſand Camels, and fiue hundred yoke of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
and fiue hundred Aſſes, &amp;c.</hi> In the fourth
verſe hee returneth againe to his children,
ſhewing how they were occupied, before the
winde came and blewe the houſe vpon their
heads, ſaying, <hi>his ſonnes went and banquetted,
in their houſes euery one his daye, and called
their three ſisters to eate and drinke with them.</hi>
In the fift verſe hee commeth againe to Iob,
and ſhewes a proofe of his vertues, which he
commended him for before, ſaying, <hi>that
when his ſonnes had banquetted, hee ſent for
them, and ſanctified them, and roſe vp earely,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So if ye aske what his ſonnes did, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>they banquetted.</hi> If yee
aske where, he ſaith, <hi>in their owne houſes.</hi> If ye
aske when, he ſaith, <hi>euery one kept his daye.</hi> If
yee aske who were the gueſts, hee ſaith that
one inuited another, and the other inuited him
againe, <hi>and they called their ſisters to them.
and ſo they made merrie together.</hi> If yee aske
what father Iob did, the ſtory ſaith, <hi>that after
euery feast, first he ſent for his ſonnes, and then
he ſanctified them, and then hee ſacrificed for
them:</hi> the reaſon is added, <hi>becauſe Iob thought,
It may be that may ſonnes haue ſinned and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
God in their hearts,</hi> his zeale in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is declared by three circumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="1037" facs="tcp:17992:484" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, <hi>that he roſe vp early in the morning.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>that he offered ſo many ſacrifices as
he had ſonnes.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that he perfourmed this
offering euery day while their feaſt laſted.</hi> Of
euery circumſtance a little, becauſe ſome had
rather heare many thinges then learne one.
Firſt heere is to bee noted that amongſt the
bleſſings of Iob, his children are reckoned
firſt, ſo ſoone as the holy Ghoſt was paſt
his ſpirituall bleſſings which he mentioneth
in the firſt verſe of all, before all his other
bleſſings, landes and houſes, and goods, and
cattell, and friends, and ſeruants, hee ſpeakes
of his children, as the chiefeſt treaſure which
Iob had next vnto his vertues; although hee
was counted the greateſt man for riches and
cattels, and all things elſe in all the eaſt parts,
3. <hi>verſe.</hi> Therefore the Diuell when hee had
taken away all his other riches, tooke away
his children laſt of al, trying him as it were by
degrees, as if he ſhould ſay, I haue a greater
plague for him yet, if the looſing of his goods
and ſtealing of his cattell, and burning of his
houſes, and ſlaying of his ſeruauntes will not
moue him, yet I know what will rowſe him:
when his children are all feaſting together I
will raiſe a mighty wind, <hi>and blow downe the
houſe vppon their heads, and kill euery ſonne &amp;
daughter which he hath at a clap.</hi> Indeed this
newes frighted him foreſt, as appeareth in
<pb n="1038" facs="tcp:17992:485" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the 20. verſe, his patience was ſo great, that
when they brought him word of his oxen, &amp;
camels, and aſſes, and ſheepe, he neuer ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
we doe not reade that he made any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
as though he cared not for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he heard that his deare children, ſeuen ſonnes,
and three daughters, after he had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp to ripe yeares, were ſlaine all at once, then
the ſtory ſaith, that <hi>he roſe vp from his ſeat, and
rent his garments, and ſhaued his head, and fell
downe to the ground and cryed; Naked came I
out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe.</hi> So euen the diuell knoweth what
a man loueth, and what a bleſſing it is to haue
children, therefore when God commaunded
the man and the woman to increaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply,
it is ſaide before, <hi>that God bleſſed them.</hi>
Gen. 1. 28. which was the firſt bleſſing that
was giuen to man, which is called <hi>a bleſſing,
The bleſſing of children.</hi> Againe, when God
ſpake the ſame words to Noah &amp; his ſonnes,
it is ſaid before, that God bleſſed Noah &amp; his
ſons Gen. 9. 4. ſo children came ſtill vnder the
name of bleſſing. Thus God himſelf ſheweth
that children are his gifts to make you thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for them, and carefull of them as Iob was.
And therefore ſome men haue more riches,
and ſome leſſe, &amp; ſome none, becauſe it is <hi>the
bleſſing of God</hi> (as Salomon ſaith) <hi>which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
rich.</hi> Pro. 10. 22. ſo ſome men haue many
<pb n="1039" facs="tcp:17992:485" rendition="simple:additions"/>
children, &amp; ſome few, &amp; ſome none, becauſe
it is <hi>the bleſſing of God,</hi> as Dauid ſaith, <hi>which
ſendeth children.</hi> Pſal. 128. But this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene temporall bleſſings and
ſpirituall bleſſings: that ſpirituall bleſſings
are ſimplie good, and therefore doe all men
good that enioy them: as faith, and loue, and
patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can neuer hurt a man, but better him:
and temporall bleſsings are as he which hath
them, to good man riches are good, honors
are good, health is good, libertie is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he doth good with them: but to an euil
man they are euill, becauſe they make him
worſe, and he doth euill with them: as Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam
had not done ſo much hurt, if he had
not been in ſuch honour. Therefore we pray
for health, and wealth, and honour, and reſt,
and libertie, and life, with a caution, <hi>If it bee
Gods will:</hi> As Chriſt praied for the remouing
of his croſſe; becauſe we knowe not whether
they be good or euill, whether they will make
vs better or worſe, or whether wee ſhall doe
good with them, or hurt. Thus when Iob had
his cattell, and his houſes, and his friends, and
his ſeruants, and his children about him, hee
was like the man of whom Dauid ſpeakes,
<hi>The righteous man ſhall flouriſh like a palme
tree,</hi> Pſalm. 91. 13. Therefore the diuell ſayd,
<hi>that God had made an hedge about Iob.</hi> verſ. 10.
<pb n="1040" facs="tcp:17992:486" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As an hedge goeth round about a garden: ſo
Gods bleſsings went round about Iob, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Pſal. 33. 10. <hi>Him which trusteth
in the Lord, mercie ſhall embrace on euery ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Iob was endowed with children, but
how his children were affected we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
ſo well as of their father, becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt ſaith nothing of them, but that they
<hi>banquetted,</hi> which doth ſound as though he
noted a diſparagement betweene Iob and his
ſonnes, as there was betweene Ely and his
ſonnes: for oftentimes a godly father hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
children, which make him watch, and
faſt, and pray, &amp; weepe when they little think,
while they themſelues ruffle, and ſweare, and
banquet, and game, till pouertie fall on their
purſes, as the houſe fell vpon their heads: ſo it
ſeemes that Iobs ſonnes were ſecure vpon
their fathers holines, as many are vpon their
fathers husbandrie, which thinke <hi>the olde
man hath enough for vs, we need not care to get
or ſaue:</hi> ſo they might thinke, <hi>Our father ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth
for vs, wee may feaſt and be merrie,</hi> his
deuotion will ſerue for vs: he is an olde man,
let him pray and GOD will heare him. One
Lot is enough in an houſe: but if Iob had bred
vp his ſonnes ſo, God would not haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him, but rebuked him, as he did Ely.
Therfore this is not ſpoken againſt Iobs ſons,
that <hi>they banquetted,</hi> as it is ſpoken againſt the
<pb n="1041" facs="tcp:17992:486"/>
Iſraelites, <hi>that they ſate them downe to eate, and
roſe vp to play.</hi> For firſt it is not like that hee
which was ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of God, that he ſaid,
<hi>No man was like him vpon the earth,</hi> verſ. 8.
would not teach his children in their youth,
as he prayed for them after. Agayne, if they
had been Epicures, and Libertines, and beaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
GOD would not haue heard his prayer
for them, no more then he would heare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels
prayer for Saul. Agayne, if they had
deſpiſed that GOD which their father wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,
hee would neuer haue ſayd as hee
ſaith, <hi>It may bee that my ſonnes haue blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
God,</hi> as though ſome fault might ſcape
them by ignorance, or raſhnes: but he would
haue ſayd, My ſonnes are blaſphemers, and
therefore I muſt puniſh them. For that which
the lawe ſayd againſt blaſphemers after, that
Iob vnderſtoode by the lawe of conſcience
written in his heart, as Paul ſayth, Rom. 2. 15.
Agayne, if they had vſed theyr feaſts for
theyr luſts, like them which ſay, <hi>Let vs eate
and drinke, for to morrowe wee ſhall dye,</hi> it had
beene vayne for Iob to ſpeake to them of
ſanctification, for they would not haue ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
themſelues at his bidding. But it is
ſayde, that before Iob offered ſacrifice for
them, they were <hi>ſanctified,</hi> that is, they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the faults which they had committed,
<pb n="1042" facs="tcp:17992:487" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and repented for them, and reconciled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
&amp; then Iob ſacrificed for them. Again,
if their feaſts had been ſurfetings, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
like our Wakes and Reuels, Iob ſhould
haue forbidden their feaſts, &amp; not praied God
to pardon their ſinnes which they committed
in feaſting, &amp; ſuffer them to ſinne ſtill, for that
were to mock God, as though he deſired not
pardon for their ſinnes paſt, but rather leaue
for them to ſinne ſtill. Laſtly, we doe not ſee
by any circumſtance of the ſtorie, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
their feaſts either in ſuſpected houſes,
or prophane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, or corrupt ſpeeches, or
impure geſtures, or wanton dauncings, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
daliances, or vaine ſuperfluities, but
that our feaſts might be allowed, if they were
like vnto theirs. For firſt <hi>they did feaſt in their
owne houſes,</hi> they did not run to Ordinaries,
or Ale-houſes, or Tauernes, as they which
ſeeke for the ſtrongeſt wine, or hunt after
newes, or worſe purpoſes, but like good
neighbours they inuited one another home,
and kept their hoſpitalitie in their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as our Gentlemen ſhould doe that lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
London, which are a kind of Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
from their poore neighbours. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they did not feaſt euery day, like the rich
Glutton in Luk. 16. euery one kept his day in
the yere whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their feaſtings came: ſo it is not
<pb n="1043" facs="tcp:17992:487" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ment, that the ſonnes did nothing but feaſt,
and the father nothing but pray: but as the
feaſts of the Iewes came at certaine times of
the yeare, to celebrate ſome bleſſings of God,
ſo they obſerued their feaſting times, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
their good wils one to another. Laſtly,
they did not ioyne themſelues with ruffins, &amp;
ſwearers, and tiplers, as all are wont to meete
together at a feaſt: neither did they inuite the
rich to their tables, as Iames ſaith, which are
feaſts of flatterie: but they were all of one
kinne, and one heart, brethren and ſiſters, like
the Diſciples which ſate downe together.</p>
            <p>All this doth ſhew that their meetings ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to nouriſh amitie, &amp; that they had reſpect
to the continuance of their peace, &amp; encreaſe
of their loue one towards another, which was
the firſt cauſe that feaſts were inſtituted in the
Primitiue Church, &amp; therfore called the feaſt
of charitie, only that friends and kinſmen and
neighbours might meet one with another to
receiue the bleſsings of God, &amp; reioyce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like Ioſeph &amp; his brethren, leſt Chriſtian
familiaritie ſhould weare out of vſe, &amp; be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
For ye may ſee in Eccleſ. 2. 24. and 3.
12. and 5. 17. where Salomon ſpeaketh of the
ioy, and pleaſure, and delight which we maie
take in Gods creatures. And againe, in Pſal.
104. 15. where Dauid ſayth, that as bread was
<pb n="1044" facs="tcp:17992:488" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made to ſtrengthen, ſo wine was made to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the heart, that God would not only haue
vs fed, but of his exceeding goodnes he wold
haue vs cheered and comforted beſide, as he
ſheweth by this aboundance of his creatures,
in that he hath ordained ſo many things moe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we need. Why did God create mo things
then we need? but to ſhew that he alloweth
vs needful &amp; comfortable things, for al good
things which were not created for need, were
created for delight. Therfore euen the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
haue commended ſolemne feaſts in Le.
10. Num. 29. Exo. 23. where ye may reade of
ſundrie feaſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by God himſelfe, as
the feaſts of gathering fruits, the feaſts of tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
the feaſts of Tabrnacles, the feaſts of
new Moones, the feaſts of reconciliation, the
feaſts of dedication of the temples, &amp;c. Beſide
it is ſaid, that Abraham made a great feaſt the
ſame day that Iſaac was weaned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 8. So
it is ſayd of Sampſon, <hi>that he made a feaſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he was married.</hi> Iud. 14. 10. and at <hi>a feaſt in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
Chriſt ſhewed the firſt miracle that euer
he wrought, turning water into wine.</hi> Ioh. 2. If
feaſts had been vnlawfull, Chriſt would not
haue been there: therefore the wiſeman ſaith,
<hi>there is a time to laugh,</hi> as well as he ſaith, <hi>there
is a time to weepe,</hi> Eccl. 3. 4. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, there
is both a time to laugh &amp; weepe, he implieth,
<pb n="1045" facs="tcp:17992:488" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the time to laugh is not euery day: as it
is ſaid of Diues, <hi>that he fared deliciouſly euerie
day,</hi> Luke. 16. for then there were a time to
laugh, but no time to weep. Therfore if ye wil
know the time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to laugh, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weep,
God hath ſet Vriah for an example, when the
Church was quiet, &amp; his countrie ſafe, Vriah
could reioyce aſwell as other: but when the
Church was troubled, &amp; his countrie in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
though the king bad him <hi>go home, &amp; eate
and drink, &amp; ſolace with his wife:</hi> he would not
doe ſo, but ſaid, <hi>the Arke of Iſrael and Iudah,
dwelleth in tents, and my Lord Ioab and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of my king abide in the open field, and ſhall
I go to my houſe, and eate and drink and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with my wife? by thy life, &amp; by the life of my
ſoule, I will not doe this thing.</hi> See what a ſin he
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it to feaſt then, which at another time
he counted no ſin. Therfore if ye aske whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is
time to feaſt, &amp; when to faſt, learne of Vriah:
he forbad not to feaſt, but if he ſhuld ſee your
feaſting now, he would ſay, as Eliſha ſayd to
Gehezi, <hi>Is this a time to take a reward? Is this a
time to make feaſts?</hi> nay the father and the ſons
both had need to riſe earely now and ſacrifice
together: for if euer the houſe were falling
vpon our heads, as it did vpon theirs, now the
Diuell hath ſent foorth his windes, now the
Pope hath layd his Ordinance, nay our owne
<pb n="1046" facs="tcp:17992:489"/>
hands which ſhould proppe it, are digging as
buſily as the enemies, with reproaches, and
ſlaunders, and ſuggeſtions, to vndermine the
Church, which is falling alreadie, that wee
might die like the Philiſtines, with the temple
vpon our heads. Is this a time to feaſt Vria?
when the houſe of God is beſet like the houſe
of Lot: when the armies of Antichriſt are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
againſt Gods people? As the voyce
asked Zacharie, and Amos, and Ieremie <hi>what
they did ſee:</hi> So if ye aske your Prophets what
they doe ſee, they may ſay they doe ſee the
woolfe deuouring the lambes. We ſee a darke
ignorance running ouer the lande, like the
blackneſſe of Aegypt: wee ſee the Romanes
comming in againe as they came to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
and ſacking the temple: we ſee the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
caruing of Images, &amp; the people knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
before them: we ſee the profeſſors of the
Goſpell ſhrink away, as the Diſciples fled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their Maſter when he was taken. Is this a time
to feaſt Vria? Is this a time to flatter? Is this a
time to diſſemble? Is this a time to loyter?
Is this a time to keep ſilence? Is this a time to
gather riches? Is this a time to reuenge wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs?
Is this a time to ſet forth pageants? No ſaith
Ezekiah. 2. King 19. 3. <hi>This is a time of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
in which the Prince, &amp; Nobles, &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould humble themſelues, as the Citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="1047" facs="tcp:17992:489"/>
of Niniuie, left the Arke be taken from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as the Arke was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Iſrael, which
God grant that our eyes neuer ſee.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Iobs childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how euery one
had his ſeuerall houſe, which ſheweth how
God bleſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with riches, as he did their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; what care Iob had, like a father to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for them: then how they feaſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which ſheweth how ſweet and pleaſant
a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in
vnitie.</p>
            <p>Nowe you ſhall ſee what the olde man
doth which was ſo commended in the 1. verſ.
the ſtorie ſaith, that <hi>hee ſent for his ſonnes and
ſanctified them, &amp; ſacrificed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In which
wordes the holy Ghoſt ſheweth the patterne
of an holy man, and good father, which kept
the rule that God gaue vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>to bring
vp his children in the feare of the Lord.</hi> Iob
doth not as ſome, which when they haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their bounds, ſet all at randome, and ſay
with Cain, in Gen. 4. <hi>My ſinne is greater then
can be forgiuen:</hi> but he goeth to the remedie,
as the Iewes when they were ſtinged, went to
the braſen ſerpent: Albeit my children haue
not done their dueties in al poynts, but offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their feaſtings, yet I am ſure that God
will haue mercie vpon them, and vpon me, if
ye aske him forgiuenes. Therefore he ſent for
<pb n="1048" facs="tcp:17992:490" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his ſonnes like a father, and then hee taught
them like a preacher to ſanctifie them ſelues,
and then he offered ſacrifice for them. Firſt,
we wil ſpeake of the cauſe which moued Iob
to ſacrifice for his ſonnes, ſet downe in theſe
words: Iob thought, <hi>It may be that my ſonnes
haue blaſphemed God in their hearts.</hi> He was
glad good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee his children agree ſo wel
together, but he would haue them merry and
ſin not, and therfore he puts them in mind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day while they feaſted, to ſanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
he condemneth not honeſt mirth and
ſober feaſts, to maintain amity and peace, but
being throughly acquainted with mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie:
this ſheweth, that he had obſerued ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any feaſts ſo duely celebrated, but ſome
diſorder or other hath crept in, whereby God
hath been diſhonoured at his owne table, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for ſuperfluitie of meat, or exceſſe of
drinke, or vnchaſt ſongs, or corrupt ſpeeches,
or wanton dancings, or vnſeemely daliances;
the diuel hath been ſtil at one end, &amp; is lightly
the maſter of the feaſt. Therefore Iob thought
with himſelfe; <hi>It may be that my ſonnes haue
committed ſome ſcape like other men:</hi> I cannot
tell, they are but men: it is eaſie to ſlip when
occaſion is readie, though they thinke not
to offend; he had no apparant cauſe to ſuſpect
them, and therefore he ſpeakes in the doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="1049" facs="tcp:17992:490" rendition="simple:additions"/>
phraſe, <hi>It may bee that they haue ſinned.</hi>
It is better to be feareful, than too ſecure: that
which happeneth often in the like caſe, he
might well doubt of it, though he had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them before: therefore his heart was not
quiet, but ſtill this ranne in his minde, all the
while they feaſted: <hi>It may bee that my ſonnes
ſinne.</hi> How wary was Iob ouer himſelf which
was ſo ielous ouer his ſonnes, leaſt one ſinne
ſhould ſlippe from them: nay if ye marke, he
ſpeaketh not of any open or groſſe ſinnes
which he feared, but he ſpeaketh of a ſinne in
the thought, <hi>It may bee that my ſonnes haue
blaſphemed God in their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blaſphemie</hi> is properly in the mouth, when
a man ſpeaks againſt God, as Rabſhakeh did;
but Iob had a further reſpect to a blaſphemie
of the heart, counting euery ſiniſter affection
of the heart, as it were a kind of blaſphemie,
or petie treaſon. Thus the penitent man
doth aggrauate his ſinnes, and retch them as
it were vpon the racke, to make his ſmall
ſinnes ſeeme great ſinnes, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
as well of ſmal as great. contrariwiſe,
the prophane and carnal minded man doth
min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and flatter, and extenuate his ſinnes, as
though they were no ſins, becauſe they ſhuld
not trouble him: for this ſinne which Iob cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Blaſphemie,</hi> which is the higheſt name
<pb n="1050" facs="tcp:17992:491" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſinne, the Papiſts call but <hi>A veniall ſinne;</hi>
that is, but a ſleight ſinne, becauſe it is in the
thought: So Iob &amp; they differ in iudgement.</p>
            <p>Now out of this ſpeech of Iob; <hi>It may bee
that my ſonnes haue ſinned,</hi> or it may bee that
my ſelfe haue ſinned, which I may properly
and rightly terme the ielouſie of a holy man;
wherein Iob ſheweth in what feare he ſtoode
of his ſonnes ſo long as their feaſts laſted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as a merchaunt doth till his ſhippe come
home. Firſt, wee may ſee this, that the beſt
thinges may ſoone be corrupted, by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
of men, ſuch is our nature euer ſince
Adam choſe euil before good, good hath bin
turned into euill, Gen. 3. Notwithſtanding,
that our intent and meaning be good. As for
example, when an husband loueth his wife, or
a father loueth his children, theſe are good &amp;
holy, and commendable things, yet there is
no man can be found that doth loue his wife,
or his children with that euenneſſe (as I may
call it) or iuſt proportion, but that there is
ſome oddes in the ballance when his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is weighed, which may craue pardon like the
feaſts of Iobs children. If this oddes be in all
our meaſures, then it is no ſtrange caſe, that
Iob thought with himſelfe, <hi>that his children
might offend God in the thing that of it ſelfe of
fendeth not.</hi> Therefore it is good for a man ſo
<pb n="1051" facs="tcp:17992:491" rendition="simple:additions"/>
long as he liueth in this world, to remember
ſtil that he is among temptations, and ſits at
a feaſt like Iobs children, where he may ſoon
take too much. If the fiſh did know the hook,
&amp; the bird had ſeen the net, though they haue
but the vnderſtanding of fiſhes and birds, yet
they would let the hooke alone, and flie ouer
the net, and let the fouler whiſtle to himſelfe:
ſo we muſt looke vpon our riches, as we look
vpon ſnares, and behold our meats, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
baites, &amp; handle our pleaſure as we han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Bees, that is, pick out the ſting, before we
take the honie, for in Gods giftes Sathan hath
hid his ſnares, and made Gods benefites his
baits, that as Adam ſaid, <hi>The woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which thou
hast giuen me, tempted me to ſin,</hi> ſo they may
ſay, the riches or the honours, or the liberty, or
the wife, or the ſeruants, or the children, or the
meates, or the wit, or the beauty which thou
haſt giuen me, tempted me to ſinne, ſo many
ſinnes lie in wait for vs, about our meats and
drinks, &amp; beds, &amp; waies, that vnles we watch,
pray, and looke about vs at euery time, <hi>it may
be,</hi> as Iob ſayth, <hi>that we may ſinne in our doings,</hi>
or in our ſayings, or at leaſt in our hearts, as he
thought of his ſons. Therefore no doubt but
as Iob thought that his ſonnes might offend
in their feaſtings, ſo hee taught them, euen
when they were feaſting, and when they ſate
<pb n="1052" facs="tcp:17992:492" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at the table, and when they dranke one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
to thinke oftentimes <hi>we may ſin as our
father tolde vs,</hi> which brideled their mirth, &amp;
ſtopt many wordes at the doore, euen when
ſin was at the tongues end: you are not Iobs
ſonnes, but you are come to be Iobs ſchollers,
therefore learne, that which his children lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
If a man did but carrie this watch-word
with him, whenſoeuer he eateth or ſpeaketh,
or bargaineth, it would cut off a thouſand i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
words, and wicked acts in one yeare for
which he ſhall giue account. The ſecond leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which Iob ſeemes to point vs vnto, is to
prepare our ſelues before we eat the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that is, <hi>to ſanctifie our ſelues,</hi> &amp; our meats,
as Chriſt did when they had nothing but a
few fiſhes and bare bread, yet there was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
before they did eate. For as Paul ſaith, <hi>All
the creatures of God are ſanctified vnto vs by
prayer and thanksgiuing.</hi> He which doth not
pray to God for his dayly bread, nor thanke
him for it, dooth not receiue the creatures
of God, but ſteale them from him, as a man
which taketh a thing without asking or than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
There is a kind of men which I ſpeak of,
which hold it too ſad a matter, to ſay a ſhort
grace before they fal to meate, leaſt it ſhould
forſpeake their mirth, &amp; keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a ſober
mind til they riſe againe. I haue heard many
<pb n="1053" facs="tcp:17992:492" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be merie, vnles they ſwear
and whoop, &amp; carouſe, &amp; dally, &amp; gibe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they can chooſe they will neuer bee a
gueſt where any godly man is preſent, leſt his
countenance or wordes ſhould daſh their
ſport; &amp; if any matter of God happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come
in while they are in the vaine, it is like a damp
which puts out their lights, and turnes their
mirth into heauineſſe, as the hideous hande
which wrote vpon the wall caſt <hi>Baltaſar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a dumpe. Theſe men had neede to leaue
their feaſting, and go to praying, for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
to die, like the Iewes with the quailes in
their mouthes. <hi>It may be</hi> (thought Iob) <hi>that
my ſonnes haue a ſpice of this vanitie.</hi> If it be ſo
with the godly ſort, as Iobs childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were, that
they may forget themſelues at ſuch a time, &amp;
ſtep too farre, and ſlip a ſinne, what ſhall wee
ſay of them that driue God out of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
when they banquet, and ſay that ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
dooth not become the table, as though
we ſhould forget God while wee receiue his
benefits, we need not ſay as Iob ſaide, <hi>It may
be that they blaspheme GOD in their hearts,</hi>
for they blaſpheme him with their mouthes;
we need not ſay, <hi>it may be that they doe ſinne,</hi>
for they doe nothing but ſinne? And their
feaſte is a feaſt of ſinnes, as if the Diuelles
ſhould banquet together. But they which
<pb n="1054" facs="tcp:17992:493" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feaſt as Iob would haue his children ſanctifie
themſelues before, &amp; eate as in the preſence
of God, and are merie as it were with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
when they take their bread, they thinke
with themſelues what a goodnes this is, that
God giueth ſuch vertue to bread, to ſuſtaine
life, which hath no life in it ſelfe; &amp; when they
ſee ſo many things before them prepared for
the fleſh, they conſider with themſelues what
care God hath of my ſoule, which careth ſo
much for my body, which ſhall go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to duſt.
There is another leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wil ſtand you in
great ſtead if ye marke it, when Iob ſaith, <hi>It
may be that my ſonnes haue ſinned.</hi> Hereby hee
teacheth vs to ſuſpect the worſt of the fleſh,
and to liue in a kind of ielouſie of our ſelues,
as he ſaith that his maner was, cap. 9. <hi>I feared
al my workes;</hi> that is, he did miſtruſt himſelfe,
and waſht his hands, and his feet, and his eies
and his eares, and his tongue, leſt they ſhould
ſin, as a mercer miſtruſts his prentice leſt hee
ſhould filtch: ſo he thought not onely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his ſonnes ſinned but he thought of his
owne ſins too: when thou ſeeſt ſome ſelling
in their ſhops, ſome tipling in the Tauernes,
ſome playing in Theaters, then thinke of this
with thy ſelfe: <hi>It is very like</hi> that theſe men
ſwallow many ſinnes, for God is neuer ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
as in feaſting, and ſporting, &amp; bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="1055" facs="tcp:17992:493" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then turne to thy compaſſions, and pray
for them that God would keepe them from
ſin when temptation is at hand, and that hee
would not impute their ſins to their charge;
ſo we ſhould doe for our brethren as Iob did
for his children. Again, ſo we ought to think
when we our ſelues come from places of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which infect like a corrupt ayre; <hi>It may
be that I haue ſinned:</hi> haue I ſeen and heard al
this, and not ſlipped my foote with them?
Come I home ſound &amp; whole? haue I drawn
none of the infected ayre? Doth none of the
duſt ſticke vpon my garments? Looke about
my ſoule, and if thou remembreſt any ſinne
which ſlipt from thee, then pray for thy ſelf as
Iob did for his children. If thou wilt not pray
for thy ſelfe, who ſhal pray for thee? If thou
wilt not repent thy ſelfe, who ſhall repent for
thee. Looke not for Iob to ſacrifice for thee.
Iob cannot ſacrifice for thee, but thou mayſt
ſacrifice thy ſelfe, and none but thee. This
ſhould be the thought of euery Chriſtian, not
whether we haue pleaſed, nor whether wee
haue reuenged, but whether wee haue
ſinned: for if Iob was ſo zealous
of his children, how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſhould we be of
our ſelues.</p>

this Scripture, and this time accorde well. In

Here the Diuel is called in like a Iaylor, which
keepes ſome in perpetuall priſon, and ſome
are bayled, and ſome returne to priſon again,
and ſome are executed. They which ſinne
fearfully, ſtay as it were about the priſon, but
are not bound: they which ſinne wittingly,
are vnder locke, they which ſinne greedily, are
vnder lock and bolts, they which dye in their
ſinne, are like them which are condemned:
this is the bondage which we haue brought
our ſelues vnto for a fayre apple. When the
tempter ouercame vs, we were remoued out
of Paradiſe, where we were ſeated: when we
haue ouercome the tempter, we ſhal be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
into heauen, where he was ſeated: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
doore was wide, and the way was broad
before the rebellion: but when we knockt at
the cannell doore, then the good doore was
ſhut: heauen is large, but the way to heauen
muſt be narrow, therefore God hath ſet our
enemies in the gate to fight with vs before we
enter, that this faying might be verified, The
kingdome of heauen is caught by violence: ſo
ſoone as we riſe in the morning we goe forth
<pb n="1059" facs="tcp:17992:495" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to fight with two mightie giants, the World
and the Diuell, and whom doe we take with
vs but a traytor? this brittle fleſh which is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to yeeld vs vp to the enemie at euery aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
onely he which ſuffereth Satan to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
vs, dooth ſtay him from deſtroying vs.
When God asked Cain, where is thy brother?
Cain lyed and ſayd, I cannot tell. When God
asked Sarah why ſhe laughed? Sarah lyed and
ſayd, I laughed not: but when God asked the
diuell from whence he came, he anſwered
truely, <hi>I come from compaſſing the earth,</hi> &amp; yet
he which ſpeaketh truth himſelf, taught them
to lye, as he is called the father of liers, becauſe
he teacheth all others to lye. How then? Was
Caine worſe then the diuell, becauſe he lyed
and the other told trueth? By this you may ſee
that carnall men doe not knowe ſo much of
God as the very diuell knoweth, for he knewe
that GOD could tell where he had been, but
Caine doubted whether God could tell what
hee had done, and therefore he made a lye.
Thus, thus the Diuell teacheth his ſchollers to
doe worſe ſometimes then hee will doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
euen as he would bring them (if it were
poſsible) into a worſe plight the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is himſelf.
The diuels faith cannot ſaue vs, no more then
it can ſaue him, the diuels knowledge cannot
conuert vs, no more then it dooth conuert
him, and yet hee would not haue men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="1060" facs="tcp:17992:496"/>
that which hee bleeueth himſelfe, nor
haue vs vnderſtand ſo much as he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelfe: for if Caine had vndderſtood ſo
much as he, that God knewe whether he lyed
or no, he would haue anſwered God truely, as
Satan did: but the diuell knew that there was
no diſſembling with God, who knowes what
he asks before he asks, therefore he told troth
to God, though he lye to man: for to lye vnto
him which knoweth, is as if one ſhould lye to
himſelfe, but Cain was not ſo wel learned, he
thought peraduenture yet God might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his murther, as a theefe ſuſpecteth in his
heart that the Iudge may know his theft: but
he doubted whether God did knowe it, and
therefore he denied it like one which is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but thinkes that if he confeſſe, he ſhall be
hanged, and therefore though euidence and
witneſſe accuſe them, yet you ſee many will
not accuſe themſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From compaſſing the earth,</hi> He which was
called Satan before, which ſignifieth an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie,
is heere ſayd to compaſſe the earth:
which is to ſay, being put together, an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
compaſſeth the earth: and therefore let
the earth beware like a Citie which is beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the aduerſarie.</p>
            <p>The diuell hath mo names then any Prince
hath titles, ſome God hath giuen to him, and
ſome he hath giuen to himſelfe: but this is to
<pb n="1061" facs="tcp:17992:496" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be noted in the diuels names, that he neuer
called himſelf a lier, nor a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pter, nor an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
nor a ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derer, nor a deceiuer, nor a deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
nor a murderer, nor a maſter, nor an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,
nor a viper, nor a lion, nor a dragon, nor
a woolfe, nor a cockatrice, nor a ſerpent. But
when Chriſt asked him his name, hee calleth
himſelfe <hi>Legion,</hi> which imports a multitude,
as if he ſhould brag of his number, &amp; here he
calles himſelfe in effect the compaſſer of the
earth, as if he ſhuld brag of his power. And in
the 4. Chapter of Luke &amp; 6. verſe, he calleth
himſelf the poſſeſſer of the earth, as if he ſhuld
brag of his poſſeſſions, and in the ſame he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
himſelfe the quier of the earth, as if he
ſhould brag of his liberalitie. Thus he which is
euill it ſelfe, doth ſhun the name, becauſe he
would not be hated: and therefore no maruel
if men call euil good, &amp; would be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
though they be neuer ſo lewd, for ſo will
the diuell: but as God neuer called the diuell
but by thoſe names which the diuell hated, ſo
he neuer calleth ſinners by thoſe names which
they call themſelues. For if you obſerue the
Scripture, there is no name of the diuel, but in
ſome place of Scripture or other the wicked
are called by the ſame name: he is called a lier,
&amp; they are called liers: he is called a tempter,
&amp; they are called te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pters: he is called a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
&amp; they are called murderers: he is called
<pb n="1062" facs="tcp:17992:497" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a ſlanderer, &amp; they are called ſlanderers: he is
called a viper, and they are called vipers: he is
called a lion, &amp; they are called lions: he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a woolfe, and they are called wolues: he is
called a ſerpent, and they are called ſerpents.
Thus God would they that ſhall be damned
ſhould haue the name of him which is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned,
to put them in mind. Now none of the diuels
names are in the book of life: &amp; therfore liers,
&amp; tempters, &amp; ſlanderers, &amp; murderers, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famers
are not: therefore theſe are the diuels
names. This I note to ſhewe you how deadly
God doth hate ſin, that neither the diuell nor
his followers could euer get a good name of
him: for al his compaſſing, he could neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
this, to ſhuffle any praiſe of himſelfe into
this booke of life: for he doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but earth, though he wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe both:
the diuel himſelfe doth tel vs here, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth,
&amp; he telleth vs not why he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſeth;
but his name Satan that we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before, which he
ſpake not of, doth tell vs why he compaſſeth.
Becauſe it ſignifies an aduerſarie, it giueth vs
to vnderſtand that hee compaſſeth the earth
like an aduerſarie. God doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe the earth
like a wall to defend it: the diuell compaſſeth
the earth like an enemy to beſiege it. For ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
is his name, he is enuie euen to the name.</p>
            <p>Three things I note: wherefore the diuell
may be ſayd to compaſſe the earth. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="1163" facs="tcp:17992:497" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he tempteth all men. Secondly, becauſe
he tempteth to all ſinnes. Thirdly, becauſe he
tempteth by all meanes: So whoſoeuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
wherein ſoeuer he offendeth, whereby
ſoeuer he is allured, the ſinne, and the ſinner,
and the baite, are compaſſed, and contriued
by this Archpolitique, which calles himſelf a
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſer. Many haue their names for naught,
becauſe they doe nothing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like Labans
images which were called Gods, though they
were but blocks: but the diuell deſerues his
names, he is not called a tempter, and a lyar,
and a ſlaunderer, and an accuſer, and a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and a murtherer, &amp; a compaſſer in vaine,
like S. George, which is alwaies on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and neuer rides: but he would doe more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his office he is bound to. Other are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
officers, becauſe they haue an office: but
he is called an enemy, becauſe he ſheweth his
enuy. Other are called Iuſticers, becauſe they
ſhould doe iuſtice: but he is called a tempter,
becauſe he practiſeth temptations. Other are
called Paſtors, becauſe they ſhould feede: but
he is called a deuourer, becauſe he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
&amp; we cal him a Compaſſer, becauſe that
he doth compaſſe. Euer ſince he fel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen
he hath liued like Caine, which cannot reſt in
a place, but is a ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nagate ouer the earth, from
doore to doore, from man to man, begging
for ſinnes as the ſtarued ſoule begs for bread.
<pb n="1064" facs="tcp:17992:498"/>
He ſhould haue dwelt in heauen, and not bin
compaſſing the earth, hee ſhould haue ſung
with the Angels &amp; not been quarelling with
men, but he hath changed his calling, and is
become a compaſſer, that is, to lay fetters vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
men, as GOD hath fettered him, leaſt they
ſhould aſcend to the place from whence he is
fallen. Therefore in this the Lyer ſpake truth,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, <hi>I come from compaſſing the earth:</hi>
as if hee ſhould ſay to God, I come from the
ſlaughter of thy ſeruants, not to aske forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for all the ſoules which he hath ſlaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie,
but to get a commiſſion that GOD
would make him Knight Marſhall ouer the
world, to ſlay and kill as many as hee hated:
like the bramble, which ſet it ſelfe on fire firſt,
and then fiered all the wood.</p>
            <p>Peter deſcribing the diuels walke, ſaith, that
he goeth about: The diuel ſaith, that he goeth
a compaſſing. Peter puts in, <hi>ſeeking whom hee
may deuoure:</hi> the diuell leaues out deuour, and
ſayth no more, but that he compaſſeth. This
circular walke is peculiar to the diuell, and
therfore may be called the diuels circuite. All
other creatures go forward but the diuell go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about, which may well bee applied to the
craftie diuell, becauſe to goe about, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vndermine: when he meaneth
he will deſtroy you, then we ſay, he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
you: ſo when the diuell compaſſeth, then
<pb n="1065" facs="tcp:17992:498"/>
beware leſt he deuour. For the diuell goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
men, as the Fowler goeth about the lark
to ſnare her; as the theefe goeth about the
houſe, to robbe it; as the yuie goeth about the
oake, to kil it. The diuels walk is a ſiege, which
goeth about but to find an iſſue to goe in: for
he goeth about but vntil he can get in to be a
poſſeſſor. He is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to be a compaſſer. The
firſt name the diuell hath in Scripture, is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
he is a Serpent, &amp; ſo are his waies like a
Serpent, which windeth himſelf like a circle.</p>
            <p>As GOD is ſayd to make an hedge about
men, ſo here the diuel is ſaid to make an hedg
about men: but this is an hedge of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that is an hedge againſt temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
As Dauid ſaith, the Angels compaſſe vs, ſo
might hee ſay, the diuels compaſſe vs, Sathan
compaſſeth, and man is compaſſed. Sathan is
like the circumference, and man is, as it were,
the Centre: that is, temptations goe round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and he dwelleth in the middeſt of
them. Thus much of Compaſſing: now what
he doth compaſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come from Compaſſing the earth.</hi> This is
the diuels pilgrimage, from one ende of the
earth to the other, &amp; then to the other againe,
and then backe againe, like a wandring Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
which ſeeketh his trafficke where hee
can ſpeed cheapeſt. I haue heard of ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers
which haue gone about the earth, but
<pb n="1066" facs="tcp:17992:499" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I neuer heard of any that had ſeene all parts of
the earth but this olde Pilgrime Satan, which
hath been in heauen, and in paradiſe, and in
the earth, and in the ſea, and in hell, and yet
hath not done his walke, but like the Sunne
which courſeth about the earth euery day: ſo
there is no day but Satan ſeeth euery man
vpon earth: as a compaſſe hath no end, ſo hee
makes no ende of compaſſing. Becauſe he is
ſuch a compaſſer of the world, therefore Paul
calleth him <hi>The God of this word,</hi> not a peece
of the world, as Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or Ireland, or France,
or Germanie, or Spayne, but of the world, that
is, of all the countries, and cities, and townes,
and villages, and houſes. The Pope talkes of
his kingdome, how many Prouinces are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the diuels circuit is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the Popes: one would thinke that he
could neuer tend halfe his flocke, becauſe he
is Vicar of ſo great a Monarchie, and yet he is
neuer non-reſident. You may ſee his ſteppes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
where ſo brim and freſh, as though they
were printed in aſhes. If God make you ſee
your country naked, your Temples deſolate,
your Cities ruined, your houſes ſpoyled, you
will ſay the Spanyards haue been heere: ſo
when you ſee your mindes corrupted, your
hearts hardened, your willes peruerted, your
charitie cooled, your Iudges bribers, your
Rulers perſecutors, your Lawyers brablers,
<pb n="1067" facs="tcp:17992:499"/>
your Marchants vſurers, your Landlords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners,
your Patrones ſymoniſts, your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
loyterers, you may ſay the diuell hath
been here. Seeing then theſe weedes growe
in euery ground, you may beare the diuel wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that he doth compaſſe all the earth. If a
man loue his friend, he will ſay, I will goe an
hundred miles to doe him good: but if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
hate a man, he wil goe a thouſand miles to
doe him hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The diuel doth not goe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
like a King, only for delight, but all the
way as he goeth, Peter ſaith, <hi>He ſeeketh whom
he may deuoure.</hi> The diuel goeth a viſiting, he
will teach the ſicke how they ſhall recouer
their health, hee will whiſper the poore how
they ſhall come by riches, he will tell the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
how they ſhall redeeme their libertie:
but to deuoure is the ende of his viſitation.
Therefore Peter called him a Lyon, and ſaid,
that he went about: and told vs that he ſought
as he went: at laſt he ſaith, to deuour, &amp; there
he ends, ſhewing that deuouring is his ende.
Now you ſhall heare whom hee compaſſeth,
and to what he compaſſeth, and how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth.
When it is ſaid, that the diuell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
the earth, it is meant, that he compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the men of the earth: out of which I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
firſt of all creatures he compaſſeth men:
ſecondly, that he compaſſeth all men, and by
conſequence, that he compaſſeth good men.
<pb n="1068" facs="tcp:17992:500"/>
The diuell is like an Archer, and man is his
marke, and temptations are his arrowes. As
Peter is called a fiſher of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo the diuell may
be called a hunter of men: for of all creatures
his enuie is onely to men, becauſe man was
made to ſerue GOD, and inherite the ioyes
which hee hath loſt: therefore he is called no
ſlear, but a manſlear. When there are no men
vpon earth, then the diuell will compaſſe the
earth no more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he aſſaulteth all men, like Iſmael,
which was againſt al. It is ſaid of Saul and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<hi>Saul hath ſlaine his thouſand, and Dauid
his tenne thouſand:</hi> but if you put in Satan, you
may ſet vp the number, and ſay, Satan hath
ſlaine his hundred thouſand. As there is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of men, ſo there is a legion of diuels: that
as they ſaid Peters angell, ſo they may ſay Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
diuell: for Chriſt would not haue called
Peter Satan, if Satan had not backed him: as
death killeth all, ſo the diuell tempteth all:
when hee hath Eue, hee hunteth for Adam:
when he hath Adam, he hunteth for Caine: as
the father was tempted, ſo muſt the ſonnes: as
the mother was tempted, ſo muſt her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Euery man but Chriſt may ſay, I haue
been ouercome, but Chriſt himſelfe cannot
ſay, I haue not been tempted. In the Spaniſh
Inquiſition the Proteſtants are examined, but
the Papiſts ſlip by: but in the diuels Inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="1069" facs="tcp:17992:500" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Papiſt, and Proteſtant, and Atheiſt, and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,
&amp; all are examined. He is not a captaine
of forties, nor of fifties, nor of ſixties, nor of
hundreds, but hee is Generall ouer all which
fight not vnder Chriſts banner: he poſſeſſed
the two Gergeſites, which were men, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
Mary, which was a woman: he poſſeſſed
the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſon, which was a child. Nimrod is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a mightie Hunter which killed beaſts, but
this is a mighty hunter which killed Nimrod
himſelf, God keep vs out of his chaſe. Thirdly,
he warreth againſt the righteous, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe
they are righteous: as God makes the barren
fruitfull, &amp; the fruitfull to beare more fruite, ſo
the diuell would haue them ſerue him, which
ſerue him not, and they which ſerue him to
ſerue him more: &amp; therfore as the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with Dauid, ſo the diuel encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred with
Dauid, and with Dauids Lord: he which gaue
him leaue here to tempt Iob, was after te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted
himſelfe, although the net brake, and the bird
eſcaped: yet as he tempted Chriſt thriſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and as he deſired to ſift Peter more then
other, ſo they that follow Chriſt, and are like
Peter, are ſifted more then other. For this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is like the viper which ſeaſed vpon Paul.
Among many which ſtood by the fire, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
choſe out Paul, and lighted vpon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the reſt: ſo if one bee holier then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this viper will battaile with him, and
<pb n="1070" facs="tcp:17992:501"/>
there is great reaſon why the godly are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more then the wicked; becauſe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
are his ſeruants, and doe tempt others.</p>
            <p>As he tempteth all men, ſo he tempteth to
all ſinnes: for hell and the diuell, are alike:
therefore as hel is neuer filled with ſinners, ſo
the diuell is neuer filled with ſinnes: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he had made Peter deny his maſter
once, he made him deny him twiſe, and when
he had made him denie him twiſe, hee made
him deny him thriſe. For this cauſe our ſinnes
are counted amongſt thoſe things which are
infinite, becauſe the diuell and our fleſh meet
together euery day to ingender newe ſinnes.
All the diuels riches is in baytes, hee hath a
packe full of othes for euery one which will
ſweare, a pack full of lyes for euery one which
will deceiue, a pack full of excuſes for euery
one which will diſſemble. As he dooth goe
through the ſtreetes, into euery ſhoppe he
caſts a ſhort meaſure, or a falſe balance: as
hee paſſeth by the Tauernes hee ſets diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt friends: as he paſſeth by euerie
Inne, hee caſts a payre of Cardes, and a payre
of Dice, and a payre of Tables: as hee paſſeth
by the Courtes, and findes the Lawyers at
the barre, hee caſts among them falſe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
forged writings, and counterfeite
ſeales.</p>
            <p>Thus in euery place where he comes (like a
<pb n="1071" facs="tcp:17992:501" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foggie miſt) he leaues an euill ſauour behinde
him. The murmuring of Moſes, the diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Abraham, the idolatrie of Aaron, the
inceſt of Lot, the dronkennes of Noah, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie
of Dauid, the flight of Ionah, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
of Peter, name Satan, &amp; thou haſt named
the very ſpawne of all ſinnes, which with his
taile plucked downe the ſtarres from heauen.
How many hate their enemies, &amp; friends too,
and yet imbrace this enemie, becauſe he kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
when he betrayeth, as though he would
not betray. Auarice ſaith, I will make thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable:
tyrannie ſaith, I will make thee dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
ſloth ſaith, I will make thee beautifull: va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
ſaith, I will make thee merrie: prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſayth, I will make thee beloued: So the
poore ſinner ſtands diſtract how he may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
all ſins at once, ſeeking grapes of thiſtles,
and roſes of thornes.</p>
            <p>As he tempteth to all ſinnes, ſo he tempteth
by all meanes: for the name of a compaſſer
doth import a cunning tempter. There is craft
in compaſſing: the Hunter maketh a raile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Deere, as though he would gard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
when he meaneth to take ſome of them: the
Fowler goeth about the bird as if he did not
ſee her, when he comes to ſnare her. If men
haue ſo many ſleights to compaſſe their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
how can the compaſſer himſelfe hold his
<pb n="1072" facs="tcp:17992:502" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fingers? if the Serpents ſeed be ſo ſubtil, what
doe you thinke of the old ſerpent, who hath
been learning his trade euer ſince the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
If mens trades may be called crafts, the
diuels trade may be called craft? Herod is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a fox, but this fox taught him his ſubtiltie:
this is he that prepared flatterers for Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
which prepared lyers for Ahab, which

Sorcerers for Pharao, which prepared
witches for Saul, which prepared wine for
Benhadab, which prepared gold for Achan,
which prepared a ſhip for Ionas, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a rope for Haman, he goeth not about
for nothing. But this is the firſt tricke of his
compaſsing, he marks how euery man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
what he loues, what he hateth, what
he feares, &amp; what he wants: &amp; when he hath
the meaſure of his foot, then he fits him. Aske
what you will, heere is he which offered the
whole world. What? ſhall Ionah ſtay for want

This is the profite wee ſhould make of other
mens faults, like a pearle which is taken out of
the ſerpent: when we ſee our brothers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
it ſhould moue vs to compaſſion of him,

Am I wiſer then Salomon? Am I chaſter then

place, where it is eaſie to ſlide, and hard to get

with their clothes, now vp, now downe
at a ſtrawe, ſo ſoone we fall from God, &amp; ſlide
from his word, and forget our reſolutions, as
though wee had neuer reſolued. Man goeth
forth in the morning, weake, naked, and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to fight with powers, and principalities,
the diuell, the world, and all their adherents,
and whome doth hee take with him but this
fleſh, a traytor, ready to yeeld him vp at euery

the ſide of a hill, alwaies declining, and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
the fleſh muffleth him to make him
ſtumble, the world catcheth at him to make
him fall, the diuell vndermineth him to make
him ſinke, and crieth ſtil, Caſt thy ſelf downe,
<pb n="1090" facs="tcp:17992:505" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and when he falleth, he goeth apace, as Peter,
who denied thriſe together; and when hee is

            </p>
            <p>So earneſtly muſt we call vpon our ſoules,
that we be not wearie of well doing: for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
are the children that neuer began, then
Iudas, whoſe ende was worſe then his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Wiſedome and Righteouſneſſe are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie

but he which leaueth his righteouſnes to liue

fornication, and is diuorſed from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
If thou wert like the Vine, or the Oliue,
or the Figge tree, they would not leaue their
grapes, or their fatneſſe, or their ſweetneſſe, to

be like the Bramble, what wilt thou doe when
the fire comes? As this is a memorandum to
all, ſo eſpecially let him that ruleth, and him
that teacheth, take heede leſt he fal: for if the
Pillers ſhrinke the Temple ſhakes, as when a
great Tree is hewen downe, which is a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
to the beaſts, and a neſt to the birdes,
many leaues, and bowes, and twiggs fall with
it: ſo many ſtande, and fall with them, whoſe
<pb n="1091" facs="tcp:17992:505"/>
lampes giue light to others: Euen as Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams
ſinne made Iſrael to ſinne: therefore Paul
hath giuen you a watchword, which euery
one ſhould write vpon his table, vpon his bed
&amp; vpon his nayles, leſt he forget in one houre:
for he which ſtandes now, may fall before
night. Sinne is not long in comming, nor
quickly gone, vnles God ſtop vs, as he mette
Balaam in his way, &amp; ſtay vs; as he ſtaied the
womans ſonne, when he was a bearing to his
graue: we runne ouer Reaſon, and tread vpon
Conſcience, and fling by Counſel, and goe by
the Word, and poaſt to Death, as though we
ran for a kingdome, like a Larke, that falles to
the ground ſooner then ſhe mounted vp: at
firſt ſhe retires, as it were by ſteps, but when
ſhe commeth neerer the ground, ſhe falles
downe with a iumpe: ſo wee decline at firſt
and wauer lower and lower, till we be almoſt
at the worſt, and then we runne headlong, as
though wee were ſent poaſt to hell, from hot
to luke-warme, from luke-warme to key cold,
from key cold to ſtarke dead: ſo the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoule bleedes to death, and ſeeth not his
life goe till he be at the very laſt gaſpe. Woe
bee vnto him that is guilty of this murther: if
the bloud of Abel cried for vengeance againſt
his brother Caine which ſlew his bodie, ſhall
not GOD bee reuenged for the death of the

<pb n="1092" facs="tcp:17992:506"/>
where is thy ſoule? haſt thou ſlaine it, which

            <p>Thus if you neuer knewe what good to

with as great good will as euer we loued wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes:

               <p>Be mercifull vnto all thoſe which lie in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of conſcience, for remorſe of their
ſinnes: as thou haſt made them examples, ſo
teach vs to take example by them, that wee
may looke vpon thy Goſpel to keepe vs from
deſpaire, and vpon thy lawe, to keep vs from
preſumption. Proſper the armies which fight
thy battailes, and ſhew a difference betweene
thy ſeruantes and thy enemies, as thou didſt
betweene the Iſraelits and the Aegyptians,
that they which ſerue thee not, may come to
thy ſeruice, ſeeing that no God dooth bleſſe
beſides thee. Make vs thankefull for our
peace, whome thou haſt ſet at libertie, while
thou haſt laid our dangers vpon others which
mighteſt haue laide their dangers vpon vs:
And teach vs to build thy Church in our reſt,
as Salomon builte thy temple in his peace.

becauſe I trauaile to bring forth eternall life,
my ſinnes doe not fright me, becauſe I haue

Oh that Gods mercy to me, might mooue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
