            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SLEIGHTED:
Being a Brief Reprehension of a Scornful Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
styled, The second Part of the Quakers Quibbles, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Name of Thomas Thompson; but (by some) suspected to
be the Author of the Two Pamphlets, the one entituled, The Spirit of
the Quakers Tryed; the other, Controversie Ended; with divers
others against the People called QUAKERS.</head>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Author's Account of himself, viz. <hi>I not pretending to Infallibility, my
Opinion being still, so long as we are men in this Condition,</hi> humanum est

it pleases him we should be in this State and Condition, 2 <hi>part. p.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>My Opinion is, <hi>Humanum est errare;</hi> and that would have born me out, I honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ingenuously telling the World, that I pretended to no such Infallibility, as the
<hi>Quakers</hi> do, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>If unwillingly there should happen any Mistake, to be committed by me, as possibly
there may be, considering the Weakness that all men are subject unto (unless <hi>Quakers</hi>) I

any of his Mistakes in Print, the Sequel will try him; which to do,
would not be so Disgraceful to him, as to lie under the Guilt of manifest <hi>Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Lyes</hi> and <hi>Slanders,</hi> which he is chargeable with in much more then this Tract
takes notice of.</p>
            <p>To begin with him:</p>
            <p>Touching the Two Passages he seems to take great Advantage upon in his Epistle
and much of his Pamphlet; I begin with, and state the first as followeth.</p>
            <p>1st, Whereas to convince him of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s or our <hi>Christianity,</hi> he proposed
<hi>the Gift of Tongues immediately inspired, and such Mighty Signs as were in the
Church in the Apostles dayes for Evidence.</hi> Upon this I queried thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And what if God will not bestow such Gifts and Signs now, must we therefore
be no <hi>Christians?</hi>
               </p>
               <bibl>
                  <hi> Qua. Plainness,</hi> p. 14.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>He concludes, <hi>That this Interrogation absolutely destroyes my</hi> own Cause, <hi>and
answers my self in all I writ,</hi> Argumentum ad hominem: and why so? He puts
the Case to <hi>Immediate Revelation from God, to Divine Inspiration, to being sent and
commissionated by God, and called by the Spirit to Prophesie and Preach the Gospel, as
the Apostles were, and to the Light Within, which the</hi> Quakers <hi>so much talk of, and
to the Doctrine of Infallibility, and to the Gift of Discerning of Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which he infers, <hi>What if God will not bestow such Gifts now, must we
therefore be no</hi> Christians? Epist. p. 2.</p>
            <p>The ingenuous and impartial Reader may easily suppose how he hath mannaged
the rest of his Controversie by this Beginning: How plain and evident is his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and Fallacy in this his Retorsion, and how Unchristian: as for instance,
from my implying by way of Interrogation, <hi>that we might be</hi> Christians, <hi>though
we had not the Gift of Tongues, Mighty Signs, or Outward Miracles</hi> (that were
peculiar to some <hi>Christians</hi> and Ministers in the Apostles dayes) he infers the same
<hi>putting the Case that the Dispute be about Immediate Revelation, and so to Divine
Inspiration, the Light Within, &amp;c.</hi> supposing, that if God will not bestow these
upon us now (any more then the other) are we therefore no <hi>Christians?</hi> (saith he) as if
we may as well be <hi>Christians</hi> without <hi>Immediate Revelation, Divine Inspiration, &amp;c.</hi>
as without the <hi>Gift of Tongues;</hi> and he would make my Question be speak the same
of the one as well as the other, to give away my Cause: Oh Injustice! Apparent
Partiality and False Construction put upon my words, never spoaken nor intended
by me [as my Principle] for the <hi>Gift of Tongues</hi> and <hi>Working of Miracles</hi> were
only peculiar to some in the primitive Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Whereas a <hi>Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit was given to every man to profit withal;</hi> and <hi>he that hath not the
Spirit of Christ is none of his:</hi> So that though men may be true <hi>Christians</hi> and
Ministers without the <hi>Gift of Tongues,</hi> yet not without <hi>Divine Inspiration, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light,</hi> and <hi>Immediate Revelation from God,</hi> in some Degree, more or less.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36832:4"/>
Also, as to the <hi>Spirit and Gift of Prophecy, and of Discerning of Spirits, and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miracles in a Spiritual Way,</hi> I cannot give away our Cause as to these, nor did
I ever intend to exclude those Gifts out of the Church among us; for we have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Evidence both of <hi>true Prophets</hi> and <hi>Discerning of Spirits,</hi> as a Gift given to
divers [And doth not the Apostle prefer Prophecy above Tongues, which were
for a Sign, not to them that believed, but to them that believed not? see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 5. &amp; 22, 23, 24. vers. So hast not thou plainly implyed thy self to be an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
and a Dark Man, who wants such a Sign to be shewn thee, to evidence that
we are Divinely Inspired? And yet, if we could speak with the Tongues of Men
and Angels, that were not a sufficient Evidence (of it self) to convince Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that we are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o inspired] And I must say, that though every Member in the
true Church hath not all those peculiar Gifts that some have, yet none can be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
True <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> or Living Member of the True Church (or of Christ) without
Divine Inspiration (for a Rule) or a partaking of the Spirit, Life and Power of
Christ within (<hi>viz.</hi> in an Immediate Way) which is sufficient to evidence and shew
forth it self in what Operation, Gift or Demonstration, as the Spirit pleaseth or
willeth; and not as man willeth, in his own Will and Time.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas to clear our selves from that Charge of <hi>Preferring our Books before
the Scriptures</hi> (because of the Titles given to some) after I had discovered the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justness
of the Charge, and Falseness of the Comparison, I said, <hi>Such Titles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have been not strictly, but figuratively placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some Books</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">And withal, shewed as high Titles given to Baptists Books as ours, Qu. Plainness, p. 71, 72, 73.</note> Hence he infers, That <hi>Thomas

W. P. <hi>and I charged him with Forging and
Forgeries, Slanders and Lyes, that such Titles, such Words or Sayings are not strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but figuratively placed, and put down in his Dialogues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which this Opposer vapours and triumphs, as if he had gotten some great
Prize, filling part of his Book with his Taunts and Jeers hereupon, as if he were
some singular <hi>Rhetoric<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an;</hi> but his Perversion and silly piece of Quarrel appears ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plain: For, Are there not some Figurative Phrases lawfully used? Yes. He
denyes not all Figures, he sayes; Why does he quarrel then? And how grosly and
fallaciously does he compare some Titles of our Books with those Passages in <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>'s
Dialogues, which we not only charged upon him (but also proved in our
Books) to be Forgeries, Slanders and Lyes, though affirmed by him <hi>for very
Truth?</hi> And from our Charge this Author and all his Abettors can never clear
him, by all his Shifts and Retorsions. For, supposing (as for ought this man knows
otherwise) T. H. be really guilty, as charged of <hi>Forgery, Slanders</hi> and <hi>Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
Is it as lawful to excuse this by a <hi>Figure</hi> (which must needs be the Devil's
drawn Figure) as when we treat of <hi>the Light Within being risen out of Darkness,</hi> such
a Title is placed upon the Book, as, <hi>Light risen out of Darkness:</hi> which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36832:5"/>
belongs to the Matter or Subject treated on, and is explained in the Treatise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
? Is this all one with forging <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous Stuff in other men's Names?</hi> Oh sensless Man! Is this thy Rhetorick? Dost thou make no Difference between
a <hi>Metonymical</hi> Phrase, used in a serious Sense, and a palpable <hi>Slander</hi> or <hi>designed
Forgery</hi> to render men Odious, as <hi>T. Hicks</hi> hath done, beneath the common use
of Phrases Ironical? Surely this will not blow away our Charges, nor make T. H.
<hi>much beholding to me, or his Way easie</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Which renders his Friend T. H. his Cause very lame, and sorely wounds it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then</note> (as this man rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
I have done) nor have we Cause to think, that <hi>I have
so furnished my Adversary with such Weapons as may mortally
wound our Cause,</hi> as he saith; nor is there any need <hi>for the</hi>
Quaker <hi>to wind or twine, kick, winch, slatter and flutter,</hi>
as he scornfully words it; however, he thinks he has found a <hi>Net,</hi> and <hi>is able to hold
the Leviathan,</hi> he saith. Oh silly Scorner! blush and be ashamed: Is this thy Net,
that if we use Words or Phrases in a figurative Sense in some Case, then a <hi>Lyar</hi> and
<hi>Forger</hi> may as well excuse himself by a Figure? Wilt thou grace thy Cause by such
Rhetorick, thinkest thou? Being so accustomed to equivocate and quibble thy self,
thou art ever and anon accusing us therewith.</p>
            <p>Thou sayest, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>have excluded themselves from using of Figures:</hi> Why
so? Because <hi>all Figures were ended by Christ, the Substance.</hi> Here thou art a very
silly <hi>Quibbler:</hi> Did we ever say, That Christ ended Figurative Speeches, when
he so much used them? And also, his Ministers often spoak figuratively, not only
<hi>Metaphors</hi> and <hi>Allegories,</hi> but <hi>Metonymyes</hi> also: Or have we not rather confessed
Christ, the Substance, as <hi>ending the Figures and Shaddows under the Law?</hi> See now
how thy silly Quibble is evident, and what <hi>a Scornful Fellow,</hi> as thou termest thy
self, thou hast shown thy self to be.</p>
            <p>Thy Pamphlet is made up much with Scoffs, Quibbles, gross Perversions and
Abuses, the greatest part of which I am necessitated at present to pass by, as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon thee to be an unworthy, cowardly and base-spirited Man, who shuffles
about to hide thy self, but makes no Conscience of exposing others by Name to
Infamy and Reproach; as for instance [after thou hast charged me <hi>with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutions
and Evasive Words</hi>] thou both evadest and shufflest about the Question
made concerning the Name <hi>Thomas Thompson</hi> (subscribed to both thy Pamphlets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us) as, <hi>Whether this be the real Author's Name?</hi> thou putst us off thus,
<hi>He hath a Nose in his Face, as well as any</hi> Quaker <hi>hath; what if the Author, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of</hi> Thomas Thompson <hi>had subscribed</hi> M. A. <hi>could not</hi> W. P. <hi>have joyned N.
and then have read it thus, A Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>?</hi> and sayes, <hi>It is happy for him that I am so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
and that my Light leaves me into so much Darkness of the Author—Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Author be a Private Person; what if he dwells 50 or 60 Miles from</hi>
London? &amp;c. pag. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And what Evasions and Shufflings is here? Hast thou not bewrayed thy own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36832:5"/>
Equivocation, and that the Author's Name is not <hi>Thomas Thompson?</hi> A shuffling
Apology of the like Nature we have in the Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The Spirit of
the</hi> Quakers <hi>Tryed,</hi> p. 44, 45. wherein the Author (it is supposed this same) gives
his Reasons why he is afraid to discover his Name.</p>
            <p>But what doth my Person signifie to the Merit of the Cause (<hi>sayest thou</hi>) that is
that which they ought to mind, if they were ingenuously honest, and not my Person?
&amp;c. p. 12.</p>
            <p>It is very likely thy Name and Person would neither add to the Merit of (nor
grace) thy Cause: Thou art very Cautious and Timorous thy Name or Person
should be discovered, and here hast gotten a Pretence that stands in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, while thou makest no Conscience of scurrilously abusing other men's
Names in Print, with a Multitude of scornful Reflections upon <hi>G. Whitehead, W.
Penn,</hi> and others, and not only so, but upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, with which
thy Pamphlet is much stuffed, short of all Seriousness and Sobriety: Where is thy
Conscience and Religion? Is it all devoured with Lightness, and turned into Scorn?
Dost thou think to terrifie us with using such a <hi>Liberty of Speech</hi> as thou tellest of,
pag. 7?</p>
            <p>And hast not thou made use of such <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>unmanly Artifices</hi> as thou tellest of,
pag. 12, as namely, <hi>to be Angry and Waspish,</hi> and therein to reflect upon Persons?
What is then become of thy Cause?</p>
            <p>And when did we ever tell thee, That <hi>we would have thee guided by our Sufferings
meerly?</hi> p. 8. Herein thou pervertest: But hast thou not formerly perceived some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Religion and <hi>Christianity,</hi> as the Ground of our giving up to suffer?
However, we are satisfied, that we suffer as <hi>Christians,</hi> and that the Presence of
God hath been with us in many Sufferings and Tribulations, and that his Presence
and Power is with us to this day, whatever Mockers and Apostates say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>I deny all Prejudiced Angry <hi>Anabaptists</hi> Spirits, p. 15.</p>
            <p>Dost thou so? Deny Prejudice and Anger in thy self then: Why hast thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
so much then (like an Envious <hi>Socinian</hi>) for the Angry <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> as one
greatly possest with the Leaven of their Spirits?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for Craftily taking thee for a</hi> Baptist, <hi>or jumbling thee with them.</hi> I did not,
nor do take thee for a <hi>Baptist;</hi> though I did look upon thee as having jumbled thy
self as a Consederate with them, or an Assister of them against us; I have Ground
to think who thou art, and possibly in time thou mayest be more manifest, for thy
creeping underly Work of Strife, and dark Attempts against the Lord's People.
And whereas to clear the <hi>Baptists Innocency</hi> touching thy other Pamphlet, thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
these words, viz. <hi>I do hereby declare once more, and affirm, as in the Presence
of God, that no</hi> Baptist <hi>nor</hi> Anabaptist, <hi>so called, did see that my Epistle to</hi> W. P. <hi>till
after I had writ it,</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36832:6"/>
Very like so; how should they? But to take thy Intention; If they did not
see any part of it, nor advise thee in the writing of it, this clears them not
from seeing or approving it for Publication, nor thee from being a Partial Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of them in their <hi>Socinianiz'd</hi> Cause, which it seems is very <hi>lame</hi> therefore, and
like to be more lame and defective, if they leave it in thy hands to mannage: It
is well, if while they are contending for the <hi>Humanity of Christ,</hi> they do not at
length oppose or further deny his <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>clearing thy self of Contradictions,</hi> thou art so far from it, that I think I
can easily make it appear to any indifferent Person, met thou hast added divers more
<hi>Contradictions, Confusions</hi> and <hi>Gross Perversions;</hi> as also can as easily remove thy
Charge of Contradictions or Inconsistencies, which thou hast framed against Me,
<hi>W. P. G. F. G. K. J. C.</hi> &amp;c. but at present I count it not worth my Labour or
Time particularly to enervate them, except thou wouldst appear and shew thy self,
like a Man, not afraid to discover thy self or Name: but it appears in thy hiding
and obscuring thy self under another Name, as divers think, thou hast the more
Liberty to traduce and abuse thy Neighbours, or such as have wished thee well,
and are not willing to render thee Evil for Evil. But if thou wilt enter into any
serious Debate about Principles, come forth and shew thy self, and do not use such
Equivocal Subterfuges: I proffered thee fair enough in my Letter to thee, when
I desired but so much Civility from thee, as to <hi>have an Hour's Discourse with thee in
the Presence of Two or Three of thy Friends and mine, that I might have shewn thee,
wherein I apprehend the Truth, my Self and my Friends wronged, in divers Passages
of thy Book;</hi> proffering, <hi>either to come to thy House, or to meet thee, if I might
know where:</hi> But instead of either, thou shuffledst me off with a long Letter,
subscribed T. T. neither letting me know where thou dwellest, nor where I might
meet with thee; pretending some <hi>Circumstances of thy Occasions would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
admit;</hi> with some other trivial Allegations. A strange Put-off! What,
not spare an Hour's Time to discourse or examine thy own Injuries and yet can
take many Hours to write Pamphlets thereof against us? Oh Timorous Man!
What sorry Shuffling art thou fain to make use of?</p>
            <p>And as concerning our <hi>Confession of the Christ of God,</hi> both as to his <hi>Divinity</hi> and
<hi>Manhood,</hi> we have not been nor are ashamed thereof; and instead of proving us
guilty either of <hi>Equivocations</hi> or <hi>Confusions,</hi> therein it may be easily made appear,
how far thou hast brought forth both, together with many impertinent and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Cavils against us thereupon: And as for the <hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Deity of the Son of God,
and his Sonship,</hi> and being <hi>Christ before he took Flesh,</hi> thou art so far from confessing
this with us, that thou makest a meer Scoff at our serious Account thereof, p. 30, 31.
Telling me of <hi>a pretty Medley of Hypocrisie, Quibbling and Confusion, and deviating
from Scripture-Language in speaking of the Divine Nature, or Word cloathed with the
Most Holy Manhood being the Christ.</hi> But is this a Truth in it self, yea or Nay?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36832:6"/>
What! is the <hi>Socinian</hi> or <hi>Biddlean</hi> Proselyte offended at our confessing the Divinity
of Christ so much as we do, when he dares not appear ingenuously and publickly
to state his own Principle? But whatever he thinks of our deviating from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Language,
or of opposing our selves therein

in our own Vindication, to use any words that are not expresly laid down in
Scripture, it is in Condescension, and not for Contention [Note, that this Man
boggles at and evades my Eight plain Questions in pag. 22, 23. of <hi>Q. Plainness,</hi>
about the Son of God; and instead of giving any ingenuous Answer, he meerly
Triffles, Quarrels, Contemns, Retorts, Questions, &amp;c. through much of his

            <p>Passing by at present many Injuries and Falshoods, and scornful Cavils against my
self. I must take notice of one Abuse against <hi>Samuel Fisher,</hi> pag. 54. and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
p. 59, 89. where thou thus chargest him, <hi>That he positively asserts the Scriptures
to be a Nose of Wax; yea, and saith, it is capable of being no other;</hi> and for this
quotes <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s <hi>Additional Appendix,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>Thou art here very positive in thy Charge, which indeed is a Charge of a
high Nature; But hast thou dealt honestly or truly in this? Was it <hi>S. F</hi>'s positive
Assertion concerning the Scriptures themselves? Or did he speak it with Reflection
upon them <hi>who make or render the Scriptures no better then a Nose of Wax</hi> by their
<hi>own various Interpretations?</hi> Though he be Dead, yet he speaketh for himself so
much as may detect thy Injustice and Abuse against him; where treating of the then
Priests Confusion, or going round, &amp;c. about the Transcriptions and Translations
of their Text, which they take to be <hi>their Rule</hi> (he thereupon addeth) <q>Which
were they never so certain and entire, by answering to the first Original Copies,
yet are not capable to be (to all men) any other then a Lesbian-Rule, or Nose of
Wax; forasmuch as even where men have them (as half the World has not)
they are lyable to be Wrested and Actually Twisted Twenty Wayes by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whose Expositions, Senses and Meanings (which are as Many and Various
as the Thoughts, and Conceits, and Inventions of the Men are, who comment upon
them) must be the Rule, &amp;c.</q> see his <hi>Additional Appendix</hi> to his <hi>Rusticus ad Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicos,</hi>
pag. 21. Now judge (serious Reader) whether it be <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s
own positive Assertion, That the Scriptures are <hi>a Nose of Wax</hi> (in themselves) or
whether that they are not rather made so (or no better) by such as Wrest and Twist
them? What a manifest Perverter is this Man! Surely the Lord will rebuke him,
and all perverse Opposers and Perverters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36832:7"/>
Whereas thou sayest, That the <hi>Baptists</hi> have this to say for themselves, <hi>They do
not pretend to Immediate Divine Revelations and such Inspirations, nor to a Gift of
Infallibility, nor yet to any such Immediate Commission from Heaven, as the</hi> Quakers
do, viz. <hi>to go forth as Prophets and Apostles,</hi> p 56.</p>
            <p>I say, the <hi>Baptists</hi> are then greatly declined from what many of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at first, as may be seen in divers of their ancient Books; wherein they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<hi>Inspiration,</hi> and confest to <hi>the Sufficiency of the Spirit's Teaching,</hi> and being

the Spirit's Teaching,</hi> commended by <hi>W. Kiffin; D. King</hi>'s <hi>Way to Sion; T. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s
<hi>Works,</hi> with many others: Hast thou mannaged the <hi>Baptists</hi> Cause well, in
saying, <hi>They do not pretend to Immediate Revelations, Inspirations, &amp;c.</hi> contrary to their
former Testimonies? And whether we or they will shew more or greater Evidence,
Time, Tryals and Sufferings will further manifest, as it hath already: God hath
made our Testimony both evident and effectual in many Consciences, through our
Travails and Suffering as <hi>Christians;</hi> wherein he hath appeared with us and for us,
and stood by his Prophets and Faithful Witnesses among us. As for thy <hi>Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
between the</hi> Quakers <hi>and</hi> Muggleton in both thy Pamphlets; there is enough in
it to manifest how Unjust, Irrational &amp; Dishonest thou art therein; it will neither
