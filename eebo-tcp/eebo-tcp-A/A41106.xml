            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint JOHN being baniſht into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> though the perſecuters of the Goſpel thought to doe him a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, yet the Lord turned it unto his great good: For the place of his exile was like <hi>Pauls</hi> third Heaven unto him, he was raviſht in the Spirit on the Lords day, and had abundance of revelations vouchſafed unto him, of the things that ſhould occurre in the Church, and out, from thence unto the end of the world. Before which he hath a charge given him to write to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia, chap.</hi> 1. the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> theſe foure are written unto in the ſecond <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> the other three are written unto in this: the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Now that which I have choſen to handle, and if God afford liberty, I deſire to goe through it, is the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42059:8"/>
Epiſtle unto the Church of <hi>Sardis;</hi> wherein we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Inſcription, containing a ſpecification whom the Epiſtle is ſpecially directed unto. <hi>And to the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Subſcription, containing a deſcription of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the King of the Church: <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres.</hi> I call it a ſubſcription, becauſe in our letters we uſe to ſubſcribe our names, or to write our names beneath at the latter end. But it may be called rather a <hi>ſupraſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as Kings write their names above for honours ſake, ſo does Chriſt the King of Sion, write his Name above.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſubſtance or matter of the Epiſtle, <hi>I know thy works, that thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead. Be watchfull, &amp; ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found thy works perfect before God, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the concluſion, <hi>He that overcommeth, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white raiment, &amp;c. v.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, the Inſcription, <hi>And unto the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write.</hi> In which words Saint <hi>John</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected whom to inſcribe this Epiſtle unto, and that is, <hi>unto the Church which is in Sardis:</hi> but eſpecially unto the Angel of it, that is, the Miniſter, or Miniſters of it: for that's the meaning of <hi>Angel</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Subſcription, or rather <hi>ſupraſcription,</hi> that contains the deſcription of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom the Epiſtle is ſent, and he is deſcribed by two Royalties, the firſt is, in having of the ſeven Spirits of God. <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> that is, that hath power to ſend the holy Ghoſt unto all the Elect: for ſo the holy Ghoſt is called <hi>the ſeven Spirits that are before the Throne, Rev.</hi> 1. 4. He meanes there the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42059:8"/>
holy Ghoſt, not as though there were ſeven holy Ghoſts, but he is expreſſed in the plurall number in regard of the abundance of graces that he infuſes into his Churches; and the number ſeven is rather taken then any other number, partly becauſe this number is put for a perfect number, as implying the perfection of his influence, &amp; partly becauſe of the preſent buſineſſe in hand, for here he writes to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath Spirit enough to ſend forth into them all. This is his firſt Royalty, that he hath the ſeven ſpirits of God. Another Royalty of his is, that he hath the ſeven Starres, that is, the ſeven Paſtors of theſe Churches, Chriſt hath them all in his hand, it is he that preſerves thoſe Miniſters that are faithfull; he hath power to raiſe them up, to gift them, to protect them, to defend them; and they are called Stars, becauſe they are to ſhine in the firmament of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the ſubſtance and matter of the Epiſtle, it containeth three parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Reproofe, and the reproofe is in theſe words, <hi>I know thy works;</hi> that is, I know them all, and they are ſtark naught for the moſt part, what ever they ſeem; they may ſeem to be very good, but I tell you plainly, I know them all what they be, <hi>q. d.</hi> generally they are ſtark naught; and then he inſtances in particular, as for example, thy dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart in Religion, <hi>Thou haſt a name to live, but thou art dead;</hi> that is, thou goeſt for an excellent Miniſter, and and excellent Church, ye doe profeſſe Religion very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a goodly manner, that to ſee to thou art alive, and thou art taken ſo too of all thy Neighbour-churches, they all think and hope thou art alive; but the truth is, thou art dead, the grace of life is hardly in thee at all. This is the firſt, the Reproof.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, here's a remedy annexed: for he does not reprove them out of any ill will, but for their good,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42059:9"/>
and ſo he preſcribes them a remedy, and the remedy is twofold. The firſt is, <hi>To ſtrengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die. q. d.</hi> as many of you as are not quite and clean dead, ſtirre up your ſelves, quicken up your hearts: and this is amplified by ſhewing how they ſhould doe thus: O, <hi>be watchfull,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>q. d.</hi> that is the reaſon why ye languiſh in this faſhion, and yee will languiſh more and more becauſe yee are not watchfull: therefore <hi>Be watchfull:</hi> and alſo by rendring a motive to preſſe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; <hi>For I have not found thy works perfect before God;</hi> that is, thou art hardly ſincere a jot, thou art full of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and rottenneſſe, and formality, and thou wilt loſe all thy labour if thou doſt not look well about thee: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhake up thy ſelfe, and <hi>ſtrengthen the things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi> This is the firſt remedy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond remedy is, <hi>to repent,</hi> and this is amplified by ſhewing how, and that is two wayes: Firſt, <hi>Remember how thou haſt received and heard;</hi> that is, conſider how thou haſt been taught, and bewaile thy declinings: for thou art hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly departed from what thou haſt learned in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hold faſt,</hi> that is, ſo bewail thy warpings, &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and degeneratings, that thou mayſt get up againe, hold thee faſt there when thou art up. Now leſt they ſhould neglect the uſing of this remedy, the Lord Jeſus ſharpens his ſpeech with a threatning, telling them the danger, if they will not be awakened: If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thiefe, and thou ſhalt not know what houre I will come upon thee. This is the ſecond part of the matter of this Epiſtle, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another part of the matter of this Epiſtle is, a commendation of ſome particular perſons in the Church, that were not carried away in the deadneſſe of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42059:9"/>
the times, and theſe he does praiſe very much, and he gives them an excellent promiſe; the praiſe is in theſe words: <hi>Thou haſt a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments;</hi> that is, there be ſome among you, though they be but a few, that have not been ſutted and ſoyled with others bad examples; though others be dead, yet they are not dead too for company: and then the promiſe is to them in theſe words, <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white;</hi> that is, I will give them the grace of repentance, and I wil keep them unſpotted unto my heavenly Kingdome and glory. And he addes a reaſon in theſe words: <hi>For they are worthy,</hi> not as though they did merit repentance and glory; no, but they are worthy in Chriſt, and Chriſt hath made them meet to be made partakers of this mercy. Thus you ſee the matter of the Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt thing is the concluſion of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and that is in the fifth and ſixth verſes, <hi>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſhall be cloathed in white raiment, &amp;c.</hi> In which words we have the concluſion of the Epiſtle, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two parts:</p>
               <p>Firſt, a promiſe to every one that overcometh, <hi>He that overcomes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a precept to command every gracious Saint to attend to theſe things. The promiſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is to be conſidered to whom it is made; it is made <hi>to him that overcometh:</hi> that is, ye know there is to be a holy warre againſt all manner of ſin, and all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the policies of Satan, and all the alluring baits of the world, and all the inclinations of the fleſh. Now he that overcomes all theſe, which is no other but one that is born of God, who alone is able to overcome, <hi>He that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes,</hi> this is the party to whom it is promiſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what it is that is promiſed. Here bee three things that are promiſed to him that overcomes: Firſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42059:10"/>
                  <hi>White raiment; He ſhall be clothed in white raiment;</hi> that is, he ſhall be preferred to everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, and hee ſhall walk in triumph in a conquerours robe. Secondly, a permanent and laſting name in the Booke of life, <hi>I will not put out his name out of the Book of life,</hi> that is, there be many hundreds that are written in the book of life in the judgement of men, and in the hope of men; but in the end the Lord blots them out, he makes it appeare, that their names are not there: But this man ſhall never bee blotted out thence. As he hopes his name is enrolled there, ſo it ſhall for a certain appeare to be enrolled there, and it ſhall never be croſſed out. Thirdly, Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of that mans name before his Father and his holy Angels: <hi>And I will confeſſe his name before my Father and his holy Angels;</hi> that is, I will acknowledge him to be mine. Thus you ſee the firſt thing, the promiſe which is made to him that overcomes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the concluſion is a precept to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand every gracious Saint to attend to theſe things, and that is in the ſixth verſe; <hi>He that hath an eare to heare, let him heare what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe in their order, and firſt of the <hi>Inſcription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to the Angel of the Church of Sardis, write.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Angel</hi> he means not the Angels of Heaven, no<note place="margin">Some tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſo too, <hi>Which have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the law by the diſpoſition of Angels, and have not kept it.</hi> Acts 7. 53. And ſo 1 Cor 11. 10. <hi>Becauſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
                  </note> nor the Angels of the bottomleſſe pit: he does not mean the Angels of heaven, becauſe they are perfectly holy, they have no ſinne in them. Now the Lord Jeſus ſpeakes of ſuch an Angel here as hath much ſinned; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him exceedingly. Neither does he mean any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the bottomleſſe pit, becauſe they are perfectly evill, they have no ſpirituall goodneſſe at all in them. Now the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks of ſuch an Angel here, whom though he reproves for many things amiſſe, yet he commends him too for ſome gracious things; and therefore he can be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42059:10"/>
Angell of the bottomleſſe pit. It remains then, that a Metaphoricall Angel is here underſtood, and that is the Miniſter of the Church. Now as the Angels are called Miniſters, <hi>Bleſſe ye the Lord all ye his Hoſts, ye Miniſters that doe his pleaſure, Pſal.</hi> 103. 21. So the Miniſters are called Angels, <hi>An Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, &amp;c. Judg.</hi> 2. 1. that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, a Miniſter, <hi>Phinehas,</hi> or ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or other, as it ſeems, came and preached unto the people. The point then is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Miniſters are to be Angels, as it were.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They are Angels in ſome ſenſe.</p>
               <p>1. Angels are Spirits, yee know they are ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,<note place="margin">1.</note> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks: <hi>He maketh his Angels ſpirits, Pſal.</hi> 104. 4. they are ſpirituall creatures, their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſpirituall, their food is ſpirituall, their delights are ſpirituall, their affections &amp; minds are ſpirituall: ſo a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter though he be a Body as well as his people, yet he ſhould be a ſpiritual man. I confeſs every true Chriſtian is ſpiritual, as the Apoſtle ſayes: <hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault, ye that are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a man in the ſpirit of meeknes, Gal.</hi> 6. he ſpeakes to every true Chriſtian, he is a ſpirituall man: But a Miniſter ſhould more eſpecially be ſpirituall; nay, our own phraſes will riſe up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us, if we be not ſpirituall. Doe not we call our ſelves the Spiritualty, as though the people were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in compariſon of us? Now if we ſhould be more carnall then they, out of our own mouthes the Lord will condemne us. The truth is, many of us may be called ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men, if we will: but we are mad ſpirituall men, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>The ſpirituall man is mad, Hoſea</hi> 9. 7. Mad ſpirituall men indeed, when we are nothing leſſe then what we profeſſe our ſelves to be, when we are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall men in a mockery: yee know what a mock is brought up upon this name; people call a ſpirituall Pig, that is, the

pooreſt of all the ten, that hath no ſubſtance in it, that is given to the Miniſter: ſo many of us are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in a mockery, having no reaſon why we ſhould be ſo tearmed, but onely becauſe there is no ſubſtance in us, no goodneſſe, no holineſſe at all in us; whereas we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others in it. We ſhould be ſpiritual in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we ſhould be like <hi>animae ſeparatae,</hi> like ſpirits ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from bodily things, taken up with ſpirituall affaires, holding forth the fruits of the ſpirit; we ſhould be as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in our Pariſhes, labouring to draw people from all their carnal courſes, endeavouring to breed in them a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and a reliſh of all the things of the ſpirit of God: our Sermons ſhould not be onely moral, but ſpiritual; our carriage ſhould be a ſpiritual walking; where we come, our diſcourſe ſhould be ſpirituall, we ſhould be like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſpirits, for ſo the Apoſtle calls us, <hi>Try the ſpirits whether they be of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. that is, try your Miniſters whether they be of God, yea or no; whether their doctrine be the doctrine of life, that wil make the ſoul live: whether their converſation be after the ſpirit, leſt ye follow a falſe guide: whether their Miniſtery be the Miniſtery of the ſpirit. <hi>If any man think himſelfe to be a Prophet, or ſpirituall,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. We cannot think our ſelves Prophets, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be ſpiritual men. When our courſes are carnal, we ſin againſt our callings: for we are to bee as Angels by our places in this ſenſe, leſt our own profeſſion hit us in the teeth at the laſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Angels are creatures of another world, not of this world, though they walk up and down on Gods errands here, yet they are creatures of another world; and therefore they are called the <hi>Angels of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>Heavenly ſouldiers, Luke</hi> 2. 13. True, every child of God is a heavenly creature, but a Miniſter ſhould be in a more ſpecial manner, a creature of another world, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42059:11"/>
unto this, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I am crucified to the world, and the world unto me.</hi> The preaching of the word is called the <hi>Kingdome of heaven,</hi> ſo we that are the Preachers of it, ſhould be of heaven too, not only in regard of the news we bring, but we our ſelves that bring it, ſhould be heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones. When our Saviour Chriſt had told <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that he muſt be begotten from above, O, ſayes hee, <hi>art thou a Teacher in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things? How beautiful upon the mountains!</hi> The Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be men aloft, the world ſhould bee a vally to them beneath, they ſhould not bee Secular men. What care Angels for fine houſes, or great livings? They had rather be in the priſon with <hi>Peter,</hi> then with <hi>Herod</hi> at the Court. Doe Angels care for outward things? No, no more ſhould Miniſters. <hi>Paul</hi> was all for Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you, but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. He cared not though the great Philoſophers of <hi>Corinth</hi> took him for a Dunce in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning; Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, <hi>Paul</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his learning in that.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Angels ſtand before <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayes, <hi>Ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him, Dan.</hi> 7. 10. So the Miniſters of God are to ſtand before God, as God ſaith to <hi>Jeremy, Thou ſhalt ſtand before me, Jer.</hi> 15. 19. The Miniſters of God are to ſtand before God, to know what his pleaſure is unto the people, what meſſage he hath for them. Again, the Angels are <hi>Miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth for the good of them that are heirs of ſalvation, Heb.</hi> 1. 14. So Miniſters, they are to miniſter unto them that are the heires of ſalvation, to watch over their ſouls, to be uſefull unto them in all their wayes. Again, <hi>the Angels pitch their tents round about them that are good,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks; ſo the Miniſters, they are the Churches Angels. Whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> all are yours, they are not their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42059:12"/>
own: But as they are Chriſts, ſo next under him, they are theirs that are Chriſts, they are Miniſters by whom they beleeve, helpers of their faith; they are Gods ſervants to bring <hi>Jacob</hi> again to him. Angels are Gods meſſengers, they never come but when they are ſent from God: ſo it is ſaid of Miniſters, <hi>There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name was John,</hi> John 1. 6.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, Firſt, Here we ſee that the Miniſtery<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> is no baſe Office; the world makes a matter of nothing of Gods faithfull Miniſters; vile men will Sirra them at their pleaſure, and take them up as if they were their diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouts. But beloved, here we ſee they are as it were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God. Chriſt himſelfe the Apoſtle makes bold to call him a Miniſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Now I ſay</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter:</hi> the Apoſtle knew it was no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement unto him. <hi>Solomon</hi> when he would chuſe him his Title, and might have called himſelfe, <hi>The King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and Judah,</hi> yet he rather takes this as honorable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>The Preacher; Thus ſaith the Preacher, Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 1. The office of a Miniſter is an Angels office. When <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> perceived that his child ſhould be a Miniſter, though yet he were a little babe lying in the cradle, he admires him: <hi>And thou child ſhalt be called the Prophet of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, for thou ſhalt goe before the face of the Lord to prepare his wayes, to give knowledge of ſalvation for the remiſsion of ſins, to give light unto them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide their feet in the way of peace,</hi> Luke 1. 76, 77. The Angels of heaven never go on greater errands then theſe. When they came to the Shepheards, what did they doe? they did but tell them of the birth of Chriſt, of peace on earth, and good will towards men. Now this is the Miniſters duty, let the world think what they will of us, as though our calling were mean, and they care not much whether they heare us or no, they will not regard
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42059:12"/>
what we preach. O beloved, conſider what an office we have, we are Gods Angels unto you, <hi>to declare unto man his righteouſneſſe, Job.</hi> 33. 23. to pray men <hi>in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>to gather together the ſaints, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. Theſe are no ſmall things, no mean im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments to treat between God and Man about eternall life, to be Chriſts Paranymphs, and the friends of the Bridegroom, to deale about the getting of a wife for the Lamb, to cater for heaven, to bring in cuſtome for the Kingdome of God. The whole world hath not a greater office in it; yee cannot deſpiſe neither our perſons nor our meſſage and be ſaved, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Let a man ſo eſteem of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the ſtewards of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. q. d. O take heed how yee ſlight us, or our Miniſtery, yee cannot have the myſteries of grace without us, yee cannot have ſaving knowledge, nor regeneration, nor faith without us. I doe not ſpeak what God may doe extraordinarily; but this is Gods ordinary way: <hi>How can they beleeve on him of whom they have not heard? and how can they heare without a Preacher? Rom.</hi> 10. 4. and therefore our office is no mean office, we are as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God unto you, and people ſhould honour our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery when a Miniſter comes into the Pulpit, even as if an Angel did appeare. It is ſaid when <hi>Samuel</hi> came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the <hi>Elders of the town trembled at his coming,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, are Miniſters Angels? then they muſt be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> ye know the Angels are holy: <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him,</hi> Matth. 25. 31. They are holy all of them: ſo ſhould the Miniſters be holy; otherwiſe they may be Angels indeed, but they are evill angels, angels of darkneſſe; they are Devils if they be not holy. Every ignorant, graceleſſe, and unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Miniſter is ready to preſſe the dignity of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42059:13"/>
and what an honorable office he hath; but hee never conſiders what a Miniſter then he muſt be. If we be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, brethren, why then as we like this honorable Title, we muſt have a care to be holy, or elſe, I ſay, we are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Thoſe Angels that are not holy, are Devils. Nay, our very calling ſuppoſes us to be holy, <hi>Let thy Urim and thy Thummim be with thy holy one, Deut.</hi> 33. 8. ſo that our very calling will teſtifie againſt us, if we be not holy: We of all men ſhould labour to be holy; What, a Miniſter, and yet a drunkard? a Miniſter, and yet a whoremonger? a Miniſter, and yet without the feare of God? a Miniſter, and yet have a dead heart? O conſider what God ſayes, <hi>What haſt thou to doe to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my covenant within thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and haſt caſt my words behind thee?</hi> Pſal. 50. 16, 17. With what face can we here ſtand in a Pulpit, and preach againſt ſin, and teach our hearers to make conſcience of all their wayes, and denounce the judgements of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that doe evill, if we that condemne another do the ſame things or as bad? How inexcuſable are we, if we can preach the ſtraitneſſe of heavens gate, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſſe of the way, and the ſtrictneſſe of the account the people ſhall be forced to give at the laſt day, and lay heavie burdens on other mens ſhoulders, and we our ſelves not touch them with one of our fingers? Teach preciſely, and live looſely, teach graciouſly, and walke broadly? This is groſſe hypocriſie; act zeal and goodnes in the Pulpit, and be heartleſſe and luke-warm in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duties unto God.</p>
               <p>Again, we can never look to doe good, if we be not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as Jet will not draw if it be not clean: For how can we hope our people will follow our exhortations, if they ſee we doe not follow them our ſelves? When S. <hi>Luke</hi> had ſhewed how <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted the Chriſtians to cleave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42059:13"/>
cloſe unto God, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. preſently he gives a reaſon why he might well exhort them to do ſo, <hi>For he was a good man, full of the holy Ghoſt and of Faith, v.</hi> 24. When our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are met with for any of their ſinnes, when wee rub their conſciences with our Sermons, preſently their eye is at us, and if they ſee us to be vain and worldly, this heals them again; though the word wounded them, yet this is an eaſe to them, O think they, he is as bad himſelfe, and we ſee no ſuch holineſſe in him, and we are as faire for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he, he loves his peny as well as we, he is as ready to quarrell as we, he is as proud, and ambitious, and fearfull, and idle, as we; he loves to ſleep in a whole skin, what wil not hee doe rather then loſe his living? hee'l break the Sabbath, and teach others to doe ſo. Now, my brethren, how ſhould we abhorre this! O it ſhould prick and ſpur us up to ſtudy holineſſe of life, that ſo our Miniſtery may be powerful.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, are Miniſters Angels? Then they ſhould be<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> apt to teach, ready to preach, and to labour in Word and Doctrine. It is ſaid of the Angels, that they have wings, <hi>One of the Seraphims came flying unto me, Iſa.</hi> 6. 6. They are ready preſt to doe any thing that the Lord gives them in charge; ſo ſhould we be, or elſe how ſhould we beare the name of Angels? We muſt labour, that we may be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our labour among our people. You know the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are called <hi>Reapers,</hi> and ſo are Gods Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I ſent you to reap, John</hi> 4. 38. When a man reaps he gathers; nay, Chriſt chuſeth good Miniſters for this end, that they ſhould bring forth fruit in their places, <hi>I have ordained you that yee ſhould goe and bring forth much fruit, John</hi> 15. 16. Nay, our Saviour Chriſt ſuppoſes that all his true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are fruitfull upon ſome. Every ſower though he<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 3. 8.</note> have ſome high-way ground to ſow in, and ſome thorny ground, and ſome ſtony ground, yet he hath ſome good ground or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42059:14"/>For firſt, a good Miniſter it is the deſire of his ſoul to ſee<note place="margin">1.</note> the fruits of his labours; As a Hen, many a Hen will hardly ever off from her egges, till ſhe ſee a young chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens bill peep; nay, ſhe will ſit ſtil till ſhe die before ſhe will off. What made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo deſirous to come to the <hi>Romans?</hi> Was it onely to ſee them, and to be among them, or to take his tythes or his maintenance? No, it was that he might have <hi>ſome fruit, Rom.</hi> 1. 13. And certainly, this is the ſtudy of every true Miniſter, that he may ſee his preaching fruitfull in the converſion and ſalvation of ſome, that ſome are awakened by his means, that ſome are quickned, ſome are made to leave their ſinnes, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures unto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, does not every man count it a miſery to be<note place="margin">2.</note> unprofitable? The Lord names it as a brand upon wicked men, that <hi>they are unprofitable, Rom.</hi> 3. 12. What a wofull brand is this, when we can live two, three, ſeven, ten, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares in a place, and our ſervices are unprofitable, no man delivered out of ignorance, no man purged from his filthineſſe by our means; when our Miniſtery is a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we preach without life, and no man is tranſlated from death unto life by it? I ſay, this is to bee unprofitable, like ſalt that hath loſt his ſavour. I confeſſe the beſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may have little takings, as the beſt tradeſman may have little vent for his wares when his trading growes dead.</p>
               <p>Nay thirdly, this is the end of our gifts, that wee may<note place="margin">3.</note> profit with them; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given unto every man to profit withall,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Hath he given us knowledge? He hath given it us that we ſhould profit others with it. Hath hee given us skill in the opening and applying of the Scriptures? He hath given it unto us, that we may doe good with the ſame. And therefore, O how earneſt ſhould we be that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42059:14"/>
our Miniſtery may profit, that our pains may be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ſucceſsfull, that we may ſay with the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Lord, behold I and the Children whom thou haſt given me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is the beſt argument that God hath of a<note place="margin">4.</note> certain called us to bee Miniſters in his Church. If we have called our ſelves, and run without ſending, then no marvell if we be fruitleſſe, and doe little or no good. But if we find that God bleſſeth our labours, this is the beſt ſeal of our miniſtery: as if the arrow hit, it's a good ſign it was ſent out of the bow; it may fall out of the bow of it own accord, but then it never hits: but when it is ſent out of the bow, ye know he that ſends it, will aim; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now when it hits, that's a ſigne it was ſent indeed: ſo when a Miniſter converts peoples ſoules, this is a good ſigne that God ſent him; when a Miniſter can ſay to his people, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, The ſeale of mine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip are ye in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>though I be not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle unto others, yet doubtleſſe I am unto you: For the ſeale of my Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord.</hi> So the ſeale of us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are yee in the Lord: though I have not converted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet doubtleſſe I have converted you unto God, as he ſayes, <hi>Truly, the ſignes of an Apoſtle were wrought among you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, this is that which will give us comfort, when<note place="margin">5.</note> we lie upon our death-beds, when we can ſay, we have been faithfull in our callings, and can ſhew a token of it too, by bleſſing of our faithfulneſſe in the gaining of foules, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Theſſalonians, What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing? Are not even yee in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 19, 20. This is a pledge of our glory. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is cleare, <hi>They that turn others unto righteouſneſſe, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres, Dan.</hi> 12. 3. I doe not deny, but a wicked
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42059:15"/>
Miniſter that hath parts, and is gifted of God with an Art of ſpeaking to the conſcience, may convert; and therefore it is not a naked argument. But when a man hath had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this ſucceſſe by his faithfulneſſe, and hath ſet himſelf to doe it in Gods way indeed; what an unſpeakable comfort is this! He is not the wiſeſt Miniſter that can plot moſt for prefermet, or can preach beſt for applauſe, or the like: No, no; but he that can moſt compoſe himſelfe to doe good, <hi>He that winneth ſoules is wiſe, Prov.</hi> 11. 30. that is, as he had need to be a wiſe man, and to goe wiſely to work, that would doe it: ſo he is a wiſe man, he is wiſe to himſelf, he layes up to himſelf a good foundation of comfort againſt the world to come.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, if we can endure to be unprofitable,<note place="margin">6.</note> not to ſtirre up our ſelves, not to point and ſharpen our Miniſtery that it may pierce into mens conſciences, nor never ſtudy how to doe good, what a heavie woe will lie upon us? You read what was done to the unprofitable ſervant, he was <hi>bound hand and foot, and caſt out into utter darkneſſe, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Matth.</hi> 25. 30. O then how carefull ſhould we be to doe good, and to be effectual Preachers, that we may ſay, theſe and theſe I have been an inſtrument of good to; by the mercy of God theſe and theſe I have begotten through the Goſpel, then are we Angels indeed, that are ſent out for the good of Gods elect. I confeſs it is good to civilize our people, to abate their wickedneſſe, to make them Profeſſors, and I would to God we could ſee more of theſe effects rather then none. But to gather in Gods elect, this is an Angels work, the converſion of one ſoule is better then the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing of a thouſand. And therefore let us be diligent and induſtrious, and preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, let us con the skill of preaching, not to tickle mens itching
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42059:15"/>
eares, not ſo much to make our people ſay, our Miniſter is a fine Scholar, a good Churchman, as to rouze up the conſciences of our hearers, to pull down their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to feed their ſouls with divine meat, with the good knowledge of the Lord, to ſhew them the ſeverall wiles of Satan, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Speak thou the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſound doctrine, that the aged men be ſober and grave, &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2. 1. that is, ſo preach, as to good, to old men, to old women, to young men, to young women, to Maſters, to ſervants, to all, as it follows there; wee muſt look unto our life, that we defile not our Angels place, that we doe not undoe what we preach. Alas! if we doe not ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice all that we doe deliver, if our lives doe not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our teaching, we are like unto kine that give very good milk, but then put their feet into the paile, or throw down the paile when they have done. This is to make our preaching of no effect: and therefore as the Apoſtle ſays to <hi>Timothy, Take heed unto thy ſelfe, and to thy doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, for in doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelfe and them that heare thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. They are the beſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that carry people unto heaven; when men think to ſend people to heaven, and not goe themſelves, ſuppoſe this ſhould doe the deed, yet what will it profit us, if our people goe to heaven, and we ſtay behind, and never come there? Nay, we cannot look they will go, except they ſee us goe before them; and therefore let us do nothing that may hinder the fruitfulneſſe of our Sermons. Thus ſhall we be Angels indeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another uſe is, If Miniſters be Angels, then<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> let us know that we are mainly for Gods elect, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſayes of every elect perſon, <hi>God ſhall give his Angels charge over thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to keep thee in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all thy wayes, Pſal.</hi> 91. 11. Mark, the Angels have the charge of the elect, they are their main charge; may be they are to doe many things
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42059:16"/>
towards others, but theſe are their principall charge; ſo it muſt be with Gods Miniſters, their chiefe charge is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods elect, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>I endure all things for the elects ſake, that they may alſo obtain the ſalvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus, which is eternall glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. Wee that are Gods Miniſters, have all our gifts and graces for their ſakes; <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, &amp; ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> For what? <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee have any that feare God in our Pariſhes, wee ſhould bend our main Miniſtery unto them, and for the adding of more to them; wee ſhould not bee like thoſe wretched Miniſters that count ſuch perſons the worſt of their flock, and they doe moſt hate them, and oppoſe them, and jeere them: No, no, we ſhould moſt dearly love them, and tender them, and bend our ſelves unto them; nay, we ſhould not altogether in theſe bad times, ſtand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt drunkards, murtherers, and ſo leave the Lords Saints without their portion. The truth is, yee that live in your ungodly courſes, yee that walk after your wicked luſts, and wil not be gotten to forſake your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed doings, we could bee content to lay hell here before you in every Sermon, and ſpend our ſhot on you, all the houres that we have of preaching in the week, are little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tell you what a damned condition yee are in. But if yee wil not enter in into the ſtrait gate, we muſt not neglect them that wil; if yee will be filthy, be filthy ſtill, and if yee wil to hell, and we cannot perſwade you to live out of your ſins. Though there be but two or three that are wel-minded in our Pariſhes, we are to bend our ſelves chiefly unto them. Indeed as long as we have any hope of adding more to their company, we muſt preach points for them too. May be ſome of Gods elect are among
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42059:16"/>
you, and if there be, the Word wil find them out. I ſay, this is our main charge, to be groping for Gods elect, and when any of them appeare, to tender them moſt, ſo ſhall we ſhew our ſelves Angels indeed for the good of Gods choſen. More uſes I might make, and very many too.</p>
               <p>But I will content my ſelf with one more, and that ſhal<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> be to you that are hearers. If Gods Miniſters be Angels, then how ſhould you come to the hearing of the word of God? Even as if an Angel ſhould drop down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto you. How ſhould you receive the Miniſters of God that deſire to be faithful? Even as the <hi>Galatians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Paul,</hi> even <hi>as an Angel of God, Gal.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>yea even as Chriſt himſelfe;</hi> yee muſt not look up into the Pulpit, as ſeeing nothing but a poor mortal man there, but as though an Angel of God were ſtanding there. How grave ſhould our meetings here bee? how reverently ſhould yee ſit in your Pewes? how ſacredly ſhould we ſtand in our desks? how graciouſly ſhould we deliver Gods errands, and you heare them with feare and trembling? When a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter appeares in the Congregation, it is as if an Angel of heaven appeared unto you to ſpeak unto you. O what a homely manner doe we come to Churches? the Majeſty of the Word is not ſeen; nay, we may ſpeak it with ſhame, neither by us the ſpeakers, nor by you the hearers; we do not come to the Word as if an Angel from heaven had ſpoken it. But generally moſt people ſee little more then a poore mortall creature in the Pulpit, and ſo they deal with the Word accordingly, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus yee have heard the firſt Doctrine; <hi>To the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write.</hi> I ſhould now ſpeake of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, he does not ſay, <hi>To the Angels,</hi> though there were many Miniſters in <hi>Sardis,</hi> yet he ſpeakes to them all as if they were all one.

                  <hi>one man.</hi> And then whereas he inſcribes the Epiſtle, <hi>To the Angel of the Church,</hi> though he write to all the Church, and blames and condemnes all the Church, yet he names none but the <hi>Angel;</hi> here we are taught, <hi>That a Miniſter ſhares in the good and in the evill of his Pariſh:</hi> if they bee good, it is to his praiſe; if they be evill, commonly he is guilty of it.</p>

he ſpeakes to the Miniſters there as to many, and yet S. <hi>John</hi> is to write to them all as to one Miniſter, <hi>Unto the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, write, Rev.</hi> 2. 1. noting thus much unto us, <hi>That Miniſters ſhould be all as one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;</hi> there ſhould be a ſweet harmony and a glorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and conſent and unity between them all, even as if they were all one Miniſter; ſo that the doctrine is plain. So again, <hi>John</hi> prophecying of <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and other godly Miniſters in ſucceeding ages, that ſhould mightily ſtrive againſt the primacy and domineering of the man of ſin, ſayes, <hi>There followed another Angel, ſaying, Babylon is fallen, Babylon is fallen, Rev.</hi> 14. 8. he calls them all one Miniſter, intimating unto us how that they all agree in one.</p>
               <p>I do not mean, firſt, that if one Miniſter be a drunkard,<note place="margin">1.</note> that all others ſhould be ſo too; if one be a man-pleaſer and a dawber, that all others ſhould be ſo too; that if one be an ignorant Sir <hi>John,</hi> all others ſhould be ſo too; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unity is not good, there is unity as our Saviour Chriſt ſhewes, even among the very Devils in Hell. <hi>For if Satan be divided againſt Satan, how can his Kingdome ſtand? Mat.</hi> 12. 26. There is a unity among rogues and theeves, <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>caſt in thy lot among us, and letus have one purſe, Pro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. 14. There was unity among <hi>Ahabs</hi> foure hundred falſe Prophets, they all hung together in a ſtring, <hi>Go up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.

ſayes he, <hi>they are all dumb dogges, they cannot bark, ſleeping, lying downe, loving to ſlumber, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter, Iſai.</hi> 56. 10, 11. This is an unity the world is full of, nay and hell is full of, like the unity of <hi>Sodom</hi> againſt <hi>Lot,</hi> the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed his houſe round, both old and young from every quarter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 4. This is a Devilliſh unity, this is no true unity. True unity is in <hi>Bono,</hi> no matter how many are of one mind, and of one heart, and of one accord, if it be not an union in good, it is faction and no union, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> told the <hi>Marcionites</hi> when they brag'd of their Churches, forſooth they were the Church, ſaith hee, Waſps have their ſwarms: ſo when wicked Miniſters ſhal cry, The Church, the Church, I ſay, theſe are ſwarmes of Waſps, I doe not mean ſuch a unity; when it is not in good, the greater the unity is, the leſſe union is indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I do not mean neither, that Miniſters ſhould<note place="margin">2.</note> thus hang together in one, that if one be a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a ſon of thunder, another ſhould be ſo too. For Miniſters may be different in different auditories. Husband-men ſow their ſeed according to the diverſity of their ground; the Phyſician tempers his Phyſick according to his patients conſtitution: as long as people are of ſundry diſpoſitions, ſo certainly the Miniſters manner of preaching may be various. And therefore I doe not mean ſuch an unity nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that all Preachers ſhould be moulded alike; nay, the ſame miniſter may and muſt differ from himſelfe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come with cordials, ſometimes with corraſives, to ſing of mercy and judgment, to preach comfort to whom comfort, and vengeance to whom vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, to ſome hee muſt give milk, to others ſtrong meat, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Paul</hi> had a rod as well as the ſpirit of meekneſſe. <hi>Zacharies</hi> Paſtor was to have two ſtaves, the one called <hi>Beauty,</hi> &amp; the other cal'd <hi>Bands,</hi> &amp; ſo he was to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42059:18"/>
feed the flock, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 7. A Chirurgian hath aking tents as well as ſuppling oyle. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he was to deale with <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, he ſet his eyes on him, and called him <hi>the child of the Devil;</hi> but when he was to deale with <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> he was mild with him. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt preach't the acceptable yeare of the Lord to ſome; and to other ſome as though he were not the ſame Preacher, he had nothing but woes in his mouth. There were two mountains in <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was the bleſſing on mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> for ſome, and the curſing on mount <hi>Ebal</hi> for others.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, we doe not mean that all miniſters<note place="margin">3.</note> ſhould be the ſame in gifts and parts, and meaſure of knowledge and ſanctification; for that can never bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, every Pariſh can never be provided for alike. Starres are of different magnitudes, ſome ſtarres are greater, ſome leſſer: The Angels are not all of one rank, ſome are ordinary Angels, ſome Arch-angels, ſome are Principalities, ſome are Dominions, ſome are Thrones, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 16. and may be, thoſe that are meaneſt, ſo they be godly, and ſent of God, may doe as much good as thoſe that are more excellent; nay more, convert more, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more, ſettle more: for it is not they that work, but God by them, who is not tied unto Organs, unity is not hindred by diſparity. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Epaphraditus</hi> who was much inferior to him, <hi>his brother, and companion in labour, and fellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſouldier, Phil.</hi> 2. 25. Though <hi>Clement</hi> were a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter much meaner then he, yet he calls him <hi>his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer, Phil.</hi> 4. 3. Though <hi>Tychicus</hi> came never ſo much ſhort of him, yet he terms him <hi>his fellow-ſervant, Col.</hi> 4. 7. So that there may be unity for all this, and a gracious ſympathy and agreement betweene miniſters, though of never ſo different parts, ſo they be ſincere and cordially minded to doe good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42059:19"/>You will ſay then, What is that unity that muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong miniſters?</p>
               <p>I anſwer 1. They muſt be all competently endued<note place="margin">1.</note> with ability for the work of the miniſtery, all muſt agree in this, that they be able men in ſome meaſure. <hi>Hee hath made us able Miniſters of the new teſtament,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. able to preach to the conſcience, able to doe it with power and might, able to divide the word aright, able to give every one his portion in due ſeaſon. They are none of Gods miniſters that are not able men, that are not able to teach and to apply, to be the mouth of God unto the people, and the mouth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto God, that are not able to ſeek that which was loſt, to bring again that which is driven away, to bind that which is broken, to ſtrengthen that which is ſick. Thoſe that are not able to doe this, they are blind guides, Idol-ſhepheards, and no miniſters. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter muſt be able <hi>by ſound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1. 9. <hi>Faithfull men, able to teach others,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. This was one of the ends that <hi>Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon high, that he might give gifts unto men for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi> as one Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. and ſo as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> All Miniſters ſhould agree in this, that they be able.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they muſt be all ſent of God, though a man<note place="margin">2.</note> be never ſo able, yet if he be not ſent of God, he is not a Miniſter. Private Chriſtians many of them have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent abilities, as the text ſayes, <hi>I am perſwaded of you, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that ye are full of goodneſſe, filled with all knowledge, able to admoniſh one another, Rom.</hi> 15. 14. he ſpeakes of private Chriſtians: I ſay, they are able many of them, and there is very great uſe of their abilities too, for the good of their families, for the good of Chriſtian communion, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42059:19"/>
the like; yea, it is a ſhame that privat Chriſtians living under good means of grace, doe not grow able to teach. <hi>When for time yee ought to be teachers, yee have need that one teach you again which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, Heb.</hi> 5. 12. Mark, he ſhames privat Chriſtians that doe not grow able to teach. But yet this is not enough to make miniſters; true miniſters agree all in this, that they are ſent of God. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>I have not thruſt in my ſelfe for a Paſtor,</hi> ſayes <hi>Jeremy.</hi> They are intruders and not miniſters that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove their commiſſion from God, as the authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſayes, <hi>No man takes this honour to himſelfe, but he that is called of God as was Aaron, Heb.</hi> 5. 4. Chriſt himſelfe alledged this to beare out his miniſtery, <hi>He hath ſent me to preach deliverance to Captives.</hi> Woe be to thoſe of whom the Lord ſhall ſay, <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, and yet they run.</hi> It will be ſayd to them one day, as to the man without a wedding garment, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> The want of this is the reaſon that ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters make no more conſcience of their duty, they make no conſcience of taking paines, of ſtrict preaching, of preſſing the word upon peoples hearts, of uſing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of means to root out ſin in their Pariſh, becauſe they have no diſpenſation from God committed unto them: if their conſciences were charged with this, it would make them doe otherwiſe then they doe. The want of this is the cauſe that the miniſtery of many is impotent, they may preach all the dayes of their lives, and not one ſoule turned unto God, but themſelves and their workes periſh together; whereas Miniſters that are ſent, make the Devils roare, and fleſh and bloud chafe, their Sermons are links of iron to bind Nobles and Princes, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born hearts. The want of this is the reaſon why ſo many miniſters are vile in the peoples eyes, people care not a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42059:20"/>
whit for them, dare drink and be drunk in their company, dare talk of their roguery before them; as <hi>Amnon</hi> before <hi>Jonadab, Jonadab</hi> ask't him what he ailed he was ſo ſad: <hi>O,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I would fain lie with my ſiſter Tamar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 4. He knew before whom he was; if <hi>Jonadab</hi> had been a godly man, he durſt as well have eaten his own tongue, as have told him his baſe luſt. A godly man the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of him would have made him aſhamed, and to have bitten in his lips. When a miniſter is unſent of God, no body does reſpect him out of conſcience, they care not for his words: whereas when a miniſter is ſent, this makes him as an Angel of God when others call him all to naught, the conſcience of many will plead for him, as we ſee there of <hi>Jeremy, O this man is not worthy to die, for hee hath ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, Jer.</hi> 26. 16. There's never a ſent miniſter, but if he come in trouble, except peoples conſciences be ſeared with a hot Iron, they wil ſpeak for him in their boſomes: Alas! why is he put down? Why is he impriſoned? Why is he oppoſed? He hath ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord. So that this is the ſecond wherein all miniſters ſhould agree, they ſhould be all ſent of God, not contenting themſelves with the calling of man, without being alſo called of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they muſt all agree in the matter that they<note place="margin">3.</note> preach; the ſame word is delivered unto all miniſters to preach. <hi>Preach the word,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. The ſame Goſpel, the ſame Truths, the ſame Duties, the ſame Commandments, the ſame Promiſes, the ſame threatnings: Ye know there is one God, and one Faith, and one Baptiſme, one Lord Jeſus Chriſt; there is but one way of life, one gate to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, one ſalvation, one Bible: Now every miniſter muſt agree in this: You know all men are by Nature the children of wrath, in a damned eſtate; now all Pulpits
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42059:20"/>
ſhould agree in this, every miniſter labouring to bring their people to a ſight of their miſery by ſinne; every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhould ſhew his people what curſed creatures they are, untill they be converted and renewed; every Miniſter ſhould preſſe the evill of ſin, and open the wiles of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the guilt of the conſcience, the ſpiritualneſſe of the Law, the neceſſity of humiliation, and repentance, and amendment of life, that there is no mercy but in Chriſt, no ſalvation but by Chriſt; except people take him to live in their hearts by faith. All miniſters ſhould let their people know the terror of the Lord, the ſtrictneſſe of Gods judgements, the inſeparable connexion of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and a godly life, that no profane perſon can enter into Gods Kingdome; no hypocrite, no meer civill man; that a form of godlineſſe will not ſerve turn, that none but Saints ſhall ſtand at Chriſts right hand at the laſt day. All miniſters ſhould preach what a narrow path there is to Paradiſe, &amp; how few there bee that find it, that ſaving grace cannot ſtand with the reign of the leaſt luſt, that people muſt be pure and holy, what ever the world think of pureneſſe, and preciſeneſſe, and ſtrictneſſe, yet without this no fleſh ſhall be ſaved. If all pulpits ſounded with theſe truths, and all miniſters cried thoſe aloud, &amp; would lift up their voyces like a trumpet, and not ſpare, what a land ſhould we have? The want of unity in this matter, is the cauſe that wickedneſſe does ſo much abound: a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, a whoremaſter, a muckworm may come to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and goe away with hope that he ſhall have peace. When miniſters make the pulpit a ſcaffold, in which like Maſters of Defence they play their prizes, blazon their own wits, deſcant upon their text, as though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were a Rattle for children and fools to ſport with, toſſing it to and fro, hither and thither, as boyes at a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis: when they go about to amaze their hearers, to mount
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42059:21"/>
aloft, to be in their high phraſes, and coyned words, more like Mimicks and Comedians then Miniſters; when they ſearch into moath-eaten Friers, affect allegories, would fain be thought Linguiſts, and interlace a many of allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Latin and Greek ſentences, which a School-boy might doe with a Polyanthea: or if they ſpeak plain, they skim the truth of the Scriptures, and never dive deep to the edifying of the ſoule. May be they will preach good morall matter. But a man may goe to hell, though he doe as they teach; people may heare them a thouſand times, and no man made to cry out, What have I done? They preach of repentance, but then they open it ſo ſlightly, that a man may repent as they ſay, and be damned: they preach of faith in Chriſt, but they make it ſo broad, that thouſands have it and ſink into the bottomleſſe pit with it: they preach that ſin muſt be forſaken, and a good life muſt be led, but they handle it in that wiſe, that their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers may doe as they ſay, and yet have no more grace then a reprobate, nor ſo much neither. Now beloved, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among brethren ſhould be this, to agree in the right matter of preaching, that the word may be carved to all, as their need is, that they may ſee their own caſes, that they may underſtand the wiles of the Devil, the fallacies of their own evill hearts, the counterfets of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and new obedience, and that they may not be couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them. This is the third thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they ſhould all agree in the true manner of<note place="margin">4.</note> preaching. That which our Saviour ſayes of hearing, <hi>Take heed how yee heare, Luke</hi> 8. 18. he means of preaching too, let your Miniſters take heed how they preach. Beloved, we that are the Miniſters of God, we are to labour to turn Lions into Lambs, and to transform the heart of man, to breed new creatures unto God: and therefore it is not every kind of preaching will ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42059:21"/>1. Then Miniſters ſhould agree in preaching with the<note place="margin">1.</note> demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>not with the wiſdome of words, leſt the croſſe of Chriſt be made of no effect,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>q. d.</hi> If we ſhould preach wit, and learning, &amp; eloquence, then the death of Chriſt would be of no effect, that is, no man would be converted, Chriſt would be offered to none; therefore we muſt preach na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, to flaſh the naked word into mens conſciences, that they may ſee, Thus ſaith the Lord againſt their ſinful courſes, thus ſaith the Lord of their eſtates, this reproofe is from the Lord, this threat is from the Lord, thus ſaith the Lord, you are a wretch, this is thy ſin, and this is thy curſed condition, and it is the Lord and not I that does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. It is ſaid of Chriſt that he preacht <hi>with authority, and not as the Scribes, Matth.</hi> 7. 29. What is it to come with authority? When a man ſpeakes from God to the conſciences of men; as when a Conſtable comes in the name of a King, I charge you in the Kings name; this is to come with authority. Therefore we ſhould not come with the affectation of wit, or of reading, of fine and filed ſpeaking. You wil ſay, What, would you have us be foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in our preaching? I anſwer, Never object ſo, for it is the <hi>fooliſhneſſe of preaching, that ſaves them which beleeve,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. as one ſayes, we muſt preach Chriſt crucified in a crucified phraſe. The world would have gewgawes, and gariſh garniſhings: and why ſo? becauſe the naked Word is contrary to fleſh and bloud; like ſome eyes, they muſt have their ſilks &amp; their cypreſſes to look upon the Sun by, forſooth the Sun beams are too glorious and ſhining otherwiſe. <hi>Pedeſtris oratio,</hi> as <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeaks, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter muſt have a foot-ſpeech, and not ſpeak a horſeback, with trappings, and taſſels, and deckings. Though this be fooliſhneſſe unto ſome, yet it is wiſdom to them that are of God. <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom to them that are perfect,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42059:22"/>
Mark, they that are perfect will accept it to be wiſdome it is fooliſhneſſe onely to children and ſots, and ſuch as are not able to diſcerne. God will have his mercies hidden under homely out-ſides, that men that will ſtumble at them, may; as men hide treaſure under ſtraw; as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Baharim</hi> hid the two Worthies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a well under a courſe ſack. Can gallant preaching make people pluck out their right eyes, and deny their own ſelves and wayes? No, no, when the heart ſees it hath to doe with God, nothing but this will pull it down: away then with our own affections, let us labour to come with God into our pulpits, that people may ſee God dealing with them.</p>
               <p>2. Miniſters ſhould agree to preach differencingly, to<note place="margin">2.</note> diſtinguiſh between the pretious and the vile, the clean and the unclean; as we muſt not bruiſe the broken Reed, but deal gently with it: ſo we muſt not <hi>give childrens bread unto dogges, Matth.</hi> 15. 29. we muſt not caſt our ſeed into fallow ground: but wee muſt let the fallow ground feele our ploughes tearing: we muſt not fling pearles before ſwine, nor bitter arrowes againſt Chriſt his Lambs. This were as if we ſhould call for ſnow in Summer, and rain in harveſt. No, no, <hi>a whip for the Horſe, and a bridle for the Aſſe, and a rod for the Fools back, Prov.</hi> 26. 3. If people be like Mules, that will not underſtand, we muſt put in a Bit into their mouthes: If people will have their own wayes, our word muſt be fires, and hammers, and axes, and cheſils, and ſwords, and ſpeares, that their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies may tremble, and rottenneſſe may enter into their bones.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Why then belike we muſt have nothing in our mouthes but hell and damnation.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, No, nothing but hell and damnation for the naught.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, that will drive them to deſpaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42059:22"/>Why then let it: it were well if wee had our people there, they muſt deſpaire before they come to mercy, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſayes, <hi>O Lord, I am oppreſſed, doe thou comfort me, or undertake for me, Iſai.</hi> 38. 14. People muſt bee oppreſſed with our Sermons, we muſt lay load and burdens on their conſciences, or they will never bee fitted for comforts and Chriſts undertakings. True, the ſervants of the Lord muſt <hi>be gentle unto all men,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24. and ſuffer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of all very patiently, praying if at any time the Lord will give them repentance, that the Devill may let them goe. Nothing but hell and damnation is not good; we muſt not be like <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that would needs bee calling for fire to come down from heaven to conſume the Samaritans: no, we muſt be long-ſuffering, but yet we muſt not let a wicked man live, but we muſt give him his deaths wound by the ſtab of the Word, leſt his bloud be required at our hands.</p>
               <p>3. Miniſters ſhould agree in preaching with all their<note place="margin">3.</note> ſtrength conſtantly, and duly, not quadrageſimall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons onely, or the like: but the Apoſtle commands Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to <hi>preach in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. It is a wicked cavill of ſome, and it is the Devill that doth ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it, <hi>It is not good to cloy the people, is it not faire to preach once a Sabbath? muſt we have two, and a week daye, too? This is overmuch, this is unſeaſonable, that people ſhould trudge and trot to Sermons when they ſhould be at their callings.</hi> Well, bee it ſo, that it is out of ſeaſon, wee muſt preach out of ſeaſon too, all will be little enough. I am ſure the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> the word of the Lord came to him twice in one day, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 10, 20. <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſed conſtantly to preach twice a day, as appears in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Sermon upon the 88. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> nay in one place he ſayes he preached thrice. Doe not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my dear brethren, <hi>ſi hodie ter ſermonem,</hi> that I have preached three times this one day. And he addes this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42059:23"/>
that it was not without cauſe, in his 33. Sermon to his brethren in the Wilderneſſe. Nay, the ancient Fathers preached every day in the yeare, as it is well known to them that are uſed to read them. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſhewes this almoſt in the beginning of every Homily. And one time perceiving his hearers ſomwhat few: O (ſays he) every houre in the day is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for you to heare, nay the night is not unſeaſonable. <hi>Paul</hi> prolonged himſelfe unto midnight, ſayes he, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. I pray did the time hinder him? No though he were for a journey the next day, yet hee would not think much to break his nights reſt. Another time preaching by candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, O, ſayes he, doe you ſee this ſame lamp? take away the oyle, you put out the light; even ſo it is with the gifts of the Spirit, the dulneſſe of our hearing, the littleneſſe of our profiting at once, our readineſſe to decline except we be pricked forward, our aptneſſe to forget God, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of having the word to dwell richly in us, the duty of meditating in it day and night, do plainly enforce this preaching.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, If Preachers ſhould preach often, it would be but prating; we cannot preach often &amp; ſoundly.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is falſe: for all that I ſee, the ableſt Divines have preached the moſt often, as <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and others, and Mr. <hi>Greenham;</hi> nay, <hi>Auſtin</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>extempore</hi> that Sermon of his upon the 95. <hi>Pſalm;</hi> it ſeemes that he expected his brother <hi>Severus</hi> to come and preach for him: but his friend failing to come, hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched himſelf, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Don</hi> relates the ſtory: So <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo preaching two Sermons upon the works of God that hee made in the ſix dayes, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. confeſſes he had no more premeditation, then that very morning when he began to preach them. Thus many holy men by ſetting themſelves to be inſtant in Gods harveſt time, have had ſuch a doore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42059:23"/>
of utterance opened unto them to ſpeak the myſtery of Chriſt, that like wiſe Scribes, they could, as occaſion was offered, bring forth out of their Treaſuries, new and old. Who are they that cry down often preaching, whatever colour they would ſeem to have, be ſuch as would cover their own ſhame by backbiting the diligence of any of their brethren. Like the Fox in the Fable, that becauſe he wanted a taile himſelfe to hide his own filthineſſe, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the other beaſts to cut off theirs too, pleading for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, O it is cumberſome, and weighty, and ye were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without; but the truth was, it was onely to hide his own deformity, which were it once in faſhion to bee without tails, ſhould never be eſpied. A worthy Divine cites an excellent admonition of <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Calphurnius,</hi> upon the like occaſion to this, That if he wanted teeth himſelfe, hee ſhould not bee envious againſt them which were able to eat. Beloved, I doe urge an equality of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour upon all; but this is moſt certain, that we are bound every one of us, to honor the Lord with all our ſtrength, and to ſtudy the edification and ſalvation of our peoples ſouls with all our might. It is a ſhame that ever our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould meet together at Church, and wee not take compaſſion upon them, to quicken them with ſome word of exhortation or other. The Evangeliſts note of our Saviour, that when he ſaw a company about him, he had compaſſion on them and taught them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 34. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was his Sermon in the mount, but becauſe hee ſaw a company about him? Whereupon was that Sermon of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13? It was becauſe there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people before him. Certainly, if we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on our people, we would doe ſo too: If we were not too worldly and dead hearted our ſelves, as we are, we would never plead againſt it. Many talk much of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, O the Fathers, the Fathers, and they doe not love
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42059:24"/>
theſe upſtart Divines, but it were well they would learn of the Fathers. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes, there was never any publick meeting in his dayes, but before the Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, they were fed with a Sermon. Nay, <hi>Babington,</hi> a reverend Biſhop among us, That a Miniſter can no more enter into the Congregation without a Sermon, and not be guilty, then <hi>Aaron</hi> could enter into the Congregation at any time without death, in caſe hee ſounded not his Bells when he entred. I might adde many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars concerning the manner of preaching, wherein all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould agree, but theſe ſhall ſuffice for feare I want time. 1. They ſhould preach in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power. 2. They ſhould preach differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly, putting a diſtinction between the pretious and the vile. 3. They ſhould preach conſtantly and to the utmoſt of their endeavours. This is the fourth thing wherein all Miniſters ſhould agree.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they ſhould agree in ſeeking of the Lord for a<note place="margin">5</note> bleſſing on their labours, they ſhould be earneſt with God in the behalfe of the people. Alas! how elſe doe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to convert any men unto God? For when we preach, what doe we doe? We doe but as <hi>Gehezi,</hi> who brought <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſtaffe to raiſe the dead child. Poore man! he could not raiſe it: for though he had <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſtaffe, he had not <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſpirit: So, my brethren, we do but bring our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtaffe, and therefore we ſhould intreat him to ſend down his Spirit; otherwiſe the dead cannot ſtand up. We trim up a Sermon, &amp; put we trim it well, nevertheles what is this? but as the rigging of the ſails, and what will that doe except the wind blow? So we ſhould pray that the wind ſhould blow upon our ſails, &amp; then the ſhip ſhall goe indeed, as our Saviour Chriſt ſayes, <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, Joh.</hi> 3. 8. The wind is free. When we have preached all that ever we can, yet the wind is free, whether
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42059:24"/>
it will blow or no. The Spirit of God is not tied to blow upon our endeavours, that they may have good ſucceſſe. What are Organs without breath? What is <hi>Pauls</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or <hi>Apollos</hi> his watering, without Gods giving of the increaſe? The Apoſtle tels us it is juſt nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. As a Divine makes the ſimilitude; when one heard what admirable victories <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> ſword had wrought, he would needs ſee it; and when he ſaw it, ſayes he, This is but an ordinary ſword: alas, what can this doe? <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> did him word, I have ſent thee my ſword, but I have the Arm that did all by it: So, beloved, we have Chriſts ſword, but we have not Chriſts arm, and therefore let us pray him, that he would together with our preaching, reach forth his arm, and that will doe our people good; without this, poore Preachers are we all, wee may cut at mens ſins, but they will never off without him: wee may ſhew people the great things of the Goſpel, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite people to come in, to lay hold on eternall life; but O for Chriſts arme! and therefore we ſhould ſtudy as much how to pray, as to preach. The want of this is that which marres all. May be we preach well, but we are not earneſt with God to give a bleſſing, we doe not bewail the ſins of our people, we doe not lay to heart the things that provoke Almighty God, wee doe not get into the caſe, wherein God may prove all our pains.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Miniſters ſhould all agree in the watching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">6.</note> the ſouls of men. Preaching to, and praying for our people, is not the whole of a Miniſters duty; but wee ſhould obſerve our people, &amp; watch over them, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes; <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, &amp; ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls, Heb.</hi> 12. 17. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how can we preach unto the purpoſe, except we watch them that are committed to our charge? as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Be thou diligent to know the eſtate of thy flockes, and</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42059:25"/>
                  <hi>look well to thy Herds, Pro.</hi> 27. 23. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> courſe to enquire into the eſtate of people, how it fared with them. This was the newes that he asked after, his deſire was to know how grace went forward in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> hearts. <hi>I heare of your faith,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 15. It ſeems he had been asking of it. Thus <hi>Epaphras</hi> told him of the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Thus he learned by ſome of the houſe of <hi>Chloe,</hi> the ſtate of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Nay, all men will enquire and hearken after the health of their friends; parents, if their children be at the Univerſity, they will liſten after them how they goe on in learning. So ſhould the Angels of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church, they ſhould liſten what courſes are in their Town, what ſinnes break out, what corruptions appeare, what proficiency the good ones make, who grow, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, who ſtand at a ſtay, who goe aſide, and wax worſe and worſe, that they may ſhape their preaching accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that their words be fitted in their mouth, that they may apt their rebukes, their exhortations, their uſes anſwerably. For then will their Sermons be like <hi>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</hi> It is no curioſity in Miniſters to be inquiſitive into their peoples courſes. It is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ill-minded ones, ſay they, What need Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters buſie themſelves? they muſt have their tell-tales, we can doe nothing but they muſt heare of it. O beloved, we can never preach fruitfully if we ſtop our eares with wax, and will not liſten what our hearers do.</p>
               <p>7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Miniſters ſhould agree in ordering their own converſations aright, it is but a folly elſe to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, we doe but make repentance dearer, and at a higher price. <hi>A Biſhop muſt be blameleſs, as the Steward of God, not ſelf-willed, not ſoon angry, not given to wine, nor to ſilthy lucre, Tit.</hi> 1. 7. It is a double wickedneſſe for a Miniſter to be wicked, to be a company-keeper, to be a pot-companion, as God ſaid to <hi>Aaron, Whoſoever he be of thy ſeed in their</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42059:25"/>
                  <hi>generation, that hath any blemiſh, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God, Levit.</hi> 21. 17. We can never doe good, if we blemiſh our ſelves with vice. True it is, the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Word and Sacraments doe not depend upon the quality of the Miniſter; the ſeed ſown in good ground may grow, though the ſower had a dirty hand. Gold is gold, though it be in the hand of a thiefe; yet ſuch is our weakneſſe, that they are weak to us. People are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Word and Sacraments the leſſe, when they ſee the Miniſter is not holy, as we ſee in <hi>Elies</hi> wicked ſonnes; for men abhor'd the offerings of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. Their eyes muſt be taught as well as their eares. <hi>Thoſe things,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul, which ye have heard and ſeen in me, do. Phil.</hi> 4. 9. Except with <hi>Thomas</hi> in another caſe, they ſee, they will not beleeve. Let a Miniſter be never ſo godly, he ſhal doe good little enough. The Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> though a holy man, yet he complains he <hi>laboured in vain.</hi> Now if a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man can doe but little good upon the moſt, much leſſe can a wicked Miniſter. A true Miniſter muſt be able to ſay as <hi>Gideon, Look on me, and doe likewiſe, as I doe, ſo ſhall yee doe, Judg.</hi> 7. 17. Miniſters muſt be <hi>examples unto the Flock, 1 Pet. 5. 3. Firſt caſt the beam out of thine own eye, &amp; then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the moat out of thy brothers eye.</hi> As it is ſaid of <hi>Ezra, Ezra had prepared his own heart to ſeek the law of the Lord, and to doe it, and to teach in Iſrael, Ezra</hi> 7. 10. Our Saviour Chriſt did &amp; taught, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeakes. This is the courſe of a Miniſter indeed, to doe his own Sermons. When a Miniſter does not do what he teaches, this makes him a vile perſon; nay, this makes him ridiculous. Like <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ians</hi> Apothecary, who had medicines in his ſhop to cure the cough, and told others that he had them, and yet was troubled with it himſelf. With what a forehead canſt thou ſtand in a Pulpit, and publiſh the lawes of God, and to undertake the charge of ſouls, that when thine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked neſſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42059:26"/>
appeares, when thy tongue is of a larger ſize then thy hands, thy miniſtery is divided againſt it ſelfe, thy courſes gives thy doctrine the lie; thou ſayeſt that men muſt be holy, and thy deeds doe declare thy mouthes hypocriſie, thou doſt more miſchiefe then an hundred others, as `<hi>Peter</hi> ſayes of wicked Miniſters, <hi>Many will follow their pernicious wayes, 2 Peter</hi> 2. 2. one Miniſter ſhal have many followers. A good Miniſter ſhall hardly get two or three to follow him. But when a Miniſter is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he ſhall have many that will follow him. <hi>From the Prophets of Jeruſalem, prophaneneſſe is gone forth into all the Land, Jerem.</hi> 23. 15. If the ſprings bee tainted, that taint runnes forth into all the ſtreames. People think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe on an Ale-bench, when they have gotten the Parſon with them; this hardens their hearts a thouſand times more. But a true Miniſter is a godly man. Now when Miniſters agree in godlineſſe, this is another branch of this unity.</p>
               <p>Eighthly and laſtly, Miniſters ſhould agree in concord<note place="margin">8</note> and in amity, even as all deare fellow-ſervants, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> the Miniſter of the <hi>Coloſsians, As yee alſo learned of Epaphras our deare fellow-ſervant, who is for you a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt, Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 7. Being to write to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> yee ſee what a tender care hee hath of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> he labours to commend him to his people, that they may regard him the more. It is an horrible ſin when one Miniſter will gird at another that is faithfull, and that in the preſence of ſome of his people. This helpeth the Devill to harden peoples hearts againſt him, that hee cannot doe the good that otherwiſe hee might doe; when other Miniſters will revile him, and traduce him, and ſpeak filthy words, ſuch as their malice doth prompt them with, <hi>Paul</hi> did not thus. When he knew <hi>Timothy</hi> was to goe to <hi>Philippi,</hi> he does moſt dearly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42059:26"/>
commend him unto them. O, ſayes he, <hi>I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your eſtate, Philip.</hi> 2. 20. So our Saviour Chriſt, how much did hee countenance and back <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts Miniſtery, to the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all that heard him? <hi>Among them that are born of women, there hath not riſen a greater then John Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 11. 11. O it is an excellent thing when Miniſters doe not envie one another, when they love one another, and will live together in bleſſed Harmony: Thus yee ſee what this unity ſhould be.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of this point, why Miniſters ſhould all agree thus, and be all as one, are:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe this makes Miniſters amiable in their<note place="margin">1.</note> peoples eyes, it commendeth their Miniſteries unto the conſciences of their hearers, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayes, <hi>How beautifull upon the mountaines are the feet of him that bringeth glad tidings, the publiſhers of peace, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 52. 7. You will ſay, How is that? How comes his feet to bee beautifull? It followes in the eighth verſe, <hi>Thy watchmen ſhall lift up their voyce, with a voyce together ſhall they ſing.</hi> Mark, that was it that made his feet beautifull; becauſe all the watchmen were of one note, they ſung with one voice together: look as one preach'd, ſo preach'd another, one did not pull down what another built up, one did not preach more pleaſing doctrine to the fleſh then another; but they all ſung in one Tune, they all were of one heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it makes the Miniſtery more beautifull<note place="margin">2.</note> and comely, ſo it makes it the more powerfull, when the Miniſters are all of one mind in the Lord, when they all draw one way, all walk by the ſame Rule, all ſet themſelves to doe good, and to promote one anothers good. I ſay, this makes the Miniſtery the more powerfull and profitable. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of an ignorant man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42059:27"/>
coming into the Church to heare the Miniſter preach, hee ſhewes how powerfull the Word may bee unto him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. O ſayes he, <hi>the ſecrets of his heart are made manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face, hee worſhips God;</hi> that is, the Sermon is made effectuall unto him, and turnes his wretched heart. But obſerve now, how this comes to paſſe, the Text ſhewes in the foure and twentieth verſe, it is by reaſon of the unity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>He is convinced of all, he is judged of all;</hi> that is, all the Miniſters were of one note, they all were in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, one did not preach looſer doctrine then another, one told him he was a very wretch, and another told him hee was a very wretch, and a third convinced him hee was a very wretch; all had a blow at him: O thought he, I, I, I am a very wretch indeed; this burſt his heart. If he could have heard any one of them preach eaſier doctrine, may bee that would have given his conſcience ſome fooliſh eaſe, and ſo the man had gone away never the better, but when hee was convinced of all, and judged of all, this ſtrikes him dumb. So, beloved, when a man can goe into no Church, but every where hee is met with, all the Miniſters condemn him, all their lives condemn him, and all their Sermons condemn him to the pit of hell, and he can ſcramble comfort no where; if the man belong to God, this is the readieſt way to beat him down, and ſubdue his heart. On the contrary ſide, when a man is wounded at one Miniſters Sermon, by and by he drops into another, and there hee catches hold of ſome eaſe: this makes him goe on in his ſinnes, and to blind his eyes againſt the truth. It is a great ſtumbling block unto the people this very thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as it makes the Miniſtery more powerfull,<note place="margin">3.</note> ſo it brings more glory unto God. As it is ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, that when our Saviour did commend him,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42059:27"/>
and made the people ſee, that hee was of <hi>Johns</hi> minde, and that he held the ſame Tenets, and that hee would not ſpeak againſt a tittle that <hi>John</hi> had delivered, but teſtifyed his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with him; And made it appear what a reverend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem hee had of him: ſaith hee, <hi>Hee is a Prophet, and more then a Prophet.</hi> Yee ſhall ſee how this brought glory to God. The Text ſaith, <hi>When the people heard this, and the Publicans, they juſtifyed God, being baptized with the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme of</hi> John. Luk. 7. 29.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, firſt, to condemne ſuch as envy their<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> fellow-Miniſters, and will not bee in the unity of minde, and heart, and life with them. In the moſt, the Proverb is too true, <hi>Figulus figulo invidet.</hi> One potter hates another, one Tradeſman envies anothers cuſtome, ſo, one Miniſter, another: if there bee a Miniſter that deſires to powre out his ſoule in the doing of good, in the taking of paines, in the diſcharging of his Conſcience, there are ſome that will envy ſuch a one, their hearts riſe up againſt him; nay, not onely ſo, but the worſt Enemy that <hi>Jeremy</hi> had, was <hi>Paſhur,</hi> one of his own Coat, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 2. The ſoreſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that <hi>Amos</hi> had, was <hi>Amaziah,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Bethel,</hi> who would never leave heaving at him untill hee had gotten him away, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 12. and why ſo! becauſe hee would not preach ſuch pleaſing Doctrine as hee. Forſooth, the Land was not able to bear <hi>Amos</hi> his words, hee Preaches as if hee would ſcare people out of their wits. Hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Schiſmatically, and as if hee loved to bee ſingular. The cheif Prieſts were furious againſt our Saviour Chriſt, becauſe his Miniſtery was more bleſt then theirs was, nay, they hated him more then <hi>Pilate, Pilate</hi> a very Pagan, his Conſcience told him hee found no fault in him, <hi>Why what evill hath hee done?</hi> Their envy againſt Chriſt was ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, that hee did diſcover it. Hee knew that for envy they had delivered him unto him. So when all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42059:28"/>
know in their Conſciences that ſuch and ſuch teach the waies of God ſincerely, ſet themſelves to roote out ſin, and to ſave ſoules, nay, the very Drunkards you ſhall hear them ſay, I, I, hee is a good man, Gods bleſſing on his heart, hee tels us our faults, wee may doe what wee liſt for all ſuch and ſuch, but hee tells us of our faults, and God help us to amend them, and when they are ſick, they would rather have ſuch a Miniſters prayers, then twenty of other Miniſters, that will ſoothe them up, and bee haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow with them: Whereas there bee many of our own Coat, that are implacable againſt a Miniſter, that labours to bee faithfull. How contrary is this unto the Rule? The Miniſters of God ſhould bee all one, and if one bee godly, all ſhould bee, if one painfull, all ſhould bee ſo, if one preach home to the conſcience, all ſhould doe ſo, they ſhould all live as Brethren. What ſaies our Saviour Chriſt? <hi>Yee are the Salt of the Earth, but if the Salt hath loſt its ſavour, wherewith ſhall it bee ſalted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to bee caſt out, and to bee trodden under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot of men,</hi> Matth. 5. 13. That is, Salt may ſeaſon others, but if it have loſt its ſavour, nothing can ſalt it.</p>
               <p>A Miniſter is of an excellent calling, appointed to ſeaſon mens hearts, but if hee have loſt his ſavour, hee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truely bee ſeaſoned again, nothing can doe him good. An evill Miniſter, is a more deſperate forlorn man than any elſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another uſe is, that all that are the Miniſters<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> of God would bee hence ſtirred up to be all of one minde, all drawing one way, all bending our forces to one and the ſame end, the glory of God, and the ſalvation of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Its a fine comely thing to fee any Brethren in unity. <hi>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard, even</hi> Aarons <hi>beard, that went</hi>

                  <hi>down to the skirts of his garments: as the dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the dew that deſcended upon the mountaines of</hi> Zion, <hi>for there the Lord commended his bleſsing, even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 133. 1, 2, 3. I ſay this is a very comely thing, to ſee any brethren to dwell together in unity, it is like the perfume of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that made all his garments fragrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweet, it is like the dews of <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Zion,</hi> that made all the ground fruitfull, this is that which hath the Lords bleſſing annexed to it, it is an excellent meanes unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. As the Apoſtle ſaith, If there bee any conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies: Fullfill yee my joy, that yee bee like-minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one minde, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 1, 2. if it be ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Brethren to bee united; how much more for Brethren in the Miniſtery? of all men, Miniſters have moſt reaſon to bee of one minde, becauſe wee are to teach union unto others. Beſides, if wee deſire to doe what wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe, wee ſhall have enemies enough in the world. Our Tribe is a hated Tribe. Of all Offices, the office of a reprover is the moſt unwelcome. <hi>Paul</hi> was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an enemy, becauſe hee told the <hi>Galatians</hi> the truth. <hi>Micaiah</hi> was hated becauſe hee dealt truely with <hi>Ahab:</hi> people love their luſts, as their members, yea, as themſelves: <hi>Ergò</hi> of all men wee are moſt hated. Every man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in his own profeſſion but wee; People do not hate Taylors that make them a good garment, nor a Shoo-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker that makes them a good Shooe, nor a Cook that makes them a good Feaſt, nor a Phiſitian that makes them a good potion, nor a good Lawyer that makes them a good ſuite, though theſe doe but provide for the body, and yet wee that provide for peoples ſoules, if wee make them a good Sermon that would ſave their ſoules for ever, ſo they would obey it; wee are hated for our labour. <hi>Ergò,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42059:29"/>
when <hi>Moſes</hi> came to ſpeak of <hi>Levi,</hi> that were the Miniſters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee prayes God, that God would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, <hi>Lord ſmite through the loynes of them that hate him,</hi> Deut. 33. 11. I ſay wee have many enemies in the world, and therefore wee had need to hang together, who ever bee at oddes, wee ſhould ſtick cloſe. Our meſſage is hardly beleeved, and therefore wee had need to bee all of one minde. The word which wee preach is adverſe to fleſh and blood, and therfore wee had need all joyntly to obey it, otherwiſe how doe wee think that wee ſhall perſwade any others?</p>
               <p>Force, the more united the more ſtrong. O if we would all joyn forces in one, wee might make all our Pariſhes quake! all the wicked round about, their very hearts would bee ready to faile them, if every Pulpit did rowze them. If they could come in no Church, but they were made to ſit upon thornes, I verily beleeve, few would have any heart to goe on in their evill doings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another Uſe is, how wee ſee it is a very uſefull<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> and a profitable thing, that one good Miniſter ſhould now and then come and help another, and preach for another, that our people may ſee our conſent, that wee all preach the ſame thing, and that is not our private preaching, but all the Miniſters that are of God, are juſt of the ſame mind: This made the Apoſtle, whenſoever hee was to write to a people, that hee knew would bee ſomewhat backward to beleeve them, hee would joyne other Miniſters with him, as conſenting together with him. Indeed when hee wrote unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> he would not doe it, for hee knew that hee did not need, hee knew the faithfulneſſe of his heart. But when hee writ to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where falſe Apoſtles had been, and had made many of them to doubt, hee joyned <hi>Soſthenes</hi> with him, as it were confirming the ſame thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. when hee wrote to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42059:29"/>
hee told them hee had <hi>Peter</hi> on his ſide, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and how the Apoſtles gave unto him the right hand of Fellowſhip, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 1. 9. Hee writing to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> hee joynes <hi>Timothy</hi> with him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. And ſo writing to <hi>Philemon,</hi> about a thing, that though hee hoped <hi>Philemon</hi> would doe, yet becauſe hee knew he might have many carnall reaſons againſt it, hee joyns another with him, <hi>Philem.</hi> 1. This is of very good uſe, when one good Miniſter comes and backs anothers Miniſtery. For as it is with men-pleaſing Miniſters, that make as if the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were eaſier than it is, people hope that other Miniſters will come, and confirming it, make it good. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 6. O they love ſuch a Doctrine alife, and they hope there will be moe of that minde: So when they heare a ſtrict Miniſter, that delivers the Word to them as it is, and as they ſhall finde it at laſt day, tuſh, this is ſo uncooth, that they hope that it is but the opinion of their preciſe Miniſter, and that no body elſe is of his minde. Now when God ſhall bring a cloud of witneſſes, it is I ſay, of very good uſe. I confeſſe that when a Miniſter ſpeaketh the truth, though no body elſe come to ſet it on beſides him, hee ſhall bee a witneſſe againſt all the people that will not beleeve, and vext at the voyce of his preaching. <hi>Noah</hi> condemned all the world, albeit there were none but hee. But yet ſymphony and agreement, and the conſent of the Miniſters of God, is an Ordinance of God when it may conveniently bee had.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſpoken of this ſecond point of Doctrine, of the unity of Miniſters, To the Angell of the Church in <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> I acknowledge this point is not ſo much for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall profit of you all. But you muſt bear with me, for hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it. Wee ſhall come now to you ere long. For I am ſure, if any portion of Scripture may doe us good, in theſe dead times, the Treating of this Epiſtle may. And yet it is not loſt time, to ſpeak unto the Miniſters, if by any meanes I may provoke my ſelf, and my Brethren, to the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42059:30"/>
in the unity of the Spirit, and of Faith, and heart and minde, for the further ſpreading and enforcing of good.</p>

                  <q>And unto the <hi>Angell</hi> of the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> write: theſe things, <hi>ſaith hee</hi> that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres. I know thy works, that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt and art dead.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <q>And unto the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> write.</q>
               <p>YEE have had two Doctrines from hence, concerning Gods Miniſters: I told you there is one more, and then I have done, and ſo will proceed. The Doctrine is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Miniſter may bee in fault, that the people are dead, that they have no more heart to good things, that they are ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ſo cold, ſo ungodly, ſo worldly, ſo vain as they are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay the Miniſter may bee in the fault; The point is very clear from this place. The Lord being to reprove the people here of <hi>Sardis,</hi> for their deadneſſe in Religion, he directs his reproof to their Miniſter. To <hi>the</hi> Angel <hi>of the Church in</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, <hi>write: I know thy works, that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt and art dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee accuſes the Miniſter for the deadneſſe of the Church, that was committed to his charge, hee meanes the Church, but hee ſpeakes to the Miniſter. You will ſay, how doe yee prove that hee means the Church? I Anſwer, there be three places that doe manifeſt the ſame. The one is <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 4. There <hi>John</hi> tells us, that hee indeed writes to the Churches, for that in the inſcription of every Epiſtle, the Miniſter onely bee named. <hi>John</hi> to the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi> So that this latter is ſent to the Church that is in <hi>Sardis. John</hi> meanes it to the Church, and not onely to the Miniſter. A ſecond place is <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 11. what thou ſeeſt write to the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42059:30"/>
in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> to <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to <hi>Sardis,</hi> to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea.</hi> The third is, the concluſion of every Epiſtle. Where it is ſaid thus: <hi>Hee that hath an eare, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Rev.</hi> 3. 6. and ſo it is at the cloſure of every Letter, to all the reſt of the Churches, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt there accuſes the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> of deadneſſe. I know thy works that thou art dead, and yet hee directs it to the Miniſter of the Church, as a thing that concernes him, and that may bee laid to his charge, and that hee is faulty in. To <hi>the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>of the Church in</hi> Sardis <hi>write. I know thy works that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt and art dead.</hi> That is, thou haſt a dead-hearted people, and thou art the cauſe of it: Thou doſt not doe thy duty, thou doſt not doe what lies in thee for to quicken them. But thou art too remiſſe in thy Miniſtery, and therefore their deadneſſe may bee imputed unto thee. Thus you ſee the Doctrine is very plain from the words. The good or bad eſtate of a people dependeth much upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. Commonly wee ſee it ſo fall out, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaid, Like people, like Prieſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 9. Like ſheepherd like ſheep. Such as the builder is, ſuch is the building, as is the Husbandman, ſo is the husbandry. This wee may finde throughout all theſe Epiſtles, where the Miniſter is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the people are commended. Where the Miniſter is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the people are taxed. And therefore they ſtand and fall together, they ſwim and ſink together, a wicked Miniſter, a wicked people, an ignorant Miniſter, an ignorant people; and ſo a good Miniſter, the people either are a good people, or elſe they are Monſters; nay, if the Miniſter bee good, though the world in his Pariſh bee never ſo wretched, yet hee hath a good people, the Church of God in his Pariſh, is very good, commonly.</p>
               <p>Well then, wee have gotten our point out. The Miniſter may bee in fault, that the people are dead, I doe not ſay, it is alwaies thus. For firſt, the Miniſter may bee lively, and yet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42059:31"/>
the people dead. The Lord tells us that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had a ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 4. and yet hee was not to bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, themſelves were in all the fault. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had a dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people: All the day long have I ſtretched out my hands to a diſobedient and gain-ſaying people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 21. and therefore I doe not ſay it was alwaies thus.</p>
               <p>Nay, Secondly, ſometimes the people are the cauſe of the Miniſters deadneſſe. The Jewes hardneſſe of heart under the Miniſtery of <hi>Jonas,</hi> was the cauſe why <hi>Jonas</hi> had no heart to goe unto <hi>Niniveh.</hi> O thought hee, if <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not heare mee, much leſſe will <hi>Niniveh</hi> heare mee. Thus the people deaded <hi>Jeremiah</hi> at one time, that hee had little or no heart to preach for a fit. <hi>Then I ſaid, I will not make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name,</hi> Jer. 20. 9. Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was deaded a while, by his people too. I came to them of the Captivity at <hi>Telabib,</hi> and I ſate where they ſate, and remained there aſtoniſht among them ſeven daies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 15. The Lord was fain to rowze his heart up, and to tell him hee would require their blood of him, before hee could pluck up a good heart to Preach livelily among them; The people deaded him. Nay more,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſometimes the Lord locks up his good Miniſters, and ſuffers them to bee ſtraitned in their utterance, and other gifts. May bee the people are ready to lay all the blame upon their Miniſters. O how tongue-tyed are they! and it is their negligence, and torpor: Whereas it is for the peoples ſinnes, thus the Lord lockt up <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſinnes. <hi>I will make thy tongue cleave to the roofe of thy mouth, and thou ſhalt bee dumb, and ſhalt not bee to them are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, for they are a rebellious houſe,</hi> Ezek. 3. 26. Nay,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Sometimes peoples ſinnes are the cauſe why their Miniſters are quite dead, and have no life at all in them, the Lord ſends fooliſh Miniſters among them, meerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſinnes. So it was in <hi>Hoſea's</hi> time. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is a foole, the ſpirituall man is mad, for the multitudes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42059:31"/>
of thy iniquity, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 7. Mark, they had fooles for their Miniſters; fooles, beſotted Miniſters, giddy Miniſters, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that were wilde, and like mad men; you will ſay, theſe were the cauſes of much ſin to the people: No, ſaith the Text, the peoples ſinnes were the cauſe of ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>The Prephet is a foole, the ſpirituall man mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity.</hi> Theſe foure exceptions then there been of the point. Otherwiſe the point is too too true, that the Miniſter may bee in fault that the people are dead.</p>
               <p>You ſee here the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> was grown dead, and the Lord faults the Angel of the Church for it. <hi>I know thy works that thou art dead.</hi> The like is ſaid of <hi>Laodicea. Loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> was grown horrible lukewarme, no zeale of God, they were neither hot nor cold, and the Lord imputes it to the Angel of <hi>Laodicea:</hi> I know thy works, that thou art nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot nor cold, and therefore I will ſpue thee out of my mouth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. The ſame is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that they had left their firſt love, and yet the Lord hits the Angell in the teeth with it. <hi>I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love,</hi> Rev. 2. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the laſt day I ſpake of the Miniſters concord and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the Angel of the Church, all the Miniſters ſhould bee as one man, as if they made up one and the ſame Angel. And therefore our Saviour Chriſt made choyce of Brethren, and Kinksfolkes. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> his Brother, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his Brother. St. <hi>Peters</hi> bark is a fiſher-boat, not a man of Warre, it is not furniſht with mortall Engines, but onely with nets to catch fiſh. If <hi>Peter</hi> were reproved for drawing upon <hi>Malchus,</hi> what reproofe had hee been worthy of, if hee had drawn upon any of his fellows? this was the Theme, that wee ſpake of the laſt day. Now then let us ſpeak of the influence that a Miniſter hath in his people, hee may bee the cauſe of his peoples deadneſſe, if hee doe not take heed. And this hee may bee three waies; firſt, by his not preaching; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by his dead manner of preaching; thirdly, by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42059:32"/>
his dead manner of Life, and Converſation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, by his not preaching, yee know the Word of God is the word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 16. The Word is that which quickeneth the heart, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy Word hath quickned mee,</hi> Pſal. 119. 50. Now when Miniſters doe not preach it, this deads peoples hearts. Wee ſee this in thoſe places where the due preaching of the Word is wanting, people are dead to all goodneſſe; nay, they that had ſome quickneſſe in them before, doe loſe them more and more: As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where there is no viſion the people periſh,</hi> Prov. 29. 18. that is, where preaching is defective, the people die, they are ſpiritually dead in treſpaſſes, and in ſins. Can a man live without bread, or without food? no more can peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live without conſtant preaching. The Word is the bread of life, now when this is not broken unto people, they muſt needs dye. Mark, how <hi>Zachary</hi> deſcribes them that are without preaching, They are ſuch as fit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 79. that is, they are blinde and ignorant, and liveleſſe, dead while they live, they are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and abominable, in the power of Satan, under the wrath of God, ſtrangers from the life of God; ſuch Miniſters as doe not preach conſtantly, they are ſoule-murtherers, they are guilty of their peoples blood, they doe not give them that which ſhould quicken them up unto eternall life, they ſhould quicken them up unto newneſſe of life, but they doe not; they ſhould powre in the words of eternall life into their hearts, but they doe not; people are naturally dead to Prayer, and dead to communion with God, and dead to all holineſſe, they have no heart to pureneſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of walking, and ſuch Miniſters doe not ſtudy to revive them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as a Miniſter may bee the cauſe of his peoples deadneſſe by his not Preaching, ſo he may be the cauſe of their deadneſſe by his Preaching, when the manner of it is dead. Preaching may be dead in the manner of it, 7 waies,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42059:32"/>Firſt, When it is too generall, when they preach onely in generall. That which wee ſay is very good, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but wee doe not apply our ſelves, to every particular mans Conſcience, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eads peoples hearts. Beloved, it is particular Preaching that does people good. When <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David, Thou are the man,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7. this ſtirred <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> heart. When <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid to his hearers, <hi>Yee have crucifyed Chriſt,</hi> Act. 2. 36. This prickt them to the heart. Generall preaching cannot quicken. Firſt, becauſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls cannot act. <hi>Actio eſt ſingularium,</hi> as wee ſay. Its one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a particular, works. Let a man preach home and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and this will work on the hearers. This made <hi>Michah</hi> a powerfull Preacher, when hee preached particularly to his peoples Conſcience. Truely, I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgement, and of might, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto <hi>Jacob</hi> his tranſgreſſion, and to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his ſin, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 8. this made him a powerfull Prophet to quicken up his people, becauſe hee told every man his ſin, and ſmote every man conſcience for his tranſgreſſion. No man is ſtirred till hee feeles his caſe laid open, till hee ſees the Miniſter beates upon him, and hit him; till the Miniſter treads hard upon his toes, hee will never cry out.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Generall Preaching leaves the Sermon to the people to apply it; now the people will never apply it while the world ſtands. Nay, <hi>David</hi> himſelf would not apply, as long as <hi>Nathan</hi> dealt with him in generall, as long as <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſpeaking of a man in the clouds, a rich man that had wronged a poore man, <hi>Davids</hi> heart was as whole as a fiſh, till hee came to <hi>Thou art Him.</hi> Now hee cries out, <hi>I have ſinned. Nathan</hi> was fain to make application. For <hi>David</hi> would never have done it elſe: Will a truantly Boy ever whip himſelf? the Maſter may lay the rod before him, but except the Maſter lay it on, hee will goe ſcot-free if hee can. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goods and as nailes faſtened by the Maſters of Aſſemblies,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 11. Mark, the Maſters of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42059:33"/>
Aſſemblies muſt faſten them into the poſt, lay the nailes by, the poſt it ſelf will never knock them in; So, though the Sermon bee never ſo good a naile; yet hee muſt knock it in, the people will never doe it. The Prophet <hi>Jehu</hi> muſt come and ſay to <hi>Jehoſaphat, Shouldſt thou help the ungodly? Wrath is upon thee from the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 2. Hee faſtened in the naile; though <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> were a good man, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet knew he would not do it. Nay, people are ſo farre from applying the word unto themſelves, that they will apply it to any body elſe rather than to themſelves, the Miniſter met with ſuch a one to day, there was a leſſon for him: But none will ſay, this was for mee, and I am a vile wretch, and vengeance hangs over mee, unleſſe I doe amend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly generall Peaching, is a dead manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Generall Preaching is confuſed, when Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters tell people they muſt repent, and beleeve, and ſerve God, and bee godly, and carry themſelves well, in all their places and callings. When they doe thus in generall, this is like, as if the trump ſhould give an uncertain ſound, like the noiſe in a battle, a confuſed noiſe, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9. 5. Like the confuſion in <hi>Epheſus, Great is Diana of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> they kept a great ſtirre, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 32. the Text ſaith, <hi>The aſſembly was confuſed, and the more part knew not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were come together,</hi> ſo while wee preach onely in the generall, Great is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and wee are great ſinners, and great is the need of repentance, but wee neither tell the people how, nor when, nor who, nor what: may bee our Sermons may keep ſome pudder in mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but people have no diſtinct edification, they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and ſay, O it was a very godly Sermon, I pray God give us grace to follow it! But no man is the better. They heare admirable things about repentance, but they are not taught how to goe about it, there they are at a loſſe. They remember gracious things about the ſerving of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42059:33"/>
a good Conſcience, and the like. But they know not how in the earth to ſet about theſe things to any purpoſe, if ever wee would quicken our peoples hearts, wee muſt let them ſee diſtinctly, the will of God concerning them, the particular means, and helps, and ſignes of it, the particular motives, and Arguments to it, the particular circumſtances of it, the particular hinderances; lets, and impediments of doing of it, and you can never doe the will of God, as long as yee doe thus and thus, and this courſe will break your neck, this practiſe of yours will bee your utter undoing: when people heare diſtinct Preaching, this doth them good, if any thing will. Generall Preaching is like the ſetting of good Phyſick before the Patient, without giving him directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the taking of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Generall Preaching is deceitfull, <hi>Eſt dolus in generalibus,</hi> as wee ſay, there is deceit in the generalls, wee Preach that people muſt love God, and feare him, and thank him, and they muſt bee new men, and they muſt leave their ſinnes, and they muſt Pray, and hear the Word, and they muſt doe every thing to Gods glory. Now mark what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit there is in ſuch preaching as this; this is in the generall: People goe away, and deceive themſelves in the particular. They think they ſerve God, and they love God, or elſe they were not worthy to live; they think they ſay their Prayers every day, and that they are thankfull unto him, they never eate their meat, but they ſay Grace, they never recover out of ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But now if a particular Miniſter ſhould come and tell them they are worldly, and mockers of God and all goodneſſe, as they are in very good deed; they cannot abide him, they would

ſay wherein? Such were the Jewes under the overly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Prieſts. When <hi>Malachy</hi> dealt particularly with them, ſaith hee, <hi>Yee have deſpiſed the name of the Lord: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſay they?</hi> Mal. 1. 6. <hi>Yee have wearied the Lord with your words: Wherein, ſay they, have wee wearied him?</hi> Mal. 2. 17. <hi>Yee have robbed God: Wherein have wee robbed him, ſay they?</hi> Mal. 3. 8. <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt the Lord,</hi> yet their anſwer was, <hi>Wherein have wee ſpoken ſo much againſt the Lord?</hi> Mal. 3. 13. Alas, alas! their Prieſts had taught them onely in generall, and therefore when the Prophet was to deale particularly with them, and told them what vile courſes they took, <hi>they cryed, wherein?</hi> and whereof? and why doe you ſay ſo of us? hee was forced to come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Otherwiſe they would have gone away and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Generall Preaching lets people ſee their ſinnes if they will. But beloved this will doe no good, if wee let you ſee your ſins, if you will; wee muſt make you ſee your ſinnes. <hi>Son of man, cauſe</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to know her abominations,</hi> Ezek. 16. 2. Wee muſt not onely let you underſtand, if yee will, it is ſaid of the good Prieſts, that they cauſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to underſtand, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. Naturally people love their own ſelves and their luſts, and they will not ſee them till they needs muſt, they doe not love to bee preciſe, they will not willingly yeeld that they muſt bee ſo ſtrict, and ſo mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Lord Jeſus will have them, if they mean to bee ſaved, and therefore if they can put it off they will; ſhew them there is a difference between people and people, ſome are the people of God, and ſome are the children of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, ſome are the redeemed of Chriſt, and ſome have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with Chriſt, ſome are clean, and ſome are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; though wee ſhow them the difference between theſe two, they will ſhut their eies if they can. Generall preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does no more, it ſhews them theſe things. But may be neither the Miniſter nor they will ſee for all that, now wee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42059:35"/>
muſt cauſe them to diſcern whether they wil or no, if we can. They ſhall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, &amp; cauſe them to diſcerne between the uncleane, &amp; the clean, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 23. that is, tell them this is unclean, and this is clean; ſuch and ſuch perſons are prophane, and ſuch are holy: Hold it before their eyes, cauſe them to diſcern; this is the way to quicken mens hearts. Now Generall preaching does not doe thus. It onely puts the truth before men, that they may ſee if they will, but if they will not, it does not urge them, this deads our people, and does them no good, for people will not bee awakened, as long as they can ſhift it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Generall Preaching is a-loft and a-loofe off, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular preaching is the moſt cloſe, and the moſt plain, and the moſt ſenſible preaching of all, if any Preaching will ſink into peoples heads, this will: it makes the truth even ſenſible after a ſort, as King <hi>James</hi> ſaid of a Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of this Land, that is now dead and gone: <hi>This man,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Preaches as if death were at my back.</hi> So a preſſe Preacher preaches, as if death were at a mans back, as if judgement and hell were at a mans back, hee brings the point home to the ſoules door, <gap reason="foreign">

People may live ſeven yeers under a generall Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and bee never the nearer, ſuch a Miniſtery breeds onely ſwimming knowledge, it does not lay the Truth at every mans doore; may bee they get knowledge, but their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge does them little good: it is ſaid of the good Levites, that they taught the people the good knowledge of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 22. That is, ſuch a knowledge of the Lord, as made the people good, they laid the Truth at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans doore, they preacht to the people as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> informe them, this did them good. Generall preaching is like an Arrow ſhot at rovers, that does not hit the mark, as if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42059:36"/>
the Miniſter would lay his Sermon on his Cuſhion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dart it into his peoples boſomes. Alas Brethren! if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe not feele our points at their backs, and like ſpeares in their ſides, and ſwords in their bellies, they will feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is naked preaching, when wee make mens eſtates even viſible before their eyes, when wee preach ſo of Gods wrath, as if they ſaw it, when wee ſo ſet out Chriſt, as if hee were palpable to mens ſenſes, this quickens and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that yee ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, and crucified among you?</hi> Gal. 3. 1. Mark, how ſenſibly hee had preached Chriſt to them, even as if hee had held him before their eies, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſaith, they were even bewitcht that they could not ſee them; <hi>q. d.</hi> how is it poſſible that yee ſhould not ſee him, that yee ſhould not obey the truth, where it hath been ſo ſenſibly preached unto you, and painted to the life, even before your very eyes! If any Preaching will quicken, this will, and therefore Generall Preaching, that will not doe the deed.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Generall Preaching is againſt the nature of Preaching, for wherefore is preaching, but to take the word of God, and apply it unto people in particular, it is called the dividing of the word of truth aright, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. When the Miniſter is a good carver, to divide to every man his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Conviction to the ignorant; reproofe to the offender; terrour to the obſtinate; comfort to the broken heart; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the wicked; mercy to the Saints, and true penitent ſoules; Then the Miniſter applies it unto every man. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are Gods Harveſt-men, as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Pray yee the Lord of the Harveſt, that hee would ſend forth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> his Harveſt,</hi> Matth. 9. 38. Now Harveſt-men, what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>? Doe they onely bring a ſithe or a ſickle into the field, and give a ſlaſh, a generall ſlaſh, at one Corn of the field, as though that would fetch down all the Corn? No,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42059:36"/>
they apply it to the Corn, to reap it down. The preaching of a Generall Sermon is but a ſickle, now except it bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to all the people, it is not the way to reap in Gods harveſt. Preachers are called Chriſts ſeed-men: <hi>The ſower went out to ſow his ſeed,</hi> Luk. 8. 5. Now what does the ſeeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? does hee onely bring in a ſack of ſeed, and powre it all on a heap in the field? does hee think that every ſpot of ground will draw it unto it ſelf? No, hee ſprinkles it, and diſperſes it abroad, that every Lea may have its part. Whence comes that fooliſh conceit, that reading is Preaching, a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net which many hold? the truth is, it comes from hence, becauſe Generall preaching is made by moſt Miniſters to ſerve the turn; Now, if this were Preaching, reading were Preaching indeed: But this is no preaching, preaching is the opening of the Word of God, and the applying of it, according as every man hath need. The not doing of this leaves poore people in their hardneſſe and deadneſſe of heart. This is the firſt. Generall Preaching is ſuch a manner of preaching, as leaves the heart dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Morall Preaching is a dead manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When Miniſters preach honeſt matter, but doe not goe to the quick, they ſtrike at the boughes: They preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Drunkenneſſe, and intemperance, and malice, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and tale-bearing, and lying, and covetouſneſſe, and making of ſhews, it is very good to preach againſt theſe things, and wee muſt too, and let them know they are farre from the Kingdome of God that live in theſe or any other ſuch luſts. But alas! this is onely to ſtrike at the boughes. If we would awake the Conſcience indeed, wee muſt preach deeper then ſo. <hi>The axe is laid at the roote of the tree,</hi> Mat. 3. 10. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was a lively Preacher; now the Text ſhews hee did not onely ſtrike at the boughes, but hee laid his axe at the roote of the tree. When Miniſters preach onely good morall matter, this kinde of preaching does not quicken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42059:37"/>Firſt, Becauſe Morall preaching does not hit all, many are very Morall people, that have not one whit of grace in their hearts. True, this may hit ſome. <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Felix</hi> of his intemperance, and how that there was a day of Judgement to judge all ſuch perſons, this made him tremble. <hi>Felix trembled,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. I ſay, morall preaching may ſtartle ſome, but it does not ſtartle all. Many Heathens have been ſober and temperate, and true in their ſpeeches; and juſt in their dealings; and loving in their carriages; and painfull in their callings; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they have done by Nature, the things contained in the Law. Now yee know the Heathens are without grace, and are not acquainted with God, neither have they any communion with God, <hi>Powre out thy wrath upon the Heathen, that know thee not,</hi> Jer. 10. 25. Mark, they have no communion with God, they doe not know Jeſus Chriſt, nor the myſteries of ſaving Grace. So that a man may bee very finely morall, and yet bee without grace. Now then, if a Miniſter ſhould content himſelf with good morall teaching, many would goe away, and conclude well of their own eſtates, though they have no grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Morall preaching, thoſe that it does hit, it does them indeed ſome good, but it does them not the good, it never quickens them up unto eternall life; it ſeemeth to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villize their lives, and to reforme them a little, but it never reneweth them, neither does it put them into Jeſus Chriſt: Let a Drunkard heare hee is a damned wretch, if hee do not give over his drunkenneſſe, if this Sermon hit him, what does hee ſay? why then I will bee ſober, and I will never bee a drunkard more. And I can tell you, this is very rare too. But ſuppoſe it bee, hee may goe to hell for all this. Suppoſe wee doe make all our people morall, which were a fine thing if wee could, but grant wee could, this does not quicken them together with Chriſt; No, no, a man muſt ſee his vile nature, and loathe himſelf, and bee made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, to mortifie his carnall reaſon, to put off his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42059:37"/>
will, to feele his curſed condition in himſelf, to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptyed of himſelf, that Chriſt may bee all in all to him, that hee may bee led by the Spirit of Chriſt, and guided by the word of Chriſt, that hee may hang onely upon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in Chriſt, that his minde may bee taken up with Chriſt, and his thoughts and affections daily bee laboured to bee fixed upon the things above, none are alive unto God, but ſuch, Now Morall preaching will never doe this.</p>
               <p>God-forbid, I ſhould ſpeak againſt Morall preaching ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, or againſt Morality it ſelf, it is a very good thing; Who will not commend <hi>Abimelech</hi> for the integrity of his heart, that hee pleaded before God? <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5. Yee know how the Lord himſelf liked of it; who will not ſay but that the young man in the Goſpel, was a very commendable man, that had obſerved all theſe from his youth: Nay, the Text ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt,</hi> in ſome ſenſe, <hi>did love him,</hi> Mark. 10. 21. <hi>Daniel</hi> told <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> what an excellent thing Morality was. O! ſaith he, If thou wilt break off thy ſins, and bee righteous, hee means Morall righteouſneſſe towards man; if thou wilt ſhew mercy to the poore, it may bee God will lengthen thy tranquillity, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. The Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> tell the <hi>Moabites,</hi> what a deale of good they might doe to themſelves, if they would but bee morally honeſt: ſaith hee, <hi>Take Counſell, execute Judgement, hide the outcaſts, let mine out-caſts bee with thee,</hi> Eſa. 16. 3. <hi>Q. d.</hi> If thou wilt bee kinde and loving to my people, thou ſhalt fare the better. When the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> puniſhed the wickedneſſe of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the Lord rewarded them very richly for it. <hi>I have given him the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>for his labour,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>becauſe he wrought for mee,</hi> Ezek. 29. 20. Morall goodneſſe is commended of God, as well as ſpirituall goodneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt; Nay, it is needfull that Miniſters ſhould inſiſt very much in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of morall duties, and the godly are to bee willing to hear ſuch Sermons, to look to juſt dealing, to Civill hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, to juſtice between man and man; How aboundant is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42059:38"/>
the Scripture in urging this Theme! it is thought by ſome, there is no Divinity in this, and ſuch a Miniſter is not deep enough, and why does hee ſtand ſo much upon ſuch things as theſe, which the light of nature calls for. But theſe doe greatly erre, the Holy Ghoſt is carefull to urge ſuch duties as theſe, to bee honeſt. <hi>Walk honeſtly towards them that are without,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Let us walk honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as in the day,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men,</hi> Rom. 12. 17. Nay, honeſty, civill honeſty between man and man is a ſweet thing; the Apoſtle himſelf brings it among other things, as a teſtimony of his ſincerity: <hi>Wee truſt wee have a good conſcience in all things willing to live honeſtly,</hi> Heb. 13. 18. O it is an excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, when his Moralls are ſound, and exemplary, and there cannot bee any thing that will make the profeſſion of Religion odious in the eies of the world, then want of Morality, when Chriſtians faile palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in their Moralls. May bee ſuch a one thou wilt think, comes farre ſhort of thee in grace, in the knowledge of good, in the beleife of the Truth, in a ſpirituall in-ſight into the myſtery of Chriſt; O then count it a ſhame that hee ſhould goe before thee in the keeping of his Word. There cannot be a greater diſ-honour unto God, than when a naturall man ſhall bee able to accuſe thee of any diſ-honeſty in any kinde. The Spirit of God ſets it down as a great ſhame upon <hi>Sarah,</hi> that <hi>Abimelech,</hi> a Heathen man ſhould be able to reprove her; <hi>Thus was ſhee reproved,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 16. When <hi>Jacob</hi> perceived that his ſonnes had ſinned againſt morall honeſty, there in the matter of <hi>Shechem: O,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>yee have made mee to ſtink among the Inhabitants of the land,</hi> Gen. 34. 30. Yee have troubled mee, ſaith hee, it was a great griefe of heart to the good man, hee knew this would bee a great diſ-honour to God, as well as a ſhame unto himſelfe; and therefore God forbid I ſhould ſpeak againſt a Miniſters ſpeaking for morality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42059:38"/>Yet, Beloved this know, that this is not enough, a man may profeſſe the name of Chriſt, and thinke verily that hee Beleeves in Ieſus Chriſt and be a very admirable morall man and yet never quickned up to the grace of life. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes this plainly in himſelf. I might have confidence in the fleſh, if any other man might truſt to that, I might be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the eighth day: of the ſtocke of <hi>Jeſſe:</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin:</hi> an Hebrew, of the Hebrews: as touching the Law, a Phariſee: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6, 9. if any fine-carriaged man under heaven could hope he is right; I could before my converſion. I was admitted into the Congregation of Chriſt by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Circumciſion: I was borne in the true Church of God, I had godly Parents, I was of the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Nay, I was a Phariſee, which was ſo admirable a ſtrict order, that after his converſion, he was not aſhamed to be ſtill called a Phariſee. <hi>I am a Phariſee, and the ſonne of a Phariſee ſayes he.</hi> Act. 23. 6. He cals himſelf a Phariſee ſtill: Nay he was zealous, and concerning the righteouſneſſe of the Law, he was a very blameleſſe man, ſo that if any faire cariaged man under Heaven were right, hee was right. But the truth is S. <hi>Paul</hi> Confeſſes that when God came to opon his eyes, he finde that he was a dead man, a vile wretch he ſhews, he had gone ſheere to hell for all this, if God had not converted him. So that morality is a poore thing. And yet people makes it their Idoll and truſt to it, and thinke certainely they are the children of God, certainly they ſhall have mercy, certainly they ſhall to heaven. And how many Miniſters make this to be true Religion, and preach nothing but this? This then is another way, whereby Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doe leave a dead Congregation by morall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A flat preaching, is, when there is no keenneſſe in our Sermons, when we do not ſtrive to ſtagger mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences that are to be ſtaggered. When a man goes on in a track, Preaches true doctrine, though it were to be wiſhed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42059:39"/>
that more Miniſters would do thus: This does not hunt the heart out of its owne ſtarting holes: this Miniſtery leaves people dead. It is ſaid of our Saviour Chriſt, that the people were aſtoniſht at his Doctrine. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 28. he ſtun'd their conſciences: he ſet them at a ſtand, ſo if a Miniſter would quicken, hee ſhould labour to ſet the wicked at a ſtun. Yee know every wicked one gets ſomewhat or other to hang on, to hope they ſhall not be damned for all they are no better. Now when a Miniſter ſets himſelfe to put his hearers to a ſtun; ſtill to ſtartle truth in an aſtoniſhing manner, that may flaſh the bare truth into the ſoule, and to make them ſee their bad eſtates, this is quickning preaching. But when a mans Miniſtery is cold, there is nothing to ſtun the heart, their heart may have its ſtarting holes for all it, his Miniſtery does not labour to meet with them, this leaves people dead, a Miniſter that ſtill goes on in a track, can never looke to quicken.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe a good Miniſter muſt make Conſcience to bring out new things, as our Saviour Chriſt ſpeakes: <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto an Houſholder, that bringeth out of his treaſure things new and old,</hi> Mat. 13. 52. that is, though he bring none but the old things that were brought before; Yet ſtill he brings them forth as new: He labours to keepe the Word ſtil new unto the heart, the reaſon is this, when people have once been convinced of the truth, preſently it growes ſtale to them, and ſo they are ſubject not to be quickned by it at all. O this we knew before, and ſo the heart makes little or nothing of it. I knew this before. Now when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word darts it in a-new, and makes it looke ſtill with a freſh looke upon the Conſcience; this is a quickning Miniſtery. Like a man that keeps his Barrell ſtill freſh, when a man gives the drinker ſtill freſh from the Barrell: ſo when a Miniſter preaches ſtill freſh from the Word, But when a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter does not do thus, he is like a man that gives one liquor that hath ſtood a great while in the Cup, it growes dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42059:39"/>Secondly, Becauſe a good Miniſter muſt goe further and further, or elſe he cannot quicken. My meaning is this, the more people are convinced by the Word, the more ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtill the heart does deviſe; the more word is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the more wiles the heart mints, the Devill alſo prompting thereunto: ſo that if a Miniſter doe not follow mens hearts ſtill further and further, this will leave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dead. The reaſon is this, Becauſe when the heart hath once invented a wile to maintaine its owne hopes for all the ſame truth, we may preach the truth all the dayes of our life, it will never quicken that mans heart: becauſe ſtill when he heares that truth, he hath a wile lying by him that ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himſelf from it: ſo that there is a neceſſity for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to go further and further. The Word of God is a deepe mine, there is no Bottome, a man may ſtill dig deeper and deeper, <hi>Thy judgements are a great deepe.,</hi> Pſal. 36. 6. When the Miniſter beſieges the heart, he is to dig round about it, and dig deeper and deeper. Still as the heart beares it ſelfe, he is to come with more and more ſupplies out of the Word, againſt it. It is a ſtrange thing to ſee how deepe Miniſters have gone, and yet people arme themſelves againſt the Word of God and are not converted by it. Tell them they muſt be new Creatures, they confeſſe it, and though they be none, yet they have many faire colours to hope they are. Tell them of Communion with God, and fellowſhip with his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and Heavenly-mindedneſſe, and hatred of all ſin, love to univerſall obedience, plucking out their right eyes: looking at the Glory of God: not to truſt in their performances to go out of themſelves; People make a ſhift to have ſomething to anſwer all. All theſe things they hope they have done, in ſome meaſure. Now when Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters goe on and on, and do not goe further and further, this leaves ſuch people dead. It is ſaid of a Preacher that is wiſe, that he ſtill teaches the people knowledge. Becauſe the Preacher was wiſe, he ſtill taught the people knowledge.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42059:40"/>
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 9. That is, people could never come to him, but ſtill hee made them know more and more. You will ſay, how can a Preacher doe thus?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, if a Preacher bee well ſtudied in his own heart, and in the Book of God, this will help him to doe it. For ſtill as hee ſees further into his own heart, ſtill hee will ſee further into the Word of God, and let out more and more light. It is ſaid of Chriſts Miniſtery, That in it the light did ſpring up, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 16. So, this is a true Miniſtery indeed, when the light ſprings up in it. Yee know in a Spring, the water ſpringeth up more and more; now when a Miniſter goes on in a track, and does not doe thus, this is a deading Miniſtery. This is the third thing, Flat Preaching leaves people dead.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Cold Preaching too, when a Miniſter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches coldly, when the Word floweth coldly from his mouth. When a man hides the affectionateneſſe of the Word, from the people, by the coldneſſe of his uttering of it. Beloved, the Word is full of affections: what a deale of affection is there in all the Truthes of the Goſpel; they are all ſteept in the warm blood of the Son of God, there is affection in the promiſes, they proceed from the tender bowels of God: Affection in the threatnings, they all iſſue from the infinite wrath of God againſt ſin. <hi>The Word of God is as fire,</hi> Jer. 23. 29. Now when a Miniſter ſhall preach the Word cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee preaches the Word otherwiſe then it is: Hee does as much as in him lies, to hide the affectionateneſſe of the Word from the peoples hearts. Suppoſe the Town were all on fire, would yee not count the man a ridiculous man, that ſhould come to us, and tell us a cold ſtory? Sirs, let mee tell you a thing, there is a great fire in the Town, and I verily think it may burn all the Town, and you ſhould doe well to goe and quench it: This man tells us ſo indeed, but would not you count him a fool, for telling us ſuch a thing, in a cold careleſſe manner, as if it were a ſmall matter? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42059:40"/>
teacheth us another courſe in ſuch a caſe. Fire, fire, help, O help, for the Lords ſake, water, water, in all haſte. Alas, alas! wee are undone, quickly, quickly, run for lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, run for buckets, run for wet cloathes; ah, you lazie villaine, run apace for iron hooks, and the like: Thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches to deliver ſuch a truth that does ſo neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, affectionately: So it is here, Brethren; what weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things does the Word contain? Truths that our very bowels ſhould yern, and wee ſhould powre out our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Pulpit, that wee may ſhew by our delivery, what they are. Now, when this is not done, this deads peoples hearts. They fit as quiet at a Sermon, though they heare of matters of life and death, eternall life, ſalvation and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Yet they ſit like blocks in their ſeats, as though it were no great matter. Why, they hear one ſtanding in the Pulpit, as though hee were ſaying his leſſon; wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not beleeve they are going to hell, though wee tell them, they will not beleeve the waies of Jeſus Chriſt are ſo good as they are, though wee tell them. It is a pretty ſtory of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> when one told him that hee was beaten and miſ-uſed by ſuch a man; it ſeemes hee told it very dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and coldly, ſhewing no affection at all; Why, ſaith <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> hath hee beaten thee? I doe not beleeve it, No? ſaith the man: and ſo the man was as it were in a great paſſion: I am ſure thus and thus hee did to mee, and doe not you call this beating? Nay, ſaith <hi>Demoſthenes:</hi> now I beleeve hee hath beaten thee indeed. Now you ſpeak as yee had been beaten, as yee ſay. So when a Miniſter preaches unto peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a dreaming manner, though the things bee never ſo weighty, yet they will not beleeve them. He ſaith in a cold manner, that Drunkards are in a bad caſe, and ſuch and ſuch perſons are in a ſad condition, and ſaith, yee muſt repent, or you will all periſh. But people heare him ſpeak ſo frigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe things, that they will not enter into their hearts. If theſe things were preached as they ſhould bee, it would
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42059:41"/>
make people quake. It is ſaid of our Saviour, That when hee was teaching, the Diſciples hearts burned within them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 32. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us, when, &amp;c. Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> makes that to bee the meaning of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where hee ſaith that our Saviour Taught with Authority, and not as the Scribes; that is, ſaith hee, hee did not preach coldly, but with life and zeale, and this went with Authority.</p>
               <p>Now the manner of Preaching is cold, two waies, and, ſo dead.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When it flowes not from the heart, for then it is unlikely that ever it will goe unto the heart, <hi>Pectus facit eſſe diſertos.</hi> The heart is the beſt Oratory, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>What doe you weeping and breaking my heart,</hi> Act. 21. 13. they ſpake ſo heartily, and affectionately, and meltingly to him, this burſt his very heart. In the 17 of <hi>Acts</hi> the 16 <hi>verſe,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit was ſtirred in him, to ſee all <hi>Athens</hi> given to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry: Hee was inwardly moved in his own heart, in his preaching unto them. Now if you look into the 34 verſe of that Chapter, how this quickned ſome there; <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and <hi>Damaris,</hi> and ſome others cleaved unto him: that is, hee preached ſo movingly, that he made their very ſoules cleave unto him. Why? hee ſpake from his heart. There bee many clamorous Preachers, ſaith <hi>Galvin,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame againſt the ſinnes of the people, and thunder againſt them, make as though they had a great deale of zeale, and yet never move a jot, becauſe themſelves have a dead heart, and a ſecure heart, the people ſee through their actings, that they are not moved themſelves, and therefore this does not move them neither: when people can ſee through a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that hee does not preach out of his owne heart, this deadeth their hearts; God bade <hi>Ezekiel</hi> eate the Book, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The manner of preaching is cold, when the Sermon is not delivered in a lively manner; when hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches dully and bluntly. The Apoſtle ſhews in the firſt of the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> that <hi>Epaphras</hi> did a great deale of good in his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42059:41"/>
Miniſtery at <hi>Coloſſe.</hi> Now in the fourth of the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> and the 13 verſe, the Apoſtle ſaith, hee was a zealous Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; <hi>I bear him record,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that hee hath a great zeale for you.</hi> But when a Miniſter hath a cold delivery, this is a great hinderance to the Word.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, how can this bee? Is it not the ſame word whether preached coldly, or with heat? Yes, it is: But the Word hath two things in it; firſt, the bare naked truth: ſecondly, the fatherly affectionateneſſe of God in the ſame. Now a zealous Miniſter; lets the people, in ſome meaſure, ſee both. But a dull Miniſtery holds out the one, and hideth the other. Again, though the Word onely convert, it is not the Miniſter that works, but the Word, yet the Miniſter is appointed of God to bee a meanes to draw peoples atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the word. Now when hee does it in a cold manner, the people are the more apt to let fall their intentions, and not mark it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus you ſee how a Miniſter may bee guilty of the deadneſſe of his people two waies, firſt, by his not preaching at all. Secondly, by his dead manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There is one more yet remaines, and that is, Thirdly, by his dead life and converſation; an evill life in the Miniſter, makes preaching ſeem vile: When hee makes it appear by his courſe, that hee makes no conſcience of framing his life according to his own teaching: Is ſtrict in the Pulpit, and diſſolute in the ſtreet: I confeſſe many are ready to quarrell with the lives of their Teachers without cauſe, as the falſe Apoſtles, with <hi>Paul,</hi> as though hee were carnall, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. But when a man will bee a Miniſter, and yet walk like men hating to bee reformed, and running into the ſame exceſſe of riot with others; how doth this harden peoples hearts, and deadeth the Doctrine it ſelf? it makes preaching ſeem but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oy. When a man will ſeem to perſwade to that which hee neglects himſelf, and to cry out againſt that, of which himſelf doth make a common practiſe. Let no man deſpiſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42059:42"/>
thee, ſayes <hi>Paul</hi> unto <hi>Timothy.</hi> You will ſay, how ſhall that be? Be you an example unto them that Beleeve. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. But I am prevented of time. There is nothing that more deads a mans Miniſtery then this, when the people know in their Conſciences, that the Miniſter is as vile as one of them. Let him preach never ſo excellent things; they will ſay, alas, alas! wee know hee loves his penny, hee loves the pot, hee is not right, no more then one of us. But I am forced to give over.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is. Firſt, Is it ſo, that a Miniſter may<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> be the cauſe why the people are dead? Then here we ſee the reaſon why the Devill is ſo buſie to poyſon Miniſters. He knowes, if he, can poyſon Them, he can quickly poyſon all the Pariſh well-neare. <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired to ſift thee.</hi> Luc. 22. 31. when <hi>Joſhua</hi> was exerciſing the office of the High-Prieſt, Satan ſtood at his right hand <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1. The Devill is like the <hi>Syrians.</hi> O ſayes he, fight neither againſt ſmall nor great, ſave only againſt the King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> If they could ſlay him, they knew they ſhould quickly take his Armie; ſo if the Devill can take the Miniſter, he cares not. If he can make him a worldling, or a drunkard, or a Drone, or a Pluraliſt that is it he deſires. The deading of one Miniſter, deads a 100. others, if he can be a lying ſpirit in a Miniſters mouth, he is able to deceive 200. at once.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here we ſee that Miniſters, of all men, ſhould<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> have a care to be quickned. For if we be not quickned, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our guiltineſſe is very great, we ſhall involve many others in our ſinne: It will go hard with every private perſon that is dead to all goodneſſe: He cannot be ſaved, he cannot eſcape the ſecond death. How then can a dead Miniſter eſcape, that hath not onely his owne deadneſſe to anſwer for, but alſo the deadneſſe of all his people? What ſayes the Lord to the Miniſters of the dead Churches of <hi>Sardis Repent, Repent ſayes he, leſt I come againſt thee, as a theefe, in an hower before thou art aware.</hi> Rev. 3. 3. And therefore let
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42059:42"/>
vs be awakened, that wee may be quickned. Beloved, the times now are very dead, and it is wee that are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church, have let this deadnes in, our not being watchfull, our not being lively and ſtirring in our places, our not being quickened. O what wrath hangs upon us, if we doe not labour for life, that we may communicate it unto our people! The common deadneſſe up and downe ſhould be an argument unto us to excite us. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw the badneſſe of the Church in his dayes, he was very earneſt to have the ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> doubled upon him. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 9. We have need of a double ſpirit of the good Miniſters of God that were before us, the dayes doe require it, never was there more deadneſſe then now is. There are not many that profeſſe holineſſe at all, but of them that doe; O how many are dead, and without life! now who ſhould bee a meanes to quicken people but wee?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſhould teach good people to pray for their<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Miniſters: the more quickned the Miniſters be, it is the better for them. But if they be dead, the infection will deſcend downe into you. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> went out to preach, the Text ſayes. <hi>They were Commended by the Brethren to the grace of God.</hi> Act. 15. 40.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This ſhould be an exhortation to us of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,<note place="margin">Uſe. 4.</note> that wee would take heed unto our ſelves and to all the Church of God that is committed unto our charge: that we would rouze up our ſelves, and ſpecially now, when there was never more need. When the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were about to goe backe againe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Text ſayes, how <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> fell on their faces before all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to beſeech them to forbeare. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 5. They were ſo mightily affected with the peoples ſinne, that they fell upon their faces before them, q. d: For the Lords ſake, and for your own ſoules ſake, Take heed of this ſin. What! will you pull all Heaven about your eares? Will you provoke the living God againſt you? O my Brethren
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42059:43"/>
take heed what yee doe, ſo wee ſhould doe, we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be affected with our own and our peoples dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wee ſhould call upon them to be quickned. O be quickned, the Lord will not endure a dead people, get life if yee be wiſe, it is but a folly to have a name to live, except yee be alive indeed.</p>
               <p>Now the way for us to quicken our people, is, Firſt, If we be good our ſelves. When <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> would encourage the <hi>Levites</hi> to quicken up the people; Sayes he, <hi>The Lord ſhall be with the good.</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 11. Hee will bleſſe your labours, hee will ſtrengthen your Sermons to doe good, though not to all, for the greateſt part are not of God, yet unto his people. Nay if we were good indeed, wee might have hope do too much good, as it is ſaid of <hi>Barnabas he was a good man, and much people were added to the Lord.</hi> Act. 11. 24.</p>
               <p>Againe, Secondly wee ſhould bee earneſt with God to quicken all our hearts, that ſo we may the better quicken our Brethren, as Chriſt ſayes to <hi>Peter, when thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren,</hi> ſo we ſhould deſire God to quicken us, that we may quicken our Brethren, that wee may waſh our hands of our people. What an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was that unto <hi>Paul, When hee could take his people to record, that hee was pure from the bloud of all men!</hi> Act. 20. 26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; We ſhould marke which of our people are dead, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 6. And then thinke, what, are not we guiltie of his deadneſſe?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let us lay about us ſoundly, that we not may be guilty of their ſinnes in any kinde.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Another Uſe is to let us ſee, What a great danger<note place="margin">Uſe. 5.</note> Miniſters are in, they may be guilty of all the evill in their Pariſh, if they doe not their duty, which is a great thing to doe, they have all the ſinnes of their Pariſh lying at their doore, This ſhould keepe us from ſecurity and from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42059:43"/>
pride, many grow proud that are Miniſters, but alas! they know not what an Office they have, that doe ſo. Our very Calling ſhould make our hearts tremble and quake to think what a charge is impoſed upon us. This made <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and many a good man more, ſo fearfull to enter upon this function. <hi>No man takes this honour unto himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (meaning no godly man, no man in his right wits, no man that is well-adviſed what hee does) <hi>but hee that is called,</hi> Heb. 5. 4. as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Pray yee the Lord of the Harveſt that hee would ſend forth labourers into his Harveſt,</hi> Matth. 9. 38. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo it is in the Originall, that hee would thruſt forth labourers into his Harveſt, <hi>q. d.</hi> God will have no good labourers, otherwiſe thoſe that are good are not over-forward to enter into the Miniſtery, as a Father ſayes, it is a burden that the very Angels ſhoulders would tremble under, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> If there were no other Argument but this in the Text, it might ſway all Miniſters hearts in the world, leſt wee bee guilty of our own deadneſſe, and of others too.</p>
               <p>Another Uſe ſhould bee to the people, that they would bee forward, and willing to hear, and greedy to drink in the word of life. The want of this is the deading of many a Miniſters heart. I was in much bitterneſſe, ſaith <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but the hand of the Lord was ſtrong upon mee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 14. that is, I had had no heart at all to preach, but that the hand of the Lord was exceedingly aſſiſtant unto mee; whereas the forwardneſſe of people, is a great meanes to quicken up their Miniſters. When the whole City flocked in to heare <hi>Paul,</hi> though the wicked were mad at it; The Text ſaith, <hi>Hee grew bold,</hi> Act. 13. 44, 45. When the people crowded in upon our Saviour, that hee had not ſo much as time to eat bread, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 20. the Text ſhews that he ſo be-ſtirred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there, that his own Kinsſolk thought hee had been mad, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>WEE have done with the Inſcription, <hi>And unto the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write.</hi> Wee come now to the Subſcription, and that is in theſe words. <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres;</hi> Which words contain a deſcription of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom this Epiſtle is ſent unto the Church, and hee is deſcribed very gloriouſly, to the intent that what hee ſaies, may bee the more reverently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly regarded. The Deſcription ſets forth two admirable properties and royalties of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Firſt, <hi>That hee hath the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> that is, hee hath the Holy Ghoſt, to give to whomſoever hee pleaſe. Secondly, <hi>That he hath the ſeven Starres,</hi> that is, the Paſtours and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church. Chriſt hath them all in his hand, to ſend them, to gift them, to aſſiſt them, to preſerve them, to vouchſafe them to a people, or to take them away, as hee liſts: and the Miniſters are called Stars, becauſe they are to ſhine in the firmament of the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the firſt royalty of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is, that hee hath the ſeven Spirits of God: by the ſeven Spirits of God, hee meanes the Holy Ghoſt; you will ſay the Holy Ghoſt is but one Spirit. <hi>By one Spirit wee are all baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>There is one Body and one Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 4. <hi>Through him, wee both have an acceſſe by one Spirit unto the Father,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 18. The Spirit of God is but one. Yee know there is but one God, in three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: one Father, one Sonne, one holy Spirit. <hi>There bee three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7. there is but one Father, and one Sonne, whom the Apoſtle there calls the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42059:44"/>
Word, for ſo hee is often called in the Scripture. <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi> that is, the Son of God was made fleſh: ſo there is but one Holy Ghoſt, one Holy Spirit. Why then does the Text here ſay of Chriſt, that hee hath the ſeven Spirits of God?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, yee may know that the <hi>Revelation</hi> uſes peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar phraſes, auguſt, and myſticall. Now the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks thus in the plurall number, is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe hee alludes to the manner of his Viſions, now in his Viſions, the holy Ghoſt was thus repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as yee may ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 5. where he ſaw ſeven Lamps of fire, burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God. So, again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 6. where hee ſaw a <hi>Lamb as it had been ſlain, having ſeven hornes, and ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent forth into all the earth.</hi> So, that this is one reaſon why hee calls the Holy Ghoſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits of God, becauſe hee ſpeaks after this manner, of the Viſion that hee ſaw.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another reaſon is, becauſe hee was to write to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Now hee ſpeaks of the Holy Ghoſt in the ſame number, becauſe that one and the ſame Holy Ghoſt, is ſeverally and intirely powred upon them all. The Spirit of God was in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Spirit of God was in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and the Spirit of God was in <hi>Pergamos,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea:</hi> and therefore hee calls him the ſeven Spirits of God, though hee bee but one and the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee calls him the ſeven Spirits of God, by a common <hi>Metalepſis,</hi> of putting the effects for the cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there bee many and ſundry gifts and graces, of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God; the number ſeven being put to ſignifie the perfection of them, and the univerſallneſſe of them.</p>
               <p>Now that the ſeven ſpirits of God, are nothing elſe, but that one and the ſame holy Spirit of God, is plain, out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4, 5. <hi>John, to the ſeven Churches in</hi> Aſia: <hi>Grace bee</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42059:45"/>
                  <hi>unto you, and peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the ſeven Spirits which are before his Throne, and from Jeſus Chriſt, which is the faithfull witneſſe.</hi> Which words are Saint <hi>Johns</hi> ſaluting of the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> wherin hee wiſhes them all grace from the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, <hi>q. d.</hi> Grace bee to you and peace from God the Father, and from the holy Spirit of God, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the faithfull and true witneſſe: Calling the Father, which was, which is, which is to come, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the faithfull and true witneſſe, and the Holy Ghoſt, the ſeven Spirits of God. It is the very ſelf ſame ſalutation that <hi>Paul</hi> uſes in all his Epiſtles, in effect; ſaving that this is more full, and more lofty and <hi>auguſt.</hi> Now then by the ſeven Spirits of God, hee cannot mean any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or creatures, as Angels, or ſo: but hee muſt needs mean the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe hee prayes for grace from the ſeven Spirits of God, which no creature is able to give. Yee know God onely can give grace, God onely, is the Authour of all grace: Hee onely can juſtifie, and ſanctifie, and quicken, and give a man eternall life, as <hi>James, Every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift commeth from above,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. It were Idolatry in <hi>John,</hi> to wiſh to the Churches, grace from the ſeven Spirits of God, if hee meant by them any Angels, or any other creatures. Wee might worſhip the Angels, if they were able to give us grace, wee might pray to them, and ſerve them, and feare them and adore them, if they could bee the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of grace to us. Now this is Idolatry. <hi>Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Matth. 4. 10. <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom bee glory for ever,</hi> Amen. Rom. 11. 36. Yee know it is the glory of God to bee the Cauſe of all grace. Now what ſaies God? <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my glory will I not give to another.</hi> Iſa. 42. 8. Well then, you ſee what is here meant by the ſeven Spirits of God, even the holy Ghoſt himſelf, that one &amp; the ſame holy Spirit of God.

                  <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee, that hath the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> that is, theſe things ſaith Chriſt, that hath the holy Spirit of God, to give him to whomſoever hee pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Not as though that were all, that Chriſt hath the holy Spirit of God, for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> had the holy Spirit of God, <hi>I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo that I have the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 40. ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all the Saints, all the people of God have the holy Spirit of God, nay, a man is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and is a meer carcaſſe, like a dead body without a ſoule, that hath not the holy Spirit of God, therefore that is not all the meaning of it, that Chriſt hath the holy Spirit of God; for ſo all the children of God have him, and are quickned by him up to all goodneſſe: But <hi>Chriſt hath the holy Spirit of God,</hi> that is, hee hath him to give to whomſoever hee pleaſes.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, is it not God the Father that gives the holy ſpirit to all his poore children?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Yes, it is very true, Hee hath him to give to whomſoever hee is pleaſed to give him, for the Holy Ghoſt is his Spirit as well as Chriſt, hee flowes from them both. And therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>How much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Luk. 11. 13. ſo that the Father gives the holy ſpirit to whom hee will, but it is in Chriſts name, Chriſt is the ſtore-houſe of this gift. When the Father gives his holy ſpirit unto any man, it is onely in Chriſts name, as himſelf ſpeaks: <hi>The Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, Hee ſhall teach you all things,</hi> Joh. 14. 26. Mark, it is onely in Chriſts name.</p>
               <p>Well, now wee ſee the point, <hi>That Chriſt onely hath the Holy Spirit of God to give to whom hee pleaſes:</hi> If any poore creature would fain have the holy ſpirit of God to be in him, hee muſt come to Chriſt for him. Though the barrell bee never ſo full of good Wine, yet when it is hoopt round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, if one would have any, hee muſt draw it at the tap: ſo,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42059:46"/>
Beloved, the Lord hath hoopt himſelf up from men, hee hath cloſed himſelf up from all men, by reaſon of mens ſins, hee hath ſhut himſelf up, no man can have any of his holy ſpirit, but hee muſt come and draw it at the tap: hee muſt come to Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord vents himſelf onely in him, as Chriſt ſaith, hee that beleeveth on mee, as the Scripture hath ſaid, <hi>Out of his belly ſhall ſlow rivers of living water.</hi> What is that? this ſpake hee of the ſpirit, which they that beleeve on him ſhould receive, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38, 39. Mark, Chriſt is the tap, yee muſt come to him by true beleeving, or yee cannot receive any of Gods holy Spirit. Hee only hath him to give to them that doe imbrace him. From him proceed all the graces of the Spirit, that any men doe injoy. This is his Roialty, as being the only King and Head of the Church, and the opened fountain, that all that would bee ſaved muſt repaire unto. Hee is the beginning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceedeth from him, as hee is the Son of God, and as hee is man, hee is anointed with him. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. Ho, every one that would have him, come unto mee for him. Away with your ſins, and take mee, abhorre all your own waies, ſee what damnable creatures yee are in your ſelves, whether your luſts and corruptions carrie you, what will become of you, if yee goe on in your own paths? if yee would have grace, and mercy, and life, and ſalvation, come to mee, The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee, to powre him upon you, that yee may bee ſaved. I ſay Chriſt is anointed with him, the Lord hath given him his Spirit in abundance, hee hath enough ſpirit to infuſe into all that lay hold upon him, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath not given the Spirit by meaſure unto him,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. No, hee hath the holy Spirit without meaſure, hee hath all ſtore of ſpirituall graces, to afford to them that lack; a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie of all heavenly bleſſings, to inrich all his poore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Members.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of this Point, why Chriſt onely hath the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42059:46"/>
holy Spirit of God, to give where hee will, are three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe there is none but hee, that God is well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in. God is out with all the ſonnes of men, by reaſon of ſin and wickedneſſe, they are all hatefull unto him, they are odious in his ſight, and the whole world cannot make him and them friends again, that ever hee ſhould give them grace and favour, much leſſe his holy Spirit. There is none in whom God is well-pleaſed but in his Son. <hi>This is my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> Father, and Holy Ghoſt, Both came and reſted upon him, ſaying, This is the onely Hee, in whom I am well-pleaſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>q. d.</hi> If yee get him to bee your Advocate, take him, and come unto mee with him, then I will bee friends with you, hee may help you with reconciliation with mee, hee may get mee to give you my holy Spirit, <hi>I am well-pleaſed in him,</hi> and in none but him. This is one Reaſon, ſo that Chriſt onely can put his holy Spirit into thy heart, and ſo ſend thee to his Father. As <hi>Paul</hi> put a loving mediating letter in <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> his pocket, and ſo ſent him to his Maſter: then hee will bee well-pleaſed with thee, when thou haſte Chriſts Letter of commendation about thee, then thou mayeſt goe to God from day to day, and bee accepted with him: None can doe this for thee but onely Chriſt, hee onely can put a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating Letter in thy hand, hee onely can give thee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions of his holy Spirit. Thouſands goe to God in mans duties from day to day, and becauſe they are without this, Chriſt hath not given them his holy Spirit, therefore they are not accepted. God is not pleaſed with them, they pray without his ſpirit, they cry God mercy without his ſpirit, they ſeek to enter in without his ſpirit, and ſo they are not admitted. Now when a ſoule comes to Chriſt, God is well-pleaſed with Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt can give him this love-token, Chriſt can give him the holy Spirit, and ſo hee ſhall bee admitted into favour with God. God is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed in him. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42059:47"/>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> could preſent his Brethren unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gen. 47. 2. If any bodie elſe had preſented them, they ſhould never have found favour, but <hi>Joſeph</hi> could put acceptance upon them. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was well pleaſed in him. So God is well pleaſed in his Son, and therefore he can doe it and none but He.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon is, Becauſe the Holy Spirit of God will never enter into man more, except Gods Juſtice be ſatisfied. God is reſolved he will not put up thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities that men offer unto him, except they bring with them one, in whom his wrath is appeaſed. As Saint <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Lambe ſlaine hath ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God.</hi> Rev. 5. 6. That is, hee hath ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, and therefore he hath the Holy Spirit of God ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Holy Spirit of God will goe to thoſe men that he hath ſatisfied Gods juſtice for, I ſay the Holy Spirit of God will not goe to any man, without ſatisfaction, if any one will ſhew him ſatisfaction, then the Spirit of God will ſay, I will goe where you will have mee, onely let mee have ſatisfaction. Now, Beloved, Chriſt onely can ſay to the Holy Spirit come a-long with me to this man, here's a ſatisfaction unto Juſtice, Therefore he only hath the Spirit at his diſpencing. And therefore if any man would have Gods Holy Spirit, he muſt bring the Lambe Divine ſlaine, with him to God. Lord here I have the Lamb ſlaine, and now let me ſee thy face, now let mee have thy Spirit, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abner,</hi> bring me <hi>Michol,</hi> or never thinke to ſee my face. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>q. d.</hi> never come to me, except thou bring mee my <hi>Michol</hi> with thee. The bringing of <hi>Michol</hi> with him, this might helpe him to ſee the Kings face. So, Beloved, when a man getteth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and brings him with him to God, this may helpe him to Gods Holy Spirit. Bring him along with thee, and thou ſhalt ſee my face, thou ſhalt have my holy Spirit. Neither will God ſend thee his Holy Spirit, neither will the Holy Spirit come to thee otherwiſe. Chriſt onely hath him to give. Have Chriſt and have him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42059:47"/>Thirdly, another Reaſon is, why Chriſt hath the Holy Spirit to give, Becauſe he is fleſh of our fleſh, and Bone of our Bone, and wee may goe to him: hee is the fitteſt to have him to give, becauſe he being man aſwell as wee, wee may make bold to goe to him: My Brethren, wee are not able to goe to God for any thing, much leſſe for his Spirit, wee are not able to looke upon him immediately, as a man is not able to looke upon the Sun-Beames in their ſtrength, ſpecially if hee have ſore eyes: But let him get a Scarfe, or a Cypreſſe, and now hee may. Now the Sun-beames will ſhine upon him through the Cypreſſe, and not hurt him. The Scarfe is able to convey unto him the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames, without dazling of him. So, beloved, Chriſt is able to convey the Holy Spirit of God into any man, our ſore Conſciences may look up to God through him, he moderates Gods looke, hee can make us looke God in the face, in a comfortable manner. Now we may aske any thing of him, even his Holy Spirit, and he will give him, as the Apoſtle ſayes: <hi>By him we have boldneſſe,</hi> Eph. 3. 12. O, beloved, they are great things that we need. We have need of ſuch great matters, that when the Conſcience is awakened, it can have no hope to obtaine, that God ſhould pardon ſuch vile wrecthes as we, that he ſhould accept of ſuch poore ſervices as ours, that he ſhould love ſuch filthy ones as wee are, that he ſhould give us a Kingdome, and his owne Holy Spirit to enliven us, to eſtabliſh our hearts, to be an earneſt of Heaven to us: how can we hope he will give us ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercies? Now the Lord hath put all theſe Bleſſings into the hands of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, that is fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones. Now we may boldly goe to him for them. As <hi>Moſes</hi> when his face ſhone, <hi>Aaron</hi> was afraid to come neare him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 30. Therefore hee put a vaile over his face: Now <hi>Aaron</hi> and others were able to come nigh him; ſo before, none were able to come to God for any thing, but now the Lord hath put a vaile of fleſh
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42059:48"/>
upon himſelfe by incarnating his owne Son, now we may make bold.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this, is, Firſt; Is it ſo that Chriſt hath the ſeven<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Spirits of God? Then, what hath he not? He is an all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Saviour. He is Gods Steward, God hath put all his goods into his hands. No man can be aſſured of any thing that is good, but by comming unto him. <hi>All things are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to me of my Father.</hi> Mat. 11. 27. <hi>That is, I have all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods in my hand:</hi> Favour, Pardon, Mercy, Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Comfort, Heaven it ſelfe, yea and his holy Spirit and all, I have the diſtributing of them all. He is the ſtore-houſe whither all needy ſoules are to goe, He is full of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of good things, as <hi>John</hi> ſaies, <hi>Of his fulneſſe have we al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Joh.</hi> 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Looke what grace any of the Saints have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have it all of him, he is Gods Conduit-pipe, the Lord opens himſelfe only in him; he is the tap, he lets out Gods Bleſſings, and Graces, and Spirit, like a ſluce. Hee is the Lord Treaſurer of Heaven and Earth: As <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if any one would have Corne; they muſt goe to <hi>Joſeph</hi> for it, if they came to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> but for a pecke, or a gallon, preſently he ſent them to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſo the Lord ſends all that will have any drop of mercy, to his Sonne, if yee will not goe to my Sonne, yee ſhall not have one drop, yee ſhall dye in your ſinnes. <hi>This is my welbeloved Sonne,</hi> ſayes hee, looke yee heare him: hearken to him: obey him: be ruled by him: bow down unto him: doe as he bids you: if ye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him, and will not ſtoop unto him: if your hearts will not burſt, if your minds will not off from the world, and other things, and be wholly intent unto him, if yee ſlight him, and ſuffer vain things to draw away your affections and thoughts and meditations from him; there is no redemption for you. No Salvation but onely by beleeving in his name, he hath all the ſeven Spirits of God, no Spirit of Grace at all can be had but onely of him, he was the Rocke, that <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt ſtand on, that the glory of Gods goodneſſe might paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42059:48"/>Secondly, Another uſe is, hath Chriſt the ſeven Spirits of<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> God? then wee are without excuſe: if wee be without the Holy Spirit of God, Chriſt hath him to give: and yet how few will ſeeke him of Jeſus Chriſt! as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Yee will not come unto me, that yee might have life.</hi> Joh. 5. 40. That is, if yee would come unto me, I would make your dead hearts to live, I would quicken you to all goodneſſe, I would powre my Holy Spirit upon you: But you will not come unto me, for it. This makes us without excuſe, That Chriſt hath the Spirit in him, for all that have a minde to him, and wee have no minde. How few among you to this very day have gotten yet Gods Holy Spirit? Yee pray, but yee have not the ſpirit of ſupplieation, to pray by, to lift up your hearts, to enliven your deſires, to be able to wreſtle with God to any purpoſe, no Spirit of grace ſtirring in you. When ye come to the houſe of God, ye heare Sermons but the Holy Ghoſt does not fall upon you to make them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and mightie in operation, to convert you to God, to knocke off your baſe luſts: yee are dead in all holy duties, voide of all Heavenly graces, dull to every good thing, even as the Body without the ſpirit is dead. Nay the Spirit of the world dwelleth in moſt men tying and glving them to the things here below, and will not let them ſavor and relliſh the things of Heaven. Whereby they cannot ceaſe from ſinne nor work the works of God. Rare is that man, now-a-dayes, that hath the Holy Spirit of God remaining in him in any meaſure: nay if people were asked, whether they have the Spirit of God, yea or no, their owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could anſwer. No they have not: they never felt any ſuch Divine ghueſt; their earthlineſſe and lumpiſhneſſe of heart in all the ordinances of God, their unaquaintedneſſe with God, their unſettledneſſe, and nakedneſſe, and blindneſſe in all the wayes of peace, plainely does declare it; and yet they will not come unto Chriſt that they might have life: he hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and yet they cannot finde in their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42059:49"/>
hearts, to be inſtant and earneſt with him, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> appointed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to diſtribute corne to all comers; Goe to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 55. the Text ſayes, <hi>all Countries came to Joſeph for Corne, becauſe the famine was ſore in all lands.</hi> But God hath appointed his own Sonne to be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencer of the Spirit, and there is a ſore want of the ſpirit every where in all Townes and Pariſhes, and yet hardly any will come in. Certainely, this is the condemnation, that men intend their pleaſure, and their profits, and every out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, and never ſeeke to Jeſus, to have the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, many of us have hard hearts that cannot melt at our owne ſinnes, nor the publike provocations whereby God is provoked, nor the generall calamities of the Church: our hearts are like a ſtone, and wee are not affected, nor can be affected, no relenting at the Word, no bleeding in any other good dutie, nothing moves us: the ſpirit could ſoften, yea, and take the ſtone away, and Chriſt ſaies hee would give him unto us, if we did deſire him. <hi>I will put a new Spirit within you, and take the ſtony heart out of the fleſh.</hi> Ezek. 11. 19. Hee hath ſpirit enough in him to doe it, and yet we will not ſue to him but in a feigned manner, and ſo a hard heart poſſeſſeth us ſtill, which marres all our familie-duties, and all that wee doe in the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: nothing comes of all that wee doe. If our fooliſh hearts would come downe to be fervent after Chriſt, this might be be remedied. He hath the ſeven Spirits of God for the nonce. But a ſpirit of ſlumber bewitches us, and and nothing can awaken us to this very day. Never was there a more hard-hearted time, never more hard-hearted Chriſtians, nummed, and paſt feeling, wiſhing indeed the things mought be mended, but never putting forth our hand to have them mended.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſcarce any of us can pray, but in a blunt-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-wiſe: our prayers never ſtirre Heaven, never give ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42059:49"/>
much as a lift to any of our luſts, neither are they any whit anſwerable to the miſeries that are on us, whether Perſonall or Nationall, the ſpirit could helpe us, and enlarge us, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies of the good <hi>Romans, Yee have received the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption whereby yee cry Abba Father.</hi> Rom. 8. 15. and Chriſt hath this Spirit in his hand, to give. But we would rather ſit woulding and yawning then be downe on our knees before God. Every one almoſt hath heavy things that he is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious of: terrible guiltines, horrible miſ-givings, ſelf-conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, uncertainties about his later end, doubtfulneſſe whether any thing be ſound, yea or no; and yet no heart of prayer, no ſtrainings after Chriſt to have the Holy Spirit of him. Nay, tittle tattle is preferred before comming about Chriſt: and every idle buſines more takes up our thoughts, then how we may injoy Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where is the man well-neer, that is holy? ſome indeed are civill, and not very many, no, not of them that would bee held for Profeſſers. For what Civility, Honeſty is there, when people are palpably proud, and palpably covetous, and palpably malicious, and ſpightfull, and envious? but, put caſe many be Civill; yet holineſſe is hardly any where to be ſeene. Where are any that are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto ſin? Crucified to the world? Pilgrims on earth, Heavenly-minded? taken up with God? <hi>The Spirit indeed, is a Spirit of Holineſſe,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. And Chriſt hath him to give but hee cannot have our cuſtome: We are not thirſtie after ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Where is the Communion of Saints? a Theme I ſpake of the laſt Sabbath day. We are all like unto <hi>Ephraim. Ephraim hath mixed himſelf among the people.</hi> Hoſ. 7. 8. that is, they had no Communion of Saints there among them. They were a miſh-maſh people; there was a Chaos and a confuſion and a medly among them. If there be any that beare the name of Saints; They are like Lambs feeding all alone in a large place. <hi>Like Iſrael when they are ſcatterd.</hi> Hoſ. 4.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42059:50"/>
16. Lambes withour flockes: Birds without mates: As if they were all frighted aſunder: No Communion of Saints, no Communion of graces, nor duties, nor hearts, nor affections. I confeſſe if we had the Holy Spirit of God, we would make a communion among us: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and the love of God and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all, Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 14. He would make a Commuinon among us, and Chriſt hath him too, and there we might have him, but we care not for him: which is a moſt fearefull thing: a ſigne of horrible deadneſſe and liveleſneſſe in good: as it is with the boughes of a tree, when they are dead, they fall off, but they hang together as long as they are alive. Though communion of Saints, be an Article of our faith, yet we let it dye. We ſee in nature, if we ſling any meat to a Hen, preſently ſhee cluckes for all her Chickens to have part: So, looke what graces we get, we ſhould impart what we can: the Lord hath appointed mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving good example unto one another, edifying one another, exhorting one another, admoniſhing one another, comforting one another, conferring one with another, ſupplicating one with and for another. As it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 10. <hi>That</hi> Simon <hi>and</hi> James <hi>and</hi> Iohn <hi>were partners in their fiſhing, looke what fiſhes they caught, they divided among one another; ſo Chriſtians ſhould be partners.</hi> What they get at a Sermon, they are to impart, What they get in prayer, or at Sacraments, or in affliction; there be others that ſhould be partners with them: as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Looke not every man on his owne things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> Phil. 2. 4. O ſayes he, if there be any fellow-ſhip of the Spirit, thus it muſt be, that is, the Spirit would breed this fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among you. Now, Beloved, where is this holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be had but in Chriſt? I ſay wee are without excuſe, if we doe not get the Holy Spirit of God, Becauſe Chriſt hath him for us, if we would reſort to him, and therefore wee can have no plea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:42059:50"/>Firſt, Wee cannot plead, wee have no need of the holy Spirit of God: what need wee have him, as long as wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is ſuch a one? Is it needfull wee ſhould have him? I, that it is; why elſe did God make his Son to bee the diſpenſer, and the diſtributer, and communicater of him? O, Beloved, the Lord hath done this, becauſe wee cannot bee ſaved without the holy Spirit of God: would wee bee regenerated and born again; wee cannot without the Spirit: <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3. 6. Wee can never bee ſpirituall without the Spirit of God: none but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men and women ſhall enter into the Kingdome of God. Drunkards, and adulterers, and lyers, and muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, and better men than they, are carnall men. <hi>Now to bee carnally minded is death, but to bee ſpiritually minded, this onely is life and peace:</hi> ſo that wee cannot plead that.</p>
               <p>Again, Wee cannot bee juſtified without the Spirit of God, Yee may ſay, O, wee hope to bee juſtified onely by Faith in Chriſt; True, but if yee have not the Spirit of God, yee have no Faith, none have true faith in Chriſt, till firſt they have the holy Spirit of God, and therefore it is called the ſpirit of Faith, that is, a ſpirit inclining a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; bowing of the minde, and heart, and ſoule, to all heavenly things in Chriſt, no man can bee juſtified without this, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, But yee are ſanctified, yee are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.</p>
               <p>Again, Yee cannot have free-will to doe the will of God without the holy Spirit of God. I confeſſe, by nature no man hath free-will: I, but if yee bee not more then nature, yee cannot bee ſaved. Yee muſt have free-will to all the waies of God, or yee cannot bee ſaved. Now yee never can have this without the Spirit of God. Can yee mortifie every wicked luſt? can yee reſiſt the devill every day? can yee keep out the world, and ward off the temptations of the fleſh, yee can never doe it while the world ſtands in a holy
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42059:51"/>
courſe, without the holy Spirit of God. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. Mark, there is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to all theſe things, that man hath liberty to doe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall things, that hath the Spirit of the Lord, and no man elſe.</p>
               <p>Again, Yee are none of Chriſts, if yee have not the holy Spirit of Chriſt; that is the Mark hee brands all his ſheep with, as a man ſaies, when hee heares tydings of any of his ſheep; ſaith hee, if they bee mine, they have ſuch a mark: they have an A. and a B. on the left ſide, or ſo: ſo ſaies Chriſt, if they bee mine, they have my Spirit, if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, hee is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Hereby wee know that hee abideth in us,</hi> ſaith John, <hi>by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which hee hath given us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. ſo that wee have need of the ſpirit, and therefore this cannot bee our plea, that wee have no need: wee have ſuch need of Gods holy Spirit, that wee cannot bee ſaved without the having of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee cannot plead, wee know not where to have him. For Chriſt ſaith, hee hath him to give to all that will receive him. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 1. that is, hee is powred upon mee, that hee may run down upon all them that come to be my members. If Chriſt indeed had not come, if God had not made him <hi>Vehiculum Spiritus,</hi> if God had not put his ſpirit upon Chriſt, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Fountain, to run out upon all that will hold their hearts under him; then wee might have ſome excuſe: Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wee know not where to have the Spirit. But the Lord hath told us where wee may have him. Wee may have him in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wee cannot plead, wee cannot tell how to have him: For as yee know where to have him, ſo yee may know how to have him too: and yee all doe know, if wee had a heart wee may have him foure waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the hearing of the Word: you will ſay, yee have heard the Word many times; yet yee never received the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42059:51"/>
holy Spirit yet. I anſwer, that's certain, but it is becauſe yee doe not come to it with a greedy yerning heart, with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen eare, and a willing minde to bee guided by it. For if ye came thus with this minde, yee would quickly have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Lord tell mee any thing, I doe unfeignedly deſire for to doe it; reprove any thing in mee, I doe ſincerely deſire to leave it. Come thus to the Word; I dare ſay, thou ſhalt not bee one quarter of an houre without the ſpirit, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Turn yee at my reproof: behold, I will powre out my ſpirit un to you,</hi> Prov. 1. 23. You will ſay, this is ſtrange, and have I heard ſo many Sermons, and never got the ſpirit yet? I, you never heard Sermons with an honeſt heart: You ſhall ſee, <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company got the ſpirit at the firſt Sermon that they heard, when <hi>Peter</hi> Preached, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt fell on all thoſe that heard the Word,</hi> Act. 10. 44. How ſo? yee may read there in the Context, O ſaies <hi>Cornelius, Wee are all here preſent before God, to heare all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God.</hi> Ver. 33. Now, if wee have the Word daily preached, and wee get not the holy ſpirit of God; wee are without excuſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By Prayer, if wee did pray faithfully unto God, wee ſhould have the holy ſpirit, as Chriſt ſaies: <hi>If ye that are evill, can give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Luk. 11. 13. You will ſay, yee have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many a time and often, and yet yee finde no ſuch thing, and no marvaile; when a mans heart prayes onely by the by: but if yee made it your buſineſſe, from day to day, if yee would ſeek for him as for life, and look upon it as more neceſſary then life it ſelf; then yee ſhould quickly ſpeed: But when yee will give God the blinde, and the lame, and your hearts run a whoring after other things; Heaven is not the main of all your care, and ſtudy: the Lord knows a hollow heart, and can tell how to deny it: none ſhall have his ſpirit, that doe not deſire him above all things, and labour after
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42059:52"/>
him above all things, and uſe all manner of meanes for him. The Spirit of God is a great gift, and wee muſt know its an infinite mercy to obtain him, and therefore wee muſt ſeek him accordingly. They that get him, doe not goe dreaming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By repentance; this is another means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Holy Ghoſt, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi> Joel 2. 13. what followes? <hi>And after that I will powre my Spirit upon you,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Never think to have Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and live after the fleſh, or goe on in a forme, or a careleſſe way: not onely drunkenneſſe and whoredome, and capitall ſins, keep him out, but any other luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the heart clings unto; Rent your hearts then, let your drowzie doings pain you at the heart, let all your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and unbeleef, and luke warmneſſe, whereby yee part ſtakes with God, let all theſe bee a burden unto you, and you heavy laden with them: this is the way-making for the Spirit of Gods comming in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Take no deniall, let not ill-ſucceſſe beat you off; this is that which thruſteth back thouſands: They find little ſucceſſe at the firſt, and ſo they give over. But, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this is it, howſoever wee finde cold ſucceſſe in our holy labours, at the firſt, yet wee muſt goe on, though wee doe not finde our luſts die, though wee doe not finde that ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Prayer that wee could wiſh, that prevailing in our endevours, that wee doe deſire, yet ſtill wee are to goe on, and ſtill wait upon God, in abounding in our care, untill the Lord grant us better ſucceſſe. The hard ſucceſſe that we have, muſt not hinder us, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let us not bee weary in well-doing, for in due time wee ſhall reap, if wee faint not,</hi> Gal. 6. 9. That is, let us not bee diſcouraged with hard ſucceſſes, or any other ſuch like thing: certainly, if wee goe on wee ſhall ſpeed. When the Wiſemen came ſeeking for Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they had no good ſucceſſe there, they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42059:52"/>
did not finde him there, yet they would not return back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; But they went down to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and ſought for him there. When the Church had ſought Chriſt in her bed, ſhee had no ſucceſſe for that time. <hi>I ſought him,</hi> ſayes ſhee, <hi>but I found him not,</hi> Cant. 3. 1. What, would ſhee give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becauſe of her bad ſucceſſe at the firſt? No, ſhee trudged out into the Lanes and the ſtreets, ſhe enquired of the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſtill ſhee had little or no ſucceſſe. But the Text ſaith, ſhee would never give over, till ſhe litt upon him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, wee muſt take heed of this. It is the impatience of mens hearts, if they cannot finde a bleſſing at firſt daſh, they will ſeek no further, then they ſtrike into a former, or a worſe condition: In the firſt of <hi>Haggai,</hi> yee may read, that when the Jews had been hindered by <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> from build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple for a fit, they gave over: Becauſe they had no ſucceſſe, they would build no more, but fell a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own houſes, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. yee know it was their ſin, and the Lord plagued them for it. Therefore, Brethren, it muſt bee our care, although wee doe not ſpeed at the firſt, not to ſlacken, or give in: As <hi>Iſaac</hi> would ſtill bee building<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wells, hee built one, and that had no ſucceſſe, hee built another, and that had as bad; ſtill there fell out ſtrife, what then? did he give over ſo? No, hee never would have done, till the Lord gave him a <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> a Well that there was no ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 22. ſo, wee ſhould never bee quiet, untill the Lord give us his holy Spirit; though wee doe not feele his workings in us at the firſt, no bad ſucceſſes though never ſo many, ſhould make us weary: But ſtill wee ſhould goe on, a ſeeking of the holy Spirit of God. Thus, as wee know where to have the Spirit of God, namely in Chriſt, ſo, wee know how too, and therefore wee are without excuſe, if wee ſuffer our ſelves to bee void of Gods holy and bleſſed Spirit; this is the ſecond uſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another Uſe, is, to you that doe indeed complain<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> of great want of the Spirit: here you ſee where yee may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42059:53"/>
have ſupplies even from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hee hath the ſeven Spirits of God. They labour to know Chriſt more and more: this is the way to have more and more of the Spirit, as the Apoſtle ſaith: That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation in the knowledge of him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17. Get the knowledge of Chriſt more and more, and thus the ſpirit ſhall come to thee more and more. It is ſaid of the Indian Gymnoſophiſts, that they would lye all the day long, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sun in the firmament, ſo ſhould Chriſtians doe, they ſhould lye looking upon Chriſt, the more ſpirit ſtill they ſhall have, if they doe ſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt, May be ye want ſpirit to make you know the Lords will, you finde your ſelves backward from day to day: little or no heart to Gods Commandements; look up to Chriſt, and ſay, Lord there is enough ſpirit in Chriſt, and hee hath it for all them that doe want, and would have the ſame; O give mee ſome together with him, as hee ſayes, <hi>I will put my Spirit into you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> Ezek. 36. 27. <hi>q. d.</hi> look up to mee, I will doe this for you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, May bee yee want ſtrength, yee have many temptations, and you have no ſtrength to reſiſt them, they come in upon you like the breaking in upon you; may bee yee are tempted to deny all, and to ſay yee have nothing in you; ſometimes yee are tempted to give over all, ſaying, it is but a folly, I ſhall one day bee damned, and I were as good give over now, as to doe it afterwards, when it will bee worſe, and yee have no ſtrength to hold out; ſometimes yee cannot meditate; yee cannot pray, yee are fain to break off in the midſt; with baſe feares; with ſecurity, and vain hopes; you are tempted to doe as the world does, and yee have no ſtrength to oppoſe them: Look up to Chriſt, yee know the Spirit of Chriſt, is a ſpirit of power, and ſtrength, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. and hee hath him for you: Look up to him then, and cry for his ſtrong ſpirit. Who knowes? may
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42059:53"/>
bee, you may bee able to ſay in the end, as <hi>Paul</hi> does: <hi>I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, May bee, yee want boldneſſe to call God your Father: yee are in a quandary, whether yee ſhould call him ſo or no: yee are afraid, hee is none of your Father, and that yee are none of his adopted ones: yee ſhall but blaſpheme him to call him your Father, or to expect of him a childes portion; Look up to Chriſt, hee hath ſuch a ſpirit in him, whereby yee may cry, <hi>Abba Father, Gal.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, May bee yee want life and quickning, you finde your ſelves very dead, even as the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> in this place; <hi>I know thy works, that thou art dead.</hi> Look up to Chriſt, as here hee does bid thee, hee hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and hath that which will quicken thee. Chriſt himſelf, when hee was naturally dead, hee was quickned by his own ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. That very ſpirit can quicken thy ſpirituall deadneſſe, to every good word and work. His ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is life, and that will make thee lively, though thy heart bee little better then a Timber-logge in duties, yet if that ſpirit get within thee, it will make thee agile, and active in every good thing. It is a horrible thing to ſee, how little, Chriſtians know of Jeſus Chriſt, though they have been thought to know Jeſus Chriſt ſo long a time, yet they doe not know him. Chriſt takes this very ill, as hee told <hi>Philip: Have I been ſo long time with you, and haſt thou not known mee, Philip?</hi> Joh. 14. 9. Chriſt could bee even angry with him, for learning him no better: what little ſpirit is there in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now adaies! a ſigne, though they have been a long time a learning Chriſt, yet they hardly know him: For if wee knew him, Brethren, wee could not bee at enmity with the holy Spirit. Wee doe not look up to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, what is it to look up to Chriſt in all your wayes?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, It is to follow Chriſt, as where <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:42059:54"/>The Text ſayes, <hi>That two of his Diſciples went away and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after Jeſus,</hi> Joh. 1. 36, 37. O thought they, is hee the Lamb of God, does hee take away the ſins of the world, wee will follow him then. <hi>John</hi> bade them look at him, and they followed after him, that is, they lookt at him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as a man looks at one whom hee follows: when a man ſo looks up to Chriſt, that hee follows him: when a man ſees him his onely meanes to bee happy, and godly, and in the favour of God, the onely meanes to doe well, and to bee well, and deſires indeed to follow after him, this is to look up to Chriſt, when a man labours ſincerely to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſell and direction of Chriſt, in all his wayes; Hee bids him to deny himſelf, and that is the thing that hee labours for; Hee bids him to repent of all his ſins, and to ply himſelf to all Gods holy paths, and to rely upon him for ſtrength and acceptance, and mercy and pardon, and every bleſſing. What-ever thing hee looks for at the hands of God, hee ſets himſelf to follow Chriſts counſell, and to expect it in him. If hee ſee his ſins, hee looks up to Chriſt, and there hee ſees his death to defray them; when hee ſees what power they have over him, hee looks up to Chriſt for his Spirit to ſubdue them, in the uſe of all thoſe meanes that hee hath appointed; Prayer, Meditation, Watchfulneſſe, Striving, Purpoſing, Endevouring, and Fighting againſt all the luſts of his fleſh. And wherein ſoever hee failes, hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to bee humbled, and yet to look ſtill up to Chriſt, for forgiveneſſe, and more help againſt another time: This is to ſee the Son of God. <hi>Every one that ſees the Son, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> Joh. 6. 40. This is to look up to Chriſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, to have Chriſt, to bee in Chriſt, <hi>to dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, I am afraid I never lookt up to Chriſt then, I never yet had him, for I have not his holy ſpirit, how ſhall I know whether I have the holy ſpirit? I Anſwer, firſt, I will tell thee, what bee not ſignes; and then ſecondly, what bee ſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42059:54"/>Firſt, What bee not ſignes, there are foure ſignes that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take to bee ſignes, and are not: Firſt, a civill Life, when a man is a mercifull man, kind to the poore, quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among his Neighbours, gentle, affable, courteous, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditioned; Theſe are no ſignes of having Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: True, they are very commendable, and they that have the Spirit of God, muſt have them, and better than them. But a man may bee without the holy Spirit of God, and yet have all theſe; <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews that the very Barbarians ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him no little kindneſſe, <hi>they kindled him a fire,</hi> though they were meer naturall men, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 2. Our Saviour Chriſt ſhews that ſome are chaſte by nature, that are born ſo; ſo, many are temperate by nature, and loving by nature, and meek by nature, patient by nature; therefore, theſe are no ſupernaturall graces, theſe are no ſignes of the holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the profeſſion of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is no ſigne of the Holy Spirit neither for many profeſſe they know God, and yee are reprobate to every good work. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. that is, many profeſſe Religion, they will heare the Word, they will have prayers in their families, they will be of the better ſide in their Pariſh where they are, if there be any godly ones, they will be of their Company, if they can, and ſeeme to to doe as they doe, and yet they have a carnall heart, they doe very good workes every day, but they have a Reprobate and unapproved heart in them. They doe not doe them right.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Every kinde of repentance is not a ſigne neither, we read that <hi>Pharaoh Confeſſed, his ſin, and deſired the prayers of Gods people.</hi> Exod. 9. 27. <hi>Saul wept for his ſinnes.</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 16. <hi>Judas</hi> made reſtitution: <hi>Eſau</hi> bought repentance with teares. The world think certainly theſe were times of Gods Spirit; no, no: They were onely Common effects of the ſpirit. The wicked may in a ſort repent of their ſinnes and beat them downe too, but the truths is, they doe not mortifie them. Like as if a man ſhould come into a garden, and ſee how a mole hath caſt up the earth, and made a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42059:55"/>
fowle ſtirre in the Alleyes, and in the Garden knots, if hee tread it onely downe with his foote, and doe not kill the Mole, anon after it will be as bad as before, ſo many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men may doe, they may beat downe their ſinnes every day, but they riſe up ſtill as bad as before; now they beat them downe, and ſo their luſts like the Mole caſt up againe. Thus the Mole is not killed. This is no ſigne of the Spirit. But a godly heart, he kils the Mole, he mortifies his ſin, indeed new Moles may breed, and caſt up again; but he riddes his ſoule more and more.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Every kind of faith neither, is not a ſigne of Gods holy Spirit, yee know the ſtony ground Believed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Now, for thoſe ſignes that be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, When a man is ſoundly convinced of his sinnes; This is an act of Gods holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. When a man hath the unction from the Holy one, The Text ſayes, <hi>that abides for ever, where it is, The anointing which yee have received of him abideth in you.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When a man hath had a ſound prick for his ſins, this lets in the Holy Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Peter</hi> told his hearers, <hi>That were prickt in their hearts.</hi> Act. 2. 37. <hi>he told them they ſhould receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, When a man hath had an unſatisfiable deſire of reconciliation with God, as it is ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> that when hee was rightly toucht by the ſpirit indeed, <hi>hee could neither eat nor drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Act. 9. 9. hee could not be quiet, till <hi>Ananias</hi> came and told him hee was reconciled with God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When a man is another, and a new creature, <hi>Whoſoever is in Chriſt is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. the Spirit of God, where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ere Hee is, Hee is a new ſpirit, and Hee carries with him a new heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. Hee works a thorow change, and hee renews minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will, and affections, inclinations, memory, appetite, members and all: Hee does not onely new-plaſter them over, but hee pulls a man quite down, and builds him up a new habitation of God, as Chriſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42059:55"/>
told the <hi>Centurion, if I come, I will heale thy ſervant,</hi> ſo, if Chriſt doe once come with his ſpirit into any mans heart, hee heales it, hee works a mighty mutation in that man into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man, as <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Corinthians, Yee were drunkards, but now yee are waſhed, yee were railers, yee were adulterers, yee were covetous, yee were unrighteous, But now yee are waſhed,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I was a blaſphemer, and I was a perſecuter, but bleſſed bee God, now I have obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Now I am not the man that I was; I was a lyer, but now, bleſſed bee God, I have the lip of Truth; I hated them that were godly, but bleſſed bee God, now they are the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt people to mee in the world.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when a man does ſupernaturall good things; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall good things, a naturall man may doe, without the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit of grace: when you ſee a man liſt up a hundred, or two hundred pound weight, you will ſay. I, this hee may do by nature; But if you ſhould ſee a man lift up five thouſand pound weight, you will ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is more then nature in him: ſo, beloved, when you ſee a man loves ſin and comes to bee vaine, and cannot abide to bee ſtrict; if hee bee ſtrict a little, hee is ſoon weary of it, and layes it aſide; you may know this man hath not the ſpirit of God in him, but if yee ſee you love holineſſe, and hate every evill thing, that nothing hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you ſo much as ſin, nothing takes you up ſo much as how to pleaſe God; now yee may know the ſpirit of God is in you, Why? This is above Nature. This then is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Hath Chriſt the ſeven Spirits of God, to give them to all that will come unto him? then what may Chriſt ſay to them that are contented without him, that have no care at all to come at him, that like not his government, that will not draw water at his Well? Hee hath taken paines to procure a ſtock of grace for them, to provide Merits enough for them, a ſalve broad enough for all their ſores, ſpirit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to powre into all their hearts; and when hee hath done
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42059:56"/>
all this, they regard other things more than him. Truely, he may ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, when he was told of <hi>Nabals</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh anſwer, <hi>Surely, in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath, in the Wilderneſſe.</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 21, Even ſo may Chriſt ſay: ſurely, in vain have I ſuffered for theſe men; in vaine have I come out of my Fathers boſome for them; in vain did I die upon the croſſe: They will have none of my ware, they reſpect not my graces, they will not come at mee for my holy Spirit, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THeſe words contain the Deſcription of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom this Epiſtle is ſent unto the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> and in particular to the Miniſter there, who is here called the Angell of the Church in that place.

               <p>Firſt, That hee hath the ſeven Spirits of God, that is, he hath the Holy Ghoſt, and all his ſpirituall graces in his hands, to give to whomſoever hee pleaſes, for the quickning of them, and the ſanctifying of them, that if any of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers want ſpirit, or any ſpirituall good, hee hath it for them: <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee that hath the ſeven Spirits of God:</hi> This wee handled the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Now wee proceed to the ſecond Royalty of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>That hee hath the ſeven Starres,</hi> hee ſpeaks of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Chriſt hath all their Miniſters in

his hands, and hee calls them ſtarres.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the ſtarres doe direct: Its a great help when Mariners can ſee a ſtarre in a dark night.

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe the ſtarres doe ſhine, ſo good Miniſters doe ſhine forth, and hold out a light, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. <hi>Yee are the light of the world,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 14. when a man ſits in a dark houſe, hee cannot ſee to doe any thing, but if one come and open a window, or a caſement, and letteth in light, now hee may ſee to goe about his buſineſſe: ſo, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, people that dwell in dark Pariſhes, where no ſound Miniſtery of the Word is, they know not what to doe to bee ſaved: they erre, they wander, they grope, they ſtumble and fall, they ſee not how to bee godly, and happy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. But when a faithfull Miniſter comes, now light is let in, and thoſe that have a minde to goe to Heaven, now they may ſee the way thither, ſo that in this ſenſe too, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſtarres.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe ſtarres have influence upon theſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours bodies, as God ſayes of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> and <hi>Orion,</hi> which are a company of ſtarres in the heavenly Orbe. <hi>Canſt thou binde the ſweet influences of the Pleiades, or looſe the bands of Orion?</hi> Job 38. 31. the ſtarres have influences into things here
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42059:57"/>
below. The <hi>Pleiades</hi> open the earth, they make herbes and flowres grow, the ſpring is when they ariſe once, Trees begin to ſprout, and the plants do waxe green; <hi>Orion,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces cold, the Winter comes when that ſhews it ſelf; the ſtarres have a great influence into ſublunary bodies, ſo it is with Miniſters. Bad Miniſters are like the ſtarres of <hi>Orion,</hi> they ſerve to coole peoples hearts, and dead them to all goodneſſe. But good Miniſters are as the ſtarres of <hi>Pleiades,</hi> no ſoule can have any minde in him to that which is good, but they doe exceedingly help and further, they quicken the heart, they warme and fructiſie the ſoules of Gods Elect.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Starres doe hang high, ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt are ſet high; they hang high, that all the people may have the benefit of their gliſtering. <hi>Zachany</hi> calls them the Prophets of the moſt High, <hi>And thou childe, ſhalt bee called the Prophet of the moſt High,</hi> Luk. 1. 76. But I have handled this Point in effect, when I ſpake of Miniſters being Angels, and therefore I will omit it now. Thus yee ſee the Miniſters are ſtarres. Now hee calls them ſeven, becauſe hee ſpeaks of ſeven Congregations, <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira, Sardis, Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Seven Churches, ſeven Congregations, and every one had their ſeverall ſtars. Whence wee ſee that every Pariſh ſhould have a particular faithfull Miniſter. <hi>Paul</hi> appointed <hi>Titus, to ordain Elders in every City,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. <hi>The Apoſtles ordained Paſtours, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every Church,</hi> Act. 14. 23. So it was in the time of the Law, as the Text ſayes, <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every City them that Preach, being read in the Synagogues every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> Act. 15. 21.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, firſt, becauſe thoſe Towns that have not a faithfull Miniſtery in it, generally doe all periſh. I doe not deny, but ſome ſoules in ſuch blinde places may come other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to bee converted and ſaved, but generally they periſh for ever, that live in ſuch places: as the Evangeliſt ſayes of <hi>Galile.</hi> True, they had ſorry Prieſts, but they had not a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42059:57"/>
faithfull Miniſtery. ſayes hee, <hi>The people ſate there in the region and ſhadow of death,</hi> Matth. 4. 16. that is, till they had a better Miniſtery, they were in a damnable eſtate. So that it is a pitifull thing, when any Town or Pariſh are without a faithfull Miniſtery, no ſtarre of Heaven ſhining among them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe when people have no faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their own, generally they care not for removing of their dwelling, neither will they goe a mile or two for the meanes, they content themſelves with what fare they have at home, though it ſtarve them to death: Like the people under the falſe Prophets, they liked them well enough. <hi>My people love to have it ſo,</hi> Jer. 5. 31. Nay, they love ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets better than them that would deale plainly with them; Nay, there bee many, that when they have a faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at home, will bee ſneaking out, to a drunken Miniſter abroad, they would rather live under ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon why every Church ſhould have its particular Starre; every congregation had need of a faithfull Miniſtery of their own: Becauſe, if there be any godly Soule, or any one that deſires the ſalvation of his Soule, and lives under a blinde guide, hee cannot goe out, without giving very great offence, it will bee thought a gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, and a flighting of their own Miniſter at home; now if every Pariſh had a ſound Miniſtery in it, this would not bee: When people came out of every Pariſh round about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>John,</hi> they had no Paſtour of their own, but they came flocking unto <hi>John,</hi> no queſtion but this bred heart-burning againſt <hi>John:</hi> I, and ill-will againſt thoſe people, that would not bee ſatisfied with what teaching they had in their own Synagogues. Now, I ſay, if every Pariſh had its ſeverall ſhining Starre, this would not bee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When ſome Pariſhes have their Starres and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have not. This caſts in a bone of diſcord between Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, for they that are idle, and vain, and ſcandalous, will
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42059:58"/>
envy them that ſpend themſelves in giving light. Again, the people of ſuch Pariſhes have many times occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing together, and falling into one anothers company. Now, how will this harden one anothers hearts, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall ſay, Gods bleſſing on our Miniſters heart, hee does not meddle or make with us, wee may doe what wee will for all him! who would dwell in ſuch a Pariſh as yours is? wee hear hee keeps a horrible ſtirre with you, hee will not let you alone, you cannot bee merry now and then, but you are ſure to heare of it: hee is ſo ſtrict forſooth, and ſo preciſe, you muſt have preaching, forenoon and afternoon, and there is ſuch adoe to get preciſe Conſtables, that you cannot bee quiet. What a wofull thing is this? how does this harden the Countries hearts?</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is; firſt, this ſhews what a miſerable thing<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> it is, when a Land is darkened, that hath but a few ſtarres; May bee here one and there one, but moſt places are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and have none: Beloved, this is a ſign of the wrath of God. God is wroth with ſuch a Land, and powres his wrath upon ſuch a people, as the Prophet ſayes. <hi>Through the wrath of the Lord of Hoaſts, is the Land darkned,</hi> Eſa. 9. 19.</p>
               <p>Again, ſecondly, you that have your ſtars ſhining among<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> you, how are you to bleſſe God, when there are ſo many places in the world that have none! Suppoſe the Harveſt ſhould bee comming, and the earth hath great need of rain, to plump up the eares, the Corn is quite ſpoyled for want of rain: if it doe not rain; Alas! our Corn will bee burnt up, and prove little worth. Now if God ſhould rain upon your fields, and not upon your Neighbours: Your Cloſes, and Leizes have raine, but on the other ſide of the hedge there is none; What a ſpeciall mercy is this unto you? As God ſayes, I <hi>have cauſed it to rain upon one City, and cauſed it not to rain upon another, one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not, withered,</hi> Amos 4. 7. is not this a great
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42059:58"/>
mercy to the owner of that ground where the rain falls, and does not fall elſe-where? ſo, my Brethren, you that have the ſpirituall rain in your particular pariſhes, what a mercy of God is it unto you? when ſo many Pariſhes have not one drop of it.</p>
               <p>Again, thirdly, let us take heed leſt thoſe few ſtarres that<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> yet bee, ſet upon us, and ſo wee bee all in darkneſſe, wee have a little rain yet, here and there ſome. O let us repent and be more forward to bring forth more fruit, if wee continue to provoke God with our unfruitfulneſſe, as wee doe, that little ſhall be taken away from you. When Gods Vineyard in <hi>Judah</hi> became barren, and brought forth no grapes, but wild ones; What ſayes God? <hi>I will command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it,</hi> Eſa. 5. 6. <hi>q. d.</hi> I will take away all the rainy clouds: yee ſhall have clouds ſtill, but they ſhall be clouds without rain, ſtarres without light and heat, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that ſhall doe you no good, this is a fearfull caſe, and yet God will bring it upon us, for a certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if wee doe not take heed.</p>
               <p>There be ſix ſigns of all the ſtarres vaniſhing away, that God will take away thoſe few ſtarres, thoſe few godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters away, that are left.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when people will not walk in the light, while they have the light. As our Saviour Chriſt ſayes: <hi>Yet a little while is the light with you, walk while yee have the light, leſt darkneſſe come upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Joh. 12. 35. <hi>q. d.</hi> yee have the light; a little while the Lord lets you have it, hee lets it ſtay with you a little while longer, but if ye will not walk in the light, the light ſhall bee gone, and yee ſhall bee in darkneſſe, this is an evident ſigne that the light will ſurely away from us: what a deale of light is yet held before our faces, and ſcarce any have a heart to walk in it! When ſervants are idle, and will not mend their cloathes, in the day time at ſpare houres, why ſhould the Maſter allow them any candle? ſo, we have a day among us, and people will not beſtirre themſelves,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42059:59"/>
they goe all rent and tottered in their garments, they care not for doing of their buſineſſe, therefore, the Lord will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them no candle, he will put out all the lights.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when people grow deader and deader, when they forſake their firſt love, they were once more earneſt for heaven, more tender in Conſcience, more eager for good things, more lively in Prayer, more zealous in holy duties, but now they abate, and ſlacken, they are told of it, and yet they doe not amend, when it is once come to this paſſe, the Lord will remove the faithfull Miniſtery of his Word. To what end ſhould he let it ſtay any longer? as Chriſt ſayes to <hi>Hpheſus, Remember from whence thou art falne, and repent, and doe the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candle-ſtick out of its place, except thou repent,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. this is another ſigne of the Miniſteries departing away from us, Candle and candle-ſtick will away, for wee will not amend. Wee have been told of our formality, we have heard whole Sermons againſt our luke warmneſſe, and againſt our declinings, and yet nothing wil fetch us up again. Wee will not think ſoundly from whence wee are falne, we will not bee perſwaded to doe our firſt works, our hearts are grown ſenſeleſſe, and nothing can pluck them up, therefore how can wee hope but our candleſtick will bee removed, and quickly too.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when people wax weary of Gods Ordinances, they are even cloyed with them, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> there in <hi>Amos, when will the New Moon bee gone that wee may fell corn? when will the Sabbath bee over, that wee may ſet forth Wheat?</hi> Amos 8. 5. <hi>q. d.</hi> here is ſuch adoe with Lectures, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, wee can hardly have time for our Markets: ſuch adoe with the Sabbath, it is ſo tedious, ſo irkſome, wee are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold out, Prayers in the Family come ſo faſt about, and duties come ſo thick, wee have hardly any ſpace for our other buſineſſes. Miniſters require ſo much of us, Sermons are ſo ſtrict, Sacrifices are ſo often, we can have no breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42059:59"/>
thus people are cloyed, they are full fed, they care not much if they had leſſe, nay, ſome will not ſtick to ſay it, and others that in their hypocriſie will not ſay it, yet they have no ſtomack, no appetite, there is ſo much Word, that they are not able to digeſt it, neither have they any minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct it; therefore mark there what follows. <hi>Behold! the daies come,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord,</hi> ver. 11. that is, you are more afraid of a famine of bread, yee would bee more troubled if you had no Bread to eate, nor liquour to drink, you care not ſo it bee not that famine. But think what you will, I will ſend you a worſe famine than that, a famine of hearing of Gods Word. Yee ſhall have Preaching little enough. Little enough food for your ſoules, ſeeing yee will bee filthy, yee ſhall be filthy; ſeeing ye will be heartleſſe towards heavenly things, ye ſhall bee heartleſſe; yee ſhall be hardned, yee ſhall be let alone; and the blinde ſhall lead the blinde, and both ſhall fall into the ditch; the wicked ſhall lead the wicked, wicked Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the wicked people, and both ſhall periſh together: and then though yee would never ſo fain have a Sermon that may come to the Conſcience, yee ſhall be long enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee ſhall hear it: Yee ſhall ſtarve for want of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all knowledge: ſtarved to death for want of life: Seared in your ſins; yee ſhall have no Sermons to diſpoſſeſſe you of Satan, no teaching to purge your hearts, to humble your ſoules before God, or to miniſter the Spirit unto you, yee are weary of the ſound Miniſtery of the Word, therefore ye ſhall not bee troubled with it. This then is another ſign that God will take away thoſe few Stars that are yet remaining. And then woe bee to you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when there are hardly any ſonnes of peace, that the Miniſters peace may light upon, then the Lord bids them pack away: Like the Market folkes, when they ſee their Commodities lie upon their hands, they take up their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42059:60"/>
Commodities lie upon their hands, they take up their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and goe home. O ſay they, people will give nothing, they will not give our price, wee and our children will have them for our own ſelves, rather then wee will part with them for nothing. So they goe away, ſo, Gods Miniſters goe away, when the Market is dead, no Cuſtomer will come to their ſtalls. So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> went away from the Jews, <hi>Yee put off the word from you, and therefore, lo, wee turn unto the Gentiles,</hi> Act. 13. 46. <hi>q. d.</hi> yee will have none of it, wee have offered it to you, and we were bid to doe ſo, but ye put it off from you, therefore fare yee well. Die in your ſins. So people now put off the word of God, our Doctrine ſinks no where almoſt; one puts it off from him, another puts it off from him: Like as the Cities of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> did with the Ark. <hi>The men of Ekron, they cryed out, and doe you bring it to us? and ſo the men of Aſhdod, ſaid, and it ſhall not abide with us.</hi> 1 Sam. 5. 7. Every one put it off, they would have none of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when people oppoſe, they are ſo farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting at the preaching of the Word, that they fall to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to miſ-uſe the bringers of it, as the Jews did Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> The Text ſayes, <hi>Hee ſhook his rayment at them, and told them, your blood bee upon your own heads,</hi> and away hee went, Act. 18. 6. when people lay their heads together, how they may heave out the Miniſter, many times God gives them leave for to doe it, that they may bring evill on their own heads, the Lord lets them have their curſed wills, to their own utter deſtruction and condemnation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, when God hath ſent all his Miniſters that ever hee means to ſend: Hee ſent one Miniſter, and they would not hear him, hee ſent another after him, and they would not hearken to him neither, a man would wonder, ſurely God will ſend no more, well, may be God in his great goodneſſe ſends another good man, and he does what he can, but the people will doe wickedly ſtill. Yea, but when God hath ſent all that Hee means to ſend, now he will ſend no more;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42059:60"/>
as God did with <hi>Judah. I have ſent unto you all my ſervants the Prophets, riſing up early and ſending them, ſaying, return from your evill wayes, but yee have not inclined your eare unto me,</hi> Jer. 35. 15. when God had ſent all, then hee would ſend no more.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, how can this bee a ſigne? when God hath ſent all that he means to ſend: who can tell that?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Beloved, God may ſhew it plainly, that God hath ſent even all that he means to ſend; when he blocks up the way, that more cannot bee ſuffered to come to us, then thoſe that are come, when ſuch courſes are laid, that ne're a faithfull one more is permitted to enter; when Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones are forbidden to Preach, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>They forbid us to Preach.</hi> When people will have <hi>Paſhur's,</hi> and not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah's:</hi> When there be Laws made, <hi>Look yee ſpeak no more in his name:</hi> When they ſay to the Seers, ſee not, and to the Prophets propheſie it. When the good Levites are made to goe away, and to leave their own places, as it was in <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 14. Again, when the ſhadows wax long, it is a ſigne that the Sun is going down.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why God will take away all his Starres, when matters are come to this paſſe, is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is but loſt labour, and Coſt caſt away, to adminiſter phiſick to ſuch patients whoſe diſeaſes are deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: my Brethren, God is a wiſe phiſician, and he knows whom hee hath to deale with: when hee ſees men rend in pieces his Preſcripts, and pull off his plaiſters, and vomit up his wholeſome potions, that he gives them for their good; he gives them up for gone, hee will bee their Phyſician no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This was the reaſon why God did leave <hi>Judah, Thy diſeaſe is incurable,</hi> Jer. 30. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is not only loſt labour, but it is worſe then loſt, to let ſuch people have the Miniſtery of the word: it makes them much worſe. <hi>Why ſhould yee bee ſmitten any more? yee will revolt more and more,</hi> Eſa. 1. 5. why ſhould
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42059:61"/>
yee bee preacht to any more? yee will, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe if men will needs goe on in their ſins, God would rather they ſhould doe ſo without his word, then with it: as a husbandman, if the ground bee ſtark barren, he would rather never plough it, and ſow it with ſeed, then to have it barren after the ſeed ſown; when people will needs bee wicked, God would rather have them doe all their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe out of his ſight, then in it, <hi>I will caſt you out of my ſight,</hi> Jer. 7. 15. God cannot abide to look upon a people, that will have their own wayes; they anger him more, when they commit all their wickedneſſe under his Word; God looks towards a people when hee ſends them his holy Word, hee looks upon them to doe them good, hee looks towards them in pity, and calls them to repentance, that they may finde favour with him, and therefore, if they doe evill now, this provokes him more a thouſand times. A drunkard where the word is truely preached, an adulterer there, a muck-worm there, a proud perſon there, a profane wretch there; I ſay, this angers him more a thouſand thouſand times. <hi>The times of ignorance, God wincked at,</hi> Act. 17. 30. If your ſins were committed in blinde Pariſhes, God would winck at you, in a manner, that is, your damnation ſhould bee leſſe. God would excuſe you himſelf, in ſome meaſure. Alas! poore creatures, they know not what they doe; let them have leſſe hell, they do not deſerve ſo many plagues; he wincks at the wicked that live without his Word: But you that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word, he cannot winck at you. Hee will puniſh you to the full. O! Beloved, above all things, the Lord cannot abide that people ſhould bee wretched and vain under his Word: But I will paſſe over this point. Thus yee ſee they are ſeven Starres, every Congregation had its Starre, every Church had its Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place, we ſee here that Chriſt hath theſe ſeven Starres. <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres.</hi> Chriſt hath the ſeven ſtarres.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42059:61"/>
Chriſt is ſaid to have the ſeven ſtarres, in five reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect that they have their miſſion from him, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in reſpect they have their Commiſſion from him, thirdly, in reſpect they have their abilities from him, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect they have their ſucceſſe from him, fiftly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they have their Protection from him; of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they have their Miſſion from him. It is Chriſt that ſends forth all true Miniſters: <hi>As my Father hath ſent mee, ſo ſend I you,</hi> Joh. 20. 21. it is Chriſt that ſends Miniſters to the Church, as hee told <hi>Jeruſalem: Behold I ſend unto you Prophets, and Wiſemen, and Scribes,</hi> Matth. 23. 34. <hi>Hee called the twelve, and began to ſend them forth by two and two, &amp;c.</hi> Mark. 6. 5. <hi>So hee called the ſeventy and ſent them alſo,</hi> Luk. 10. 1. ſo it is Chriſt that ſends Miniſters to this day. True, the Church does ordain them; I, but if they be not ſent by him too, they are intruders. Now when hee ſends them, they are his Miniſters, though it bee the Church that puts them into Orders. As it is with a true Conſtable, though the Pariſh chooſe him, yet hee is the Kings Officer, and does things in the Kings name; ſo it is with every true Miniſter, Chriſt hath the ſending of him, he is the Miniſter of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as the Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. and therefore look what wee doe in our Office, wee doe it in his name. As hee ſaid, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>riſe up and walk.</hi> So we ſay unto Gods Elect, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, riſe up and walke. In the name of Jeſus Chriſt Repent of all your wicked wayes, and Beleeve, and though the world will not ſtirre at our ſpeech, yet they that are elected of God doe ſtirre: they are none but the Reprobate, that lie ſtill in their ſinnes, ſometime or other wee get all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Elect for to heare us.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is; firſt, for comfort to us that are true Miniſters, Chriſt hath the ſending of us, therefore certainly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42059:62"/>
hee will bee with us in all his errands, the world may bee againſt us, we may meet with many wolves: <hi>Behold! I ſend you as ſheep among Wolves;</hi> people may threaten and ſpeak their words againſt us, a foot and a half long; what need wee care for all their great ſpeeches, as long as Chriſt ſends us? Chriſt will bee with us for the good of his Elect, in all the courſe of our Miniſtery, be it ſhort, or be it long: Wee ſhall bee uſefull to them what ever the world doe: if there be any that belong to God, wee ſhall finde them out, no matter for others. Chriſt will bee with us in the Pulpit, in the priſon, in the dog-hole, if yee would put us into it, as Chriſt told his Miniſters, <hi>Goe and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, and lo I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28. 19, 20. this is our comfort that Chriſt will bee with us, and this is the Elects comfort, they ſhall bee ſure to finde him with us in our Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if Chriſt hath the ſending of us, wee muſt bee<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> ſure wee doe his meſſage, that we perform the work he ſends us to doe, every meſſenger ſhould doe thus, nay, Chriſt himſelf did thus. <hi>I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath ſent mee;</hi> Joh. 5. 30. If a Merchant ſhould ſend a ſervant beyond Sea, to bee a Factor for him, if that ſervant ſhould goe and trade for himſelf, to get monies for himſelf, and an eſtate for himſelf, and neglect his Maſters buſineſſe; hee may look for a cold welcome home: ſo when Chriſt ſends us to bee Factors for him, to ſee what Soules wee can gain unto him; if wee ſhould now ſeek our ſelves, how to be rich, how to bee ſome-body in the world, how to get preferment, and ſo leave his buſineſſe undone; wee may look for a cold welcome home, when wee ſhall bee brought before God. Certainly, if Chriſt ſends us, we ſhould minde his work, glorifie Chriſt, labour to reveale Chriſt, to win Soules to Chriſt; this is our buſineſſe to doe. When <hi>David</hi> ſent <hi>Huſhai</hi> to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> to bee a factor for him, wee ſee how
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42059:62"/>
well hee did the meſſage, hee turned the counſell of <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> into fooliſhneſſe, hee marred all that wicked wretches plots, he did all for <hi>David:</hi> ſo we ſhould doe all for Chriſt, wee ſhould labour to turn the devils plots into fooliſhneſſe, to undermine Satan, and where God hath any to ſave, wee ſhall prevaile.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If Chriſt hath the ſending of us, wee muſt give<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> him account when wee have done. When Chriſt had ſent his Diſciples to preach, they returned again, and gave him account of what they had done, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Lord even the Devils are ſubject unto us.</hi> Lord I have done thus and thus, I have declared all thy whole counſell, I have kept nothing back: I have done thy meſſage, and ſuch and ſuch have heard mee, but ſuch and ſuch will not hear me. A meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is bound to give an account unto him that ſends him: nay, the devill himſelf returned to give an account: when the Lord ſent him to tempt <hi>Job,</hi> hee came again, and told what hee had done, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 1. when the children of <hi>Dan</hi> ſent ſpies to ſearch the land, they came and gave up their account. The very devill may teach us this leſſon, to goe and give Chriſt account of what wee have done. Wee ſee there how they that had received the Talents, how they came and gave in their accompt, Lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another Uſe is to you; what a great mercy is<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> this, that Chriſt ſhould ſend unto ſuch as you bee? If Chriſt had ſent unto you, when yee had ſought him and turned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, it had been very much, but that hee ſhould diſpatch meſſengers to you, when yee had not a thought of him; nay, when yee ſinned againſt him, O what a great mercy is this! It was a great kindneſſe, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> would ſend unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Brethren, and bid them leave all, and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and willed them that they ſhould not care for their ſtuffe, for the beſt of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall bee yours, yee know his brethren were unkinde unto him. Beloved, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was never ſo unkindly dealt with by his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42059:63"/>
Brethren, as Chriſt hath been by us, and yet that he ſhould ſend to ſuch wretches as wee are: O leave all, and come unto me, regard not your ſtuffe, regard not your profits, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble your ſelves with this thing and that thing, for all the beſt of heaven ſhall be yours; O what an infinit kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this! when hee will ſend ſuch treaſures of his to us, by his Miniſters. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> filled his brethrens ſacks with corne, which they carryed to their fathers houſe, in <hi>Canaan,</hi> to preſerve them alive till they came over to <hi>Egypt;</hi> So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath put his ſpiritual treaſures into a ſack, and given them his Miniſters to diſpence them to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to nouriſh them, and preſerve them, untill they come home to him: hee fills his Miniſters ſacks every week for us, they come with ſack-fulls of heavenly and divine truths eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week to us, with ſack-fulls of food to feed our ſoules un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternall life, and when that is ſpent, hee ſends us every Sabbath more; and therefore how ſhould we eſteem a true Miniſter that comes to us from Jeſus Chriſt! He is one of a thouſand, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, if there be a meſſenger with him, an interpreter, one of a thouſand, to declare unto man his righteouſneſſe, then hee is gracious unto him, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 23, 24. that is, then is God gracious to us indeed, ſuch a one is one of a thouſand, ſuch a one declares to us our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he brings to us the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus. This the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſends unto us, when hee ſends us a true Miniſter, hee ſends us an excellent preſent, even his own righteouſneſſe and merits, and the glad tidings of peace, how we may live and be ſaved: So that we ſhould be thankfull unto God, that Chriſt ſends to us his Miniſters, with ſuch precious things. If the King ſhould ſend to any one of us but five pound, O how would we wonder at it, who ever were the meſſenger, we would bid ſuch a one welcome, and, what! does the King take notice of mee? ſuch a poore man as I? who would have thought that ever hee ſhould ſend ſuch a token to me? what a condeſcending is this! I tell thee, if
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42059:63"/>
thee, if the King ſhould do thus for thee, thou wouldeſt make very much of it, I, and talk of it too, where ever thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt; nay, it would make thee glad, and a very joyfull man, and it would make thee think thy ſelf highly preferred. O Beloved, and what a horrible ſhame is this, that the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, ſhould ſend a meſſenger to us every day almoſt, not with five pounds a-piece to every one of us, but with all the riches and treaſures of heaven, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich us for ever, to make us happy for ever, Bleſſed that ever wee were born, and yet that we ſhould not be affected hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! My Brethren, we that are the Miniſters of God, wee come with heavenly and glorious things, every day from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: though wee have them but in earthly veſſels, yet they are things that the whole world is but droſſe and dung in compariſon of, and therefore think how yee ſhould come to Church; think how ye ſhould come to hear Sermons: Now I come to hear a meſſage from Chriſt, now ſhall I hear an Embaſſadour from heaven, that will break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Chriſts Letter to me, a reproofe from Jeſus Chriſt, a counſell from Chriſt, Directions from Chriſt concerning the framing of my life, Leſſons from Chriſt, how I may come to glory. O, ſayes the Apoſtle, He hath given to us the Miniſtery of reconciliation with God: to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <hi>Now then wee are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, wee pray you in Chriſt his ſtead bee reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. 20. <hi>q. d.</hi> Ah yee poore creatures, God and you are out, yee are enemies of God, by your evill works, the wrath of God hangeth over you, wrath for all your ſinnes; wrath for your drunkenneſſe; wrath for your covetouſneſſe; wrath for all your carnall courſes; yee lye under the wrath of God, wrath that will damne you, and undoe you for ever. Now the Lord of Heaven and Earth hath ſent us as Heralds of Peace,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42059:64"/>
wee come Embaſſadors from the Lord of all glory, we have the word of reconciliation, the word that wee preach, will make God and you friends, if ye will beleeve it. O, wee pray you in Chriſt his ſtead conſider of it, and bee reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, heare our meſſage, imbrace our Embaſſage: O doe not ſlight what wee ſay to you, we ſpeak to you from Chriſt, doe not receive it as a word onely from our mouthes, but as indeed it is, the Word of the great God. This is the onely Word that can make God and you friends, O how highly does it concern you to ſubmit hereunto!</p>
               <p>How will this judge the world, that the Miniſtery of the Word, is no more regarded or heeded! When God ſends his Miniſters unto people, and becauſe forſooth, their fleſh and blood does not like it; they look little after it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this containes eternall life, and if ye reject this, ye reject eternall life. I beſeech you judge what I ſay: Doe you meet with a reproofe, that croſſes your corrupt luſts? I pray you reaſon the caſe thus with your own Soules, O let me not put off this reproofe, it reproves me of my drunken doings, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves me of my ſecurity, it reproves me of my ſins: if I put it off, I put off the word of reconciliation: This is one of thoſe truths, that comes to reconcile me to God: I ſtand out in rebellion, and deſiance againſt God, if I doe not take it home. So of any other paſſage of the Word. Still when the Prophets would ſpeak unto the people, this was their voyce, <hi>The Lord ſent mee:</hi> ſo ſayes <hi>Iſaiah, the Lord ſent mee;</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> too, <hi>the Lord ſent mee.</hi> When they refuſed to hear what he ſaid: O, ſayes hee! <hi>Surely the Lord ſent mee to ſpeak thus unto you.</hi> One would think it were enough to ſtrike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough into the hearts of men, to put off any Sermon, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, any exhortation, of Chriſts Miniſters, when they know the Lord ſends them. May bee, the Miniſter is as poore a creature as one of you; O, but remember who ſends him, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>hee that heareth you, heareth mee, and hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth mee, and hee that refuſeth mee, refuſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luk. 10. 16.</p>

               <p>I Have begun to handle this Epiſtle, wherin I noted foure things:</p>

               <p>Secondly, The Subſcription, declaring from whom it is ſent: <hi>Theſe things, ſaith he that, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Subſtance, or ſubject matter of the Epiſtle: <hi>I know thy works, &amp;c. Uſque ad, ver.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Concluſion, <hi>He that over-commeth, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
               <p>I have already Analyſed all this whole Epiſtle, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſed upon every part of it, and ſhewed you the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and the ſcope of it; and have made ſome entrance upon it; namely, to reprove their deadneſſe and coldneſſe in Religion, and to quicken them up unto life, leſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God fall upon them. I have diſpatcht the Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>And to the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write:</hi> and ſo I paſſe on to the ſecond: Namely, the Subſcription, <hi>Theſe things ſaith, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words, as ye heard, contain a deſcription of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom this Epiſtle is ſent. The Deſcription is not a whole and an entire deſcription of him, but only accommodated to the buſineſſe in hand. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it deſcribes him onely from two admirable Royalties that are in him. The firſt is this, <hi>That he hath the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God,</hi> that is, he hath the Holy and quickning Spirit, to give him to whomſoever he pleaſe, <hi>q. d.</hi> if ye would be quickned, hearken unto me, come unto me, I have all the graces of the Spirit to quicken you withall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42059:65"/>Secondly, <hi>That he hath the ſeven Starres,</hi> that is, as I told you, he hath all the Miniſters of the Church in his hand, and at his diſpoſe, <hi>Theſe things, ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God, and the ſeven Starres,</hi> That is, Chriſt hath all the Starres, all the Miniſters of the Church, they are all in his hand. I told you, he is ſaid to have them in five reſpects: 1. They have their Miſſion from him. 2. They have their Commiſſion from him. 3. They have their Abilities from him. 4. They have the ſucceſſe of their labours from him. 5. They have their protection from him, he opens their mouths as long as he liſts, and ſhuts them, when hee ſeeth fit ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken of the firſt; The Miniſters of Chriſt have their Miſſion from Chriſt, he hath the ſending of them, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> Joh. 20. 21. it is Chriſt that ſends Miniſters to the Church, as he told <hi>Jeruſalem, Behold! I ſend unto you Prophets, and Wiſemen, and Scribes,</hi> Matth. 23. 34. <hi>He called the twelve, and began to ſend them forth by two and two,</hi> Mark. 6. 7. <hi>So he called the ſeventy and ſent them alſo,</hi> Luk. 10. 1. ſo, it is Chriſt that ſends all true Miniſters, to this day. True, the Church does Ordain them, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if they be not ſent by him too, they are intruders. Now when he ſends them, they are his Miniſters, though the Church put them into Orders. As it is with a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, though the Pariſh chooſe him, yet he is the Kings Officer, and does things in the Kings name. So it is with every true Miniſter, Chriſt hath the ſending of him. He is the Miniſter of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Let a man ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. And therefore look what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we do in our Office, we doe it in his name. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>In the name of Jeſus Chriſt, riſe up and walk.</hi> So we ſay unto Gods Elect, riſe up and walk, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt repent of all thy wicked wayes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and though the world will not ſtirre at our ſpeech, yet they that are elected of God doe ſtirre, they are none but the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42059:65"/>
reprobate that lye ſtill in their ſins. Sometime or other we get home all the Elect, they hear us, they obey us, they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our Doctrine, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is; firſt, for comfort of the poore Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> of Chriſt, may be we meet with many wolves in the delivery of his errands. We meet with ſowre faces, and wry lookes, ſuſpenſions, oppoſitions, and ſuch like wolviſh dealings, for doing of our meſſage; what need we care for all theſe, as long as Chriſt ſends us. Certainly, if he ſend us, he will be with us, as God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I ſend thee, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I will be with thee,</hi> Exod. 3. 12. he will be with us for the good of his choſen, in all the courſe of our Miniſtery, be it ſhort, or be it long. We ſhall be uſefull unto them, though the reprobate world will not obey any of our words. Chriſt will be with us in the Pulpit, in the priſon, in a dog-hole, if the wicked put us in it, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Goe and teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and loe I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28. 19, 20. This is our comfort, Chriſt will be with us, and this is the Elects comfort, they ſhall be ſure to finde him with us in our Miniſtery: if we be in the Pulpit, there they ſhall hear us teaching of them; if in the priſon, there they ſhall have us ſealing of the truth to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if Chriſt hath the ſending of us, wee muſt be<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> ſure to doe his meſſage, that we performe the work he ſends us to doe. Every meſſenger ſhould doe thus. <hi>I ſeek not mine own will, ſaith Chriſt, but the will of the Father which hath ſent mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Joh. 5. 30. if a Merchant ſhould ſend a ſervant beyond the Seas, to be a Factor for him, if that ſervant ſhould goe and trade for himſelf, to get money for himſelf, and an eſtate for himſelfe, and neglect his Maſters buſineſſe, he may look for a cold welcome home: So when Chriſt ſends us to bee Factors for him, to ſee what Soules wee can gain unto him, if we ſhould now ſeek our ſelves, how to be rich, how to be ſome-body in the world, how to get preferment, and ſo leave his buſineſſe undone; wee may look for a cold welcome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42059:66"/>
home. Certainly, if Chriſt ſends us, we ſhould minde his work, we ſhould glorifie Chriſt, labour to reveale Chriſt, to win Soules to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is our buſineſſe to doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If Chriſt hath the ſending of us, wee muſt give<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> him account when wee have done. When Chriſt had ſent his Diſciples to preach, they returned again, and gave him account of what they had done, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Lord even the Devils are ſubject unto us.</hi> Lord I have done thus and thus, I have declared all thy whole counsell, I have kept nothing back: I have done thy meſſage, and ſuch and ſuch have heard mee, but ſuch and ſuch will not hear me. A meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is bound to give an account unto him that ſends him: nay, the devill himſelf returned to give an account: when the Lord ſent him to tempt <hi>Job,</hi> hee came again, and told what hee had done, <hi>Job<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2. 1. So wee ſhould come again, and tell God what wee have done. When the children of <hi>Dan</hi> ſent ſpies to ſearch the land, they came and related what they had done, ſo ſhould we doe. Lord, behold, here am I, and here are the people that I have begotten by thy Word, and here are the rebells that I could never get to reforme their wicked wayes. Wee ſee how they that had received the Talents, how they came and gave in their accompt, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. O what a caſe ſhall wee be in, if wee cannot give up a good account at the laſt day, of what wee have done in our places and callings!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If Chriſt ſend us unto you. O, Beloved, what<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> a great mercy is this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that Chriſt ſhould ſend unto ſuch as you bee? If Chriſt had ſent unto you, when yee had ſought him and turned unto him, it had been very much, but that hee ſhould diſpatch meſſengers unto you, when yee had not ſo much as a thought of him; nay, when yee ſinned againſt him, This was a mercy indeed! It was a great kindneſſe, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> would ſend unto his Father, and his Brethren, and bid them leave all, and come into the Land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> O, ſaith he, regard not your ſtuffe, for the beſt of the Land of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42059:66"/>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall bee yours, yee know his brethren were unkinde unto him. Beloved, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was never ſo unkindly dealt with by his Brethren, as Chriſt hath been by us, and yet that he ſhould ſend to ſuch wretches as wee are: O leave all, and come unto me, regard not your ſtuffe, regard not your profits, never trouble your ſelves with this thing and that thing, for all the beſt of heaven ſhall be yours; O what an infinit kindneſſe is this! when he will ſend ſuch treaſures of his to us, by his Miniſters. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> filled his brethrens ſacks with corne, which they carryed to their fathers houſe, in <hi>Canaan,</hi> to preſerve them alive till they came into <hi>Egypt;</hi> So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath put his ſpirituall treaſures, as it were, into a ſack, and given them his Miniſters to diſpence to their brethren, to nouriſh them, and preſerve them, untill they come home to him: hee fills his Miniſters ſacks every week for us, they come with ſack-fulls of heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths every week to us, with ſack-fulls of food to feed our ſoules unto eternall life, and when that is ſpent, he ſends us every Sabbath more; and therefore how ſhould wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem a true Miniſter that comes to us from Jeſus Chriſt! Hee is one of a thouſand, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, if there bee a meſſenger with him, an interpreter, one of a thouſand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto man his righteouſneſſe, then hee is gracious unto him, <hi>Joh</hi> 33. 23, 24. that is, then is God gracious to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. When God ſends us a meſſenger from him, ſuch a one is one of a thouſand, ſuch a one declares to us our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Yee know wee cannot ſtand before God without righteouſneſſe. Now ſuch a one declares to us righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He brings us the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. So that we ſhould be thankfull to Chriſt that he ſends us any of his true Miniſters. O my Brethren, we that are the Miniſters of God, wee come with heavenly and glorious things, every day from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Though wee have them but in earthen veſſels, yet they are things, that the whole world is but droſſe and dung to; and therefore think how
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42059:67"/>
yee ſhould come to Church; think how yee ſhould bee affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with our meſſage, think with what affections ye ſhould heare our Sermons: Now I come to heare a meſſage from Chriſt, a Letter from Chriſt, a Direction from Chriſt, a reproofe from Chriſt, counſells from Chriſt, for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of my life, now I ſhall be told, what I may doe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit glory. O, ſayes the Apoſtle, He hath given to us the Miniſtery of reconciliation with God: to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſesunto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <hi>Now then wee are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt his ſtead bee reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. 20. <hi>q. d.</hi> Ah yee poore creatures, God and you are out, yee are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, by your evill works, the wrath of God hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over you, wrath for all your ſinnes; wrath for all your drunkenneſſe; your covetouſneſſe; worldlineſſe; wrath for all your carnall courſes; your ſlighting of heaven and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, the wrath of God abideth on you. Now the Lord of Heaven and Earth hath ſent us as Heralds of Peace, we come as Embaſſadors from the Lord of all glory, we have the word of reconciliation, the word which we preach, will make God and you friends again, if yee will beleeve it, and imbrace it. We pray you in Chriſt his ſtead to conſider of it, bee reconciled unto God, heare our meſſage, doe not ſlight what wee ſay to you, we ſpeak to you from Chriſt, This is the onely Word that can make God and you friends.</p>
               <p>O how will this judge the world, that the Miniſtery of the Word, is no more regarded nor heeded! When God ſends his Miniſters unto people, and becauſe forſooth, their fleſh and blood does not like it; they look little after it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this containes eternall life, and if ye reject this, ye reject eternall life. I beſeech you judge what I ſay: Doe you meet with a reproofe that croſſes your corrupt Iuſts? I pray you reaſon the caſe thus with your own Soules, I am reproved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42059:67"/>
for my looſeneſſe, and my vain wayes, my faſhioning of my ſelf according to this world, my fawning, my flattering, my gaming, my ſcandalous courſes, my ſinning againſt light, I have had good education, I have lived under good meanes, but I am very graceleſſe, if I put off theſe reproofes, I put off the word of reconciliation: This is the word that comes to reconcile me to God, if I have faith to apply it, but if I put it from me, and doe not regard it, I refuſe all recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God. So, when the Word ſhewes you your duty, how to beleeve, how to live, how to walk, in all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true righteouſneſſe. Conſider, if yee put it from you, yee put away from you the onely word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are the truths that are ſent unto me, to reconcile me unto God: O, if I will have none of them, I caſt off the Son of God, and everlaſting life. Still when the Prophets would ſpeak unto the people, this was their preface, <hi>The Lord ſent mee:</hi> ſo ſayes <hi>Iſaiah, the Lord ſent mee,</hi> Eſa. 48. 16. ſo ſayes <hi>Jeremiah, the Lord ſent mee.</hi> When they refuſed to hear what he ſaid: O, ſayes hee! <hi>Truely the Lord ſent mee, of a truth the Lord hath ſent me unto you, to ſpeak all theſe words unto you.</hi> Jer. 26. 15. One would think it wore enough to ſtrike terrour into the hearts of men, to put off any Sermon, any rebuke, any exhortation of Chriſts Miniſters, when they know the Lord ſends them. <hi>Of a truth the Lord hath ſent mee to ſpeak all theſe words unto you.</hi> May bee, the Miniſter is as poore a creature in himſelf, as one of you; O, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who ſends him, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>hee that heareth you, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mee, and hee that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth mee, and hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth mee, deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luk. 10. 16. So much ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken of the firſt way, whereby Chriſt is ſaid to have the ſeven Starres, that is, the Miniſters of the Church, namely, he hath the ſending of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hee hath them,</hi> that is, hee hath the giving of them their Commiſſion, as they have their Miſſion from him, ſo they have their Commiſſion from him too. They are not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42059:68"/>
onely meſſengers but Embaſſadors. This Commiſſion hath two things; firſt, the heads of their Embaſſage, that Chriſt ſends them to treat of. Secondly, the authority of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, that Chriſt inveſts them with.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the heads of their commiſſion, Chriſt hath the appointing of them, what they ſhall treat of, and they are five. Firſt, they ſhall preach the Word. <hi>Goe and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark. 16. 15. Secondly, to remit the ſin of all them that doe embrace the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. that is, to pronounce all the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, and in particular, forgiveneſſe of ſins to all true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and beleeving Soules. Thirdly, to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the New Teſtament, to all the ſaid perſons, to whom the promiſes of eternall life doe belong, for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their hearts, concerning all the things of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to them in particular, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>To build up the Church of God, for the perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying of the body of Chriſt, untill they all come, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 12. Fifthly, to ſhut the Kingdome of Heaven upon all that have an evill heart of unbelief, to goe on in their ſins, and not to ſtoop to the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. and in divers other places. Theſe are the heads of their commiſſion, that Chriſt will have them treat of in their Embaſſage unto men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, now for the Authority that hee inveſts them with, it is not any carnall or earthly authority, to jet, and to vaunt, or to domineere, as though they were Lords, and Gods heritage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. no, ſayes Chriſt, it ſhall not be ſo with you. <hi>But hee that is greateſt among you, hee ſhall bee as the least,</hi> Luk. 22. 26. and therefore I doe not here ſpeak of any earthly authority: No, the Authority that Chriſts Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have, and they have it from him, is a ſpirituall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: uamely, not onely to preach, and to declare forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin, and to adminiſter the ſeales of the covenant, and to build up the Saints, and to denounce wrath and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42059:68"/>
to all that continue in their unregenerate eſtate through impenitence &amp; unbelief, but to do all theſe things with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power and Authority, to have an Office under Chriſt for the doing of them, ſo as to be the very mouth of Chriſt, and that which they doe according to their commiſſion from him, to ſtand firme and good, for ever and ever. <hi>I will give power to my two witneſſes.</hi> Rev. 11. 3. <hi>The Lord hath given me power and authority ſayes the Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 8. You will ſay this is great power indeed, all the Kings &amp; Potentates of the earth have not ſo great power as this, this is a power of life and death, not naturall, nor temporary, but Spirituall and eternall, this is a power not oven mens Bodies but over their ſoules, not in ſmall matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but either for ſalvation ordamnation. This is a great Commiſſion, how come they by ſuch a great one as this is? O ſayes Chriſt, I am able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them with as much as this comes to. <hi>For all power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> Matth. 28. 18. <hi>q. d.</hi> I am able to furniſh you with all authority and power, goe you in my name, and preach you in my name, in my name bid people repent and beleeve, in my name open heaven to all that doe obey, and ſhut it upon all that doe diſobey, and I will make it good.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is. Firſt, have the Miniſters of Chriſt ſuch<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> a Commiſſion from Chriſt? then they are the greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, that ever were, or can be. Embaſſadors of earthly Kings, have a great Commiſſion, they repreſent the Kings perſon from whom they come, Alas, what are they to theſe? they come about petty things, about civill peace, or warre and yet they are Lord Embaſſadors, they are Lords by their places, they are much reſpected among men. O then what great Embaſſadors are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, that repreſent the King of Kings perſon, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the perſon of the Lord of Lords, that came to Treat of peace betweene God and Man, or of open Hoſtility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Creator and the Creature? as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes now then
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42059:69"/>
wee are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, <hi>As though God did beſeech you by us, wee pray you in Chriſts ſtead be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 15. 20. that is, we have a very great commiſſion, we repreſent the perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we come to treat with you about eternity, according as you heare us, or heare us not, ſo it will be with you unto all eternity. O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we have to do, you are enemies unto God from the womb, as long as your ſins doe remain, ye are enemies ſtill, we come to ſet you at one again. Yee know the condition, yee know what the heads of our commiſſion bee, if yee will not hearken unto them, and ſubmit, yee are damned for ever; if ye doe, bleſſed and happy are yee for evermore, was there ever ſuch a great Embaſſage as this? as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>To make known the myſtery of the Goſpel, for which, I am an Embaſſadour in bonds,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 19, 20. <hi>q. d.</hi> though the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and blinde world, look upon me as a Schiſmatique, and a malefactour, and caſt me into the priſon, and here I am in bonds, they ſee no ſuch thing in me, as an Embaſſadour of the great God, yet the truth is, though I bee in bonds, they ſhall know it one day to their coſt, who I was, and what a commiſſion I had, and what it is to ſlight it, and put it off. I am an Embaſſadour of the myſtery of the Goſpel, though I be in bonds.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Have ſome Miniſters, ſuch a commiſſion from<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Chriſt? then let them learn how to behave themſelves in their function. My Brethren, Chriſt hath committed unto us the cuſtody of his own power, and authority, and therefore we are to exerciſe it in his name, our commiſſion is to charge the great men of the world, <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they bee not high-minded,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17. True, we are your ſervants for Jeſus his ſake, and wee are to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and to wait upon men of loweſt degree, and to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcend unto men of meaneſt capacity, and there is a time when wee ſhould for loves-ſake intreat, but the truth is too, wee have power to charge and command, <hi>Theſe things command</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42059:69"/>
                  <hi>and teach,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 11. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke withall authority.</hi> Tit. 2. 15. We muſt not betray the power and majeſticall ſimplicity of the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt. We have Chriſts owne power and authority in our miniſtery, and therefore wee are to command you in his ſtead: as ever you will anſwer Chriſt, before his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall at laſt day, neglect not thoſe things, which we preach to you from him. Now we command you, Brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that yee withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walkes diſorderly, and not after the Tradition which hee received of us. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6. True, we are inferiors to Kings, and Princes, and Magiſtrates, and the Nobility and Gentry of the land: There be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and thouſands that are our Betters, in all civill reſpects; but our Embaſſage is above all.</p>
               <p>The Lords own Power and Authority goes through the miniſtery, as a Trunk. As, the King may ſend a Command to the greateſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nobleman of the Kingdome by the hand of a meane man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he is to hearken to it: though the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in himſelfe be his underling, yet his meſſage is above him, and he looſes his head if he deſpiſe it. So, beloved, we are over you in the Lord, that is in regard of our meſſage. Though we be your inferiors, and ſome of you be our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and wee are to ſtand with Cap in hand to you; yet ye looſe your ſoules; if ye will not heare us, and obey our Embaſſage. We muſt not bow to your humors, nor make the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpell to bend and comply with human luſts. If Princes and Potentates were by, we muſt not ſpare their ſins. <hi>Nathan</hi> deales roundly with King <hi>David. Thou art the man. Jehu,</hi> with King <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> wrath is upon thee from the Lord, becauſe thou haſt helpt the ungodly. We muſt let all the world know that Chriſt whom wee preach, is above them all, wee muſt not proſtitute Chriſts Scepter, no not at a Monarchs foot. If we be men-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, we are not the ſervants of Chriſt. We muſt not ſuffer
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42059:70"/>
Chriſts word to be bound, whoſoeuer is our hearer, whether high or low. We defie popiſh Divinity that exalt their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtan Clergy, above the civill Magiſtrate. <hi>Belar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines Martin</hi> is but a foyſted ſtory. But yet in this ſenſe we are above all the Kingdomes of men, as God ſayes, <hi>Behold I have put my words in thy mouth, and loe I have ſet thee this day over Nations and Kingdomes, to plant and to root up, to build and to throw downe.</hi> Jer. 1. 9. 10. Let no man thinke we are ſaucy, though we reprove the greateſt of you all, as long as we doe it in Chriſt, and from Chriſt, we are the mouth of the Judge of quick and dead, and he will make our words good; The meaneſt Sergeant in the Kings name dares arreſt the greateſt Duke. So, my Brethren, we come in the Kings name, in Chriſt his name, and therefore we muſt not be afraid of your faces, As <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Philemon,</hi> I have great authority in Chriſt to command thee, that which is convenient. <hi>Philem.</hi> 8. We have great authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand every one of you, to doe your Duties towards God, and man. We have Chriſt for our Author, and therefore he will be a wall of Braſſe to us. We are his Embaſſadors, and therefore our Meſſage is with great power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Have we this Commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt?<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> then this may ſerve to condemne all ſuch as doe not obey our Miniſtery. Though wee have all this authority, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of Chriſt himſelf in our mouthes, that equally binds King and Begger; Yet who obeys our commands? who ſtirres? who repents? who ſubmits himſelf unto our commiſſion? we have called for humiliation, but no man will humble himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have cryed for reformation, and amendment of life, but no man relents; wee have read our commiſſion every week unto people, we ſhew them our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and they are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as idle tales by the moſt. O what an indignity is this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt! we are his Embaſſadors, and your ſtanding out againſt us, is not againſt us, but againſt him,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42059:70"/>
and he will repay it. O, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>if any man obey not our word, By this Epiſtle, note that man,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 14. <hi>q. d.</hi> note him with a brand of infamy, note him as a Rebell againſt Jeſus Chriſt, look upon him as a wretched miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, take heed of him, avoid him, withdraw your ſelf from him, point at him, yonder goes a wretch, that will not obey the voyce of his teacher, excommunicate him from your company, have as little to doe with him as you can. Be ye ſhie of ſuch a man, certainly there is great wrath hangeth over him. So, Beloved, if any obey not our word, note ſuch perſons, note ſuch pariſhes, note all ſuch families, the wrath of heaven hangeth over them, their ſtubbornneſſe, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart is not againſt us, but againſt the Lord. Theſe are notorious Townes, notorious people, that have Chriſts Embaſſadors among them, and yet will not be obedient, and yet how is our Embaſſage made nothing of! if Kings onely, and Princes, and Lords, and great men ſhould make nothing of it, we ſhould not ſo much wonder, becauſe they are greater men, then thoſe that God ſends his Embaſſage by, and yet if they were wiſe, and knew what they did, they durſt not doe as they do, but every baſe fellow ſtops his eare, and hardens his heart, againſt the God of Heaven and earth, and will not obey our word: nay, men can hear their ſins ripped up, and the Anathema's of Chriſt ſpread before their faces, and not bluſh. They can heare that thoſe very ſinnes they live in, doe ſeparate from God, do adjudge them to hell, and ſhew them to be under the blacknes of darkneſſe, and the ſentence of damnation, they can ſee it ſhowne them out of the word, which they cannot deny for their hearts, though they would never ſo faine, and yet they will not repent nor returne that they may have mercy. Not one drunkard will leave, nor one Mocker leave, nor one Covetous perſon, nor one graceleſſe wretch leave, they will have their owne wayes, doe the Miniſters of God what they can. We can get none to be awakened, none quickened, none ſtirred, none ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42059:71"/>
to any purpoſe. Setting aſide here one and there one that truely obeys the voyce of Gods ſervants, the whole countrey lying in ignorance of God, in the privation of his Spirit, unreconciledneſſe with heaven, voydneſſe of faith, emptineſſe of grace and life, the nakedneſſe of an outward profeſſion, having no true quickening within, nay the moſt in groſſe wickedneſſe, drunkeneſſe, company-keeping, unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſorder, uncleaneneſſe, laſciviouſneſſe, covetouſneſſe, mocking at the pure in heart, malicious alienation of ſpirit againſt the holy wayes of God. Nay ſince we have ſpoken to them in the name of the Lord, yet none will hearken to any effect that their ſoules may live.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, therefore, I pray you let me adde one uſe more;<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> doe but conſider, how the Lord taketh this at our hands, that his Miniſters are thus vilipended. They are in more danger of their liberty for reproving, then the wicked for committing of their ſins. Are his Miniſters, his Embaſſadors? then he will never endure that his Embaſſadors ſhall bee abuſed. When the King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> had abuſed <hi>Davids</hi> Embaſſadors, that he ſent him in love. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. Ye know what it coſt, it coſt above 40. thouſand mens lives. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſlue the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> for miſ-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Embaſſadors, and as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayes, our Anceſtors ſayes he, for this very thing deſtroyed all <hi>Corinth.</hi> For alas how could Princes deale with one another, if Embaſſadours ſhould not goe ſafe, and be hearkened unto? Therefore Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors muſt be regarded. When <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> tooke a ſhip full of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> though he meant to rifle all they had, yet when they ſaid they were Embaſſadors, he would not meddle with them. True, they were not, they did but counterfeit, that ſo they might eſcape. But yet you may ſee how inviolable Embaſſadors were, the leaſt indignity offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, was puniſht as if it had beene offered to the perſon of that Prince, that they did ſuſtaine. Well then, how doe we thinke will the Lord take it at peoples hands,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42059:71"/>
that his Embaſſadors are abuſed, and diſobeyed, that people will not diligently come to them, and acknowledge their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, and yeeld obedience to him, no Nation under heaven hath had more Embaſſadors from Heaven then we have had, and though ſome have hearkened to them, yet for the moſt part they meete with <hi>Ammonitiſh</hi> dealings they are disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and mocked, and laded with indignities, denyed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their meſſage, every paltry raſcals complaint admitted againſt them, none walke in ſo much danger as they, none more ſhot at, then they; ſcarce any will heare them and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Embaſſage, and thoſe few that doe, are counted the only factious people, and peſtilent fellows in the land, O, what wrath is there againſt us for theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this very cauſe, the Lord plagued all <hi>Judah</hi> even becauſe they would not liſten to Gods Embaſſadors that he ſent to them earely and late, as the Prophet ſpeakes. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord of Hoaſts. Behold I will ſend upon thee the ſword, the famine and the Peſtilence, and will make them like vile Figges, that cannot be eaten they are ſo evill, and I will perſecute them with the ſword, with the famine and with the Peſtilence, and I will deliver them to be removed to all the Kingdomes of the earth, to be a curſe, and an aſtoniſhment and an hiſsing and a reproach, among all Nations whither I have driven them.</hi> Mark now; what is the reaſon, why God would doe thus? <hi>Becauſe they have not hearkened to my Word,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>which I ſent unto them by my ſervants the Prophets, riſing up early and ſending them, but yee would not heare ſayth the Lord.</hi> This was the reaſon, why God would plague them ſo grievouſly, becauſe they would not liſten to his Embaſſadors that he ſent them for their good. The like we reade of the ten Tribes: the Lord powred his vengeance on them too for this very reaſon, becauſe they would not heare his Embaſſadors, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord caſt them out of his ſight, and flung them away from being his people and hee would never be their God more, the place is 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 13, 14, 15. The Lord teſtified
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42059:72"/>
againſt <hi>Iſrael &amp; Judah,</hi> by all the Prophets &amp; Seers, ſaying, <hi>Turne ye from your evill wayes and keepe my Commandments and my Statutes, according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers notwithſtanding they would not heare, but hardned their necks, like to the neck of their Fathers, and did not beleeve in the Lord their God, and they rejected his Statutes and his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that he made with their Fathers.</hi> Mark, this was the cauſe why the Lord was ſo angry with them, and removed them out of his ſight. Becauſe they would not doe as his Embaſſadors did command them in his name. Now as God hath let out his fury upon them for not attending to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, ſo he hath done, and daily doth and will yet more doe upon us. For though for temporall Judgements, God be patient and forbearing, beyond all admiration, we feele yet no Sword, no Famine, no Peſtilence, we may be aſtoniſht to ſee how long ſuffering he his, O if we had the grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, nevertheleſſe the Lord is effuſing out upon us the very dregges of his Cup, he fats us up for his eternall ire, he hath done converting of our hearers, he hath done bleſſing of our Sermons, he hath made us <hi>Loammies,</hi> and <hi>Toruha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahs,</hi> &amp; turned us into a generation of his wrath. You whoſe eyes God hath opened, whoſe hearts God hath inclined unto him, whoſe Conſciences God hath purged and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and made you Saints. Bleſſe him and praiſe his holy name, and make more of his infinit grace and goodneſſe. For it is to be feared God will now adde no more to your mumber, he delivers people now to a reprobate ſence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to be revenged on our land in fire and Brimſtone, for the contempt of his glorious Goſpell, that hath beene preached ſo long a time. He lets men fill up the meaſure of their ſins, that thoſe that are filthy may be filthy ſtill, thoſe that are drunkards may be drunkards ſtill, thoſe that are led with their luſts, ſhall be ſo ſtill, to the intent that he may bring upon the world, all the fierceneſſe of his ſpirituall and everlaſting wrath, and that he may revenge the quarrell of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42059:72"/>
his Covenant, and the labors of ſo many Embaſſadors, whom he hath ſent unto you, and ye would not heare. O that this might move ſome of your ſoules, that ſo ye might prevent this dreadfull judgement and be plucked out like Brandes out of the Burning.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Another Uſe is, are Gods Miniſters, his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors?<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> then they muſt Preach no mercy at all, unto ſuch as wilfully ſtand out againſt Jeſus Chriſt. When <hi>Antony</hi> was a Rebell, O ſayes <hi>Tully,</hi> it is not fit to ſend him Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Peace, to treat with him of Peace; as <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſaid once: Goe, ſayes hee, and tell <hi>Creon, Theſeus</hi> offers thee a gracious offer; Yet I am pleaſed to bee friends, if thou wilt ſubmit. This is my firſt meſſage: But if this offer prevaile not, look for me to be up in Armes. So, Beloved, Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of peace have been made already, again, and again, and they have been rejected. Now his Embaſſadors muſt cry. Armes, Blood, and fire, and pillars of ſmoak. At the firſt God dealt with us, as <hi>Tullus</hi> with his Enemies, <hi>Quae verbis componere potuit, armis non decrevit:</hi> as long as hee could reconcile them with his word, they ſhould not have his blows: So the Lord hath dealt with us, at the firſt he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded us with the promiſes of his Word, now ſeeing no more can be gotten in that way, hee will have his Miniſters lay the axe at the rootes, to hew down, and to deſtroy, and to ſlay people with the ſword of his lips. Doe not wonder, when we preach hell and damnation to all rebellious ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You will ſay, here is nothing but judgement, Preachers ſend us all to the devill, they preach, as if they would drive us to deſpaire: they ſhould put in, except wee repent.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, it is enough now to underſtand it; when the Goſpel hath been a long time in a place, Gods Embaſſadors muſt hold out the black flagge: when <hi>Tamberlane</hi> had hung out his White flagge, and that would not doe, and his Red flagge, and that would not doe neither; then he hung out his Black flagge. Now look for no mercy. So, Chriſts
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42059:73"/>
Embaſſadours ſhould doe. When <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the Goſpel was contemned in <hi>Corinth,</hi> the white and red flagge had cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe good; You ſee how hee hung out his black one. <hi>Know yee not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God. Bee not deceived, No idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor railers, nor covetous, ſhall ever inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. He does not put in, now except yee repent; no, no, now look for no mercy. So the Apoſtle <hi>John. The fearfull, and unbeleevers, and whoremongers, and lyers ſhall be caſt into the Lake that burnes with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> Rev. 21. 8. hee does not put in, except ye repent: if we ſhould bee ever putting in, except yee repent, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with mercy upon condition of repentance, what would hard-hearted people ſay? O wee had a terrible Sermon to day, but the Preacher gave us comfort in the cloſure, he had a ſweet bit at the laſt, and thus they heale all again. Nay, when people grow once to be ſtubborn, then Prophets have been ſo farre from putting in except yee repent, or any other tearm of mercy, that they uſed to meet with the peoples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of repentance. So <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they threaten deſtruction to the wicked, and they adde this above all, though they cry for mercy, nay, though they faſt, and could get <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> to pray for them, yet they ſhall have no mercy: <hi>q. d.</hi> ye think to avoid theſe judgements, by repenting another day; no, no, when yee cry for mercy, yee ſhall not have it. When a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a Pariſh, or any people grow perverſe, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the ſweet tenders of mercy, Gods Embaſſadors are to look upon ſuch wretches as rebels; no indenting with them more, no tearms of peace more, as the Law ſayes, with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and Traytors, and Rebels, the Law of Armes is not to bee obſerved, as <hi>Baldus</hi> ſpeaks, they have broken the league, as <hi>Florus</hi> ſpeaks: when <hi>Spartacus</hi> the Rebell, deſired an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage of peace, hee would faine have <hi>Craſſus</hi> contract a league with him, <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſcorned the motion; when <hi>Talfari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42059:73"/>
that egregious Robber and Traytour, ſent an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor with treaty of Peace to <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> took it with indignation, that hee ſhould bee ſo ſawey with him. No Embaſſage of peace is to be made with rebellious wretches; wee need not put in, except yee repent, when we are to deal with ſuch; No, no, when ye grow once to deſpiſe reproof, ſee you to that. True, if yee doe repent, who knows what God will doe? Though <hi>Craſſus</hi> would not parlee with <hi>Spartacus</hi> about peace, yet when hee did repent indeed, hee received him to mercy. So will God doe with you. But in the mean time, know that the God of Heaven is at defiance with you, and all the curſes in his Book, are directed againſt the face of you. Yee have played the deaf Adder, againſt the gracious tenders of mercy from day to day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee your damned condition. The Embaſſadors of Chriſt have not one tittle of mercy of you, if we could ſee you melt, and cry out, and down on your knees, and your hearts turn, and your ſpirits ſink down before God, then wee might ſay ſomething unto you; therefore, Brethren, if the Miniſters of the Goſpel doe daily preach more and more judgement, doe not think much, they ought ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and Laſtly, one Uſe to you that feare God, and<note place="margin">Uſe 6.</note> beleeve his Embaſſadors, and are beſought by them. Let me ſay to you, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voyce of his ſervants, that walketh in darkneſſe, and hath no light, let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</hi> Eſa. 50. 10. that is, bee of good comfort, though all the world, and all the devills in hell bee againſt you, yet bee of good cheare; what, although yee meet with never ſo many temptations, and feares, ſuch a fogge of them, that ye can ſee no light, yet it ſhall aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe well with you. Though others have not come in at the preaching of the Word, ye have. Howbeit others will not reform, will not ſee the Lords hand lifted up, they will not acknowledge their ſins and ſinfull doings, and damned
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42059:74"/>
caſe, yet ye have. Yee have ſeen it, and felt it, and run to the throne of Grace, and have ſought the Lord, according as Gods Embaſſadors have directed you out of his Word, yee have feared God, and obeyed the voyce of his ſervants, though others make a mock of ſuch as will be ruled by Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; tuſh, they ſhall not curb mee, ſayes one, and they ſhall not controll mee, ſayes another. What, does hee think to lead mee in a ſtring? Yet yee doe fear God, and yee dare not ſtand out againſt the preaching of his ſervants, yee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that yee may ever practiſe their Word, and lead your lives according to it, what ever others doe. Bee of good chear, ſayes the Prophet, <hi>The Lord is your God, and doe yee ſtay your ſelves on him.</hi> the Doctrine that God hath ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by the Miniſtery of his ſervants, is the only Doctrine of Salvation, and therein yee ſhall finde eternall life.</p>

                  <q>Theſe things, ſaith hee, that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THeſe words are the Subſcription of the Letter, unto the Angell of <hi>Sardis,</hi> containing a deſcription of Chriſt, from whom the Letter is ſent. Now Chriſt is here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, according to the matter in hand, from two royalties of his; firſt, <hi>That he hath the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> that is, he hath the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, and all his gifts and graces to whomſoever he pleaſeth; Secondly, that <hi>He hath the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Starres,</hi> that is, hee hath the diſpoſing of the Miniſters of the Church. And this, I told you, is to bee meant divers wayes. Chriſt is ſaid to have the Miniſters of the Church five wayes. Firſt, hee hath the ſending of them, they have their Miſſion from him. Secondly, hee hath the delegating of them, they have their Commiſſion from him. Thirdly, bee hath the gifting of them, they have their abilities from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42059:74"/>
him. Fourthly, hee hath the proſpering of them, they have the ſucceſſe of their labours from him. Fifthly, he hath the keeping of them, they are put into a place, continued, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they have their liberty from him, and when they are put downe or ſilenced, it is he that does doe it.</p>
               <p>The two firſt I have handled already; firſt, that he hath the ſending of them; Secondly, that he hath the delegating of them. I come now to the third, Hee hath the gifting of them; look what good gifts and abilities they have, they have them all of him. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Hee hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. and this was one of the ends of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Hee aſcended up on high, and led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. that is, this was one end of his aſcending up to Heaven, that hee might ſend down gifts unto his Church. Now what gifts does hee mean? True, hee ſends gifts to all his true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but he meanes the gifting of his Miniſters, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>And hee gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and teachers, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery;</hi> and ſo forth, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, it is not without cauſe, for of all men, wee that are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, have need of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and rare gifts and abilities.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To open the Scriptures: the Scriptures are a great deep, and they have under the Letter, much admirable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matter encouched, and many things are hard in them as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, And a Miniſter is to open them, and to give out the ſenſe, as it is ſaid of the Prieſts, <hi>They read the Law diſtinctly, and gave out the ſenſe, and made the people to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Reading,</hi> Nehem. 8. 8. Now if a Miniſter have not gifts from Jeſus Chriſt, what madde work will hee make? the Scripture will bee a claſped book unto him, and a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſealed up. Like the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> that in three daies could
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42059:75"/>
not expound <hi>Sampſons</hi> Riddle. It is ſaid of Chriſt, that he opened the Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 32. The Scriptures are ſhut, and contain Myſteries folded and lapped up, now the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had need of abilities to open them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To Teach; as a Miniſter is to open the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which requireth great gifts: ſo, he is to teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of them, to draw Doctrines out of the ſame, and this requireth great gifts too, to informe the judgement, to let out the light of the Word, to ſcatter the beames of the Sun of righteouſneſſe abroad, to diſpel the darkneſſe of mens minds, to ſhine round about them in ſpirituall knowledge. This is a work of much ability, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy, the things which thou haſt heard of mee, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhall bee able to teach others,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. and therefore it is called Prophecying. <hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying,</hi> that is, deſpiſe not Teaching, a man had need of a ſpeciall gift, to be able to Propheſie, ſo, if a man would be a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; when <hi>Nicodemus</hi> would expreſſe what an able Teacher Chriſt was, ſayes hee, <hi>Thou art a teacher come from God.</hi> A man had need to be one that hath been with God, that would teach aright. There is a gift of fitneſſe and aptneſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a man cannot doe it. <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt bee apt to teach,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. the Apoſtle tells us, there bee heapes of naughty teachers in the world, a good teacher is a rare man, it cannot bee without all wiſdome, as hee ſayes, <hi>Teaching every man in all wiſdome,</hi> Col. 1. 28. we are to teach people the learning of the holy, how to know God, how to fear him, and love him. Wee are to teach people how to pray, how to walk in all holines and righteouſnes of living: the great things of Gods Law, the deep things of the Spirit, the myſteries of eternall life, to open the wiles of Satan, the miſtakes of the hearts of men, the many by-wayes of the ſoule, ye know ſin is covered over with pleaſures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and carnall reaſons, and evaſions, and we are to lay it out naked, as indeed it is. Gracious and godly courſes, ſeem
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42059:75"/>
grievous, and irkſome, and uncouth, and vile, and needleſſe, and we are to diſcover the inward pleaſure, and commodity, and neceſſity and glory of them, and therfore wee have need of abilities.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to Convince, yee know how the heart does uſe to put off the Word, and if it meet with a doctrine, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or a precept, that it does not like, it will deny it, it will cavill and carp, O, it is falſe, as <hi>Johanan</hi> and others ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> it is falſe you doe not ſay true, wee will never beleeve it. When wee paint out a drunkards damned eſtate, he is ready to gainſay it, or an adulterers, he is ready to except, people contradict ſuch paſſages of the Word, as are againſt their luſts, and they give us very little better then the lye, many times, therefore a Miniſter ſhould bee able to convince, that he may be able by ſound doctrine, both to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and to convince the gain-ſayers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſubject to condemn us for harſhneſſe, and hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that we doe not preach <hi>placentia</hi> enough, we muſt be able to uſe ſome ſpeech that cannot be condemned, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 8. when a Miniſter preaches weakly, Sermons like wide nets, or rotten threads, that the Birds may get through or break, this is not able preaching, as <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> when he heard him diſputing weakly againſt conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, O, ſayes he, I am ſorry that ſo good a cauſe ſhould have ſuch a weak defendant. It is ſaid of <hi>Apollos,</hi> that hee mightily convinced the Jewes. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Univerſity-men there, that came huddling about him, they were not able to withſtand the Spirit, and the wiſdome by which hee ſpake, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 10. it is the promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>I will give you a mouth and wiſdome, which all your adverſaries ſhall not bee able to gainſay, or reſiſt,</hi> Luk. 21. 15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to move the affections, Miniſters have need of abilities to move the affections of their hearers; not only to informe their judgements, but alſo to work upon their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, not onely to illighten their underſtanding, but alſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42059:76"/>
to ſtirre up their hearts, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to ſtirre you up,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 13. a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is to ſtirre up his people, to ſtirre their hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: hee may preach a wholſome Sermon, and the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bee like Mill-poſts, and not ſtirred a jot: <hi>Paul</hi> laboured to ſtirre affections too: <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. that is, wee labour to work upon your affections, and therefore Chriſt ſent a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim with a live coale unto the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to touch his lips, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. 6. he had need of live coales in his lips, to fire the affections of his auditory; So, hee ſent the Holy Ghoſt down upon his Apoſtles in fiery tongues, without this the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the judgement is little worth. Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more in the will and the affections of men, then in any other faculty of the ſoule. I confeſſe the Miniſter muſt ſhine too; I, but he muſt heat too. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was a burning and a ſhining light.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To ſpeak <hi>Pro re natâ,</hi> a Miniſter hath need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary abilities, ſometimes hee ſhall bee called before Councills, hee preaches ſuch doctrine as angers the world, and therefore he is in danger to be had before Councills, and therefore hee had need to have an extemporary facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he may anſwer as hee ſees cauſe, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>When they deliver you up, take no thought, how or what yee ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall bee given you in that ſame houre, what yee ſhall ſpeak,</hi> Matth. 10. 19. ſometimes to preach upon ſhort warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did, when hee relyed upon his Brother <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> to Preach for him, hee not comming, hee was faine to goe up <hi>extempore</hi> himſelf, and ſo hee preacht upon the 95 <hi>Pſalme;</hi> So; when there was a ſuddain judgement of God that fell out there in <hi>Hippo,</hi> though <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had preacht twice that very day before, yet he went up again, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the third time: O, ſayes hee, doe not wonder, my deare Brethren, <hi>Si hodie ter Sermonem, &amp;c.</hi> doe not wonder that I preach thrice this ſame time, it is not without cauſe, &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42059:76"/>
a Miniſter may be put upon it as <hi>Philip</hi> was by the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> concerning the meaning of a place of Scripture to ſpeake of it at firſt ſight, &amp; a Miniſter muſt not only have this knowledge in his note-book, but in his lips; that is, to be in a readineſſe upon every occaſion. His lips muſt preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. Sometimes he may come among his people, he may light upon their company by chance, now if he have not good abilities, he cannot doe the part of a Miniſter. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I long to ſee you, to impart unto you ſome ſpirituall gift,</hi> Rom. 1. 11. A Miniſter when he ſees his people, he ſhould be a well-ſtored man, to impart ſome ſpirituall thing or other to them, a word of inſtruction, a word of exhortation, a word of admonition, when he does but ſee them, he ſhould be able to drop ſomething among them.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, to obſerve ſeaſons, to be able to make choice of ſpeciall Texts for ſpeciall occaſions. For howſoever all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are full of divine and Heavenly truths; yet ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſit ſome perſons and ſome occaſions better than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. <hi>Aarons</hi> bells muſt be wiſely rung, ſometimes in one tune, ſometimes in another as the occaſion ſerves. A Miniſter is to change his note, as the circumſtances do require. A Steward in a family muſt have aſwell wiſedome to Miniſter every owne his portion in due ſeaſon, as fidelity to diſpence his Maſters goods. A word fitly ſpoken in due time, is like Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25. 11. The very Heathen man Commends much <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> When a man ſpeakes in due ſeaſon. S. <hi>Paul</hi> had this gift, in all his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to ponder all circumſtances, who, and what, and where, &amp; when, &amp; how. <hi>I made my ſelf a ſervant unto all, ſaies, he that I might gain the more, To the Jewes I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jewes: to them that are under he Law, as under the Law, that I might gaine them that are under the Law. To the weak I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as weake that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome.</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 22. To Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, we are the miniſters of God, and we have need of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42059:77"/>
to fit our doctrine to the preſent time and occaſions and perſons, that we may profit hearers. When the Apoſtle came to <hi>Athens,</hi> he tooke his Text according to the preſent hint. He found an Altar with this inſcription, <hi>To the unknown God,</hi> and ſo he ſpake of that. Act. 17. 23, 24. He tooke occaſion from thence to ſpeake of the God of Heaven and Earth to them. When our Saviour Chriſt ſaw <hi>the woman of</hi> Samaria <hi>come to draw water,</hi> hee tooke opportunitie to preach unto her of the <hi>living water.</hi> Joh. 4. 10. Miniſteriall gifts are for this very purpoſe as the Prophet ſayes. <hi>The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that I ſhould know how to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon.</hi> Iſa. 50. 4. It is noted of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> that when he ſaw the Scribes and Phariſes came in to heare him, he had about with them. <hi>O generation of Vipers, who hath forewarned you to ſlie from the wrath to come,</hi> q. d. What do you make here? yee are Hypocrites, ye are vile wretched perſons; repent or elſe you'l to hell. This was now in due ſeaſon. So when a Drunkard comes in, we ſhould let fly at him. Weepe and howle yee drunkards. See what God ſaies of you: to whom is wo but to you? See what the Scripture ſayes of your courſes, <hi>yee ſhall never inherit Gods Kingdome, none of you, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks.</hi> So, when Whoremongers ſtep in, we ſhould give them their doome, O ye Whoremongers &amp; Adulterers, God will judge you one day. This is like the former and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raine. Then it comes, when the ground hath need of it. So when a Miniſter obſerves ſeaſons, then the word comes, when the ſoule hath need of it. It comes pat, as we ſay, Then people may ſee a ſpeciall providence in it. I ſee a ſpeciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God that the Miniſter ſhould ſpeak of ſuch a Theme this day, that he ſhould hit ſo right upon my ſin; when a man hath beene cozening, then to come to Church and there heare of it againe: When a man hath beene ſwearing and lying, then to turne in to the preacher, and heare of that very ſinne, and the danger of it, and the damned eſtate of the commit of it: When a man hath beene thinking to do evill, then to ſit
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42059:77"/>
in his ſeat and heare his evill ript up, and all his ſecrets laid open, and wo to you wretch, that deviſe evill, the Lord knowes your deviliſh intentions, ye are thinking to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but God will be revenged on you, ye are minding to go by-and-by to ſuch a piece of villany, but the Lord will find you out. This is preaching in ſeaſon. So when a ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be caſt downe, but when he comes to a Sermon, there he meets with his owne caſe, his temptations are treated of wine and oyle is powred into his wounds, this is to preach in due ſeaſon. O what gifts had a Miniſter need to have! He had need of daily inflvence from God: Daily inſtincts, that God ſhould guide his tongue and his heart. Now, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is Chriſt alone that gifts all his true Miniſters. I will be with thy mouth, ſaies he to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe of this is. Firſt, here we ſee that a Miniſter had not<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> need be a foole, no; no, he that winneth ſoules, is wiſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 30. he muſt be a wiſe man that would be a Miniſter, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more then humaine wiſedome to catch ſoules, when the heart hath ſo many put-offs, ſo many deceits, ſo many ſtrongholds, ſo loth to obey the word, ſo ſubtill to invent excuſes, ſo crafty to thruſt away the truth; There is ſome wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome required to catch fiſhes, and birdes, and vermine; how much more, to catch men! who is ſufficient for theſe things? The beſt of us all may bluſh to thinke how unfit we are to be Miniſters. O how ſhould we bleſſe God, if he fit any of us in any ſuitable meaſure! and when we have done our beſt, we had need to goe home, and downe on our knees, and cry ſhame on our ſelves for not doing better.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then they are none of Chriſts Miniſters that are<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> not gifted for this mighty worke. Will he ſend a foole on ſuch a waighty Meſſage as this is? <hi>He that ſendeth a Meſſage by the hand of a foole, cutteth off the feet and drinketh dammage,</hi> Pro. 26. 6. That is, if a man have a buſineſſe of any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, He had not need to imploy a foole in it, leſt he ſuffer great dammage. It is all one as if one ſhould chop off ones
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42059:78"/>
feet &amp; then bid him go on our errand. O, Beloved, preaching of the Goſpell is a worke of infinit importance, the humbling of mens hearts, the convincing of conſciences, the converting of mens Soules, theſe are great buſineſſes, doubtleſſe they are no Fooles that Chriſt ſends on ſuch errands. True, all Chriſts Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not alike gifted, ſome have meaner gifts then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome have, but he that hath leaſt, he is fitted in ſome meaſure to diſpence divine myſteries, to call home Gods elect, to build up the called, to judge all his hearers, to ſtop the mouthes of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, to hew down the obſtinate, to ſhew unto men the things belonging to their peace, to give the Saints their due, and the wicked their due. That a good man cannot come, but he ſhall have heavenly meat to feed on: Nor a wretch neither, but his Miniſtery wil ſingle him out &amp; give him his bit to chew upon. He that cannot doe this in any meaſure, he is none of Chriſts Miniſters. Surely he will not ſend ſuch a Meſſage by a fooles hand, but either he makes him a wiſe able man, or elſe he runs without his ſending.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then my Brethren, hence we learn whether to go for<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> gifts, if we would be enabled to our calling, let us goe to Jeſus Chriſt that hath the ſeven ſtars in his hands, he can make our inflvences ſtrong, and our light &amp; heate mighty, he can give us a gift of boldneſſe to feare no mens faces. He can unty our ſtammering tongues that we ſhall have liberty in ſpeaking. He can make our tongues a ſharpe ſword. He can make us ſons of conſolation unto ſome, &amp; of thunder, unto others. If we want knowledge in the myſterie of Chriſt, let us make our wants knowne unto him, &amp; he will inſtill into us. If we want words, he can make them flow in unto us. If we want affections, he can purge away our iniquities &amp; fire our hearts &amp; lips. While the Apoſtles were together at prayer. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 14. ſuddenly the Lord Jeſus ſent them the gift of the holy Ghoſt in fiery cloven tongues <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>While</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>were praying in the priſon, the Lord backt them from Heaven, &amp; made them inſtruments of turning the heart of the Goaler.</hi> Let us pray, then, not only in our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42059:78"/>
Pulpits before our Sermons, but alſo in ſecret, God giveth the greateſt gifts in ſecret, and like man revealeth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: as ſecret meales make a fat body, ſo does ſecret prayer, it makes a well-liking ſoule.</p>
               <p>Again, this ſhould teach us to ſtirre up the gifts that hee<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> gives us: Wee ſhould labour to put them forth, a man may loſe the benefit of Chriſts gifts, for want of rouzing up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and putting of them forth, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to <hi>Timothy, I put thee in remembrance that thou ſtirre up the gift of God, which is in thee, by the putting on of hands,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. wee muſt ſtir up the gift in us. When Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> would prophecy to his Sons, hee ſtirred up his ſpirit with ſavoury meat. When <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> would Prophecy before the three Kings, hee called for a Minſtrell to ſtirre up the ſpirit of Prophecy in him. <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah cryes, awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, O my ſoule,</hi> ſayes <hi>David.</hi> When Chriſt would pray to his Father, the Text ſhews, how hee ſtirred up himſelf, <hi>Theſe things ſpake Jeſus, and lift up his eyes unto heaven,</hi> Joh. 17. 1. He lift up his ſoule and his ſpirit, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> went and ſhook himſelf, if his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had been in him it had been well, but like a foole he had driven him away. But it ſhould ſeem, when hee had the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him, this was his wont, hee ſhooke himſelf as at other times, hee uſed to ſtirre up the Spirit in him, ſo wee ſhould ſtirre up the Spirit in us, wee ſhould rouze up our gifts, like ſparks out of the aſhes, and beſtirre our ſelves ſoundly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe uſing of them, lets them warpe and wane.</p>
               <p>Again, wee ſhould labour to relye more upon Chriſt, we<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> truſt too much to our notes; but, O if wee could truſt more to Chriſt, thats warmeſt matter that comes down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ſpeaking, not that wee ſhould leave all without ſtudy, till wee come into our Pulpits: No, prepare as much as wee can. But then if we would truſt in Chriſt for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent aſſiſtance, and yearn up to him for prompting, it would make our Miniſtery more lively. When a Sermon is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Faith, thats it that does moſt good: then Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42059:79"/>
Preaches, and not wee, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by mee,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 2.</p>
               <p>Again, this ſhould teach the people of God, if they would have their Miniſters inabled indeed, to doe their ſoules good; that they ſhould pray for them, that Chriſt would mor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them. How often does the Apoſtle tell the people, that Miniſters might have greater gifts, if they had a heart! O ſayes hee, <hi>Pray for mee, that I may have utterance, and that I may ſpeak boldly, to make known the myſtery of the Goſpel,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 6. 19. <hi>q. d.</hi> if yee have a heart to pray, I doe verily think that I ſhall bee the more aſſiſted, a great deale. Our Chariot drives the more heavily, becauſe it wants the wheels of your Prayers, and the truth is, God uſes to puniſh people thus, that becauſe they are dead and dull, and have no heart, and are weary of the Word; therefore hee with-holds from the Miniſter on purpoſe, to plague them back again; as God told <hi>Ezekiel, Son of man, thou ſhalt bee dumb, and when thou wouldſt reprove, thou ſhalt be tongue-tyed, thy tongue ſhall cleave to the roof of thy mouth:</hi> now mark the reaſon; why? <hi>for they are a rebellious houſe,</hi> Ezek. 3. 26. Mark, it was long of <hi>Judahs</hi> ſinnes that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was tongue-tyed and locked up: An excellent Miniſter, and yet ſtraitned for the peoples ſinnes.</p>
               <p>O, Beloved, I will tell you what would enlarge our hearts and our gifts towards you. Firſt, if you would more flock to the Word, and attend. It is ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 1, 2. That Chriſt ſeeing the multitude, <hi>Hee opened his mouth,</hi> that is, he was the more inlarged to Preach, upon the ſight of ſuch a great auditory. Who would not caſt his net amidſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſiſhes? The Text ſayes, <hi>When Chriſt ſaw the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, hee had compaſsion on them.</hi> So, if Miniſters could ſee all their Pariſh come in, all that might hear; the ſight of ſuch a multitude would ſtirre up pity. O would wee think, O what a goodly company is here! O it is pity but they ſhould have ſomewhat, O if I could win ſome of you. There may
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42059:79"/>
bee a luſt in this thing, and wee muſt take heed of it too, leſt we be tickled with flockings, or diſcouraged with thin Pewes. This is pride, but yet there is a truth in this. What a ſhame is it, that there ſhould bee fewer of our own Pariſh every Lecture-day, than of ſtrangers? is it not juſt with God to make the breſts dry, when the Children care not for ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if God had more among you to bee ſaved, as God ſaid to <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning <hi>Corinth, Bee not afraid, ſpeak, hold not thy peace, I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee to hurt thee, I have much people in this City,</hi> Act. 18. 10. this opened <hi>Pauls</hi> mouth, this made him finde abundance of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from Chriſt, becauſe God had much people there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if you would hear with alacrity, and with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a greedy minde. When <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company were all liſtening, and earneſt to hear, and to hearken, O ſay they; <hi>Speak Peter, wee are all here before God, to hear every thing thou ſpeakeſt. Then Peter opened his mouth,</hi> Act. 10. 33, 34. But when people look dully, and blockiſhly, and ſit ſleepily and drowſily, as though they were weary of hearing, and cared not whether they heard or no; Nay, this is the reaſon why the Devils inſtruments are ſo bold to oppoſe the Miniſtery of God, they ſee they are not much cared for, none but here one, and there one, a ſort of preciſe fooles: whereas, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would bee eager to hear over all the land, they durſt not meddle with them, as it is ſaid of our Saviour, the Chiefe Prieſts, and the Scribes ſought to deſtroy him, but they could not finde what they might doe, <hi>For all the people were very attentive to hear him,</hi> Luc. 19. 48.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if yee would bee fruitfull in obedience, and in learning; this would put life into our Prayers at home, this would quicken our labours and paines in the Pulpit. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hope of having fruite, made <hi>Paul</hi> very eager to come to <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 1. 13. The very thought that the people are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and godly, and fruitfull, carries the Preacher beyond
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42059:80"/>
himſelf. Nay, its ſtrange to conſider, how, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter knows hee hath but one underſtanding judicious hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, one gracious Soule in his Pariſh, it provokes him very much, it makes him look about him the more, a great deale: How much more, when there be many ſuch? But when a Pariſh is ſenſeleſſe, and heavy, and froward, it is unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſider how it ſtraitens a Miniſter. Let a man be to pray in a meeting, where they bee graceleſſe, and dull, and hardly any almoſt godly, hee cannot tell what to ſay almoſt, hee is not himſelf. Whereas, if he were to pray among them that hee knows can ſavour gracious things, there hee hath more liberty to let out himſelf.</p>

               <q>And the ſeven Starres.</q>
               <p>THe Doctrine we continue yet in, is, That Chriſt hath the <hi>ſeven Stars,</hi> he hath all the Miniſters of the Church. I told you he is ſaid to have them five wayes. Firſt, hee hath the ſending of them; they have their Miſſion from him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hee hath the delegating of them; they have their Commiſſion from him. Thirdly, hee hath the gifting of them; they have their abilities from him. Fourthly, hee hath the proſpering of them; they have the ſucceſſe of their labours from him. Fifthly, he hath the diſpoſing of them, either for placing, or removing, for freedome, or reſtraint.</p>
               <p>The firſt three I have handled already; the laſt whereof was this; That Hee hath the gifting of his Miniſters; As <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Hee hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. This was one of the ends of his Aſcenſion; <hi>Hee aſcended up on high, hee led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. Thus the Text ſayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42059:80"/>
they preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with ſignes following, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 20. So <hi>Paul</hi> had great gifts, and abilities, which he calls the ſignes of an Apoſtle. <hi>Truely, the ſignes of an Apoſtle were wrought among you, in all patience, with ſignes and wonders, and mighty deeds,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 12. they that are not competently, at the leaſt, gifted for the Miniſtery, they ſhew no ſigne that they are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt gives all his Miniſters a gift of utterance, a gift of ſpeaking to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a gift of dividing of the Word aright, mighty deeds. They may all ſay to the people, Truely, the ſignes of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Jeſus Chriſt hath been wrought among you. Theſe gifts are the witneſſes, whereby he gives witneſſe to a man, that hee comes from God to a people, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bearing them witneſſe, both with ſignes and wonders, and with divers Miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will,</hi> Heb. 2. 4. I confeſſe ſuch wonders and Miracles are now ceaſed; I, but the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, are powred out ſtill upon all the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and theſe are Gods witneſſes, that people may know they are ſent of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhewed you how Miniſters have need of excellent and rare gifts; I, and you have need that they ſhould bee well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifted, that ſo they may be able to doe you good:</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the interpreting of the Scriptures, they are a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and a claſped booke, they are ſhut up naturally to a man. It is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>He opened the Scriptures,</hi> Luc. 24. 32. So, a Miniſter had need of gifts to open the Scriptures; to give out the ſenſe, as the Prieſts in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, St. <hi>John</hi> wept, when no man could open the ſealed book. When a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hath a Miniſter that cannot open the ſealed Book, it is enough to make good people weep and lament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they have need of gifts to teach. He that would teach, had need to be an able man, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>that are able to teach,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt bee</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:42059:81"/>
                  <hi>apt to teach,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. there is a gift of fitneſſe and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without which a man cannot be a good teacher.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they have need of gifts to be able to convince, it requires a great art to ſpeak irrefragably to mens mindes. Many truthes the hearts of men doe not like, and therefore they labour to put them off. And therefore a Miniſter had need of a gift of convincing, <hi>That he may be able by ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to convince the gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1. 9. as it is ſaid of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, they were not able to withſtand the ſpirit, and the wiſdome by which he ſpake,</hi> Act. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to move the affections; a Miniſter is not onely to informe mens judgements, but alſo to work on their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>I think it meet as long as I am in this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, to ſtirre you up,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 13. a Miniſter is to ſtirre up his people, to ſtirre their hearts and affections: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes: <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. that is, wee labour to ſtirre your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Chriſt ſent a Seraphim with a live coale to touch <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his lips, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. 6. we had need of fire coales in our lips, to heat your affections. Religion conſiſts in the will and affections of men, more then in any other faculty of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To ſpeak <hi>Pro re natâ,</hi> a Miniſter hath need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary abilities, to bee able upon ſhort warning, when <hi>Severus, Auguſtines</hi> Brother, failed him one day, hee was faine to goe up <hi>extempore</hi> into the Pulpit himſelf and Preach. A Miniſter may come into the company of his people, now if hee bee not habitually furniſht, how unprofitable will hee bee? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, when he came among his people, he <hi>would impart unto them ſome ſpirituall gift,</hi> Rom. 1. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A Miniſter had need of abilities to obſerve ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that <hi>Aarons</hi> bells may be wiſely rung, ſometimes in one tune, ſometimes in another, as occaſion ſerves, <hi>A word ſitly ſpoken in due time, is like apples of gold, in pictures of ſilver,</hi> Prov. 25. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42059:81"/>The uſe of this was Firſt, here we ſee that a Miniſter had<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> not need be a foole, no; he muſt bee a well-gifted man. <hi>He that winneth ſoules is wiſe, Pro.</hi> 11. 30. hee muſt bee one that may winne ſoules, and therefore he muſt be a wiſe man, when the heart hath ſo many wiles, and ſo many put-offs, and ſo many evaſions, and diſtinctions, and excuſes, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, hee had need bee a wiſe man that will goe about to catch it. There is ſome wiſdome required to catch birdes, and beaſts, and fiſhes, and vermine; becauſe they are all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till in their kinde, how much more, to catch the heart? This is <hi>Onus humeris angelorum for midandum,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſpeaks. Who is ſufficient for theſe things, ſayes the Apoſtle? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. The beſt of us all may bluſh to thinke how unfit we are to bee Miniſters: and therefore how ſhould wee bleſſe God, if he fit any of us in any ſuitable meaſure?</p>
               <p>Secondly, another Uſe was, Then they are none of Chriſts<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Miniſters that are not gifted for this mighty worke. Will he ſend a foole on ſuch a weighty Meſſage as this is? <hi>Hee that ſendeth a Meſſage by the hand of a foole, cutteth off the feet and drinketh dammage,</hi> Prov. 26. 6. There is great dammage in the Church, becauſe ſo many fooles have the handling of Gods meſſage. But I let this paſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hence we learn then, whether to goe for gifts, if<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> we would be inabled to our callings, let us goe to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that hath the ſeven Starres in his hands, he can make our influences ſtrong, our light mighty; he can give us a gift of boldneſſe, to fear no mans face; Hee can untye our ſtammering tongues, that they ſhall have liberty in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that words may flow in; Hee can make our tongues a ſharpe ſword; Hee can fire our hearts and lips. <hi>While the Apoſtles were together in prayer,</hi> Act. 1. 14. <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſent down the Holy Ghoſt on them in fiery tongues,</hi> Act. 2. 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This ſhould teach us to ſtirre up the gifts that<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> hee gives us; we ſhould ſtrive to put them all forth, as <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:42059:82"/>
ſayes to <hi>Timothy, Stirre up the gift that is in thee by the putting on of hands,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. we muſt ſtirre up the gift that is in us: when father <hi>Iſaac</hi> would Propheſie to his ſons, he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up his ſpirit with ſavoury meat: when <hi>Eliſhah</hi> would Prophecy before the three Kings, he called for a ſacred Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrell, to ſtirre up the Spirit of Prophecy in him: ſo <hi>Samp ſon</hi> uſed to goe and ſhake himſelf, when he went againſt the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims;</hi> as <hi>Deborah,</hi> while ſhe was at her work in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>Awake, awake Deborah,</hi> ſayes ſhee; ſhee ſhook up her ſelf; wee ſhould labour to uſe all our gifts to the full, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Make full proof of thy Miniſtery,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 5. ſo, wee ſhould make full proof of every one of our gifts, put them out to the utmoſt. Miniſters ſhould be able to ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> does, <hi>I have fully preached the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 15. 19. to preach fully, to convince fully, to exhort fully, fully to terrifie the hearts of the wicked, not to uſe our gifts by halves. O, how ſhall wee anſwer it, if we let our gifts ruſt for want of ſound uſing of them?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Wee ſhould rely more on Chriſt, we may truſt<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> too much to our notes; but, O that we could truſt more in Chriſt, that is warmeſt matter that comes down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ſpeaking, not that we ſhould leave all without ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, till wee come into our Pulpits, and then hope to have it given us in that moment; No, we muſt prepare as much as we can: as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thy ſelf in the field, and afterwards build thy houſe,</hi> Pro. 24. 27. So, we muſt prepare our Sermons, and make them fit for our people in our ſtudies, and then come and preach them, <hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to Doctrine,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 4. 13. God gives gifts by meanes, but then if we would truſt Chriſt for his preſent aſſiſtance, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erne up to him for prompting, it would make our Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more lively. When a Sermon is an act of Faith, that's it that does moſt good, then Chriſts Spirit Preaches, and not wee, then, then God ſpeaks, and not our notes, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42059:82"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by mee,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 2.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, this ſhould teach the people of God, if they<note place="margin">Uſe 6.</note> would have their Miniſters inabled indeed, to doe their ſoules good; to pray for them, that Chriſt would more furniſh them. How often does the Apoſtle tell the people, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters might have greater gifts, if they had a heart! O ſayes hee, <hi>Pray for mee, that I may have utterance, and that I may ſpeak boldly, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 6. 19. <hi>q. d.</hi> if yee have a heart to pray, I doe verily think that I ſhall bee the more aſſiſted, a great deale. The truth is, God uſes to puniſh people thus, becauſe they are dead and dull, and have no heart, and are weary of the Word; therefore hee with-holds from his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter on purpoſe, to plague them; as God told <hi>Ezekiel: Son of man, thou ſhalt bee dumb, and when thou wouldſt reprove, thou ſhalt be tongue-tyed, thy tongue ſhall cleave to the roof of thy mouth:</hi> now mark the reaſon; why? <hi>for they are a rebellious houſe,</hi> Ezek. 3. 26.</p>
               <p>But I will recapitulate no more of what I have delivered. Thus ye have heard the third thing, how Chriſt hath the gifting of his Miniſters? They have their gifts and abilities from him. Now I proceed on to the fourth. That he hath the proſpering of them: They have the ſucceſſe of their labours from Ieſus Chriſt. Chriſt bids us preach, Repent, repent, but it is he that muſt give the Repentance; So, <hi>Paul</hi> preached to <hi>Lydia,</hi> and had good ſucceſſe, for the text ſhews how ſhe was converted by his Miniſtery: But, it was God that opened her heart. As <hi>Rebeccah</hi> cookt the Veniſon, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave the bleſſing. So we may cooke the Word for you, but the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is in Chriſts hands, as the Apoſtle ſayes. We are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by whom ye Beleeved, even as the Lord gave to every man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. that is, when wee preached among you we had good ſucceſſe, you beleeved. What? as we would our ſelves? No, Alas we would faine have had you all to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve but even as the Lord gave to every man, the ſucceſſe was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42059:83"/>
as he would; ſoto ſome he gave only conviction by the word to ſome onely knowledge, to ſome good reformations, to ſome a true faith. It was as he was pleaſed to give to every man. So when he preached unto other <hi>Gentiles</hi> he confeſſes, looke what good ſucceſſe he had, he had from Jeſus Chriſt. I will not dare to ſpeake of any of thoſe things which Chriſt hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient by Word and deed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18. that is, as who ſhould ſay, that the Gentiles did heare me, that they were brought to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in word and deed, that I had ſo good ſucceſſe in my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; God forbid I ſhould ſay or thinke it was my doing. I dare not ſay ſo for a world. No, no, It was Chriſt, and hee alone that did worke by me as his poore Inſtrument. I have all my good ſucceſſe from him. The ſucceſſe is meerly as he will. If he will be pleaſed to give ſo good ſucceſſe, <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall convert 3000 at one Sermon. But if he be pleaſed to deny a good ſucceſſe, the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſhall preach in the reigne of 4 Kings, about foureſcore yeares and convert hardly one, as he ſayes to Iſrael, as the Apoſtle quotes him. <hi>All the day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying people.</hi> Rom. 10. 21. All ſucceſſes are of God, and therefore much more ſucceſſe here. Let it be in any calling. As for example, fiſhing; that when a man goes a fiſhing, he ſindes good ſucceſſe, this is of God. <hi>Simon</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany toyled all night and tooke nothing. But when Chriſt came and gave them good ſucceſſe, then they incloſed a great multitude of fiſhes, two ſhipfull of fiſhes at one draught, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 5. So when a man runnes, who ſhall get the Goale; the man may runne, but whether he ſhall get the Goale, that he cannot tell. When a man fights, the man may fight, and be the better man of the two, but whether ſhall overcome, that is uncertain unto them; the ſucceſſe is of God, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battaile to the ſtrong, nor riches to the wiſe, time and chance happens to them all,</hi> Eccle. 9. 11. that is, not as though the ſwift doe not ſometimes get
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42059:83"/>
the race, and the ſtrong the Victory, and wiſe men riches, yet they doe many times; namely, when God gives ſucceſſe, otherwiſe they doe not. How many times doe men goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout buſineſſes, and in all likelihood, they might hit well, yet how often doe they not? the Lord will have us ſee that ſucceſſe is from him.</p>
               <p>Now if it be ſo in outward things, how much more here, in other things, the work is more in the mans hands, and the thing is traceable to him, but it is not ſo here: VVee may labour to convert Soules, but this work is not in our hands, the uſing of the meanes, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt puts that into our hands; but the doing of the deed, the ſucceſſe is onely from him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe we are nothing in this worke. We may be ſomething at other workes, we may ſtudy, and in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence we may make a Sermon. But when we come to preach, it is not an ordinary providence that will make us to convert ſoules; no, here we are nothing, <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> may water, Now marke what followes, he does not onely ſay, it is God that gives the increaſe. <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but God gives the increaſe.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 6. that is, all their ſucceſſe and all the fruit of their labour is from God. That is not all he ſayes. But in the ſeventh verſe, ſayes he. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth any thing, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, as excellent gifts as theſe men had, they did nothing in this worke, the whole ſucceſſe is of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved we can but ſet before you, life and death, we can but tell you thus ye will be damned, and thus and thus ye may be ſaved. But it is God that muſt bleſſe this unto you. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we can doe nothing. We may preach our hearts out; and yet you'l to hell, doe we what we can, except the Lord break your careere. <hi>Eliſha's</hi> man could lay his Maſters ſtaffe upon the child, but the child ſtirred not, till <hi>Eliſha</hi> came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and then the child was raiſed. So we can but lay our
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42059:84"/>
Maſters ſtaffe upon your dead ſoules, But except our Maſter come himſelf, ne're a dead ſoule will ſtand up: what is all our preaching, and dreſſing up of our Sermons, like the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſayles, thats nothing except the wind blow. The Spirit of Chriſt is the winde, except hee blow upon you, we are nothing: the tampering on the Organs is nothing, but when the breath comes, then there is muſique; So, we may keep adoe to turne your hearts, but till God breath into you, there is nothing done. True, the preaching of the Goſpel is a very powerfull thing; I, when Chriſts arme goes along with it, it is the ſword of the Spirit, but if the Spirits arme be not with it, we may brandiſh it here every week, and doe little; as <hi>Scanderbagge</hi> ſaid: One hearing what mighty feats <hi>Scanderbagges</hi> ſword had done, ſent for it, and when he ſaw it, he made nothing of it: Is this the Sword that hath done ſuch great exploits? whats this Sword more than other ſwords? O, ſayes <hi>Scanderbagge,</hi> I ſent thee my ſword, but not my arme, that did handle it. So, my Brethren, the word which wee preach, is but Chriſts ſword; God ſends you his ſword many times, when he keeps his arme to himſelf, and ſo nothing is done. So then, we are nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſucceſſe is of Chriſt. Firſt, our wills are nothing to doe it, we may will to doe you good, but Converts cannot bee made by our wills, as the Evangeliſt ſayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13. Secondly, our paines and labours are nothing; we may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and take paines, but look <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49. 4. Thirdly, our gifts are nothing; who had better gifts than Chriſt had, as hee was man? and yet that would not doe it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 38. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Prayers are nothing, they may doe ſomething, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but except God be pleaſed to give ſucceſſe, they are nothing, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> prayed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 7, 8, 9. yet the Lord told him, that ſhould not doe it, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Converſion of Soules, is a ſupernaturall work; we that are Miniſters, preach to make men new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to turn Leopards into Kids, as if we ſhould preach to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42059:84"/>
make Blackamores white, the dead alive, which is a work for God alone to doe, and therefore the ſucceſſe muſt needs be from him, Alas, what are we able to doe? as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes, <hi>You are Gods wormanſhip in Chriſt Jeſus, created to good works,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 10. we are his inſtruments, that's true indeed, but yee are his workmanſhip, you are the Epiſtle of Chriſt, adminiſtred by us; <hi>Writen, not with Inke, but with the Spirit of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 3. The Epiſtle of Chriſt, but miniſtred indeed by Chriſt, his is the hand, wee are but the pen; when we bid you repent, and beleeve, and be holy, and godly, and heavenly minded men; deny your ſelves, be dead to the world, and alive to God, come out of Satans power, come into Chriſts Kingdom: it is like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the dead bones to gather fleſh, and ſtand up living men. All the ſucceſſe muſt needs be of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore what does this teach us? The Uſe of it is:<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Firſt, That we that are the Miniſters of God, can but make tryall whether we can convert our people, or no; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, proving, if at any time, God will give them repentance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. ſo it is in ſome of your Bibles, ſo, we muſt make proofe: we muſt try; come into the Pulpit every week, and try, ſharpen our nailes as ſharp as we can, and ſtrike them as farre in as we can, and ſo try, often try, as the wiſeman ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening let not thy hand reſt, for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, this, or that, or both,</hi> Eccle. 11. 6. So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did, hee would try; firſt, hee went to the poorer ſort, to ſee whether they would hearken unto him; when he had no ſucceſſe there, then thought he, I will try the great men, <hi>I will get mee to the great men,</hi> Jer. 5. 5. we ſhould make aſſayes, we doe not know, may be God will give us good ſucceſſe, we muſt make aſſayes, as it is ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, That they aſſayed to goe into</hi> Bithynia, <hi>but the Spirit ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them not,</hi> Act. 16. 7. O, thought they, here bee a great many ſoules in this Countrey, we will try, whether there be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42059:85"/>
any for Chriſt, yea, or no. Indeed, they found that they had no ſucceſſe in their attempt. But they made an aſſay though.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This teacheth us to wait, though we have not<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> ſucceſſe preſently, yet we ſhould wait, all ſucceſſe is from Chriſt, and therefore it is fit we ſhould wait for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Miniſter is commanded to be patient. <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. <hi>q. d.</hi> he hath not the ſucceſſe in his own hands, to have it when he will; no, though he doe no good yet, nor yet, hee muſt be patient. He is not apt to teach poore people elſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be patient, as he is not fit to teach a dull Schollar, that is over-haſty. And therefore, my Brethren, though we have loſt all our labour hitherto on the moſt of you, yet now again we ſpeak to you, come, will ye yet go to heaven? come are ye yet in the minde to hearken and obey? wee come to you once more, will ye yet, &amp;c. as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſayes, <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, O Jeruſalem, wilt thou not bee made clean? when ſhall it once be?</hi> Jer. 13. 27. Beloved, wee are dull Schollars in Religion, and people are hard to take their learning in this kinde, and therefore if we would be apt to teach, wee muſt be patient, what though we ſee no good yet, this muſt not make us out of heart, or to grudge our paines, we muſt bee patient ſtill, wee are to think, may be the next time I preach God will give me good ſucceſſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> gave not over, though they had cauſe to complain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This may ſerve to condemn all the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> the Goſpel comes, and ſpecially us hereabouts, that doe not let Miniſters have any good ſucceſſe, you will ſay, how doe I make this uſe of it? If all the Miniſters ſucceſſe be from Chriſt, then one would think, this were an excuſe unto peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; no, the meaning of the Doctrine is this, that the people are ſo contrary to the Word, ſuch enemies to the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt, that a Miniſter can look for no ſucceſſe,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42059:85"/>
except the Lord turn their hearts: This is the meaning of the point. Does this excuſe any? what, does your enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt Chriſt and all goodneſſe afford you any excuſe? nay, this aggravates your ſin. Now this is the meaning of it. As Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpake, how little ſucceſſe he and all the reſt of his fellow-Apoſtles had, hee layes the blame upon the people; <hi>All the day long, I have ſtretched out my hands againſt a diſobedient and a gainſaying people,</hi> Rom. 10. 21. So the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> from whom theſe words are taken, complaines of the unfruitfulneſſe of his Miniſtery, as being the peoples fault, and therefore he complaines of them unto God; <hi>Lord who hath beleeved our report,</hi> Eſay. 53. 1. The conſcience of man knows this to bee true, for hee knows hee ſinnes willingly, and hee knows hee would not doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, hee daily feeleth Gods Spirit haling him to good, and telling him he ought to live thus and thus, and yet he is loath and will not, he inclines the other way, and rather would do as he does, then as he knows God would have him: what is this but contempt? and indeed this is the great ſin of this Land, the contempt of the Goſpel, people count it not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but a tedious thing. Never merry world (ſayes ſome) ſince we had ſo much Preaching: as if the Sun ſhone too bright; like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who ſtumbled at the plenty of Manna: Nay, they are akin to the Devils, who asked Chriſt if hee were come to torment them; they account the Goſpel a torment, becauſe it croſſeth their luſts, and lets in ſo much light. Theſe can ſpend dayes and nights in vanity, but an houre at a Sermon is tedious, if they had any delight in the Word, they would not care though their Miniſter ſtood ſomewhat long. Though <hi>Zachary</hi> ſtayed long in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet the people waited for him till hee came out, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 21. they marvelled indeed he ſtayed ſo long; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God notes, that they waited for him. But our people ſit upon thornes at a Sermon, but they can lye ſoaking at an ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench as though they ſate upon ſoft cuſhions. The Onions
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42059:86"/>
of <hi>Egipt</hi> have a better taſte with them, than the Quailes of the Wilderneſſe. They had rather live at the Hogs-trough, than in their Fathers houſe. With the <hi>Gadarens</hi> they parfer their Pigges before our Saviour Chriſt. O ſay they, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live by Sermons; Sermons are too holy and ſtrait for them. Bid them take up Chriſts yoake, they care not for it except it were wider. The Miniſtery hath no ſucceſſe at all with them unto any purpoſe. What a thing is this Brethren! Whence is it that wee regard the Goſpel no more? The ſooth is, people know not their damned eſtate, neither will they beleeve it, though we tell them; nay, they care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they hear it or no. But if they knew the goodneſſe of it, they would run from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> for it, if drunkards, and worldlings, and ſuch rabble, knew their fearfull eſtate, the Miniſter ſhould be as welcome to them, as bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, or a pardon to a Theif; So that yee ſee this condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them deeply, that the Word hath no ſucceſſe with. Thus yee ſee the Miniſters of Chriſt have all ſucceſſe from Chriſt, if any one ſoule come in at their teaching, it is an evident ſigne, it is of Jeſus Chriſt; for otherwiſe people hold off, ſome hold off altogether, others yeeld a little way, but will not yeeld full out; if a man yeeld to us indeed, it is meerly by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew you, that as a Miniſter hath all his good ſucceſſe of his labours from Jeſus Chriſt. So if he be a true Miniſter of Chriſt, Chriſt uſes to give him good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. When Chriſt put <hi>Peter</hi> into the Miniſtery. <hi>He told him from hence forth thou ſhalt catch men.</hi> Luk. 5. 10. That is, as I have made thee a Miniſter, So thou ſhalt have good ſucceſſe. They ſhall have ſome good ſucceſſe, as we ſee in the ſence though three parts fell into hard ground, yet ſome fell into good ground, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 8. Nay, though Chriſts Miniſters come into the moſt Deſperate places that can be, as we read in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, notwithſtanding the places they went to, were deepely rooted in Idolatry and full of perſecuting
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42059:86"/>
Jewes, and they were ready to be ſtoned to death, the people were ſo madde againſt their Doctrine; yet they never Preached any where, but they had good ſucceſſe with ſome. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> the text notes, <hi>ſome of them beleeved, and joyned in Company with him.</hi> Act. 17. 4. When he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> though ſome mocked, and ſome hung in ſuſpence, like <hi>Neuters,</hi> that were neither fiſh, nor fleſh, <hi>howbeit certaine men clave unto</hi> Paul, <hi>and beleeved</hi> Act. 17. 34. So when he came to <hi>Rome.</hi> Though ſome ſtood out, yet ſome were perſwaded, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 24. Yea when <hi>Philip</hi> came to <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> though it was a Towne, that was bewitcht, full of ſorcery and witchcraft, and they had even given their ſoules to the Devill. A Miniſter could hardly come into a worſe Towne, yet the people gave heed to thoſe things that he ſpake. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 6. Nay, the context ſhewes he had marveilous good ſucceſſe, the Lord maketh that precious account of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell, that he never beſtowes it upon any place, where he hath not ſome elect; other bleſſings God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows more promiſcuouſly, Reprobates have as great plenty as others. All things come a like to all. But this bleſſing he gives to no place, where he hath not ſome to ſave. Either ſome in the Towne, or ſome there abouts.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, firſt, Here we are to enquire then what<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> may be the reaſon that Chriſts Miniſters have ſo little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe now adayes. Firſt, Some Miniſters have the leſſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe by rayſing up of others that have greater. As <hi>Calvin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Luther. Luther</hi> had admirable ſucceſſe for a time, and then when <hi>Calvin</hi> came, he did increaſe, and <hi>Luther</hi> did decreaſe. So <hi>John</hi> obſerved of himſelfe, he had admirable ſucceſſe for a time, but when Chriſt came, <hi>John</hi> had the leſſe. <hi>He muſt increaſe but I muſt decreaſe. Joh.</hi> 3. 30. Againe, it may be peoples unthankfulneſſe, for the Miniſtry of the Word. When people have had the Word along time, and yet they will not obey it, may be God ſayes to them as he did to the Fig-tree, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee more,</hi> while the world
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42059:87"/>
ſtandeth. Then God ſends <hi>Eſay</hi> to make the heart of the people fat. Then <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> errands moſt an end to plucke up and to pull downe. Then <hi>John</hi> is to ſay, He that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill. Then <hi>Hoſea</hi> cryes, <hi>Ephraim is joyned unto Idols; let him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some Miniſters may be have the leſſe ſucceſſe, for their owne fault in not ſpeading of the net, when their preaching is little better then reading. True, it may be a man may be converted by reading, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes he was. And <hi>John Huſſe</hi> by reading <hi>Wiclefes</hi> bookes. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſayes he was converted by reading the 13. of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the 14. verſ. There is a Bleſſing that may be looked for by reading. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that readeth</hi> Rev. 1. 3. But this is very rare. There may a fiſh or two hang on the net, being let downe on a heape, but that is a chance. No, no, it is not the net lapped up together that bringeth in the draught, but hayled out at length and ſpread all abroad, this cloſeth in the fiſh. So it is the ſpreading of the Word, the ſtretching of it out upon every ſoule preſent, this is the way to catch ſome: When a Miniſter labours to hit all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſome Miniſters may be unſucceſſefull for not preaching roughly enough. Beloved our times are knotty times. Rough hewing is needful. Now people had need heare of hell and damnation, and wrath and vengeance, againſt their ſins, <hi>Some ſave with feare,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>plucking them out of the fire,</hi> Jude 23.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Again, May bee a Miniſters ſucceſſe is not ſeen, may be he is ſucceſſefull, though he ſhall not live to ſee it, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>One ſowes and another reaps,</hi> Joh. 4. 37. as the Prophets ſowed, and the Apoſtles reapt: So, Beloved, we may ſow now, and thoſe that come after us, may bee they ſhall be the reapers. The preſent age, now may ſow ſeed for the ſucceeding. <hi>Arbores ſerit, quae alteri proſuit saeculo.</hi> As the <hi>Chinah</hi> make their diſhes: the Fathers lay them into the fire, and the third generation after takes them out. Though
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42059:87"/>
we doe not ſee our ſeeds to come up; may be we meet with no harveſt, this may be our comfort, if we can but ſow, for others afterwards to reap. Let us have a care of ſowing, many a man that now hears the word, and now is brought up under a good teaching Miniſtery, though yet he doe not obey it, who knows what God will doe? may be God may caſt him into ſome horrible affliction yet before he dyes, and ſling terrour into his Soule, and then what we have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red may doe him good: And therefore we ſhould never lin ſowing, though wee never ſee the Harveſt: this ſhould bee our comfort, that the ground hath the ſeed. Let us ſtill powre in good examples into our people; Parents into their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Maſters into their ſervants, Miniſters into their hearers, let God alone with it, when, and what, and where the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſhall bee.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Some Miniſters are not godly, and then how can they looke for good ſucceſſe? as God ſayes, <hi>If they had ſtood in my Counſell, and cauſed my people to heare my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evill way,</hi> Jer. 23. 22. I dare not ſay abſolutely, that a carnall Miniſter ſhall never have good ſucceſſe in his Miniſtery. As if a Miniſter ſhould conclude hee were a good man, becauſe God hath bleſſed his labours; No, that is not a good argument: for,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is the Word that converts, and not the perſon of the ſpeaker, I dare not tye God to the goodneſſe of any mans perſon. God, as he is a Creator he is a wiſe God, and can write well with a bad pen, and cut well with a blunt naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty knife.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such may bee ſent of God, and gifted for the Miniſtery, and therefore for all that I know, they may bee an Organ of converſion ſometimes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced that Chriſt was preached by the falſe Apoſtles, <hi>though it were but of envy,</hi> Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18. you will ſay, how could he rejoyce in that? that was a wicked manner of Preaching. Why ſurely hee could not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42059:88"/>
rejoyce in it, but that hee did think that it might doe ſome good.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This may bee thus, or elſe, no man can be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his ſalvation: For, if a carnall Miniſter cannot be the meanes of converſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They may ſay at laſt day, <hi>Lord, Lord, wee have Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have we caſt out devils, and yet Chriſt will ſay unto them, I know you not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Why elſe does our Saviour Chriſt bid people heare the Scribes and Phariſees, but that he implies, they may be a meanes of good to them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Judas</hi> was ſent out to Preach, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 4. Chriſt ſaid to him as well as the reſt, <hi>When yee goe Preach, ſaying, the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand,</hi> ver. 7.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Experience hath found this to bee true; ſome godly ſoules have confeſſed this very thing, that ſuch as now they ſee to be palpably carnall, have been the means of their converſion, &amp;c. Many helpt <hi>Noah</hi> to build his Arke that periſhed in the waters. God may make the crowing of a Cock, to be a meanes of a wakning <hi>Peters</hi> Conſcience. The temptations of the Devill, to be the means of <hi>Luthers</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and therefore, I doe not ſimply affirm that carnall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters cannot convert. But this I ſay, it is a very rare thing, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>If the blinde lead the blinde, both ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch,</hi> Matth. 15. 14. So, if a Hypocrite lead a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, the Drunkard lead the drunkard, &amp;c. It is a woe to a Pariſh, when their Miniſters are not godly: <hi>Woe to the City ſayes God,</hi> Zeph. 3. 1. why ſo? <hi>Her Prophets are light per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> ver. 4. Woe to ſuch Townes whoſe Miniſters will goe to the Alehouſe, whoſe Miniſters will keep company, and bee haile fellow with every vain fellow, whoſe Miniſters will embrace this preſent world, whoſe Miniſters are proud, and envious, and malicious, that give a bad example to the people, that depend upon their charge. Woe to them, ſayes God. The curſe of God is upon ſuch Pariſhes. God hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42059:88"/>
hardly any intention to ſave ſuch peoples ſoules. Or, if he have any of his Elect there, God will ſave them ſome other way; as God told the naughty Shepheards. <hi>I, even I will ſearch out my ſheep and ſeek them out,</hi> Ezek. 34. 11. that is, I will ſearch them out ſome other way, I will not do it by you. and therefore when he hath a minde to ſave a poore people, he ſends good Miniſters among them, or them to good ones. <hi>Turn o backſliding children,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will give you Paſtors according to my heart,</hi> Jer. 3. 14. &amp;c. God would have none but wiſe-hearted men to work in his manuall Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 10. how then doe we think he will let fooles, as all carnall Miniſters are? &amp;c. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, it was a part of the hope that he had in the preſence of Chriſt, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that God had made him the inſtrument of gaining ſoules to his Kingdome. <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing, are not even you in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his comming?</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 19. and hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſuch as convert ſoules; ſo runs the Promiſe, <hi>They that turn others to righteouſneſſe, ſhall ſhine as the ſtars,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. indeed this is but a ſecondary evidence of Salvation, &amp;c. O, Beloved, if we could convert any of your Soules, what a comfort would it be? whereas, if a man be a wicked man, what hope can he have that God will bleſſe his labors? nay, he hath ſaid expreſſely, that if a man will not obey the voyce of the Lord: <hi>curſed ſhall he be in the field, and in the houſe,</hi> and ſo in the Pulpit, in his ſtudies, he cannot look for Gods aſſiſtance, as God told the wicked Prieſts: <hi>I will curſe all your bleſsings, if ye will not lay it to heart,</hi> Mal. 2. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Vſe is, does Chriſt uſe to bleſſe and<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> proſper his true Miniſters? then let us labour to get this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him. Let us ſeek to him to give us good ſucceſſe, O how eager is <hi>Paul</hi> every where in prayer to God for good ſucceſſe?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Vſe is, if we have not the ſucceſſe that<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42059:89"/>
we could wiſh, let us not bee diſcouraged; as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayes, <hi>My labour is with the Lord: though</hi> Iſrael <hi>be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious,</hi> Eſa. 49. 4, 5. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man looſeth by an ill crop; I, but if wee bee faithfull, wee ſhall not looſe, though our crop be never ſo ill, if we have plowed well, and ſown well, no matter what the crop bee, wee ſhall have our pay. If I preach and you repent not, it ſhall never repent me of my paines, I will preach ſtill. For though my preaching be not a ſweet ſavour, yet it ſhall bee to God, even in thee, and thou ſhalt ſmart for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not ceaſe working, many a draught the poore fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er man makes and takes nothing, yet hee leaves not off; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time is the net of Preaching ſhot forth, and yet none converted thereby. So it pleaſeth God to exerciſe the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſervants. Yet ſtill the work muſt bee followed, and the Lords leiſure muſt be waited for. Oftentimes the net taketh fiſh, and they ſlip out again; So, there bee many that ſeem to be pulled in by the Goſpell, nevertheleſſe they ſlide away again. Again, there is oftentimes brought in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the net, that which is yet good for nothing when it is got, there comes in frogges, and weeds, and a great deale of traſh, which in the end are caſt away, and yet for love of the fiſh, the fiſherman is content to hale all in that hee can; So, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, wee draw in many hypocrites, many that prove nought, and yet for hope of good fiſh, wee muſt ſtill bee a labouring, and may be wee may have a good Harveſt yet, though yet wee ſee little likeli-hood. <hi>Bee not weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>for mee ſhall reape if wee faint not.</hi> Gal. 6. 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another Vſe is to you, that you doe not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand out, to deprive us of good ſucceſſe. The ſhrewdeſt turn you can doe your poore Miniſters, is to deprive them of the joy of their labours; the way to rejoyce them, is to imbrace the Goſpell they preach, it will bee heavy for you when wee ſhall groane to God, that we could not perſwade
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42059:89"/>
any of you. If thou wilt not now hear that which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thee, thou ſhalt heare one day that which ſhall make thy heart ake. <hi>Goe ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> O, remember <hi>Sodome,</hi> and do not ſtand out againſt the Miniſters that come from Jeſus Chriſt to you.</p>

                  <q>Theſe things, ſaith hee, that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HAving done with the inſcription of this Epiſtle, <hi>To the Church that is in</hi> Sardis <hi>write,</hi> wee came to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, containing the perſon from whom the Epiſtle is ſent. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is here deſcribed from two Royalties of his, Firſt, that he hath <hi>The ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> that we have handled already. Secondly, that he hath <hi>the ſeven Starres,</hi> or the Miniſters of the Church. This we have almoſt finiſhed too; wee ſhewed you that Chriſt is ſaid to have the Miniſters of the Church five wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee hath the ſending of them; they have their Miſſion from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee hath the delegating of them; they have their Commiſſion from him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee hath the gifting of them; they have their gifts and abilities from him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he hath the proſpering or not proſpering of them; they have their ſucceſſe from him.</p>
               <p>All theſe foure I have ſpoken of already. Now remains the fifth and the laſt, hee hath the diſpoſing of them, the placing of them in a Town, the continuing of them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of them, the holding of them up, or the pulling of them down, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Hee hath the key of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>hee openeth and no man ſhutteth, and he ſhutteth and no man openeth,</hi> Rev. 3. 7. that is, he hath all power in the Church,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42059:90"/>
to place it or diſplace it. To ſettle it or to tranſplant it, to preſcribe or not preſcribe, to abſolve or to condemne, to ſave or to deſtroy, to give Miniſters liberty or to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. As Chriſt telles the Miniſter of <hi>Philadelphia, I have ſet before thee an open doore, and no man can ſhut it.</hi> Rev. 3. 8. good Miniſters ſhall have Liberty to preach in their ſtations, as long as he pleaſes, and they never can be hindred, till he is pleaſed ſo to permit it, or appoint it. So when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Epheſus</hi> though he had never ſo many adverſaries there, that would faine hinder him if they could, Yet as long as Chriſt gave him an open doore, to preach and to do good, none of them all could withſtand him. A great doore and effectuall is opened unto me, and there are many adverſaries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 9.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt hath the placing of his Miniſters. As he ſaith to <hi>Ieremiah I have ſet thee.</hi> So Chriſt ſayes to all his true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, I have ſet you. God hath ſet to all men the bounds of their habitations. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. that one man ſhall dwell here; another there, one in this Pariſh, another in that Pariſh. How much more does he appoint unto his Miniſters their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſhall be in the Wilderneſſe of <hi>Judea, Titus</hi> ſhall be in <hi>Creete, Epaphras</hi> ſhall be at <hi>Coloſſe, Epaphroditus</hi> at <hi>Philippi, Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the like. Nay, he is no Miniſter of Chriſt that is not of Chriſts pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. As the Apoſtle ſpeakes. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves and to all the flocke, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers. Act.</hi> 20. 28. Over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers. He is a true Miniſter to this or that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; that can ſay that the Holy Ghoſt hath made me an overſeer to them.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, firſt, Becauſe no man is a Paſtor or a Shepheard to any ſheepe, that did not enter in by the doore into thoſe ſheep. He that entreth in by the doore, is a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the ſheep. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 2. Now who is this doore but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? I am the doore</hi> ſaith he, <hi>By me if any man enter in,</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:42059:90"/>
                  <hi>he ſhall be ſaved.</hi> As it followes there in the ninth verſe. As he is the doore, no man can enter into the Miniſtery rightly but by him. He muſt have his Letters of Orders from him. So he is the doore into any flocke, and if a man have not inſtitution and induction from him, he is no Shepheard of the flocke. Nay, Chriſt tells him flatly, <hi>he is a theefe and robber, and a hyreling.</hi> When the <hi>Danites</hi> askt the <hi>Levite</hi> in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who brought thee hither? What makeſt thou in this place? <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 3. ye know he put himſelfe there, he ſought for the place himſelfe, and it was maintenance that brought him thither. His owne conſcience told him he was a Hyreling. He could not ſay, the Lord brought me hither. He came not in by the doore; Now every true Miniſter comes in by the doore into a Pariſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes in by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No Miniſter can be placed in any Pariſh, but by the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe. Now Beloved, who ever be Chriſts ſubſtitute, Chriſt is the maine Biſhop of every Dioceſſe, Chriſt is the Shepheard and Biſhop of our foules, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. Indeed there be other Biſhops under him, other Shepheards under him, I but he is the great Shepheard of the ſheepe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. the Arch Shepheard. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. The chiefe Shepheard. When the chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſhall appeare. Well if he be the chiefe Shepheard, it is fit that he ſhould inſtitute and induct into Paſtorall charges. Its fit that his word ſhould be followed, in every ones comming into a living, to go no where, but where his word doth allow. To take no care of Soules, but of ſuch as he commits to our cuſtody. All true Miniſters are his Curats, and therefore if they be not of his placing, they came not in right.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be he that muſt pay them their wages, then reaſon good, that he ſhould ſet them on worke. If a man thruſt himſelf into a Pariſh, it was not Chriſt that moved him to come there, but forſooth he wanted a Living, he would
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42059:91"/>
faine have maintenance, there is ſo much <hi>Per annum,</hi> this was his motive, Chriſt never moved him, this man can look for no wages from Jeſus Chriſt. When he hath gathered in his Tithes or his quarteridge, Chriſt will tell him as he told the fooliſh <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Ye have the record. He that ſet you on work, he wil pay your wages. I never ſet you on work, and therefore ye can look for nothing at my hands. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if Chriſt muſt pay a man his wages, good Reaſon that he ſhould have the putting of a man into this or that Vineyard. He called in the Labourers and payd them their wages that gave them their taske. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 20. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How can they looke for his aſſiſtance and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, if they be not placed by him? when the Lord had placed <hi>Jeremiah</hi> a Prophet in <hi>Judah,</hi> the Lord undertooke to aſſiſt him. <hi>I have made thee this day a defenced City and an iron Pillar, and Brazen walles, I will be with thee</hi> Jere. 1. 18, 19. A Miniſter hath need of Chriſts aſſiſtance, where e're he is, his Preaching elſe will doe little good, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons will be of no effect, Chriſts aſſiſtance and Bleſſing is all in all. <hi>Moſes</hi> prayes for <hi>Levi,</hi> Bleſſe Lord his ſubſtance, and accept the worke of his hands. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 11. No man hath more need of Chriſts bleſſing to go along with him then a Miniſter. Now when a Miniſter is not there where Chriſt would have him to be, How can hee expect that Chriſts bleſſing ſhould be with him? if he can ſay, Chriſt would have me here, Chriſt hath placed me here, then he may looke for Chriſts being with him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, what peace of Conſcience can they have, when they lye on their death-beds, except they can comfortably ſay, Lord thou didſt place me in this Pariſh, Lord I came in by the doore, and by no other way. It was not by-ends, nor filthy lucre, nor gaine, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſayes, I did not thruſt in my ſelfe to be a Paſtor, Lord thou madeſt me a Miniſter to this Congregation, I have faithfully tended thoſe Soules, that thou gaveſt me to feed, this is a ſweet thing. Ye know
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42059:91"/>
people are apt to ſay, who ſent for you, who made you our Miniſter? we will not acknowledge you to be our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. As <hi>Shemaiah</hi> ſaid of good <hi>Jeremiah; Thou haſt made thy ſelf a Prophet to this people,</hi> Jer. 29. 27. Now if <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had not his own Conſcience to prove his Inſtitution from God, what a taking had he beene in?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And laſtly, what comfort elſe can the people of God have to live under ſuch a mans Miniſtery, unleſſe they can ſay, this is my Miniſter, ſet over me in the Lord! This is ſo needfull, that without it, he were as good have no Miniſter at all. As the Apoſtle tells the good people of <hi>Coloſſe, Epaphras is for you a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 1. 7. This is their comfort indeed, when they can truely affirme that this man is for us a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt. This Miniſter is our Miniſter in Chriſt. This is the ground of their Conſciences, ſubmitting to his Miniſtery, and of their receiving of him, as an Embaſſador from Chriſt unto them. Now when a man is not placed by Chriſt in a Pariſh as their Miniſter, what joy can they have to heare him? What hope that God will ſanctifie his labours among them?</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, firſt; For us that are Miniſters, that we<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> looke we be of Chriſts placing, that we may be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to our people, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinths, Though I be not an Apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſſe I am an Apoſtle unto you. So that we may be able to conclude to our people,</hi> doubtleſſe I am Chriſts Miniſter unto you. As our Saviour Chriſt ſayes. Who is the faithfull wiſe Shepheard, <hi>Whom his Lord ſhall make Ruler over his houſhold?</hi> Luk. 12. 42. Hath the Lord made us Rulers over his houſhold? We are all ſhepheards in ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes. But did the Lord put us there? We are Spirituall Rulers over ſuch and ſuch houſholds of God, but did the Lord make us Rulers over them? otherwiſe we are not Starres in his hands; No, We are blazing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets out of his Orb, if we be Starres in his hands, wee can prove our placing from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:42059:92"/>Secondly, This ſerves to condemne them that are theeves<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> and intruders into Gods Heritage, that never came in by the doore, but by ſome other way, that are hirelings and will leave the ſheep, for their own advantage; Gain makes them take livings, gain makes them chop and change, that never went to Chriſt for his approbation, it is ſaid of the Apoſtles that the <hi>Rulers and Elders perceived that they had been with Jeſus,</hi> Act. 4. 13. Thoſe are Miniſters of Pariſhes indeed, that have been with Jeſus, But theſe men, no man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ever they have been with Jeſus Chriſt, that ever they had any allowance from him, and yet they will bee crowding in into Livings. But I let this paſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hath Chriſt the placing of Miniſters? then this<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> is of uſe unto you, that have Miniſters of Chriſts placing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you. Take heed how ye carry your ſelves under your Miniſtery. If you doe not obey their Doctrine, you ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt. O reject not their reproofes, put not off the Word of God in their mouthes, if ye doe, ye doe not put off men but God. It was an excellent exhortation of that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, <hi>Jehoſaphat: Heare me, O yee inhabitants of Judah and Jeruſalem, beleeve the Lords Prophets and ye ſhall proſper,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 20. O, if Kings and Princes would do ſo now, call upon people up and down, O Sirs, beleeve the Lords Prophets and ye ſhall proſper: Ye that have Gods Miniſters among you, beleeve them, may bee when they threaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all your ſinfull courſes, they tell you of hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and heaven and ſalvation, ye hardly beleeve any ſuch thing: O beleeve them, that it may goe well with you. Remember they be of Chriſts placing among you. He put them into your Pulpits, he gives them the Themes that they preach to you from day to day. Beleeve them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hath Chriſt the placing of Miniſters? then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> complain of graceleſſe Miniſters; O, ye have graceleſſe Miniſters, and our Miniſter is not as he ſhould be, he is not a good liver, he does not preach to the Conſcience. People
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42059:92"/>
are apt to complaine of Patrons, and ſuch and ſuch cauſes, but let mee tell you, you murmure againſt Jeſus Chriſt, every Pariſh in <hi>England</hi> might have a good and a godly Miniſter, a Miniſter after Gods own heart, for all that I know, if they would goe to Jeſus Chriſt, he hath the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Now what is the reaſon that there are no more able worthy Miniſters every where?</p>
               <p>Anſwer, Surely if Chriſt were ſought to, this would quickly be holpen, when <hi>Judah</hi> had no Miniſters in the Captivity, their ſoules ſtarved for want of good feeding, thouſands periſht, and their ſoules were quite loſt for lack of Viſion. What ſayes Chriſt to them. <hi>Turn ye back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for</hi> I <hi>am marryed unto you, and</hi> I <hi>will take you one of a city, and two of a Family, and</hi> I <hi>will bring you to</hi> Zion. <hi>And</hi> I <hi>will give you Paſtours accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding,</hi> Jer. 3. 14, 15. people are ſubject to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and this is long of ſuch and ſuch, that wee have no better Miniſters, whereas the Truth is, it is long of our ſelves, iniquity abounds every where, the love of many waxes cold, people grow weary of wholſome Doctrine, they have itching eares, they are full fed, any Miniſtery is good enough for them, if a man propheſie of Wine and ſtrong drink, hee ſhall even bee the Prophet of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. 11. that is, any Prophet is good enough for them, fitter than a better. One that would ſhew peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple how to get Bread and Drink, and Wine, and profits, and pleaſures; People would rather hear ſuch a one preach, than to hear of Repentance and Mortification; and Faith, and Holineſſe, and the wayes of God, they care not for theſe things. The true Preaching of the Word, is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the diſpoſition of men as can be. Nothing is more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42059:93"/>
irkſome unto them, as the Word rightly taught. It goes againſt their luſts, it croſſes their wicked wills. They are weary of it, they ſay unto God depart from us, they will not let Chriſt reigne in their hearts, therefore we may rather wonder that there is any good Miniſter in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome any where, wee are to bleſſe God, and pray for our Governours, that wee have any good Miniſters at all, the truth is wee deſerve not any. There is ſo little Religion every where, ſo much hypocriſie, ſo much profeſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any power of godlineſſe, ſuch a deale of vanity, and unſoundneſſe, and hollow-heartedneſſe; nay, among ſuch as have gone for good Chriſtians, ſo much falſehood and rottenneſſe, and apoſtacy, to what end ſhould Chriſt let us have any more Preaching. Wee give the world occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to think, that Preaching is the cauſe of all this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. What a diſhonour is this to Jeſus Chriſt? and therefore no marvaile we have no more, wee may admire the patience of God that wee have any.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Hath Chriſt the placing of Miniſters? then<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> ſee whether to goe for good Miniſters. Chriſt is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Patron of all Livings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee can preſent whom hee will to a Pariſh, and therefore we ſhould pray unto him. When our Saviour Chriſt preached here and there, and ſaw how the people came out of all Pariſhes to him, it ſeems, though they had Levites in their own Synagogues, yet they did not know how to feed their flocks; they were as ſheep for all them without a ſhepheard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ere a good Miniſter among them all. Mark, what the Text sayes. <hi>Jeſus had compaſsion on them, becauſe they were ſcattered abroad as ſheep having no ſhepheard:</hi> O ſayes he, <hi>Pray yee therefore the Lord of the Harveſt that he would ſend forth labourers into his harveſt,</hi> Mat. 9. 38. ſo much for the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42059:93"/>Secondly, Now as Chriſt hath the placing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo hee hath the continuing of them, as long as hee pleaſes. Hee continued the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry during the Reigne of foure Kings. Hee kept the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea</hi> in his function, during the reign of five Kings, though the times were very bad. When it was told Chriſt that <hi>Herod</hi> ſought his life, that hee would not onely put him beſides his Miniſtery, but alſo his very life; ſayes he, <hi>Goe tell that Fox, Behold I caſt out Devils, and I doe cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I ſhall bee perfect,</hi> Luk. 13. 32. Chriſt had his time appointed him by his Father himſelf, and hee would Preach all that time out, and all the devills in hell, and all his Enemies on earth ſhould not hinder him. So, Beloved, it is with all his Miniſters, hee hath ſet them a time, and hee hath power to continue them all that time. I ſhall preach to day, and to morrow, and ſuch a day, doe the world what they can, they cannot hinder his miniſters from preaching, till Chriſt pleaſe, as hee told his people: Though the Lord give you the bread of adverſity, and the water of affliction, yet ſhall not thy Teachers bee removed into a corner any more: <hi>But thine eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers.</hi> Eſa. 30. 20. <hi>q. d.</hi> though thy Miniſters have been put by, yet I will reſtore them againe, and they ſhall not be put by any more. I have power to continue them as long as I will; when he called <hi>Noah</hi> to preach to the old world, he appointed him 120. years, and hee continued him all that while, whether the wicked world would or no.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſon is, firſt, becauſe Miniſters are his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. Now a King it is in his choyce, how long his Embaſſadors ſhall lye Lieger in a forain Country, he hath ſo many buſineſſes for them to doe, and ſo long they ſhall continue there. So, true miniſters are the Embaſſadors
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42059:94"/>
of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, wee pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. we are Chriſts Ambaſſadours, and therfore he will continue us as long as he liſt; as long as he hath any buſines to doe; as long as he hath any ſoules to ſave, any men or women to reconcile to his father, or to build up, ſo long he will continue us. Its a dolefull ſigne when Chriſt takes away his Miniſters from a place, its a ſigne he hath no more ſoules to ſave; if he had, he would let his Ambaſſadours lye beſeeching ſtill: ſo that this is one great reaſon, becauſe, Miniſters are His Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe Chriſt hath all power in Heaven and in Earth, as he told his Apoſtles, when he ſent them out to preach, <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth, Math.</hi> 28. 18, <hi>q. d.</hi> I have power to ſend you, and I have power to continue your Miniſtery as long as I thinke fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and I have power to take you away, I have power to ordaine you either for ſalvation or the damnation of men. Whom I will I can convert by your Sermons, and whom I will I can deliver up to the counſell of their own hearts, that they ſhall not be converted by you. Now: if Chriſt have all power in Heaven and in Earth, then he hath power to continue his Miniſters as long as his will is. I need not ſtand to prove this, it is too evident: he hath power to lengthen his Miniſters lives, to prolong their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, when he takes away one, he hath power to put in another as good: when he meant to take away <hi>Elias,</hi> he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted <hi>Eliſha</hi> in his roome. If their enemies be never ſo many, he can tye up their hands; he deliverd <hi>Paul</hi> from the mouth of the Lyon: though fortie men had vowed to take him away by death, he diverted their plot, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42059:94"/>
him ſtill: nay, when he was in Bonds, yet he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get him liberty to go abroad with his keeper, and to preach the Kingdom of God to as many as came. Suppoſe the world be never ſo mad againſt Chriſts Miniſters, yet as long as he hath any more worke for them to doe, he can hold off their ſingers from meddling with them, till they have finiſhed the Taske that hee hath given them to doe.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is; firſt, That Miniſters ſhould not fear<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> to bee deprived of their liberty, ſo long as they doe well; indeed if they doe ill, if they bee wicked or idle, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, ſuch Miniſters ſhould fear they doe deſerve to be put down. But if wee bee godly Miniſters, it is our baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to feare any ſuch thing. Chriſt hath the continuing of us, our times are not in mens hands, but in his. What a horrible thing is it, that wee ſhould goe againſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in any thing, or bee afraid to ſpeak what God bids us, to bee mealemouthed, to bee diſcouraged with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or dangers, wee ſhould keep nothing back of the whole counſell of God, wee are ſtarres in his hands, and hee hath the continuing of us; though men fight againſt us, they cannot prevaile againſt us, till our buſineſſe is all done. As the Lord told the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah: They ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not prevaile againſt thee, for I am with thee,</hi> Jer. 1. 19. Let us then be afraid of nothing but ſinne. Let us bee afraid to doe any evill, either towards God or towards man; let us be harmleſſe in the midſt of a crooked, and a perverſe generation. Let us deale faithfully with our people, let us undauntedly Preach, Rebuke, Exhort, with all long ſuffering and Doctrine, make our faces hard againſt the wickeds faces, no matter for their railings, their threatning ſpeeches, their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42059:95"/>
malicious accuſations, and not feare, the Lord Jeſus hath the continuing of us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here we may ſee the reaſon why the Goſpel<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> continues in any place, a man would wonder it ſhould continue any where, becauſe the world cannot abide it. Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted? ſaves <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. 52. They that doe evill, hate the light, it cuts them to the heart; Every one hates mee, ſayes the Prophet, hee was reproached for the Words ſake. Report, ſay they, and wee will report it. One time they put him into a dungeon; Another time they would have killed him. <hi>Shemaiah</hi> writ Letters to the high Prieſt againſt him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 25. And yet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Miniſtery, untill the day of the Captivity. Nay, hee had liberty, when others had their liberty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Yee know Chriſt himſelf Preached dayly in the Temple, and they took him not, though they gnaſht their teeth at his Doctrine, and ſometimes were in the minde to throw him down headlong and break his neck, ſometimes to ſtone him; yet till his houre was come, he had his liberty.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, a man would wonder how any of Gods Miniſters have their Liberties continued; when there bee ſo many Drunkards, ſo many Enemies of all goodneſſe, ſo many that follow their own ungodly luſts, and the Goſpel is an eye-ſore unto them, and yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places it ſtands ſtill. This is Gods doing. You ſee here Chriſt hath the continuing of his Miniſters; they ſhall have their liberty, as long as God hath any uſe for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Is it ſo, that Chriſt hath the continuing of<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:42059:95"/>
his Miniſters? then this is of uſe alſo unto you; Now you heare whence to have your good Miniſters continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even by ſeeking to Jeſus Chriſt, hee can lay a charge upon all the world where they are, to let them alone. He can ſay, <hi>Doe my Prophets no harme,</hi> Pſal. 105. 15. you will ſay, why? what ſhall we doe?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer; firſt, let us repent of our ſinnes, it is our ſins that removes the Miniſters of God, if we would repent us of our ſins, and turn from our wicked wayes, and let the Word work upon our hearts, this would continue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word, as God told <hi>Judah,</hi> when they ſhould repent of their ſins, O ſayes hee, <hi>I will bee your God, and you ſhall be my people, and my Sanctuary ſhall be among you for evermore,</hi> Ezek. 27. 27, 28. that is, by Sanctuary he meanes his publique Worſhip, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, and other of the meanes of grace, when they repented of their ſins, then theſe ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So, Beloved, if yee would repent of your ſins, I do not mean one or two, or a few, or ſo; But if there might be a generall Reformation among us, this would faſten the Word among us, as in a ſure place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us prize the Goſpell, the Goſpell loves to ſtay there where it is welcome: it will never goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if it might have good entertainment, if wee would honour it, and glorifie it, and pluck up our affections, in the deareſt manner to it, this would preſerve it among us for ever. The Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that uſed the Word beſt, had it longeſt, &amp;c. Our Saviour Chriſt hath a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Into what ſoever Towne or City yee enter, enquire who is worthy, there abide, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 11. And as hee ſayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 7. Goe not from houſe to houſe. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell does not love to change houſes till it be urged; ſo it does not love to change Townes, if it may have good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42059:96"/>
So, Beloved, if wee would give the Goſpell good uſage, the Lord would continue it; like a Gueſt that is the willinger to ſtay when he ſees he is among Friends.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let us bring forth the fruits of it. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman will ever continue ploughing of his ground, as long as hee ſees it will give him a good crop. But when hee perceives it will not quit charges, then hee layes it Fallow. So Chriſt would have ſtayed his word ſtill in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if they would have brought forth competent fruite. But when once they grew barren, hee ſaid hee would take his Kingdome away. <hi>The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken away from you, and given to a Nation that will bring forth the fruites thereof,</hi> Matth. 21. 43.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let us bee earneſt with God, to have his Goſpell continue. Importunity may doe much: Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity held Chriſt a night longer with the Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 29. Importunity held the Levite three or foure dayes longer then otherwiſe hee would, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6, 7. O If wee would bee importunate with Chriſt to ſtay his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſtill; as <hi>Jacob</hi> did the Angell, <hi>Thou ſhalt not goe till thou bleſſe mee,</hi> Lord thy Goſpell ſhall not goe till it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me; and it ſhall not goe till it convert mee, and it ſhall convert mee firſt; if every one would hang upon Chriſt, to ſtay his Goſpell ſtill, and thou ſhalt not let it goe till it hath done my ſoule good, till it hath illightned mine eyes, and quickned my heart, this would obtaine much; may bee ſome doe doe thus! as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did: <hi>O thou hope of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou bee as a ſtranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring man, that turneth aſide to ſtay for a night,</hi> Jer. 14. 8. Alas! that would not doe, if there had been many <hi>Jeremiah's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to doe thus, then they might have gotten him to ſtay longer. So, may bee ſome doe cry importunately thus, <hi>O thou hope of Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42059:96"/>
ſo I fall upon the third thing: ye have heard; firſt, how Chriſt hath the placing of his Miniſters; ſecondly, he hath the continuing of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Now it followes, hee hath the removing of them too. People are prone to look upon ſecond cauſes, But Chriſt is the ſupreame, hee is the principall cauſe of this judgement upon men, to take away his Miniſters, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The Lord of Hoaſts doth take away from</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and from</hi> Judah, <hi>the mighty man, and the Judge, and the Prophet,</hi> Eſa. 3. 1, 2. Whether it bee by death, or removeall, or impriſonment, or ſuſpending, or any other way: It is he that deprives a people of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters, whoſoever be the inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He can take them away by death out of the world, Thus the Lord took away the Prophet <hi>Enoch, Geneſis</hi> 5. 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He can take them away by removeall, thus he took away <hi>Jonas</hi> from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſent him to <hi>Niniveh, Jon.</hi> 3. 1. Ye know he was a Prophet in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Lord removed him thence to the Land of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He can take them away by letting them bee impriſoned, thus he took away <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Herod</hi> put him into priſon, for telling him of his ſins, <hi>Mark,</hi> 16. 17. So, <hi>Ahab</hi> impriſoned <hi>Michaiah</hi> for telling him the truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hee can take them away by letting them be ſuſpended, and inhibited from Preaching, by letting wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men have their wills, That ſay to the Seers, ſee not, and to the Prophets, propheſie not, Speak to us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 10. Thus King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> ſilenced the Prophet that reproved him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He can take them away by ſilencing them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42059:97"/>
this is as bad as taking them away for the time, thus himſelf ſtopt <hi>Ezikels</hi> mouth, and made him dumb.</p>
               <p>Now the Reaſon why Chriſt does doe thus, is; firſt, becauſe of the wicked, they will not receive their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Thus the Lord Jeſus took away <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. Make haſte, get thee quickly out of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for they will not receive thy teſtimony concerning mee,</hi> Acts 22. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord does it in regard of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe they begin to forſake their firſt love. This was the reaſon why the Lord threatned to take away the Miniſtery of the Word out of <hi>Epheſus, I will remove thy Candleſtick out of its place, except thou repent,</hi> Revelations 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord does this ſometimes in regard of the Miniſtery it ſelf, that it may be more precious afterwards, as it is ſaid there in <hi>Samuel,</hi> when the Lord had deprived <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his Prophets, for a matter of foureſcore yeares together, O ſayes the Text, <hi>The Word of God was preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thoſe dayes, becauſe there was no open Viſion,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is, firſt, Is it ſo, that it is Chriſt that<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> removes Miniſters? then this ſhould teach us to mourn before him, if ever any of our Miniſters bee taken away by any meanes, wee ſhould ſee whoſe hand is upon us, the hand of the Lord is gone out againſt us, it is hee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth this judgement, and therefore wee ſhould mourn unto him, as the Church did. When all their Prophets were gone, and all Religion went to wrack, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had burnt up their Synagogues, and broken up all their godly Aſſemblies: O how they mourned unto God for it. <hi>O God, why haſt thou caſt us off? Why does thine anger ſmoak againſt the ſheepe of thy paſture? Remember</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42059:97"/>
                  <hi>thy Congregation, which thou haſt purchaſed of old. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mount</hi> Zion, <hi>wherein thou haſt dwelt,</hi> Pſal. 74. 1, 2. this was a heavy judgement indeed, they felt the Lords anger ſmoake againſt them then. Why? What was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? <hi>Wee ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Prophet,</hi> Ver. 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Uſe is, Let us look into the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> cauſe, which is nothing but our ſins. If Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters be put down at any time, it is our ſins that put them down. For if Chriſt be the inflicting cauſe, certainly our ſins are the deſerving cauſe; wee can blame none but our own ſins, if any thing ſtop any good Miniſters mouth, it is they, it is peoples drunkenneſſe, and diſorder, you are the cauſe, your unfruitfulneſſe, and ſecurity, and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and formality, you doe not learn goodneſſe and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under the Word, yee remaine vaine and blinde, and hardned in your hearts under the ſame. What Pariſhes more diſorderly, than thoſe where moſt preaching is, where is more hatred of word, and vertue, and piety then there? where is more railing at a good life, and holy walking, and ſuch as deſire to doe well? the more preaching people hear, for the moſt part, the worſe they grow. People come to Church it may bee, but they make it a cloake for their villanies, they will give us the hearing, but no obedience, no practiſe, no Reformation, no ſigne of amendment, no love, no truth, no faithfulneſſe, no communion at all, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneare, where moſt Preaching is! if any thing ſtop our mouthes, this will doe it. And indeed what may men think of us, but that wee are a company of hypocrites, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of vanities; what are theſe Preachers, wee ſee little good they doe, what becomes of all their Preaching, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and odde opinions, in one Towne, and diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and all manner of licenſiouſneſſe in another. If the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42059:98"/>
whole world ſhould let us alone, I verily feare God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would put us down immediately, in the end. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcandals, ſo many thouſand offences are given every day, that its a wonder wee ſtand as we doe. That the Lord of heaven lets any Miniſter in <hi>England,</hi> come into a Pulpit more; nothing but pride, and ſelf-conceits, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtings, and feared conſciences, dead hearts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe; unleſſe it be a very little handfull; O Beloved, if where preaching is, it were honoured as it ought to bee, and obeyed as it ſhould, if people would doe as we teach, I dare be bold to affirme wee might Preach long enough. If our Townes would ſweetly reforme, ſet up good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, root out all diſorders and curſed abuſes, live like Chriſtians indeed, be humble, and ſober, and loving, and dutifull to God and Man; Giving to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and to God the things that are Gods. If we would feare God, and honour the King: Reverence Gods Courts, obey the voyce of his ſervants, love Chriſt and his word, above our appointed food, this would leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Miniſtery of the Land, this would bee a meanes for the eſtabliſhing of Gods Kingdome among us, Chriſt would never repent that ever hee ſent his Goſpell unto us, where wee have ſome, wee ſhould have more, where we have more, wee ſhould have a hundred times more, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>Who is he that will harme you, if yee be followers of that which is good,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Uſe is, is it Chriſt that takes away<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Miniſters, either by death, or reſtraining, or by any other way? Then let it bee a meanes to exhort us to repent of our ſinnes, that Chriſt may ſtill give a doore of utterance to his Miniſters, that they may ſtill ſpeak in his name. This ſhould move us to ſeek God. When <hi>Peter</hi> was caſt into
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42059:98"/>
priſon. O what faſting, and crying, and praying was there to God for him, till hee was reſtored again, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 5. they did not goe to <hi>Herod</hi> to reſtore him; No, they knew Chriſt was hee that tooke him from the Church, whoever were the inſtrument, therefore they ſought to Heaven for him again, if any peoples Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery bee gone, this is the beſt way to fetch them again. <hi>Paul</hi> knew this to bee true, and therefore when hee was in priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> hee writes to <hi>Philemon</hi> thus. <hi>I truſt that through your prayers, I ſhall be given unto you.</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon <hi>v.</hi> 22. Nay, hee is ſo confident that if people would but cry hard for him to God, that hee ſhould quickly bee enlarged. Nay, ſayes hee, prepare mee a lodging, for I truſt that through your prayers I ſhould be given unto you. <hi>q. d.</hi> I make no queſtion but I ſhall out of priſon, if you will but bee earneſt with God. So, alſo it ſeems the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from Preaching. Now mark what an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee uſes, <hi>Pray for us,</hi> ſayes hee, <hi>and I beſeech you the rather to doe this, that I may bee reſtored unto you the ſooner,</hi> Heb. 13. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Thus I have finiſhed this part of the Deſcription of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, That hath the ſeven Starres in his hand, and the whole Subſcription too: <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Starres.</hi> I come now to the Epiſtle it ſelf. I <hi>know thy works, that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt and art dead,</hi> but of this more, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>YE have heard two things concerning this Epiſtle. Firſt, the Inſcription, that declareth the perſon to whom it was ſent, <hi>To the Angel of the Church in</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis <hi>write.</hi> That is, it was ſent principally to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church in the Town of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and alſo to the Chriſtians that were in that Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſubſcription that declareth from whom it was ſent, <hi>Theſe things ſaith hee that hath the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God, and the ſeven Stars:</hi> that is, it was ſent from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the third thing, and that is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of this Epiſtle, which conſiſts of three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Reprehenſion of the ſins of the Miniſter, and the body of his congregation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a Direction, or the ſhewing of the remedy, for the curing of their ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a Commendation of ſome particular perſons in that Congregation, that were not carryed away with the ſins of the times.</p>
               <p>The reprehenſion is either in generall, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> that is, I know them all, and I know them to be ſtark nought for the moſt part, what-ever they ſeem, they may ſeem to be very good, but I tell you plainly, I know them all what they be, <hi>q. d.</hi> Generally they are ſtark nought.</p>
               <p>And then in particular hee inſtances in two: firſt, the ſin of hypocriſie, or ſeeming to be good, <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt.</hi> Secondly, the ſin of deadneſſe of heart; <hi>But thou art dead.</hi> This is the reprehenſion, or the reproof.</p>
               <p>Then follows the Direction, or the ſhewing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42059:100"/>
for he does not reprove them out of any ill will, but for their good. And therefore he preſcribes them a remedy, and the remedy is twofold: The firſt is, <hi>to ſtrengthen the things that remain, that are ready to dye.</hi> v. 2. q. d. as many of you as are not quite and clean dead, ſtir up your ſelves, quicken up your hearts; and this is, firſt illuſtrated by ſhewing how they ſhould doe thus. Be <hi>watchfull</hi> ſayes he, <hi>q. d.</hi> thats the reaſon why ye languiſh on this faſhion, and ye will languiſh more and more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yee are not watchfull, therefore be watchfull: and then it is urged by rendring a motive to uſe this remedy: <hi>For I have not found thy workes perfect before God,</hi> that is, thou art hardly ſincere a jot, thou art full of hypocriſie, and formality, and thou wilt loſe all thy labour, if thou doſt not look well about thee; therefore ſhake up thy ſelf, <hi>and ſtrengthen the things, &amp;c.</hi> this is the firſt remedy. The ſecond remedy is <hi>to repent,</hi> v. 3. and this is amplified by ſhewing how, and that is two wayes, 1. <hi>Remember how &amp;c. i.e.</hi> conſider how thou haſt been taught, and bewail thy declinings, for thou art horribly departed from what thou haſt heard out of the Word. 2. <hi>Hold faſt. i.e.</hi> ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile thy warpings and degeneratings, that thou mayeſt get up again, and hold thee faſt there, when thou art up.</p>
               <p>Now leſt they ſhould neglect the uſing of this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Lord Jeſus ſharpens his ſpeech with a threatning, telling them the danger if they will not be awakened, <hi>if therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhalt not know, &amp;c.</hi> Thus you ſee the remedy.</p>
               <p>Then the next thing is the commemoration of ſome ſlain perſons, raw Birds, that were not carryed away with the ſins of the times, and in the common deadneſſe of the Congregation, where they lived, and theſe hee does commend very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42059:100"/>And then an incouragement to give them an excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The commendation is in theſe words. Thou haſt a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. That is, there be ſome among you, though they be but a few; and he commends them for two things. 1. From the <hi>place,</hi> that they could be in Sardis, and yet keepe their quickning. Thou haſt a few names even in Sardis. Even in Sardis, <hi>q. d.</hi> in dead Sardis, even there be ſome lively Chriſtians, that are not dead. 2. from the quality of their care expreſſed by a metaphor of keeping their garments cleane, which have not defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is, they have been very carefull indeed, that they are not ſooted and ſoyled with ſo many ill examples; though others be dead, yet they will not be dead too for company.</p>
               <p>And then their promiſe followes for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe words. They ſhall walke after me in white, in the ſame <hi>verſe;</hi> that is, I will give them the grace of preſence, and will keepe them unſpotted unto my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdome and Glory; and hee addes a reaſon why hee makes them ſuch a promiſe, in theſe words. For they are worthy; not as though they did merit preſence and glory; no; but they are worthy in Chriſt, and Chriſt hath made them meet to be made partakers of this mercy. Thus you ſee the matter of the example.</p>
               <p>Well, now to come to the reproofe, and firſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> I know thy workes, that is, I know them all, and I know them to be ſtarke naught for the moſt part, what ever they ſeeme; they may ſeeme to be very good and godly; but be it knowne unto you, I know them all, what they be, <hi>q. d.</hi> generally they are ſtarke naught. The firſt point wee hence gather is that the Lord knowes every mans ill courſes; hee is privy to every mans ſinnes, though men carry them never ſo cleverly &amp; cloſely, yet he knows them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42059:101"/>Firſt, he ſees mens ſinfull workes; they can do nothing,<note place="margin">1</note> but hee ſees it, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>his eyes are upon the wayes of men, and hee ſeeth all their goings. There is no darkneſſe nor ſhadow of death, where the workes of iniquity may hide themſelves,</hi> Job. 34. 21, 22. what ever evill men doe, they cannot hide it from him; they may go into a houſe, and thinke to ſhut out all men from ſeeing of them, but they cannot ſhut him out; they cannot get out of his ſight be they never ſo private, and who ſees them? yet the Lord ſees them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee knows every ſyllable that men ſpeake<note place="margin">2</note> at any time, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>There is not a word in my Tongue, but lo O Lord thou knoweſt it altogether,</hi> Pſ. 13. 4. The Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> could tell what the King of <hi>Aram</hi> ſpake in his privy chamber, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 12. the Lord can tell what words people ſpeake under the Roſe; what they ſay in their beds, what they whiſper in their cloſe meetings, what they belch out on their Alebenches. <hi>Enoch</hi> ſayes he wil have them all up at the day of judgment, nay if a word be but at the Tongues end, hee hears it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee knowes every thought in mens hearts, as<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes, and God ſaw <hi>that the wickedneſſe of man was great upon the Earth, and the very imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely evill continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. Though mens thoughts be ſly things, and are out of mens eyes, and Divells eyes, and Angels eyes, yet they are not out of his eye, he ſees what men think.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he knowes all that ever a man hath done in<note place="margin">4</note> times paſt; he revealed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> what <hi>Adam</hi> did in the Garden, what <hi>Cain</hi> in the ſield, what bragges <hi>Lamech</hi> uſed before his Wives, what villany <hi>Lots</hi> Daughters did in the night time, many 100 years after they were done. He knowes what was done yeſterday and tother day, and tother day, ſeven hundred hundred yeares agoe. Hee
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42059:101"/>
hath a Kalender of all the ſinnes of men ever ſince the beginning of the World; what people did in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, what in their youth, what in their manhood, though they themſelves have forgotten, yet he remembers; Ther's no time out of minde unto Him: as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>God requireth that whch is paſt,</hi> Eccl. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he knowes what ſinnes men will commit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;<note place="margin">5</note> Chriſt told his Apoſtles before hand, what wicked dealings they ſhould meet with; the Lord told <hi>Moſes</hi> what <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would do, before he went to him, <hi>I know he will not let you go,</hi> Exod. 3. 19. So likewiſe when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael were in the Wilderneſſe, the Lord told them even then that he knew all the wickedneſſe that ever they would doe when they came into Canaan. <hi>I know their imaginations even now ſayes he, before I have brought them into the Land which Iſware,</hi> Deut. 31. 21.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Hee knowes not onely what ſinnes they have<note place="margin">6</note> committed heretofore, nor onely what they will commit hereafter, but alſo he knowes what they would commit, in ſuch and ſuch caſes. Hee knew <hi>Abimelech</hi> would have taken <hi>Sarah,</hi> if hee had not hindred him. He knew that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would betray <hi>David,</hi> if hee ſhould ſtay there, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 12. He knowes what a rich man would do if hee were poore; what a poore man would do if he were rich; He knowes that ſuch a one would play the apoſtate, rather then looſe all his living; Hee knowes that ſuch a man would do miſchiefe, if hee had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall; hee ſees what is in every mans heart, what lies particularly in every mans nature; It may be her's one that dyes in his infancy, the Lord knowes what hee would have done, if hee had lived till hee was a man; here's one that dyes at 40, the Lord knowes what a wretch hee would have been, if he had lived to twenty or thirty years longer; here's one that dwells now in a good family, it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42059:102"/>
may be now hee conformes to good duties, he does not flye out, but the Lord knowes how he would be a very rakeſhame; if hee lived in another place.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Lord knowes what men are and what they have beene, and what they will be, as he knowes all their thoughts, words and works, He knowes all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, their perſons, their natures, their qualities, their affections, and ends and aymes, and motives and eſtates; hee knowes how many are rotten though they profeſſe never ſo much, how many are unfound though they be never ſo well eſteemed in the Church; Hee knowes in what eſtate every man ſtands in. <hi>He knowes vaine men, he feeth wickedneſſe alſo; will not he then puniſh it?</hi> Job. 11. 11. The reaſons of this point, that God knowes all mens ſinnes and ſinfull courſes, hee knowes all that they ever have done, or doe doe, or will doe, or can doe or would doe are:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe God is infinite in knowledge, as <hi>David</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> ſayes, <hi>his underſtanding is infinite,</hi> Pſal. 147. 5 as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayes, <hi>ther's no ſearching of his underſtanding,</hi> Iſa. 40. 28. well, if he be infinite in Knowledge, what can a poore Creature keepe cloſe from him? who can hide his iniquities from him? who can ſet ſuch a colour upon his wicked deviſes that hee can not diſcover them? let a man excuſe himſelfe, may be his excuſes may paſſe currant among men, but God muſt needs know the falſeneſſe of his excuſes, and that they are but Fig leaves: men may pretend what they will, and deny what they will with an impudent forehead, and ſet a good face upon what they will and this may goe unperceived among men; but Gods underſtanding is infinite, and therefore hee knowes all that men do, he knows how every man ſtands affected unto him, he knows how people come to Church, and whether they meane to doe what they have been taught, whether they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42059:102"/>
meane to reforme what they have been reproved for; for, He is infinite in Knowledge, and therefore he is privy to all the ſins of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he is omniſcient, ſo he is omnipreſent; he<note place="margin">2</note> is preſent every where; whether can any Creature goe from his preſence? if hee goe into Bed, or Chamber, or Cloſet, or Street, or high way, or Alehouſe, or Drab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, home or abroad, hee can go howhere but where God is, and how can hee doe ought, but God muſt needs ſee him? God himſelfe argues on this manner, <hi>Can any hide himſelfe in ſecret places, that I ſhould not ſee him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not I fill Heaven and earth? ſayth the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 24. q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d if I be every where, I muſt needs be able to ſee every where.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord is omniprovident, as I may ſo ſpeak,<note place="margin">3</note> hee hath a hand either in the making of all things, or at leaſt in the permitting and diſpoſing of all things. All that is good, hee does it himſelfe, or elſe it cannot be done. All that is evill, hee muſt permit it to be, or elſe it cannot be committed; nothing is done without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence or ſufferance; therefore he muſt needs know all mens ſins he knowes what hee hath ſuffered to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or does ſuffer, or will ſuffer; not ſo much as the ſinnes of men can fall out without him; as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſinnes, and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Pilats,</hi> and <hi>Herods,</hi> they did nothing but what he knew they would doe; why they did nothing, <hi>but what his Hand and Counſell determined before to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Acts 4. 28. therefore he knew the <hi>Jewes</hi> would be betray Chriſt; he could tell the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> diverſe hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that hee would take 30 pieces of Silver to doe it. He could tell the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> that they would fmite him, and buffet him, that they would reck on him among tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; he could tell the Prophet <hi>David</hi> that they ſhould pierce his hands and his Feet, and that they ſhould offer
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42059:103"/>
him Vineger to drinke, the Lord knew all theſe ſinnes of yours; why? becauſe hee had decreed them. True hee did not decree that hee would make them commit them, but he decreed that they themſelves ſhould be the agents of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſhould be meerly their fault, their covetouſnes, their malice, their men-pleaſing, their wicked diſpoſition; I but he ordred theſe things, and therefore he muſt needs know them. The drunkard could not hold up the cup to his mouth, if God had not intended to preſerve his armes, and his mouth, at that time; hee could not goe to the tipling houſe, but that God intended to continue him his feet, and his health; no man could thinke a wicked thought, nor ſpeake a naughty word, but that God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his heart and his tongue in the interim; if God ſhould forbeare his goodneſſe to them, he would be ſpeechleſſe, and not able to thinke ſo much as any thought at all, and this aggravates mans ſinnes, that hee hath need of Gods goodneſſe at the ſame time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet that he ſhould ſin againſt his Maker.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord knowes every mans ſinnes, becauſe<note place="margin">4</note> he hath a Candle in every mans boſome; hee hath made mens hearts on that wiſe, that he hath a Candle in them all. Yee know there is a ſpirit in a man, that we call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that is Gods Candle, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>The ſpirit of man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly,</hi> Pro. 20. 27. well, if he have a Candle ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every mans boſome, what can there be hidden in the darke? nay he knoweth mens hearts and wayes better then they knew them themſelves, as the Phyſitian can better judge of his Patients body then himſelfe; Chriſt knew <hi>Peters</hi> unbelieving heart, when he knew it not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, though all men be offended in thee yet will not I; Chriſt knew he would be offended in him that very night; ſo hee knew <hi>Hazaels</hi> wicked life, when the man that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42059:103"/>
owned it, would not believe it; is thy ſervant a Dogge ſayes he, that I ſhould be ſo wicked? yet he knew he would be ſo wicked and cruell; and therefore God can bring to a mans minde a thouſand things that he never dreamt of before; many a man deceives himſelfe all his life time; But when hee comes to ſicken and die, then God ſhewes him what he is, and what he hath done, and now he ſees he is a damned wretch, and yet before though all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in England had told him ſo much, hee would not have believed it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he muſt needs know every mans ſins, becauſe<note place="margin">5</note> he is the Judge of all the World, and he is to judge every ſinner according to his deeds; now if hee ſhould not know all his ſins, he could not judge righteous judgement. The Judge muſt know all ſecrets, otherwiſe he cannot well judge. Now beloved God is a righteous Judge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſin can ſcape him; God ſhall bring every work into judgement with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evill, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 14. True it is, he ſhall not want witneſſes in the day, for conſcience ſhall be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes; yet it is needfull that himſelfe ſhould have perfect knowledge of all the actions of men. For why is conſcience ſo ready to accuſe a man, when it is awakened? it is onely becauſe it is conſcious that God knoweth all its doings; now if God had not perfect knowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, conſcience would not witneſſe all then, neither could it make a ſinner confeſſe all. But Gods knowing all, this is it that will make conſcience to ſpeake truth.<note place="margin">Jeremy hath a very excellent ſaying, <hi>let.</hi> 11. 20.</note> The Pſalmiſt being to diſpute againſt a company of Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall people that ſayd, <hi>tuſh God ſhall not ſee,</hi> Pſal. 94. 7. marke how hee reaſons againſt them. He brings an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Gods judging of men to prove that God muſt needs ſee; O ſayes he, it is he that chaſtiſeth the hea hen, ſhall not hee correct? hee that teacheth man knowledge,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42059:104"/>
ſhall not he know? <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. q. d. yee deny God to be judge; if hee ſay hee does not know, how can he correct them? will he judge men for that he knowes not what? no, if he be the judge of the whole World, he muſt needs know all that men doe.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, Firſt, is it ſo that God knowes all<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> mens ſinfull courſes, if men be dead-hearted, he knowes it; if they be heartles in good duties, he knowes it; though they would be loth that men ſhould know what they are, and doe keepe it from them, yet they cannot dawb it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; he knowes it; then this may ſerve to confute them that ſay God does not know ſin. This was <hi>Averroes</hi> his opinion, who ſayes God does not know ſin; God knows all that ever he knowes by knowing of himſelfe, and how can hee know ſin, becauſe hee can ſee no ſuch thing in himſelfe? I anſwer this is to derogate from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and to deny the perfection of it. True, ſin is an evill, yea the greateſt evill of all evills; yet the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it is good: nay, it were ſtrange to ſay that God does not know who ſin againſt him; that were a pity; if men be abuſed, wee ſay it were pity but that they ſhould know of it; and if wee doe love them, wee tell them who they be that abuſe them, and what the abuſes are. Certainly God knowes who doe abuſe him, and how people carry themſelves towards all his Commandements and worſhip; it is a part of his perfection to know it. Againe we our ſelves may know ſin, and may know ſin by the contrary, as wee know what darkneſſe is by the contrary, which is light; and ſhall we ſay that God doe not know it? God damnes all the wicked one after another for it, and therfore he does know it, nay we ſee that God brings ſecret things to light here in this World, when people had thought that no body ſhould ever come to know it, yet hee does often bring ſecret ſinnes to light here in this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42059:104"/>
World, how much more at the laſt day? And though God knowes all that ever he knowes by looking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſin be not there, but nothing but good and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, yet hee can know it as a Medium to bring good out of it; And ſo it is good as he wils it, and therefore hee decrees it, and therefore he muſt needs know it and know it in himſelf. For the permiſſion onely of it is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the acting which is evill is out of himſelfe, neither does it follow that Gods underſtanding ſhould become vile by knowing ſo many vile things, as <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and others do blaſphemouſly aſtirme, &amp; thence they would conclude their curſed Atheiſticall axiomes; we indeed may make our ſelves vile by looking upon vile and baſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot keepe our hearts from ſavouring of them; <hi>whoſe end is damnation, &amp;c. who minde earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. that is, their minde becomes vile by ſo doing. Hereby people come to be unacquainted with God, and with Heavenly things. They know how to buy and ſell, how to earne and get gaine, how to plough and ſow and ſuch earthly things, and they do ſo ſavour their minds, that they make their minds baſe with them, and therefore we are commanded to ennoble our minds and underſtandings, for theſe things make them vile, and therefore we ſhould think of them no oftner then needs muſt, for our minds are debaſed by baſe objects; This is to be meant in regard of us, not as though any thing that God hath made were vile, but our corruption makes us vile; when we looke upon vile things, we are apt to run a whoring after them, and our affections to bee hampered by them; but God can daily and every howre ſee and looke what vile things men doe; for he keepes a continuall and an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hatred of them, as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, he is angry with the wicked every day, ſo hee hates their courſes every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:42059:105"/>Againe does God know all mens ſins? then this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Anomiſts, that ſay God cannot ſee the ſins of his people, God ſees no ſin in his people ſay they; abuſing that place there of <hi>Balaam. Hee hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he ſeene tranſgreſſion in Iſrael.</hi> Numb. 23. 21. what's this but to pervert Scripture, hee ſpeakes there of the eye of his Juſtice, He does not ſpeake of the eye of his Knowledge; He ſpeakes of ſuch things as is in the wicked: That indeed God doe not ſee in his people; for it is not there to be ſeene; otherwiſe, if Gods people ſin, God makes them know and confeſſe that hee ſees it; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>O God thou knoweſt my fooliſhneſſe, and my ſinnes are not hid from thee,</hi> Pſal. 69. 5. The garments of ſalvation that God puts upon his people, are not to hoodwinke Gods Al-ſeeing Knowledge, but to keep of the deſtroying Angell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another uſe is to condemne the moſt ſorts of<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> men, that doe not conſider of this truth; they little thinke that God ſees all their doings. I feare there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any among us, that will ſeeme to deny but that God can ſee all his wayes; and yet we ſee it is too apparent by mens lives, that few men do believe this indeed. There is this vile Atheiſme ſculking in all our hearts naturally (otherwiſe we durſt not doe as wee doe) that either God is ſuch a God as the Epicures made him, that ſits in Heaven and regards not what men doe here below, or at leaſt we doe not charge this truth on our hearts, that God ſees us; this is the cauſe of all the ſinnes that are among us; That there is ſo much luke warmeneſſe in the better ſort, ſo much heartleſneſſe in holy performances before God, ſo much wickedneſſe among others; for why? if men did ſeriouſly conſider that Gods ſees all and markes all, nay hee markes all that men do, ſo curiouſly that hee can ſet them in order before them, all that ever
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42059:105"/>
they have done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. in the ſame order that they committed them; marke he can ſet before us in order all that ever we doe from day to day; this ſin then, and that ſin then; ſuch a ſin wee did at ſuch a time, ſuch ſins in the morning, ſuch at noone, ſuch the laſt night, ſuch luſts were in our hearts in ſuch a place, and ſuch in ſuch a place; hee can ſet them in order before us, he knowes them ſo well, and will too before he hath done; I ſay if wee did charge this upon our ſoules, we could not live ſo looſely as we doe.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, yea, but we are Chriſtians, why do you tell us ſuch a known truth? what need ſo many arguments to prove that God knowes all our ſinnes? wee know that already and no body will deny it, we are Chriſtians. I anſwer, this is the hypocriſy of men hearts; their hearts will confeſſe it to be a truth, but in their workes they do deny it. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of men that were in the viſible Church of God aſwell as we, and that would confeſſe this truth aſwell as we, and yet he ſayes of many an one of them; <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart God hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he hath hid his face, he will never ſee it,</hi> Pſal. 10. 11. And the truth is, this is the cauſe of all the boldneſſe of people to goe on in their ſinnes, or to yeeld to ſinne at any time; they put this out of their boſomes that God ſees them; As <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>the land is full of blood, the City is full of perverſneſſe, for they ſay the Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Earth, and the Lord ſeeth not,</hi> Ezek. 9. they ſay ſo in effect; they put God afar of, and they doe not conſider that hee ſees them. Beloved there's none of us all but hath need that this truth ſhoud be urged upon us, that God beholds all iniquity and evill; we can never doe amiſſe, but he takes notice of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another uſe is; is it ſo that God ſees all mens<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſins? Then this is a terror to all that goe on with a ſelfe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42059:106"/>
condemning heart. O conſider what the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>if our heart condemne us, God is greater then our heart, and he knowes all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 20. <hi>q. d.</hi> if we have a ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning heart, how much more ſhall we find a ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning God? If our own heart can find us out, if that can find out our worldlines, or our irreverence, or our careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, how much more wlll God find us out? He knowes all our ſins better then we our ſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O let us quake all of us to goe on with a ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning heart; it is a bad badge, it is a prodigious token of the fearefull judgement of God; if wee doe not get our ſins done away, by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and by his ſanctifying Spirit, God will finde us out; for hee knowes what we are, and what wee doe daily, and how we live every day and howre. Againe, this is a terror to them that are Hypocrites; If God could not ſee a rotten heart, he ſhould ſpeed as well as the beſt. O but ſayes God, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, J try the reynes, even to give every man according to his wayes and according to the fruit of his doings,</hi> Jer. 17. 10. and therefore wo be to ſuch as are otherwiſe within then they ſeeme to be without; without they are painted ſepulchers, but within they are full of rottenneſſe, they profeſſe godlineſſe, but they ſuffer within a Worldly ſpirit, a guilty conſcience, a vaine minde, an unbelieving heart, no love of God, no zeale to his glory, no feeling of the Churches miſery, no compaſſion with the Saints, no delight in them that feare God indeed; and yet they will goe for Chriſtians forſooth. God ſees all their workes, and will unmaſk them in his due time, either in this world, or in the world to come, and will poure everlaſting contempt on them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is comfort to good people, for if God ſee<note place="margin">4.</note> all mens ſins, then he ſees all mens goodneſſe much rather; what a comfort is this in prayer to conſider, <hi>that he that</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:42059:106"/>
                  <hi>ſearcheth the heart knowes what is the minde of the ſpirit?</hi> Rom. 8. 17. Hee knowes all thy groanes, Hee knowes all thy deſires; what a comfort is this when ever an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſoule is put to it ſoundly in temptation, when the ſoule is accuſed by Satan, hardly thought on by men, and God lets bitter temptations to come on? I ſay what a comfort is this, that God knowes all the good things that are in man? all ones affections, all ones endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ail ones combats againſt ſinne, all ones griefes for corruption, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayd, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Joh. 21. 17. <hi>Peter</hi> was put to it ſoundly at that time; But yet this was his comfort that God did know all things. Hee had many tokens of Gods gracious goodneſſe about him, hee had love to Jeſus Chriſt, hee had deepe deſires to doe all that hee bade him. O ſayes hee, and thou knoweſt it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine this is an excellent comfort in time of affliction. When <hi>Iob</hi> was in affliction, and his friends ſcorned him, then did hee goe and poure out his Teares unto God, and this was his comfort, <hi>Behold my witneſſe is in Heaven, and my record is on high,</hi> Job. 16. 19, 20. Againe this an excellent encouragement to ſerve God in theſe bad and ſinnefull times; people generally never looke after God, nor holineſſe; the World lookes after their pleaſures and their profits, and preferments, and friends, and the like; but Religion and Devoutneſſe, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of living, few people looke after that as though God did not regard what people doe. Now beloved, when wee heare that God ſees all that men doe, and markes it, and will call all men to accompt, what an encouragement is this to ſerve God, as <hi>David</hi> ſayd to <hi>Solomon, Know thou the God of thy Fathers and ſerve him with a perfect heart, for the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts,</hi>

1 Chron. 28. 9. Againe, what a comfort is this againſt falſe accuſations? Hee knowes all our innocency, when our Neighbours ſay all manner of evill of us. Hee knowes wee doe that in ſimplicity, which others thinke wee doe out of a ſiniſter reſpect, or out of pride, or popularity, or for applauſe. What a comfort is this, when wee can appeale to God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>the Lord knowes that J lye not,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I have not refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my lips from Preaching thy Righteouſneſſe O Lord, thou knoweſt,</hi> Pſal. 40. 9. Hee knowes the uttermoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and deſires of our hearts is to be as good as wee ſeeme, though the World take us for Hypocrites Hee knowes wee be true men, that reverence every power that is of God, though the World eſteeme us factious and humorous. Little does the World thinke what the Saints doe every day, what wraſtlings with God, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts in their mindes they indure; this is ſufficient, the Lord knowes.</p>
               <p>Againe, what a comfort is this? if wee deſire to know our ſinnes, God is able to ſhew them unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee can open our eyes to behold them for our humiliation, that wee may ſay with the Prophet, I know mine owne iniquities and my ſinne is ever before me; if we want a right ſight of our ſinnes at any time, it is but going to God, Hee knowes them all, hee can helpe us to ſee them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, does God know all mens ſinnes? then this ſhould make us afraid to doe evill at any time, or in any place, yea in the ſecreteſt; wee can never do any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but God will ſpy us out; wee cannot have a thought in our heart, but hee does diſcerne it; nor omit any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but hee does perceive it; nor ſlubber over any good duty, but hee ſtands by and lookes on; may be when yee are among your ſelves, yee can ſhoot out your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42059:107"/>
even bitter and malicious words, may bee no body can tell what yee ſaid, tuſh it ſhall never come to ſuch a ones Eare; Who can tell that you did ſay ſo? Who? why God can Thus yee ſayd and thus yee ſaid, ſayes the Lord; <hi>That have you ſayd O houſe of Iſrael, for I knew the things that came into your minde every one of them,</hi> Ezek. 11. 5. Hee knowes thy adultery and with whom and in what Bed; neither Curtaines, nor Doores, nor Lock and Key can hide from him. Hee knowes how thy heart hath riſen up againſt the Word, Hee knowes how many times thou haſt ſmothered thine owne conſcience, and gone againſt it, and outwreſtled it; He knowes how thou letteſt thy minde rove in Prayer, how many times thou haſt come to the Lords Table unworthily, omitted Family duties or hudled them over without due regard; Hee knowes what trickes thou haſt to put off conviction, what a baſe eſteeme thou haſt of the ſtrictneſſe that Gods Word doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, when thou heareſt it layd open. O I ſay, this ſhould make thee to feare God, this ſhould make thee to feare everywhere as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>Thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeſt my paths and my lying downe, and art acquainted with all my wayes, Pſal.</hi> 139. 3. Thou haſt beſet mee behind and before, within and without; thou poſſeſſeſt all my reines. O what an awe ſhould this breede in us! But I let this Uſe paſſe. This Uſe will better come in the next Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Well then, the next Doctrine is this. The knowing<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> that God knowes all our workes, is the powerfull meanes to all Gods elect, to do them good, and to quicken them, and to make them take heede of all manner of ſinne; when the Lord would quicken his people here in Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, hee uſes this as his firſt meanes to doe it by, <hi>I know thy workes;</hi> wee may ſee this in <hi>David. I have kept thy</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:42059:108"/>
                  <hi>Precepts and thy Teſtimonies, for all my wayes are before thee. Pſa.</hi> 119. 168. when <hi>Solomon</hi> would confute a whoriſh heart, hee uſes this for his argument, <hi>Why wilt thou my Son, bee raviſht with a ſtrange Woman, and embrace the boſome of a ſtranger? for the wayes of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and hee ponders all his goings.</hi> Prov. 5. 20. 21. why wilt thou doth us? <hi>q. d.</hi> thou art madde, thou art deſperate, if this argument will not prevale with thee.</p>
               <p>The reaſons of this point are, Firſt, becauſe the Lords<note place="margin">1.</note> knowing of our workes is not onely a meere knowing of them, but alſo a marking and a pondering of them too; Hee diligently obſerves what wee doe, hee ponders and conſiders whence it proceeds, and whether it tends, as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>The Lords Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes well conſider, his Eye-lides try the Children of men, Pſal.</hi> 11. 4. And therefore when the Scripture would tell us that God knowes mens hearts, it ſometimes expreſſes it thus, <hi>The Lord pondereth mens hearts,</hi> Prov. 24. 12. if God did onely ſee what we doe, it were another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but when the ſoule ſhall heare that hee markes, and that hee ponders, and conſiders mens ſinnes, and weighes them how haynous they are, what puniſhment they deſerve, and how horrible it is that they do, how much it is againſt his glory; its a ſigne of a deſperate heart, when this will not work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe when God ſees all our ſinnes, it<note place="margin">2</note> is with a moſt holy and pure Eye, and ſuch an Eye as cannot abide ſuch an object before him, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakuk</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes then to behold evill, thou canſt not looke on iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1. 13. if God ſaw our ſinnes with ſuch an Eye as men ſee them now and then, it were no ſuch great thing; for wee know that moſt men can endure to ſee our ſinnes well enough, and like us little the worſe; but they
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42059:108"/>
are infinitely offenſive unto God, he ſees them with ſuch an eye, that if ever the conſcience be a wake but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how he lookes, it will burſt the very heart of a man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe when God ſees our ſinnes, he records<note place="margin">3</note> them, he notes them in a booke, that he may never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them; as he told the people of the Jewes, <hi>behold it is written before me, I will recompence and render it into your boſome,</hi> Iſay. 65. 6. if God did ſee our ſinnes, and ther's an end, then indeed this doctrine of Gods ſeeing would doe little; may be God would forget them againe; yea, but when he ſees, he regiſters too, nay he layes it up in record to be in ſtore by him againſt another day; nay, he ſeales them up in his treaſure; <hi>is not this laidup in ſtore by me, and ſealed among my Treaſures?</hi> Deut. 32. 34. now when the Soule ſhall come to marke this, this will wound it to the quicke, this muſt needs doe a man good, and ſtrike an awe into him of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe when Gods ſees our ſinnes, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">4.</note> all one as if all the world ſhould ſee them too; as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> notes; for let our ſinnes be never ſo ſecret, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unſoundneſſe never ſo unknowne, yet if God know it, it is as bad and worſe then if all the world knew it; for all the world ſhall know it one day, God will lighten all things that are hid in darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the ſecret counſailes of mens hearts; <hi>then ſhall every man have praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. that is, whoſoever have been godly, God will bring all their godlineſſe forth, and every one of them ſhall have praiſe of God; this ſhall be an honour to them before all the world: ſo if a man have been evill, then God will produce all his naughty courſes forth, then ſhall he have ſhame from God, God will ſhame him before all the World. There is nothing now covered that ſhall not then be revealed, nothing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42059:109"/>
hid that ſhall not then be laid open; what a ſhame then will this be for thee, that thou which haſt gone ſo many yeares for an honeſt man, and may be haſt been ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy here in this world, when all the Saints ſhall ſee thee ſtanding as a wretch, as a hell-hound as a limme of the Divell, on Chriſts left hand? what a ſhame will it be, if we that are now earneſt Preachers, if any of us ſhall then be found among the goats? what a ſhame to any of you, that would count it a ſore diſgrace to be called a wicked man, to be led forth with evill doers, and ſholed among the damned? well then, if Gods ſeeing of mens ſinnes be ſuch a kind of ſeeing as this is, no marvell it worke ſo effectually on them that are of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, an other argument may be taken from our<note place="margin">5.</note> diſpoſition; our diſpoſition is ſuch, that we cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that our wickedneſſes ſhould be ſeen of any body that we know can't abide them; Which among us when we pray and have baſe roving thoughts, would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that a man ſhould ſee our thoughts rove? which of us, that are unſetled and dead-hearted, would not bluſh that men had a caſement to ſee how <hi>dead</hi> he ſits at a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and how <hi>dead</hi> at a Sacrament, how <hi>dead</hi> in other of Gods Ordinances; what baſe and impure thoughts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doe ariſe in his minde; if he did thinke that any man ſhould ſee them, he would not hardly be able to ſhew his face among men. Let but an adulterer that is naught with a whore, have but a few men, or but one man come and take him in the act, O how it will gall him and vex him to be ſeen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>if one know them, they are in the terror of the ſhadow of death,</hi> Job. 24. 17. they abhorre the light, they cannot abide to be brought out to be knowne. Now beloved if this be our diſpoſition by nature, that we cannot abide that ſo much as a man ſhould know us; nay, not a child of ſix or ſeven yeeres of age, then O what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42059:109"/>
a terror is it that the God of Heaven and Earth ſhould know us, that he ſhould ſee all our luſts, all our ſinnefull and vile thoughts, all our uncleane and noy ſome affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all our by ends and careleſneſſe of God! O what a powerfull thing is this to worke upon the heart, except it be delivered up to a reprobate ſenſe, to ſleight God, and care leſſe for him then for a little Boy, or a mortall man? ſo then yee ſee, this is a powerfull meanes to work upon a ſoule, to know that God knowes all his workes; though the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſtood jeſting, and playing, and conteſting with our Saviour a good while: yet when ſhe perceived that he knew all her villany, this burſt her heart; <hi>O ſaies ſhe this is no other then Chriſt, he hath told me all that ever I did,</hi> Joh. 4. 29.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is. Firſt, here we ſee they are deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that this point cannot worke on; its certaine they are graceleſſe that can heare that God ſees all their workes, and yet it does not purge them from day to day; its an evident argument that a man contemnes God, and makes nothing of him. When <hi>David</hi> had ſhewed that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked care not for Gods eye, they make a matter of nothing of it; tuſh God does not ſee, Pſalm. 19. 11. ſay they; that is, they knew he ſaw indeed, but they made nothing of it; as long as men did not ſee them, they counted Gods ſeeing as nothing; now marke what followes, <hi>wherefore doe the wicked contemne God?</hi> Pſalm. 13</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it ſo, that this is ſuch a powerfull meanes<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> to worke upon our hearts? let us not harden our hearts, but let us conſider of it, that it may cut between the bone and the marrow, and devide between the ſoule and the ſpirit; God ſees all our workes. This point ſhould fall upon our hearts, like the almighty hand of God, as it did upon Job, <hi>I know thou canſt doe every thing, and that no thought can be hid from thee,</hi> Job, 42. 2.</p>

               <p>WE are come to the ſubject matter of this example; and Firſt, we meet with the reproofe that Chriſt gives to the Church of <hi>Sardis;</hi> the reproofe is either in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; <hi>I know thy workes, i e.</hi> I know them all to be ſtarke naught for the generall; and then in particular, firſt, their hypocriſie, <hi>thou haſt a name that thou liveſt;</hi> ſecondly, their deadneſſe indeed, <hi>and art dead.</hi> The generall reproofe we ſpake of the laſt day, <hi>I know thy workes,</hi> and there ye heard that God knowes all the ſinfull courſes that any man takes; he is privy to every mans ſinnes: though men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them never ſo cloſely and cleverly, yet he knowes them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſees all mens ſinfull actions, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>his eyes are upon the wayes of man, and he ſees all his goings; there is no darkneſſe or ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves,</hi> Job. 34. 21. 22. people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out of his ſight, they cannot ſinne ſo in private but he ſeeth them; they may goe into a ſecret roome, and ſhut every living creature out, but they cannot ſhut God out.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he knowes every ſyllable that men ſpeake,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>I have heard what the Prophets ſaid, they prophecy lies in my name,</hi> Ier. 23. 25. the Lord can tell what men ſpeake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the roſe; looke what the King of <hi>Aram</hi> ſpake in his bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chamber, he could tell <hi>Eliſha.</hi> As <hi>Enoch</hi> ſpeakes; he knowes all the ſpeeches that wicked men ſpeake, and will have them up at the day of judgement againſt them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he knowes every ſinfull thought that is in mens<note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:42059:110"/>
hearts, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes; <hi>God ſaw the wickedneſſe of man was great upon the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. though mens thoughts be ſlie things, and are out of mens eyes, and Angels eyes, and Devils eyes, yet they are not out of his eye, he ſees what men thinke.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he knowes all that ever a man hath done as<note place="margin">4.</note> the woman ſaid of Chriſt; <hi>come ſee one that hath told me all that ever I have done,</hi> Joh. 4. 29.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he knowes all the evill that ever men will doe<note place="margin">5.</note> hereafter; the Lord told <hi>Moſes</hi> what <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would doe before he went to him; <hi>I know he will harden his heart and will not let them goe,</hi> Exod. 3. 19. while the Children of Iſrael were in the wilderneſſe, he knew what they would doe when they came into <hi>Canaan; I know their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even now before I have brought them into the Land which I ſware to give them,</hi> Deut 31. 21.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, he knowes all the evills that men would doe<note place="margin">6.</note> in ſuch and and ſuch circumſtances; he knew <hi>Abimelech</hi> would have taken <hi>Sarah,</hi> if he had not hindred him; <hi>he knew that the men of Keilah would betray David, if David ſhould ſtay there,</hi> 1 Sam. 23. 12. he knowes what a rich man would doe if he were poore, what this or that poore man would doe if he were rich; one dies in his infancy, he knowes what he would have done if he had let him live to be a man: her's a man that lives in a good fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and may be carrieth himſelfe very ſquarely, but the Lord knowes what he would doe, if he lived in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Lord knowes mens diſpoſitions, their<note place="margin">7</note> natures, their qualities, their projects, their intentions; he knowes how many are rotten, though they profeſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much; he knowes mens perſons, <hi>he knowes vaine men,</hi> Iob. 11. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:42059:111"/>I told you the reaſon of this, Firſt, becauſe he is omniſcient and knowes all things, <hi>his underſtanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> Pſal. 147. 5. let a man ſet as good a colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he can upon his wicked devices, God can diſcover him, let a man have never ſo many excuſes; though they paſſe for currant among men, yet God ſees what they are; men may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what they will, and deny what they will, and ſet an<note place="margin">1.</note> impudent forehead and face on the matter, and go unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among men, but they cannot goe unperceived by Allmighty God, his underſtanding is infinite.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he is omniſcient, ſo he is omnipreſent, he<note place="margin">2.</note> is everywhere; whether can any creature goe from his preſence? if he goe into the ſtreet, or ale-houſe or drab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or his houſe or his cloſet, or his privy chamber, he can goe nowhere but where God is; and therefore how can he doe ought but God muſt needs ſee him? <hi>can any hide himſelfe in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſecret places, that I ſhould not ſee him? doe not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Ier. 23. 24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord hath his providence in every thing,<note place="margin">3</note> nothing is done without his concurrence or ſufferance, if it be good, it is done by his aſſiſtance; if it be evill, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without his permiſſion and diſpoſition; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt needs know every thing. He knew whether the Devils ſhould enter into the herd of ſwine, for they could not enter in, untill he ſuffered them: he knew all that <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Jewes and the High Prieſts did againſt Chriſt, <hi>becauſe they did nothing but what his hand and counſell had determined before to be done,</hi> Act. 4. 28.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord knowes every mans ſinnes, becauſe<note place="margin">4</note> he hath a candle in every mans boſome. <hi>The Spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly,</hi> Prov. 20. 27, that is a mans conſcience, that's the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42059:111"/>
Lords Candle; well, if Hee have a Candle ſtanding in every mans boſome, what can bee done there in the darke?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, becauſe He is judge of the whole World; <hi>O Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>of Heaſts that judgeſt righteouſly, that tryeſt the Reines and the Heart,</hi> Jer. 11. 20. Hee could not judge every man righteouſly elſe. A man may doe well, and yet ſeeme to doe evill; againe a man may doe very evill, and yet ſeeme to doe well; yee know the heart is all in all; now if God did not know all mens hearts, all mens lookes and aymes, and intents, and meanings, the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and every thing that men doe, Hee could not judge every man according to his workes, as hee will for a certaine. Hee will judge every man according to his works, and therefore Hee knowes what every mans workes bee.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this was, Firſt. To confute <hi>Averroes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> that ſay that God does not know mens ſinnes; O ſay they, God ſees all things by looking on himſelfe; now there is no ſuch thing to be ſeene in himſelfe. Beloved, here you ſee that this is a blaſphemous Doctrine; for God knowes what ever men are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thinke, or ſpeake, or doe, or have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſhall doe, or would doe in any caſe; and though ſinne be not in God, yet the ſuffering of it is in God and Hee may ſuffer it in his juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wiſdome; though the commiting of it be wicked, yet his ſuffering of it is good, and juſt. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evill and the good,</hi> Pro. 15. 3. But I let this paſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to condemne the moſt ſorts of men that doe<note place="margin">2</note> not conſider of this truth; for though men will grant that God knowes all the evill that they doe, yet this vile Atheiſme is lurking in mens hearts, they either make God as the Epicures hold, that hee ſits in Heaven, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42059:112"/>
regards not what men doe, <hi>or at leaſt God will not require it,</hi> Pſal. 10. 13. they doe not charge this truth on their hearts; This is the cauſe that men are ſo daring to doe evill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is a terror to all that doe evill. This<note place="margin">3</note> is a terror to them that have condemning hearts, as <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>if our heart condemne us, God is greater then our hearts, and Hee knowes all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 20. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine this is a terror to all Hypocrites; if God could not ſee a rotten heart, then a Hypocrite ſhould ſpeed as well as the beſt. But God ſees what men are; ſeeme they what they will, He ſees what they be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is comfort to good people, for if God<note place="margin">4.</note> ſee all mens ſinnes, then Hee ſees all mens goodneſſe; what a comfort is this in Prayer to conſider, <hi>That Hee that ſearcheth the Hearts knowes what is the minde of the Spirit?</hi> Romans 8. 27, Hee knowes all thy groanes and ſighes; though thou canſt not utter what thou wouldſt in Prayer, yet Hee knowes what thou wouldſt have. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is this in temptation, in the midſt of the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan, when a man is pitifully put to it in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conflicts, that God knowes what is in us? all our ſecret affections, our mournings after him, our private ſeekings of him, all our hidden meanings to him, all our combats againſt ſinne, all our griefes for corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>God thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Joh. 21. 17. <hi>Peter</hi> was put to it ſoundly at that time, yet this was his comfort that God did know all things; and as Hee knowes more evill by us then our ſelves, ſo He knowes more good by us then our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Againe, what a comfort is this againſt the nick-names and falſe judgings of wicked men? Hee knowes all our innocency, when men ſay all manner of evill of us;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42059:112"/>
Hee knowes wee doe that in ſincerity, which men thinke wee doe in Hypocriſy; Hee knowes our. ſimplicity, when men judge that wee doe it out of by and ſiniſter reſpects; what a comfort is this when wee can appeale to God as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>the Lord knowes that I lie not;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained my lips from preaching thy Righteouſneſſe, O Lord thou knoweſt,</hi> Pſalme 40. 9. little does the World think what the Saints doe every day, what wreſtlings with God, what goings out unto him they have; this is a comfort; the Lord knowes. Againe, what an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it to ſerve God in theſe bad and ſinnefull times? People generally never looke after God, nor holineſſe, as though God had forſaken the Earth; moſt people are of the minde, that if a man bee preciſe, hee is little the better; and if hee be not ſo preciſe as ſome be, hee ſhall never be the worſe for that, as though God cared for no ſuch matter. Beloved, when wee heare that God ſees all that men doe, and markes and will call all men to an accompt, what an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this to ſerve God? as <hi>David</hi> ſayes to <hi>Solomon, Know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect Heart, for the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. This was the firſt pont.</p>
               <p>And then the Second point was this. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this that God knowes all our workes, is a powerfull meanes to all Gods elect, to doe them good, and to quicken them and to make them take heede of all manner of ſinne; when the Lord would quicken his people here in <hi>Sardis,</hi> hee uſes this as his firſt meanes to doe it by; I know thy workes; wee may ſee this in <hi>David; I have kept thy Precepts and thy</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:42059:113"/>
                  <hi>Teſtimonies; for all my wayes are before Thee,</hi> Pſalme 119 168. when <hi>Solomon</hi> would convert the whoriſh man, hee uſes this for his argument, <hi>why wilt thou O my Son be raviſht with a ſtrange Woman, for the wayes of man are before the Eyes of the Lord, and He ponders all his goings,</hi> Pro. 5. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>The reaſons of this point, are. Firſt, becauſe the<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> Lords knowing of our workes is joyned with a mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a pondering of them too. Hee diligently obſerves what wee doe; Hee ponders and conſiders whence it proceeds, whether it tends; what light we goe againſt, what checks of conſcience wee meete with, what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wee abuſe, what prickes wee kick againſt; Hee does not barely ſee what wee doe, but Hee conſiders what wee doe, how hainouſly wee ſinne, what a vile thing it is that wee doe; Hee conſiders how curſed wee are, what a great One wee offend. <hi>The Lords Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes doe conſider, and his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids trie the children of men.</hi> Pſalme 11. 4. <hi>Hee ponders mens hearts,</hi> Prov. 24. 12. if God did only ſee what wee doe, it were another matter, but when the ſoule ſhall heare that He markes and conſiders, and that he ponders mens ſinnes, and weighs them how horrible they are, how much againſt his glory, what puniſhments they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how inexcuſable they be, how juſt it is to damne them, its a ſigne of a deſperate heart when this wil not work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lords ſeeing of our ſinnes is with moſt<note place="margin">2</note> holy and pure Eyes, and ſuch Eyes as cannot abide ſuch an object before Him, as the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk</hi> ſpeakes; <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes then to behold evill, thou canſt not looke on iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1. 13. If God ſaw our ſinnes with ſuch an Eye as men ſee them with, it were no ſuch great
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42059:113"/>
thing; many men can endure them well enough, and like us little the worſe; nay may be they will like us the better; but they are infinitely offenſive to God. Hee ſees, them with ſuch an Eye, that if the ſoule did but ſee how God lookes, it would burſt the very heart of it; as when <hi>Peter</hi> had denyed Chriſt, Chriſt look't upon him; But it was ſuch a looke, that burſt his very heart and made him goe out with ſhame, and weepe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lords ſeeing of our ſinnes is joyned<note place="margin">3</note> with recording of them; Hee notes them in a Booke that hee may never forget them, as hee told the <hi>Iewes, Behold it is written before mee, and I will render it them into their boſome,</hi> Iſaiah 65. 6. if God did ſee our ſinnes and there's an end, then indeed this Doctrine of Gods ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſinnes would doe little good, may be God will forget them againe; yea, but when hee ſees them, hee regiſters them too, and hee will never forget them; now when a ſoule ſhall come to conſider them, this will wound it to the quick. O hee will never forget them, hee ſets them on our ſcore, and wee ſhall heare of them another day, except we make our peace with him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when God ſees our ſinnes, it is even all<note place="margin">4</note> one as if the whole World ſaw them; nay hee will ſhew them before all the whole World, <hi>Hee will bring to light things hidden in darkneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. wouldſt not thou bee loth that all the World ſhould ſee all thy thoughts, and heare every word that thou ſpeakeſt, and know all the evill thou haſt done; would it not much bridle thee, if thou couldſt doe nothing, not thinke a thought but all the whole World ſhould ſee it? why man, the Lord ſees thee, and that is all one and more
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42059:114"/>
too; for hee will open it before all the World, before hee hath done.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, another argument may be taken from our<note place="margin">4.</note> diſpoſition; our diſpoſition is ſuch that wee cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide our wickedneſſe ſhould be ſeen by any body; which among us when wee pray, would not be aſhamed that any body ſhould ſee how our thoughts rove? which of you that are unſetled and deadhearted would not bluſh that men had a caſement to ſee how dead hee ſits at a Sermon, how dead and blockiſh at a Sacrament, how dead at other of Gods Ordinances? What baſe and uncleane, and blaſphemous thoughts doe ſometimes come into our hearts? if a man did thinke that any man ſhould ſee them, hee would hardly be able to ſhew his face among men: ſhould an Adulterer be but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the act by any Man or Woman or Child, O how it would gall him and vex him to be ſeene! as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>If one know them, they are in the terrour of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death,</hi> Job. 24. 27. now beloved if this be our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by nature, that wee cannot abide that a man ſhould ſee us doe ſomething that wee doe, nay not a child of ſeven yeares old, then O what a terrour is it that the God of Heaven and Earth ſhould ſee us and know us; that hee ſhould ſee all our luſts, all our noyſome and uncleane affections, all our vile and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts! O what a powerfull thing is this to worke upon the heart, except it be delivered up to a reprobate ſenſe? The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſhee was briske and frolique a great while, till ſhee perceived that Chriſt knew all her villany, this made her aſhamed, and brake her very heart.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this was: Firſt, here wee ſee they are<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> deſperate that this point cannot worke on; its certaine
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42059:114"/>
they are graceleſſe that can heare that God ſees all their workes, and yet it does not purge them from day to day, its an evident argument that a man contemnes God, and makes nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it ſo that this is ſuch a powerfull meanes<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> to worke upon our hearts? O let us not harden our hearts, but let us conſider of it, that it may cut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the bone and the marrow; God ſees all our workes. This point ſhould fall upon our hearts, like the Al-mighty hand of God; ſo it did on Jobs. <hi>I know thou canſt doe every thing, and that no thought can be hid from thee,</hi> Job. 42. 2. ſo much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the reproof in generall.</p>
               <p>Now wee come to the particulars. And the firſt is in theſe words, <hi>thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt,</hi> and the other is, <hi>and art dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That thou haſt a name that thou liveſt; This is the firſt particular whereby the Lord Jeſus, proves that which hee had implyed before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the works of <hi>Sardis</hi> were all ſtarke naught, becauſe they had onely a name to live, they reſted in a meere outward name to bee Religious and good Chriſtians, and people of God, and believers and a Church of Jeſus Chriſt; they had the name, and that was all; they had a name to live; well, ſayes hee, for this very thing, I know all thy workes, (<hi>i</hi>) I know them to be all ſtarke naught. Some thinke this is an alluſion to the Miniſter of <hi>Sardis</hi> his name, who (they ſay) was called <hi>Zoſing,</hi> that is Living. Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, but the truth is, thou art dead; whether that be ſo or no, I know not; but this is the meaning of the words, that both the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and the Church ſeemed to be alive towards God; hee to be a very good and godly Miniſter, and they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42059:115"/>
very good and godly hearers, they were all profeſſors, they were all very devout and forward in all their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion to ſee to; Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt.</p>
               <p>By name is meant a meere name, as wee ſee by the clauſe following, and art dead; for when a man is dead, the name to live muſt needs be a meere Name.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Name in regard of themſelves, they tooke<note place="margin">1</note> themſelves to be alive; as <hi>Paul</hi> had a name to live before his converſion, while yet hee was a Phariſee, hee had then a name to live, <hi>I was alive without the Law once,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. That is, I had a name to live then, I taking my ſelfe to be alive; I thought verily in thoſe dayes that I had true Grace, true Faith, and true Hope, and true Love, and the true feare of God before my eyes. So this Church had a name to live, they thought themſelves to be alive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a name in regard of other godly Churches;<note place="margin">2</note> others in the judgement of Charity conceived they were alive; as the Scribes, the Phariſees, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt told them they had a name to live, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites; for yee are like unto whited Sepulchers, which indeed appeare beautifull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but are within full of dead mens bones,</hi> Matthew 23. 27. that is, yee ſeeme to be alive, yee have a name to live, but indeed yee are dead; They had ſuch a great name to live that our Saviour Chriſt had much a doe to keepe his owne Diſciples from over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; beware of them ſayes hee, <hi>q. d.</hi> what ever yee may thinke, they have a meere Name to live.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a name among poore ignorant and ſimple<note place="margin">3.</note> people; yee know there be abundant of poore ſimple
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42059:115"/>
people that are led away with ſhewes, that know not what true Religion is, nay may be hate it, but yet they are led away with the ſhew of it; now they that ſeeme to be religious, they are the onely Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with ſuch; they are held for the only good people in a Country, they are admired, poore ſilly people take them for their Ghoſtly Fathers, if they can have but their Prayers, they thinke their Prayers can do much; when they are ſick, they love a life to have ſuch by their bedſides, they give them a great deale of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, like <hi>Abſulom</hi> that comforted the people that came to him, O your matters are good; ſo the Apoſtle ſhewes that they that had <hi>a ſorme of godlineſſe,</hi> had a name to live among a company of poore ſilly people, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a name among the perſecutors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">4</note> and ſo they are perſecuted too among them that live indeed; for mockers take them to be of the ſame number. So <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copperſmith, had a name a great while, and the enemies of goodneſſe perſecuted him even as <hi>Paul;</hi> ſo <hi>Demas</hi> for a time had a name, and was perſecuted as well as the Apoſtle, till afterwards hee was weary and forſooke him. This is one of your Preciſians, this is one of you purer people, this is one of them that call themſelves the people of God, <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 36. 20. as a Bat hath a name to be a Mouſe, and ſo the Birds perſecute it, and cannot abide it.</p>
               <p>Now the point of Doctrine is this, that it is a horrible<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> thing to reſt in a meere name of being Religious; it is the argument that Chriſt uſes, to prove that <hi>Sardis</hi> workes were all ſtarke naught, becauſe they had a meere name to live; ſo when the Lord would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42059:116"/>
how the Jewes were growne to be ſtarke naught, hee layes this to their charge, that they had onely a name to bee his people; <hi>They call themſelves of the holy City, and ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael, the Lord of Hoſts is his name,</hi> Iſaiah 48. 2. that is, they got themſelves a name to bee his people, and there was all; they had not the thing it ſelfe, but they tooke the name; thus hee proved them to bee ſtarke naught.</p>
               <p>The reaſons are; firſt, becauſe this is to be fartheſt<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> off from Religion; religion is a reall thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that reſts in having the name of it, is fartheſt off from it; as Chriſt ſayes of <hi>Nathaniel, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile,</hi> Ioh. 1. 47. ſo when a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious indeed, humble indeed, feares God indeed, this is religion; when a man is freed indeed from his ſinnes, and from the power of them, this is religion: <hi>if the Sonne ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8. 36. Now when a man hath only the name, he is fartheſt off from this; Religion is a reall, ſolid, and a ſubſtantiall thing; as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayes, <hi>my little children let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 18. what though a man have the name to love God and goodneſſe? how farre is this off from doing of it indeed? a man may goe for one that is converted; but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that is converted indeed; ſo he is godly that is godly indeed; the name is nothing where the thing is wanting; all religion is in deed, to believe indeed, to deny a mans ſelfe every day indeed, to be ſenſible of God indeed in all ones waies; not to ſay ones prayers, but to pray indeed; to give God thankes indeed; to worſhip him indeed; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>when a man can ſay God is in us indeede,</hi> 1 Corinthians 14. 25. when
<pb facs="tcp:42059:116"/>
a man hath onely the name, this is a meere fancy and conceit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a very blaſphemy to get the name<note place="margin">2</note> for good people, when wee are not good people; indeed the reaſon is this, Religion hath an inward dependance upon God, it unites a man to God, it hath an internall relation unto God, it puts a man in a propriety with God, that God is his God, that hee is borne of God, it puts the very Name of God upon a man; now if a man take the name with out the thing, it muſt neede bee a very blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy as hee ſayes, <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Iewes, and are not, but are the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine.</note> 
                  <hi>of Satan,</hi> Revelations, 2. 9. as if a man ſhould ſay hee were of the blood royall; yee know the blood royall hath ſuch a dependance on the Crowne, that that man that ſhould ſay hee were of the blood royall, and is not, hee muſt needes blaſpheme the King. So beloved, Religion hath a neere dependance on God, and therefore hee is a blaſphemer of God, that gets the name of it, and lets the thing alone; and therefore how ſhoud wee take heede, how wee have the name for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, except wee bee Religious indeed, and holy indeede, and Heavenly indeede, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes; <hi>nam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it nomen inane, &amp; crimen immane,</hi> a bare name is a horrible blame unto any man, whoſoever he be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a flat lie; when a man hath the<note place="margin">3</note> name for a good Chriſtian, and hath not the thing ſignified by the Name, this is a flat lie; as God ſayes, <hi>Note it in a Booke that it may be for time to come, for ever and ever, that this is a rebellious people,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42059:117"/>
                  <hi>lying children, children that will not heare the Law of the Lord,</hi> Iſaiah. 30. 8. 9. that is, they had the name of his children, but they had not the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that name; they would not doe as children ſhould doe, they would not bee ruled by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Lawes, therefore they are lying children, they lie in bearing ſuch a name; the Lord notes it in a Booke, that it might ſtand for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt them at the day of judgement; this was nothing elſe but to lie before God; you goe for my children, what? and will not doe as I bid you? you lie in haveing the name of my children; when a man ſhall have the name of a child of God, or the name of a Miniſter of the Lord Jeſus, or the name of a Chriſtian baptized into Chriſt, hee had need to take heed what hee does; for if he doe not anſwer this name, hee does but play the <hi>Ananias</hi> to lie to the Holy Ghoſt: Looke into thy generall calling; looke into thy particular, looke into thy carriage; looke into thy manner of good duties, whether thou doe behave thy ſelfe anſwerably to this holy name whereby thou art called, knowing thou doſt but lye to God, if thou doſt not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is an unreaſonable thing; when a<note place="margin">4.</note> man hath not the thing, there is no reaſon that hee ſhould have the name; when God gave <hi>Abram</hi> the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee told him there was a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why hee ſhould bee called by that name; <hi>thy name ſhall bee called Abraham, for a Father of many Nations have I made thee,</hi> Geneſis 17. 5. ſo it is an unreaſonable thing why wee ſhould have the name of Gods ſervants or Chriſtians, unleſſe there bee
<pb facs="tcp:42059:117"/>
ſome reaſon why wee ſhould have the impoſition of this name; now when wee make it a bare title, and doe not obey Chriſt, nor make conſcience of all his holy waies, this is very unreaſonable; as <hi>Abigail</hi> reaſoned about her Huſbands name; <hi>as his name is ſo is hee, Nabal is his name, and folly is with him,</hi> 1 Samuel 25. 25. So my brethren, as our name is ſo ſhould we be; if Chriſtian be our name, true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould bee with us; humility, love, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, patience, faith, holineſſe, and all other parts of Chriſtianity ſhould be with us; now if we have the name without theſe things intimated by the name, this is a very unreaſonable thing; nay, it is not onely unreaſonable, but alſo ridiculous; who will not count the names that the Papiſts give to their blockiſh Friers ridiculous? <hi>ſubtiliſſimus</hi> Doctor, Doctor <hi>Angelicus, Seraphicus,</hi> theſe are ridiculous, as a drunkard a Chriſtian, a whoremonger a Chriſtian, a worldling a Chriſtian, a vaine man a Chriſtian? what a ridiculous thing it is to call ſuch the Saints of God? ſtrangers here on earth, ſuch as have their converſation in Heaven, ſuch as are buried together with Chriſt in his death; ſuch as are men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; mortified, juſtified, ſanctified, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to themſelves, loving the things above, and not the things that are here beneath; If theſe things doe not agree with us, what a ridiculous thing is it that wee ſhould bee termed good Chriſtians; here bee Chriſtians indeed? this is a meere mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is an impudent thing; when we have a<note place="margin">5</note> name to live and to be wrought upon by the word, what an impudent thing is it if we doe not looke to
<pb facs="tcp:42059:118"/>
it that wee be ſo indeed; one would thinke wee ſhould bluſh to thinke what a name wee have, and how little wee make good our name, between God and our owne ſoules. <hi>When the men of Bethlehem ſaid, is not this Naomi, O how ſhe was aſhamed of her ſelfe; call me not Naomi, call me Marah, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me,</hi> Ruth. 1. 20. ſo when wee are named Chriſtians, we ſhould even bluſh, call me not a Chriſtian, call me a wretch, call me a vile creature, a hell-hound, a limme of the Devill, a curſed ſinner; for the Almighty never yet turned my heart; he never yet purified my Soule and life, I never yet have reſembled Chriſt to this very day; I ſay the moſt of us ſhould even be confounded to thinke what a name wee have. I a Chriſtian, and doe no more good, and live no better life? I a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and not humbled, not abaſed yet before God, ſo dull to all goodneſſe, ſo carnall, ſo dead to all Gods Ordinances, ſo voide of all grace, ſo ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of my ſinnes? how can this be? wee are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, if wee have our name for naught, our name may upbraide us; the good opinions that others have of us, may fill our faces with ſhame to thinke how ſhort we come of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it is an inexcuſable thing; if we have a<note place="margin">6.</note> name to be alive, wee are without excuſe if wee be not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe now out of our owne mouthes God<note place="margin">1</note> will judge us; wee ſaid wee were his people, wee tooke the name of his ſervants; why then he will ſay why had I not your ſervice? why would you doe no more for me? why were you cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, why were you proud, why were you hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
<pb facs="tcp:42059:118"/>
why were you ſo careleſſe of me? you wore my livery, you ſhrouded your ſelves under my name. So the Lord did with the Jewes that had the name of his children and ſervants; ſee how he judges them out of their owne mouth; <hi>a Sonne honours his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a ſervant his Maſter; if then I be a Father, where is my honour? and if I be a Maſter, where is my feare?</hi> Malachi. 1. 6. <hi>q. d.</hi> you ſay I am your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I am your Maſter, and I am your God; well, out of your owne mouthes I will judge you; why then did you honour me no more? why did yee regard mee no more? yee cared not for mee, yee did not looke after mee, you had little or no heart after me; your owne mouthes have even caſt you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ye can have no other excuſe; can you<note place="margin">2</note> ſay you could not beleeve in my name? ye could not forgoe ſuch and ſuch luſts at my command? why then would you goe for my ſervants? you ſhould have ſaid ſo plainely, and not daily have come into my Courts, as if you would obey me; nor taken up the profeſſion of my Worſhip as if you would goe through ſtitch with it; why would you come to my Table, as though my promiſes belonged unto you? if ye could not doe as I bade you, you ſhould not have borne me in hand as though you would; now yee have played the Hypocrites and drawne neere to me with your lips, and taken my name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your mouthes, whereas yee would not be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by me; <hi>What had you to doe with my Covenant, that you muſt needs he medling with it?</hi> Pſalme. 50. 16. if yee would not obey it, yee ſhould have let it alone; ſo that ye ſee, that to have a naked name to live, is an inexcuſable thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42059:119"/>Seventhly, it is an unprofitable thing; a naked<note place="margin">7</note> name will doe us no good; when the Jewes truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the name that they had, O they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they were Gods onely peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they had his Covenant, and his Oracles, and his Temple; O the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord; they hoped well, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus much to ſay for themſelves; but marke what God tels them, <hi>behold you truſt in lying words that cannot profit,</hi> Jeremy. 7. 8. this would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them one jot, becauſe they did not verifie the name they had. So the <hi>Galathians</hi> they preſumed mightily on this, that they were Chriſtians; as for making good this holy name, that they gave no heed to at all; they would have the Ceremonies; when <hi>Paul</hi> told them of their faults, they would not liſten unto him may they counted him their Enemy; they would have the Ceremonies of the Law; well, the Apoſtle told them plainly, that if they would not be ruled, their name would doe them no good. <hi>Behold I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> Galathians. 5. 2, <hi>q. d.</hi> you beare your ſelves upon Chriſt, and yet will not doe as he would have you doe, yee will doe what yee liſt; but let me tell you, if yee will not reforme, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing; you ſay you beleive in Jeſus Chriſt, I but it ſhall profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: So when the people there in <hi>Iſay</hi> reſted in this, they came to Gods houſe, they gave him Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice every morning and evening, they did thus and thus, and ſo they had a name for his peculiar people; the Prophet aſſures them, this ſhould not profit them one whit. <hi>I will declare thy righteouſneſſe and thy workes,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42059:119"/>
                  <hi>for they ſhall not profit thee,</hi> Iſaiah. 57. 12. Thou prayeſt and doeſt many good duties, and ſo thou gettteſt thy ſelfe a name; yea but if thou doſt not ſoundly and throughly anſwer that name, God will declare all thy righteouſneſſe and all thy profeſſion, and all thy good duties, and none of them all ſhall profit thee; in that day he will declare what rotten things they have been, how heartleſſe, how liveleſſe, how dead-hearted all thy duties have been, and they ſhall doe thee no good; and indeed what good can a name doe a man? true faith alone does juſtifie, not the name of it; true peace of conſcience does comfort, not the name of it; true intereſt in God gives a man a chearefull acceſſe to God, not the name of it.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, it is not onely unprofitable, but alſo<note place="margin">8.</note> it is hurtfull. It is hurtfull unto others; a bare name I ſay without ſubſtance and truth is hurtfull unto others. It is hurtfull unto them that are without; for when they ſee how lazy ſuch as goe for profeſſors, be, how they have little elſe in them but talking and profeſſing, and prating and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, otherwiſe they are as vaine and as covetous and as having as other men, no ſtrictneſſe no pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, no holineſſe, no humbleneſſe of minde, no love, no forgiving one another, no forbearing one another, no brotherly Kindneſſe, no Union nor Communion, no power in their Prayers, no gravity non authority in their ſpeeches, no Heavenlineſſe in their converſation, no brokenneſſe of heart, this hardens the hearts of them that are without, and makes them all thinke that Religion is a matter of nothing; thus they doe a great deale of hurt unto others; the
<pb facs="tcp:42059:120"/>
profeſſing Wife to the prophane Husband, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſervant to his profane Maſter, the profeſſing Neighbour to his prophane Neighbour; whereas if they were godly indeed, and humble indeed, and as their name does import, indeed they would doe a great deale of good, but now they doe a great deale of hurt.</p>
               <p>Againe, they doe a great deale of hurt unto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers on; many a man that is ſmitten at the Word, that begins Reformation and amendement and gives good hopes that hee will come to ſomething in the end; when hee lights upon ſuch Sardian Saints, that are ſo in name, but there is no life at all in them, theſe put him backe againe, and make him ſet up his ſtaffe before hee ſees halfe way, like the dead body of <hi>Amaſa</hi> that made the people ſtand ſtill.</p>
               <p>Againe, they doe a great deale of hurt unto the Saints of God, ſometimes by deceiving of their hearts and cooling of their zeale and fervour, or if they cannot doe that; then they hate them, and prove very ſhye of them, and gird them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde their backs, and doe them much miſchiefe, as <hi>Paul</hi> complains, <hi>hee was in perils among falſe Brethren,</hi> 2 Corinthians 11. 26. that is, thoſe that had a name to be Brethren in Chriſt, but were not ſo indeed, hee was in perils many times and often by them; againe they increaſe the diſgraces and ſufferings of Gods true Saints and Children; for while they ſeeme to be Saints good enough themſelves, the other that are Saints indeede, are rejected of all, and thought to be beſides their wits.</p>
               <p>Againe, they do a great deale of hurt to themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:42059:120"/>
for it had beene better for them they had never had a name, then having a name not to be as the name does require.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, Firſt, let mee tell what uſe yee muſt not make of it; namely, to beate downe the having of a name, for all the Lords people ſhould be carefull of having of a name. <hi>I will give them a name of Sonnes and Daughters, nay a better name then ſo,</hi> Iſaiah 56. 5. yea, and the people of God ſhould make conſcience of a name before men; <hi>A good name is betier then pretious Oyntment,</hi> Eccles 7. 1. and the ſervants of God have had a name; <hi>Demetrius</hi> had a good report of all men, yea of the truth it ſelfe too; and therefore they are blacke mouths of Hell that object againſt good people, that they are Hypocrites, they doe thus and thus to have a name. This is no newes, for the World hath alwayes dealt thus with the Saints in all Ages; <hi>Paul</hi> was counted the great impoſter of the World; <hi>O ſayee hee, wee are deceivers and yet true,</hi> 2 Corinthians 6. 8. that is, the World gives us a name for deceivers, and yet wee are true; Yee know what was ſayd of Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe, ſome ſayd of him hee was a good man, others ſayd nay, Hee was a deceiver of the people; it was ſayd of <hi>David,</hi> that Hee was a ſubtle man, a crafty Fox, and that Hee was a meere Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, it was <hi>Sauls</hi> judgement of him. Thus the Saints have a nick name put on them; the World thinkes they are Hypocrites, and that they have ſiniſter ends in what they doe, and whereas they make ſuch a ſhew, it is but in Hypocriſy, that they may deceive, and that they may have a Name for Religious people; ſo that the World would faine

put downe the having of a Name. But that is a Devilliſh uſe; wee muſt not make ſuch a uſe of this point, No; the Lord does not finde fault with <hi>Sardis</hi> for having of a Name that they lived, but that they had this Name when as they were dead; if they had beene alive, the Name to be alive had beene well; well then what uſe muſt wee make of this point?</p>
               <p>The Firſt Uſe then is this, to ſhew the miſery<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> of the Church of Rome, which hath a Name to live, and in their owne judgement and a great part of Chriſtendome, is the onely true Church, but in the judgement of God it is dead, and therefore ſtarke naught; ſome ſay its a body full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and whoſe throat is cut, but yet the heart pants, and life is therein; But the truth is, its ſtarke dead, and hath no manner of ſpirituall life, What though they have the Sacrament of Baptiſme? ſo had <hi>Edom</hi> circumciſion, and yet they were never counted a Church of God; And what's a Seale to a blanke? what though they have the Scriptures among them and the Articles of our Creede? that does not make a Church; for Ptolomy and all Aegypt had the Bible, and yet that did not make them a Church; if the Scriptures might have their owne ſenſe, it were another matter; but they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terturne it with their expoſition, and make it in their ſenſe to be a fardell of Doctrine of Divels; and what though Antichriſt bee ſaid to ſit in the Temple of God? yet his Body is a Synagogue of Satan. There is no life in that Church. But to come neerer to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>This may bee ſaid of them, of our Churches too,
<pb facs="tcp:42059:122"/>
and of our Congregations; they have onely a Name to live, though wee might live well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; for wee have the Doctrine of Life, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, yet in regard of our converſations for the moſt part, wee may ſay it is but onely a Name. For how does ſinne reigne among us everywhere, Coveteouſneſſe, Profaneſſe, fulneſſe of Bread, Luſt, Security, as it were in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, deadneſſe of heart, Formality; now where ſuch ſinnes doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, there the power of godlineſſe muſt needs bee away; generally our Aſſemblies content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an outward profeſſion, if they goe ſo farre, they have but a Name to live. True, wee are a Church, ſo was <hi>Sardis</hi> though ſhee had hardly any thing but a Name, yet ſhee was a Church, as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſhewes, <hi>waſhed in the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Revelations, 1. 4, 5. for they had a few Names that were ſo, but the body had onely a bare name; ſo it is with us, wee are not nullifyed from being a Church, for God hath his choſen among us though they bee very few, here one and there one that live indeede and in truth; yet the Bodies and Bulkes of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, have onely a Name, if that; no Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, no good Order, no thorough Reformation nay Cages of uncleane Birds; nay ſuch as profeſſe better then the multitude, little better then titular and morall Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Nay, are not all things almoſt growne to bee a ſole Name? What is the Preaching almoſt but the bare Name of Preaching? For converſion of Soules where is it? the pulling people out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan where it it? a thouſand Sermons may be, and hardly one wrought upon? wee may be ſayd to
<pb facs="tcp:42059:123"/>
be fiſhermen; but it is turned only into a name, for when doe we catch any?</p>
               <p>So for hearing of the Word. True, it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and yet not ſo common as it ought to bee, for many care little whether they heare or no. But that that is, there's hardly ought left but the Name; for who heares with trembling, who mingles his hearing with faith, who drinkes the Word, as the Earth doth the Raine, who does what hee heares, without which all hearing is no better then an empty Name?</p>
               <p>So for comming to the Sacrament, is not that made a name too? ſetting a ſide the Name of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament now and then, what have wee elſe? who feeds upon Jeſus Chriſt? who comes to the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Faith? who hath Faith at all, that it may bee increaſed? Who comes to it with preparedneſſe? who ſits at the Lords Table with a Wedding Garment? who goes away nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up any more unto eternall Life? without the which all our Sacraments are but naturall things.</p>
               <p>So for holy Conference, unleſſe it bee the Name of it, what is there of the thing it ſelfe left? may bee a few curſory words of goodneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee part, but no quickning of one another up, no exhorting of one another, no comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one another, or admoniſhing one another; nay wee are growne to bee aſhamed of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and for Prayer, but that wee take Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fall downe on our Knees, and ſay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Confeſſions, and Petitions, there is little elſe done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42059:123"/>Come wee to the Graces of Gods Holy Spirit, without the which a man is Dead in treſpaſſes and in ſins, &amp;c. as Faith, Repentance, peace of Conſcience, and Love, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another uſe is of terror againſt us;<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> doe wee thinke that the Lord will endure this at our hands? Hee hath endured it too too long, but Hee will not ſuffer it alwayes. Hee hath a Spirituall thunder-clappe that Hee lets ſlye againſt this ſinne; <hi>The vile perſon ſhall bee no more called liberall, nor the Churle bee ſaid to bee bountifull,</hi> Iſaiah, 32. 5. That is, the Lord will unmaske all ſuch perſons, Hee will plucke of all their Names, and they ſhall have a Name fit for their natures, and Hee will doe this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in their owne Conſciences, if wee will<note place="margin">1.</note> not bee awakened to bee as wee have a Name to bee, the LORD will make our owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to call us Reprobates as wee are, and then what will our Name doe us good, when our owne Conſciences ſhall tell us wee are naught, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us in our Boſomes? what ſhall wee bee the better for our Neighbours judging well of us? Our Neighbours may bee thinke wee Pray well; what a poore thing is this, when Conſcience ſhall ſay no? our Neighbours may hope wee ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good ground, when Conſcience ſhall ſay no; Men call us godly, and Conſcience ſhall ſay nay but yee are not. <hi>What a ſhame was it to the Iewes when they were convicted by their owne Conſciences?</hi> Joh. 8. 9. It is not the Name of joy and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that will give their Conſciences true Peace, no, no; Conſcience knowes another name is ſit for
<pb facs="tcp:42059:124"/>
us. Unbeliefe, and Ungodlineſſe, and Hardneſſe of Heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, againe Hee will doe it in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">2.</note> of others; if wee reſt in a Name, the Lord will detect us at laſt before others; and then what a ſhame will this bee? as <hi>David</hi> ſayes of <hi>Doeg,</hi> the Lord would diſcover him; Hee would make all the good people round about ſay of Him, <hi>Lo this is the Man, that tooke not GOD for his ſtrength,</hi> Pſalme 52. 7. So hee will doe with us. <hi>Lo, this is the Man, that had ſuch a Name to Live. Lo, this is the Man;</hi> now wee ſee here's a wretch, now wee ſee how hee deceived his owne ſoule; hee never truely ſought GOD in all his life; hee was not the Man that wee tooke him for; hee built upon the Sand, hee did not lay a good foundation, and therefore now hee is tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled downe, and what is become of his name? Now hee ſhewes himſelfe in his Colours, now wee ſee hee is an Enemy of GOD, hee can ſide with the Times, hee can embrace this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent VVorld, hee hath no eternall life abiding in him.</p>
               <p>Nay, the Lord will not onely doe thus with us, if wee reſt in a Name, but alſo hee will pour his Wrath upon us otherwiſe too; yee may read how that this was the reaſon why the Lord drowned all the old World; not onely the wickedneſſe of them that were without; for if they that profeſſed Religion, had beene ſound, they might have prevented the Deluge, and prayed it away. But they that profeſſed Religion, had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Name. <hi>The Sonnes of GOD ſaw the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42059:124"/>
                  <hi>of men that they were faire,</hi> Geneſis 6. 2. That is, the Sonnes of God, they were onely ſo in Name, their workes plainely ſhewed that they were onely ſo in Name, therefore the Lord ſwept them all away; So the Lord will pour bitter things on us, if wee bee Chriſtians onely in Name, and the ſervants of CHRIST onely in Name, if wee bee not ſo indeede; nay, this is not all, but wee ſhall have a deeper Portion in Hell too then Pagans or Papiſts, or any in our owne Land; the more wee have borne of his Name, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſhall our damnation bee, if wee doe not really anſwer the Holy Name wherewith wee are called. Wee may ſee this in the Man in the Goſpell; <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither? Binde him hand and ſoote, caſt him into utter darkeneſſe where is weeping, &amp;c.</hi> Matthew 22. 12. 13. <hi>Come Friend, how came you in hither?</hi> marke, hee had the Name of a friend of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore the Text ſayes hee was ſpeechleſſe, hee had nothing to ſay for himſelfe, his damnation had nothing to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it; other people ſhall have ſomething to ſay for themſelves to leſſen their damnation; but thoſe that have a Name to live ſhall not have the leaſt ſyllable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then let another uſe bee to humble<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> our hearts, let us goe to God in humiliation of heart, as the poore prodigall Sonne did, and downe on the knees of our ſoules and bodies, and ſay, <hi>Lord, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy, to bee called thy Sonne,</hi> Luke 15. 21. So as many of us as are guilty of this ſinne, (as who almoſt is not and that in a horrible manner?) let us ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:42059:125"/>
Lord, I have beene called a Chriſtian, I have beene called a child of thine, I have had the Name a good while; but O what a Wretch have I beene! I am not worthy of this Name, I have ſinned againſt heaven and in thy ſight, I have not anſwered the Name I have had, and therefore it were juſt with thee to cut mee aſunder with Hypocrites, and ſo fling mee downe to Hell.</p>

The firſt particular was this, <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt:</hi> all theſe have been delivered already, now followes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond particular reproof, <hi>And art dead.</hi> Here the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what Chriſt meanes by <hi>dead.</hi> By <hi>dead,</hi> he does not mean dead in errors and hereſies, though theſe be called deadly poyſons, and may make a Church dead. <hi>For the truth is called the word of life,</hi> Phil. 2. 16. and wholeſome Doctrine, as the Apoſtle cals it, and ergo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and hereſies, theſe poyſon &amp; dead any people that drink them in. But this cannot be the meaning here, for we ſee no ſuch thing here laid to their charge, it ſhould ſeeme this Church was an orthodox Church; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>dead</hi> does he meane prophane wicked manners, though they make a people dead too, as we ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall Sonne that had been given to prophane and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute courſes, his Father ſayes, <hi>he was dead in thoſe dayes,</hi> Luke 15. 24. Yet this cannot be the meaning neither; for this Church had a name to live, and it had this name among the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, which had more wit, then to Judge them to be alive, if they had been ſo
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42059:126"/>
palpably wicked; no, it ſeemes they were an excellent Church to ſee to, a good Miniſtry to ſee to, but both dead; ſo then this is the meaning. For all their ſeeming to be alive, they were indeed dead; as the Apoſtle ſayes of himſelfe, before he was quickned by Chriſt Jeſus, He was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ſin revived, and I dyed</hi> Rom. 7. 9. yet he was as jolly a good man as any other, and yet he confeſſes he was dead; ſo they were dead for the moſt part; and thoſe that were not all out dead, yet they were dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and without life in Gods wayes. For as it was with the Moraller Heathen they did the things contained in the Law, yet they were dead; ſo a people may doe the things contained in the Goſpell too, and yet be dead; people may beleeve; yet as <hi>Iames</hi> ſayes, <hi>their ſaith be dead ſaith,</hi> Jam. 2. 26. namely when their faith is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, ſo people may have goodly works, for the morall part of them, and yet doe them with a dead heart; to be ſober and temperate, and loving, and chaſte and civilly humble, and meek and diligent in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and known to frequent all the ordinances of God, in publik &amp; in private, theſe are outwardly good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet may be in the number of thoſe works that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cals <hi>dead works,</hi> Heb. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that liveth, and beleeveth in me</hi> Joh. 11. 26. faith without life is but equivocally termed faith; ſo it is not enough to hope in God, except we doe it with life; <hi>he hath begetten us againe to a lively hope ſays</hi> Peter. So it is not enough to be a member in Gods Church, a Stone in Gods build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except we be lively Stones, <hi>Ye alſo as lively Stones ſayes he,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. The like I may ſay of all the duties of Religion, it is not enough to doe them, but we muſt doe them with life, as to pray, to pray with a dead heart is nothing; no ſayes David, <hi>Lord quicken us and we will call upon thy name,</hi> Pſal. 80. 18. In a word not to heape par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; we cannot walk in any of Gods wayes aright as long as we walke in them with a dead heart, as the pſalmiſt ſayes; <hi>Lord quicken thou me in thy way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 37. it is a poore thing to walk in Gods wayes onely for the matter of them; That indeed a dead heart may doe, there's no duty that God bids a man doe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be them that conſignifie life, but fleſh and blood may doe it, for the matter of it, if there be matter and forme in it. True, ſome duties are ſimple that fleſh and blood cannot doe, as to love God, to delight in God, to have communion with God himſelf; to take God for ones Portion and Lot, and inheritance, &amp; to be all in all to him, theſe are ſimple acts, they are not compounded of matter and forme. But when a duty is compounded of matter and forme, fleſh and blood may doe the matter of it, whatſoever it be; now then as the eſſentiall forme is the life of the matter, ſo the matter without it is a dead matter; and the doing of it dead.</p>
               <p>Well then now we ſee what is meant by dead; the next is, what is the meaning of <hi>Thou? Thou art dead,</hi> the word hath a double relation, the one to the Miniſter of the Church in Sardis; thou art dead, thy Miniſtry is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42059:127"/>
dead; the other to the Church in Sardis it ſelfe: thou art dead, thou art a dead people. Firſt it hath relation to the Miniſtry, thou art dead, thy Miniſtry is dead, there's no life in it at all; hence the Doctrine is this, that a dead Miniſtry is as good as no Miniſtry at all, for this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<note place="margin">Dect.</note> meanes, in regard of the Angell of the Church in Sardis q. d. thy Miniſtry is little better then no Miniſtry; it is ſtark dead well neare, it is not lively at all, there is little or no warmth to be had by it. Like the Miniſtry of the Scribes <hi>that had no authority nor power at all in it</hi> Mat. 7. 29. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid when he heard a cold Sermon, cold, cold, cold, ſayes he, this is cold Preaching, here is no heat at all to be gotten; as God ſayes of the Miniſtry of <hi>Laodicia; Thou art luke-warme,</hi> Rom. 3. 16. that is, as there was no heat in his people, ſo there was no heat in his Miniſtry; this is little better then no Preaching at all, it is even as good as nothing. Firſt, becauſe true preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is lively preaching when the Miniſter is a ſtirring Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>I think it meet to ſtirre you up,</hi> a Pet. 1. 13. when the Miniſter is earneſt to ſave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſoules; as the Lord ſayes, <hi>I earneſtly proteſted to your Fathers,</hi> Jer. 11. 7. He ſpeakes of the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets down along untill the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> time; they did not onely witneſſe the word of God unto the people, but they did it in a lively and earneſt manner; as <hi>Paul</hi> did, I <hi>have ſtriven to Preach the Goſpell,</hi> Rom. 15. 20. marke he belaboured him in the Pulpit, he lay about him ſoundly, that his Miniſtry might have life in it. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſhewes, <hi>that he had ſweaty Handker-chiefes,</hi> Act. 19. 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Hugo</hi> ſayes upon the place, it ſeemes he ſwet much in preaching, and ſo Chriſt compares Miniſters to Harveſt men, that labour in Gods Harveſt; ye know Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt men are hot at their worke, ſo Miniſters ſhould be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42059:127"/>
Harveſt men, they ſhould be hot at their worke. Thus ye ſee dry and dull Preaching is little better then no preaching at all, it is contrary to the manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contrary to the practice of all true and right prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a dead Miniſtry is called no Miniſtry; the<note place="margin">2</note> Scripture calls it no Miniſtry in effect. The Scripture is the beſt Judge what is a true Miniſtry, and what is not? now the Scripture makes a dead Miniſtry, and no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry all one: the Scribes and the Phariſees, ye know were partly morall men moſt of them, as we may ſee by <hi>Pauls</hi> Teſtimony of himſelf, and they were orthodox Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as our Saviour witneſſes of them in the maine, for our Saviour bids people heare them, yet their Miniſtry was little better then no Miniſtry; as the Text ſhewes, the people that ſate under their Miniſtry, are ſaid to be <hi>as ſheep having no Shepheard,</hi> Mat. 9. 36. they preacht as if they did not preach; people might come to their Sermons and be neere a jot moved; nay, ſuch as came with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be quickned, could get no quickning at all under them, <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayes they ſate under darkneſſe yet for all them. Theſe are Idoll Sheepheards; <hi>wo to the Idoll Shepheards,</hi> Zach. 11. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a dead Miniſtry does doe little or no good;<note place="margin">3.</note> though it be never ſo true, yet it is very unfruitfull; it does not awaken any of the auditory, it does not ſtartle any of the hearers, it does not rowze up mens hearts, it does not grapple with the obſtinate, it does not pull down the proud, neither does it carry life at all with it, neither is it ſitted to work upon the conſcience; you may ſee an example of this in the Angell of the Church of Sardic. a dead Miniſter, a dead people, as he was dead himſelfe, ſo his people were dead too; a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42059:128"/>
Miniſtry does a great deale of good, <hi>it even is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veur of life unto life unto thoſe that be of God, or elſe the ſavour of death unto death, unto thoſe that be not of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. it ever workes one way, either it makes people rage, or it fats people up, or elſe it drives people home unto God; which way ſo ever it works, it is a ſweet ſavour unto God, it glorifies God; but a dead Miniſtry does neither, it is a flat weapon and cuts not, it is a blunt Sword and wounds not; may be it hath the true words of God, but they are not in a wiſe work mans hands to make them as Goads and ſharp Nayles; partly good points, but not pointed to prick any bodies heart; it is ſaid when <hi>Paul</hi> Preacht, ſome went away converted, <hi>others went away blaſpheming,</hi> Act. 13. 45. 48.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a dead Miniſtry, God ſeldom goes along<note place="margin">4.</note> with it, nay, that's the life of a Miniſtry, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſeekes God to goe along with him; now a dead Miniſtry God goes not along with it, a lively Miniſtery Chriſt goes along with it, <hi>So I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28. 20. if there be any of Chriſts ſheep in the pariſh, a lively Miniſtery does aſſuredly one time or other finde them out; thoſe that are not Chriſt his ſheep, a lively Miniſtry hewes them all downe, ſlayes all their Souls, ripens them apace for hell and for the pit. But a dead Miniſtry, the Lord does not goe along with that, the Lord does not Crowne it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a dead Miniſtry prophanes the word of God, it makes it ſeeme nothing worth; it does not hold forth<note place="margin">5.</note> the glory of the Lord, nay, it hides it, &amp; keeps it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen, either by dwelling upon Generals, and whats that but hiding? for people will confeſſe the word in generall, they ſee it the generall, all their blindneſſe is in particulars, there they ſlip away, like Fiſh out of a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42059:128"/>
broad Net; or elſe by delivering it ſo coldly, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think it no great matter; a lively Miniſtry holds forth it lets out God into the conſcience, it gives people to underſtand they come upon life and death, it makes people looke about them, it makes people conſider all that ever they have done, it ſlaſhes the word of God into their hearts, as a light to diſcover all their wayes; it gives them a view of their Chriſtian eſtate, either one way or other; as it is ſaid of <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry, <hi>The word of the Lord was glorified by it,</hi> Act. 13. 48. But a dead Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry prophanes it, it vailes the glory of it, it lets people ſit quiet under it; it diſeaſes no ſinner, where as if it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Gods word, it would either trouble them, or turne them.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, firſt here we ſee the reaſon why a<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> dead Miniſtry is not houted at but applauded in the world; why, it is as good as no Miniſtry at all; it does not make the devill roar, it lets people ſleep in their ſins; whereas a lively Miniſtry can hardly come into a pulpit but preſently he is halfe a martyr, <hi>Briers and Thornes were with</hi> Ezechiel, Ezek. 2. 6. lively Miniſters cannot give the world any good content; they fought againſt <hi>Jeremy,</hi> they played the wolves againſt the Apoſtles of Jeſus. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was counted too ſterne and auſtere, and <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes it is impoſſible for a man to be a true lively preacher of Gods word and not be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; there's an utter antipathy between the world and ſuch a one, the world and ſuch a Miniſter can no better agree together then light and darkneſſe; ſuch a Miniſtry ſtands in the worlds light, it makes the world ſee their works are evill, it detects, it ſhames, it oppoſes their ſinnes that the world tumbles in, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>I have given them thy word, and the world hates them becauſe they</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:42059:129"/>
                  <hi>are not of the world,</hi> Joh. 17. 14 &amp; therefore there cannot be a lively Miniſtry any where, but the world hath a ſling at it; but now let a man have a dead Miniſtry, thats let alone, that may ſtand long enough; that never comes home to men to ſhew them their ill eſtates, the devils dawbers, the devils upholſters, that doe not pluck mens pillowes away from under their arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, that deale gently with men, and they may do what they liſt for all them, theſe are the worlds mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and applauded at all hands; what a thing is this? whereas a dead Miniſtry is the undoing of mens ſoules; it lets men periſh and never drawes them back.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may ſerve to reprove us, that are<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, I deſire to ſpeak to my ſelf, eſpecially that we are no more lively in our Miniſtry; that our Miniſtry hath no more edge upon it to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this horny thick skin age: we complaine of much dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe now a dayes; alack how if we be found guilty of it, that we preach no more quickningly! I confeſſe, bleſſed be God we have ſo much lively preaching left yet among us, that woe be to them that are dead and have to grace of life. But O that our Miniſtry had more lively-hood in it; that it were more exciting, and provoking. <hi>Iſ the Apoſtles of Chriſt complained of dull hearers,</hi> Heb. 5. 11. how many dull hearers have we! why then ſhall we make our ſoules guilty of their dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? the deader people be we had need to be the quicker in our Miniſtry, or elſe we cannot ſay we are pure from their blood don't we ſee how many people are very neer the Children of wrath; how they cannot be ſaved except they be juſtified and ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt; how few are ſo; how hard a thing it is to awaken mens hearts; nay, the world and the cares of this life, carry their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42059:129"/>
minds quite and cleane away; how ſcarce any almoſt ſeriouſly conſider their latter end? don't we ſee how the devill tempts, how the fleſh and the world reigne in moſt, and how little religion we have up and down? the Saints ſcarce, the wicked many; times very bad, the ſhortneſſe of life, the irrecoverable eſtate after death? the immortality of the ſoule, the paines of hell, and the joyes of heaven, and how that without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God, how ſhould we beſtirre our ſelves to beat theſe truths into mens minds, that they may be bethinke themſelves and flee from the wrath to come? The cold preaching of ſuch weighty things cleane cozens the world, ſo that they hardly conceive any great matter in the buſineſſe; live and dye, &amp; periſh for ever in their ſinnes, and we give them ſuch faint warnings, that no wonder ſo few do take any warning; we found the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet too too low, that ſcarce any almoſt prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; we come into the pulpit, but we doe little or no thing there, may be we preach good doctrine, but we doe not preſſe it to the quick, that the conſcience may feele; we doe not bleed for our peoples ſecurity, and though they do not heare, how little does our ſoul weep in ſecret or melt in publik? <hi>Bucolcerus</hi> that admirable live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preacher, was wont to ſay, that a Miniſter ſhould preach <hi>flebiliter, obſecratorie, anxie, humiliter, expectore, cum gemitu;</hi> that is, a Miniſter ſhould preach mournfully over peoples ſoules, beſeechingly, anxiouſly, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, heartily, groningly; as it is ſaid of our Saviour Chriſt, he groned for the peoples unbeliefe; now when our Miniſtry is deadiſh, as though we cared not much whether people doe our doctrine or no, whether they be damned or no; this is a lamentable thing. The poore ſoules of our hearers may ſay to us, as the diſciples of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42059:130"/>
Chriſt ſaid to Chriſt, and more juſtly, they ſaid it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly to him, <hi>Maſter careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> Mark 4. 38. he was aſleep, and they awakened him, <hi>Maſter careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> more juſtly may our people ſay ſo to us, O ſirs, <hi>doe not ye care that we periſh?</hi> they may even come and awaken us, Sirs, <hi>Care ye not that we periſh?</hi> doe not you ſee how dead we are, how heardned, how Ignorant of God, how empty of grace, how backward to that which is good; how prone to looſe our ſoules; <hi>and doe not you care that we periſh?</hi> why doe not you labour more to quicken us, and move us, and to drive us out of our by wayes, that we may come into the right way and live? when <hi>Archippus</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dead in his Miniſtry, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids the people of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> to goe and awaken him; ſay to <hi>Archippus, Take heed to the Miniſtry which thou haſt received in the Lord that thou fulfill it,</hi> Col. 4. 17. well then.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another uſe is an uſe of exhortation, that we<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> labour for a quickning Miniſtry, that our Miniſtry be a reviving ordinance of God; that we may as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſay, <hi>though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious,</hi> Iſa. 49. 5. ſo though our people be not quick end <hi>yet ſhall we be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> we have done what in us lyes for to quicken them.</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt, this is the end of all true Miniſters<note place="margin">1.</note> preaching, that they may bring life into the hearers hearts; as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>Heare, and your ſoules ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. wherefore elſe doe we preach, but that the dead may heare the voyce of the Sonne of God and live? people are alive to that which they ſhould be dead unto, and they are dead to that which they ſhould be alive unto, they are alive to the world, and the things of the world, and dead to God and all goodneſſe, dead to the humbling of their ſoules, dead to the ſeeking
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42059:130"/>
of God, dead to Prayer, dead to the holy communion of the Saints, dead to holy comfort and meditation, and what ever elſe may doe their ſoules good? now wherefore doe we preach, if not to quicken up your hearts, that your ſoules may live for ever; they have knowledge already, more knowledge then they are quickened up to; our maine intention then ſhould be to quicken them up to doe what they know; are we not ſowers of ſeed? why then we ſhould moſt labour ſo to plow and harrow and till the ground, that our ſeed may quicken; this is the very end of preaching, that our hearers may heare and live.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is the end of all true Miniſters preaching<note place="margin">2.</note> ſo it is the nature of all true and right preaching; either to quicken, or to be a fitted inſtrument of quickening; when <hi>David</hi> heard the word, it quickened his heart, <hi>thy word hath quicken me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 50. and indeed it is never heard nor preacht aright, unleſſe it be in a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning way; &amp; therefore let us not think it is only the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Text, and the ſpeaking of good and wholſome truths, but let us ever remember what right preaching is, that our Miniſtry be quickning, that God may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our ſoules, and accompany our words, and teach us how to go beyond the policy of mens hearts, and direct us how to drive the truth home to the quick, to anſwer the evaſions of fleſh and blood, and ſo put his live coale into our ſpeeches, that our Sermons may be warming.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us conſider this is onely profitable preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">3.</note> we may preach all the dayes of our life, and our people ſtird no more then a mill-poſt, unleſſe our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be quickening; they may heare what we ſay, but unleſſe we could quicken their hearts, they will forget all again; it may be they may remember the doctrin, but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42059:131"/>
I meane they will forget to doe what they heare; it is the quickening that makes any remember to practiſe; as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them theu haſt quichened me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 93. we can never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that friend whom our hearts doe moſt dearely affect; ſo when our Miniſtry doth quicken and affect peoples hearts, they will never forget what they have heard; The quickening of the come in the earth, makes it the faſter in the earth, it twiſts about the earth, it gets a rooting if it quicken; ſo it is with our Sermons, if they be quickening, they get about peoples ſoules, and will not out againe; otherwiſe they are never the nearer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let us conſider this kinde of preaching onely<note place="margin">4.</note> will yeeld us true comfort; when our Miniſtry is lively in our pariſh, as <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> when we can ſay to our people, You hath God quickened by us, as he ſayes, <hi>you hath he quickened, who were dead,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. I dare ſay it was a great comfort to his ſoule, to ſee that his Miniſtry was quickening; nay, if our Miniſtry be quickening, though none be quickened by it, but two or three, nay, though none at all, yet we ſhall have comfort; whereas when we have preacht 1000 times in a dead hearted manner never labouring to creep into mens conſciences, nor to be Miniſters of life, we ſhall have no comfort on our death-beds; nay our owne hearts will tell us, we have preached often indeed, but we never preached Chriſt Jeſus, we never flung our hearts among our people, as one ſaid of the good Biſhop <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi> he flung his heart among his people. But when our conſciences can ſay, we are not hearty for God, we are not earneſt to ſave our peoples ſoules, we did not goe the way to doe them good; this will lye as lead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our boſomes when we dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:42059:131"/>Fifthly, a dead Miniſtry, is but the bare name of a<note place="margin">5</note> Miniſtry, it is little better then meer voyce; as the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid, when he heard how ſweetly the Nightingall ſang, O thought he, ſurely that Bird is good meat if I had it; and ſo when he took it, and eat it, and found but little meat in it, he ſaid, <hi>voxes &amp; praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea nihil;</hi> now I ſee thou art meere voyce and nothing elſe; ſo a dead Miniſtry it may have a great name of a good Miniſtry, and a man may deſire to live under it, O let me live under ſuch a Miniſtry, but when he comes to it, and thinks to receive much benefit by it, he finds it to be little better then a name.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, a dead Miniſtry is not a ſigne to our people;<note place="margin">6</note> Miniſters ſhould be ſignes to the people, thus <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is unto you a ſigne, according as he hath done, ſo ſhall ye doe. <hi>A voyce,</hi> Ezek 24. 24. true, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was <hi>a voyce,</hi> Iſa. 40. 3. I but he was more then a <hi>voyce,</hi> he was a burning and a ſhining light, there was life and heat in his Miniſtry, he was not a meere <hi>voyce.</hi> But when ones Miniſtry is but a meere <hi>voyce,</hi> little good comes of ſuch a Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another uſe is for direction; to ſhew what<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> a lively Miniſtry is, and how we may have a true lively Miniſtry, that is in one word to preach with affection; as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſays of Eloquution, affections are the ſoule and life of Eloqution; ſo I may ſay of preaching, affections are the life of preaching; now by affections, I doe not meane feigned and forced affections, they are no affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions indeed, but when a man preaches ſo for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner indeed, affectionate matter, and with a true affected heart, that he may move the hearts of men; as one ſays the world is now full of knowledge, as a drunkard is full of wine, that his ſtomack is not able to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42059:132"/>
digeſt; ſo I ſay, people have more knowledge, then they can well digeſt, the ſtomack wants heat to concoct it for their good; as <hi>Rodolphus Agricola</hi> ſpeakes, any man that hath learning may teach; but to move the heart and affections, it requires more a great deale. This is lively preaching, when a Miniſter ſets himſelf to be in mens boſoms; what alively preacher was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> you may ſee by his dealing with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> he made the Kings heart even yearne againe with his ſpeaking; the King confeſt how his ſpeaking worked within his boſom, <hi>almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian,</hi> Act. 26. 28. ſo you may ſee by the Galatians, his preaching did not onely convert many of them, but thoſe whom he did not convert, he did wonderfully work upon their hearts, <hi>that they could have be contented to have pluckt out their eyes, &amp; have given them to him,</hi> Gal. 4. 15. ſuch a lively preacher was he in the ſecond of Judges, that when he preacht, he ſet all the people a melting, a weeping, like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that had been beaten Judg. 2. 4. 5. I grant it may be the beſt and livelieſt Miniſters under heaven cannot do ſo now, peoples hearts are more hardned. But yet though we cannot undertake to move any one mans heart, that's the worke of God, yet our Miniſtry may be lively.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by labouring to make the things that we preach<note place="margin">1.</note> as it were lively before peoples eyes; as the Apoſtle preached Chriſt <hi>crucified,</hi> even as if he were <hi>crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his peoples eyes,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> had a very lively Miniſtry; the Text ſayes, he ſet before them life and death; he laboured to preach with that evidence, as if he had ſet before their eyes life &amp; death, heaven and hell, good and evill; when a Miniſter preaches in <hi>the evidence, and the demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. when he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42059:132"/>
labours to bring the Goſpell plainly to mens hearts; a man may teach the Goſpell, but it is not preaching, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he ſet it lively forth, and labour to make people ſee it, this is the truth, and this is your ſinne againſt that truth, this is the doctrine, and thus you faile in the doctrine, this is the threatning of God, and thus you lye under the threatning; otherwiſe they heare a Sermon, as if it did not concern them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, coming to particulars; generals are but<note place="margin">2.</note> dead; we ſee they leave people dead, people have a hundred tricks to put them off; but when a preacher comes to particulars, he either quickens or ſlayes, he convinces either to life or to death; when a Miniſter layes the truth at every mans doore, he preſſes it upon every mans heart, he meets with many a put off, he makes every conſcience, ſay I am the man, except they be aſleep or their minds are a wooll-gathering, he darts into his hearers faces, a view of their particular eſtates; he toucheth their copy-hold, he confutes their falſe pleas, and knocks off the fingers that would be applying of a promiſe when it does not concern them, &amp; puts it onely upon the ſoule to whom it does belong. This is lively preaching, that gives to every ſoule his due, terror to whom teror, comfort to whom comfort belongs; milk to the Babe, ſtrong meat to the grown, oyle to the bruiſed, and a ſword into the hard heart, a whip for the Horſe, and a Bridle for the Aſſe, and <hi>a rod for the fooles back, Prov.</hi> 26. 3. application is the life of preaching; this ſerves to condemne ſuch a one, this ſerves to confute ſuch a one, this ſerves to comfort ſuch a one, when a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter does as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>divide the word aright,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by worrying of people out of their ſinnes,<note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:42059:133"/>
when a Miniſter will not let people be quiet in any of their ſinfull courſes, when he labours daily to vex their guilty conſciences, and to turne them from day to day, <hi>as the two witneſſes did,</hi> Rev. 11. 10. that they may ſay, we cannot be quiet for this man, he makes me ſit upon thornes; when a Miniſter labours to make hell to have every vile wretch, and heaven and the promiſes to have every honeſt heart, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by being pittious and affectionate towards the<note place="margin">4</note> poore people, to let them ſee how we pity their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we ſhould doe what we can to make them feele their damned eſtate, as alſo with bowels, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, labour that they may ſee we doe pity them, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preaching ſometimes is called <hi>lamentation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Ezek. 19. 1. it may be people then may ſay, what a beaſt am I; how does our Miniſter pity us! he mourns over us, and bewayles us; what a wretch am I, that I doe not bewayle mine own caſe? O beloved, what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing is it, that any of us ſhould periſh, to be damned for ever in hell! to lye in eternall paines! what a pity is this? is it not much better ye ſhould embrace the good word of God and beleeve and take Jeſus Chriſt, and be willing to doe any thing he would have you to doe, then to lye by it for ever in the paines of hell, for the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon? alas it is for want of bowels, that we doe no more good.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, by being deeply affected with the word of<note place="margin">5</note> God, laying nothing on peoples backs, but what we lift up upon our owne ſhoulders; ſpeaking the truth from the bottom of our hearts, uttering the word of God with feeling and with a contrite ſpirit. O if we could drop our Sermons as dew down from heaven on our people; this would be lively preaching indeed as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42059:133"/>
did, <hi>he dropt the word of God upon Ieruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 21. 2. ſo if our Sermons did come droping downe from us, as if they dropt downe from heaven. O how coldly doe our Sermons come from our mouthes, we doe not preach as if the word came downe from heaven, as if our hearts were no higher then our pulpits.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by getting the Lord to goe along with our Miniſtry; for it is not our preaching it ſelf that hath any life; no, it is but a dead letter, as <hi>Micha</hi> ſayes, <hi>I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> Mich. 3. 8.</p>

                  <q>And art Dead.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THeſe words as ye heard, have a twofold relation; one to the Angell of the Church in Sardis; thou art dead, thy Miniſtry is dead; there's no life, nor heat at all in thy Miniſtry, it is no ſtirring Miniſtry; thou art dead; another to the Church it ſelf; thou art a dead people, a dead congregation. For the firſt thence we had this point of Doctrine; that a dead Miniſtry is little better then no Miniſtry at all. By a dead Miniſtry I meane though the matter preached be never ſo ſound &amp; orthodox, yet when the preaching of it is dead, this is a dead Miniſtry; as a Prayer may be dead, though the things prayed for, be never ſo honeſt and godly; now ſuch a Miniſtry is little better then no Miniſtry; there's no warmth hardly to be had by it at all; like the Miniſtry of the Scribes, <hi>that had no power nor authority in it at all, Matth.</hi> 7. 29. as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, when he heard one preach very cold; cold, cold, ſayes he; this is cold preaching; here's no heat at all to be gotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42059:134"/>Firſt, this is nothing like a true Miniſtry indeed; a true Miniſtry indeed is lively; it is a Miniſtry that warmes and heats; it is a very earneſt Miniſtery; as when the<note place="margin">1.</note> Lord let the Jewes have a true Miniſtry, he ſayes they had a lively Miniſtry, <hi>I earneſtly proteſted to your Fathers,</hi> Jer 11. 7. he ſpeakes of the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; it was a very lively Miniſtry; they preacht in good earneſt to the people; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was earneſt in his Miniſtry, <hi>I have ſtriven to preach the Goſpell,</hi> Rom. 15. 20. he belaboured him hard in the pulpit, he laid about him ſoundly; ſo that a dead Miniſtery, is nothing like a true Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord counts a dead Miniſtry, even as if it were no Miniſtry at all. The Scribes and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, were very morall men moſt of them, as ye may ſee<note place="margin">2.</note> by <hi>Paul's</hi> Teſtimony of himſelf, and they were orthodoxe Miniſters for the maine, as our Saviour ſayes of them, for he bids people heare them, yet he counted their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry even as no Miniſtry at all; he cals the people that ſate under their Miniſtry, <hi>people having no Shepheard,</hi> Matt. 9. 36. true they had Shepheards, but as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayes of the Shepheards of Judah, <hi>they were Jdoll Shepheards,</hi> Zach. 11. 17. they were very Idols; ye know Idols are dead Images.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a dead Miniſtry does little or no good; it is very unfruitfull; it does not awaken any of the auditory; it does not ſtir any of the hearers; it does not rouze up<note place="margin">3.</note> mens hearts; it does not grapple with the obſtinate, nor pull down the proud, neither does it carry life at all with it; as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſayes of many of the Prieſts and the Prophets of Iſrael, they did not convert any; God tels them, if they had ſtood in his counſell, <hi>they ſhould have turned many,</hi> Jer. 23. 22. But as the matter
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42059:134"/>
went, they turned none, they converted none; a lively Miniſtry doth a great deale of good; but a dead Miniſtry is a flat thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a dead Miniſtry God ſeldome goes along<note place="margin">4.</note> with it; nay, that's the life of ones Miniſtry, when the Miniſter ſeekes God to goe along with him; now a dead Miniſtry, God goes not along with it; a lively Miniſtry God gos along with that; as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Lo I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28. 20. ſuch a Miniſtry God bleſſes, it gathers up Gods Jewels, it builds up Gods Church it helps to perfect the Saints. But a dead Miniſtry, the Lord does not goe with it, he does not worke with it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a dead Miniſtry prophanes the word, it makes<note place="margin">5.</note> it ſeeme nothing worth; it makes people thinke there is no great matter in it; a lively Miniſtry gloriſies the word, it lets out God into the conſcience, it givs people to underſtand they come upon life and death, it makes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple looke about them, it makes people heare over all that ever they have done, it flaſhes the word of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, as a light to diſcover all their wayes; it gives them a view of their eternall eſtate either one way or other; it is the ſavour either of life unto life, or of death unto death; as it is ſaid of <hi>Pauls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Miniſtry, <hi>the word of the Lord was glorified by it,</hi> Act. 13. 48. But a dead Miniſtry prophanes, hides the glory of it; it lets people ſet quietly under it; it diſeaſes no ſinner.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this was firſt, here we ſaw a reaſon why a<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> dead Miniſtry is not houted at, but applauded in the world; Why? it is as good as no Miniſtry at all, it does not make the devill roar; it lets people ſleep in their ſins; ſuch Miniſters are dawbers, they are the divels upholſters they doe not pluck away mens pillowes from under their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42059:135"/>
arme-holes; people may doe what they liſt for all them. The world will let ſuch alone, they may ſleep long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough; whereas a livelie Miniſter can heardly come into the pulpit, but preſently he is halfe a Martyr; as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Ezekiel Briers and thornes are with thee</hi> Ezek. 2. 6. The world fought againſt <hi>Ieremy;</hi> they played the wolves againſt the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt. Lively Miniſters cannot give the world any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; there's an antpathy between the world and ſuch; they cannot more agree then light and darkneſſe; ſuch a Miniſter ſtands in the worlds light; he makes the world ſee their works are evill, he detects &amp; ſhams, and oppoſes the ſins that the world wallows in; ſuch a Miniſtry is a diſſering Miniſtry, it makes a diviſion among men. There cannot be a lively Miniſtery any where, but the world hath a ſting at it. But a dead Miniſtry may goe Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free, it does not torment them that dwell upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may ſerve to reprove our ſelves that<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> are no more lively in our Miniſtry. That our Miniſtry hath no more edge upon it to enter into this horny thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin age; we complaine of much deadneſſe now a dayes, alas how if we be found guilty of it, in that we preach no more quickeningly? if the Apoſtles of Chriſt complained of dull hearers, Heb. 5. 11. O how many dull hearers have we! The Lord awaken our hearts! The deader people be, we had need to be the quicker in our Miniſtry, or elſe we cannot ſay we are pure from their blood. Don't we ſee the damned eſtate that our people are in by nature? the careleſneſſe of getting to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out? the neceſſity of faith, of repetance, of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the danger of ſinne, the multitudes of them that periſh, and the fewneſſe of them, that ſtrive to enter in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42059:135"/>
at the ſtraight gate? the deceitfulneſſe of the heart, how the world and the cares of this life, carry almoſt all eleane away? the badneſſe of the times, the ſhortneſſe of this life, the irrecoverable eſtate after death, the immortalitie of the ſoule, the paines of hell, the joyes of heaven? O how ſhould we beſtirre our ſelves, to beat theſe truthes into mens hearts, that they may bethink them, and flye from the wrath come? The cold preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch weighty things quite cozens the world; we give them ſuch faint warnings, that it's no wonder that ſo few doe take any warning; we ſound the Trumpet too too low, that ſcarce any almoſt prepare themſelves; we preach as though we did not care much, whether our people be damned or no; this is a lamentable thing, people may ſay to us, as the diſciples ſaid to Chriſt; they ſaid it unjuſtly to Chriſt, but our people may ſay it juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us. <hi>Maſter careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> Mark. 4. 38. he was aſleep, and they awakened him; <hi>Maſter careſt thou not, &amp;c.</hi> O Sirs, <hi>don't you care that we periſh?</hi> awaken, awaken, don't you ſee how dead we are, how hearned, how Ignorant of God, how emptie of grace, how back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to that which is good! how prone to loſe our ſoules! <hi>and don't you care that we periſh?</hi> why don't you labour more to quicken us, and move us; why don't you rub us, and pull us, and prick us, and drive us out of our ſecurity?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another uſe is, that we labour for a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> Miniſtrie. This is the end of all true Miniſters preaching; that they may bring life into their hearers hearts; as the Prophet ſaies, <hi>heare and your ſoules ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. wherefore elſe doe we preach, but that the dead may heare the voyce of the Sonne of God and live? people are alive to that which they ſhould be dead unto;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42059:136"/>
and dead to that which they ſhould be alive unto; dead to God and all goodneſſe, dead to reformation and amendment, dead to Prayer, and the communion of the Saints; dead to holy conference and meditation and what ever elſe may doe your ſoules good: now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe we preach, if not to quicken up your hearts, that your hearts may live for ever? are we not ſowers of ſeed? why then we ſhould moſt labour ſo to plow and harrow and till the ground that our ſeed may quicken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, now another uſe is how to get a Miniſtrie<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> to be quickening. Firſt let us conſider the worth of a ſoule, our Saviour Chriſt ſaies, <hi>its of more worth then the whole world,</hi> Matth 16. 26. if one ſoule be of ſuch worth, O then what is the worth of ſo many ſoules as God hath given us the charge of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore doe we ſtirre up our ſelves no more in our Miniſtrie? its a plaine ſigne, we don't conſider the worth of ſoules, that we have the care of; the blood of the Sonne of God was ſhed for them. O if we would but conſider this, this mought whet us up if by any meanes we might gaine ſome ſoules to Gods heavenly Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as we muſt conſider the worth of the ſoules<note place="margin">2.</note> of our people, ſo we muſt get bowels to tender their ſoules. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, he had the bowels of a Father towards the ſoules of the Theſſalonians, <hi>you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father thes his Children,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 11. nay, as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Babe of her womb; nay, ſayes he, we were ready not onely to impart the Goſpell of God to you, but alſo even our owne ſoules, becauſe ye are deare to us; as it is there in <hi>verſe</hi> 8. Is a Father dead-hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his deare childe? or a kinde Mother toward her deare babe? no; if we were ſet to doe our people good,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42059:136"/>
if our bowels did yearn after their everlaſting good, it would appeare in every Sermon we make, yea, it would appear in our delivery, in our faces, in our carriages, in our earneſt endeavour for their comfort; the earneſtnes of a true Miniſters preaching, Saint <hi>Iude</hi> compares to the ſnatching of a childe, that is fallen into the fire; <hi>other ſome with feare, plucking them out of the fire, Iude.</hi> 23. if we did ſee our poore children fallen into the fire, how would we beſtirre our ſelves quickly to pluck them out againe? would we goe about it coldly? nay, would we not runne, and ſnatch and pull, and cry out, and alas my poore childe, nay, we would ſchriek out, O woe is me my childe will be burnt; O how our bowels would yearne, ſo we ſhould doe to our people, this would quicken our Miniſtry, and ſo I full upon a third.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then as we ſhould dearely love our peoples<note place="margin">3.</note> ſoules, ſo we ſhould be pitious and affectionate towards them; we ſhould let them ſee how we pity their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we don't onely tell them their ſins, and threaten againſt them the Judgements, but with pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; lamenting their condition, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>O my howels, my homels, I am pained even at the very heart,</hi> Jer. 4. 19. we ſhould not mouth hell and damnation and roare out againſt their ſinnes in a ſtirdy manner, as if we had Iron ſides, but in a relenting pittious wiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling their caſe. Preaching ſometimes is called la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in Scripture; <hi>take up alamentation for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 19. 1. that is, goe and preach to them; this is to quicken in our Miniſtry; may be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now will ſay; what a beaſt am I! how does our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter pity us? he mournes over us, and bewayles us; what a wretch am I, that I doe not bewayle mine owne miſerable condition! O beloved, what a wofull thing is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42059:137"/>
it that any of us ſhould periſh! to be damned for ever in hell? to lye in everlaſting burnings; what a pity is this? Is it not much better, we ſhould embrace the good word of God, repent and beleeve, and take up Chriſts Yoke, and to be willing to do any thing, to part with any thing, then to lie by it for ever in the paines of hell for the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon? alas brethren it is for want of bowels; that we doe no more good; O we ſhould fling our hearts among you, as was ſaid of that good Biſhop, the People ſaid of him, he flung his very heart among them; ſo ſhould we doe, we ſhould even melt over you, the Lord give us tender bowels for you; this is a quickening Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We ſhould worry our people out of their<note place="margin">4</note> ſinnes; we ſhould not let our people be quiet in any of their ſinfull courſes; we ſhould daily labour to diſeaſe them, to make them ſet upon thornes, as is ſaid of the two witneſſes, <hi>they tormented the earth,</hi> Rev. 11. 10. ſo we ſhould torment and vex guilty conſciences, gall them, and peirce them, and make our Sermons haunt them; we ſhould be eager and earneſt with them to let goe their ſinnes; we ſhould be like the importunate wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that would have juſtice, ſhe would never let the Judge be quiet for her; as God ſayes there, <hi>returne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> O Shulamite, <hi>returne returne; compell them to come in,</hi> Luke. 14. 23. <hi>repent repent, O wretch, repent repent;</hi> O doe not goe on, thou'lt periſh, turne back, turne back, thou'lt be in hell in a moment elſe; it is not enough to deliver a good doctrine, and then to ſay thus and thus ye are guilty of ſinning againſt this good doctrine; but we ſhould labour to lay it home, and to impoſe it firmly on their conſcience, to haunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them with the danger; O how dull, and blockiſh and ſecure in their
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42059:137"/>
heart how apt are people to forget any thing that is good, to put off any thing that ſhould pull them downe before God? and therefore we ſhould labour to help our poore people, that if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it be poſſible, we may ſtop them from going downe into the pit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we ſhould labour to make the things that we<note place="margin">5</note> preach as if it were lively before peoples eyes; as the Apoſtle preacht Chriſt <hi>crucified</hi> to the Galatians, <hi>even as if he were crucified before their very eyes,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> had a very lively Miniſtry; the text ſayes he ſet his points before their very eyes. <hi>I call heaven and earth to record againſt you this day, that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and cruſing,</hi> Deut. 30. 19. marke he ſet before their eyes, <hi>life and death, heaven and hell;</hi> he preached ſo evidently, that the people might ſee, as it were with their eyes, the things that he preached; this is lively teaching; as the Orator ſayes Hypotypoſis is an excellent meanes to perſwade; when the ſpeaker does as it were point before the hearers eyes, when he repreſents the things he ſpeakes of, <hi>this is preaching in the evidence, and the demonſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> when a Miniſter demonſtrates his points, and this it is, this is the ſinne, and this is the caſe, and this is the miſery, and thus it ſtands with you, when he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make people ſee it, and they muſt needs ſee it, unleſſe they be wilfull and ſhut their eyes; otherwiſe people heare a Sermon as if it did not concerne them; there's a man in the pulpit, and they heare what he ſays, but they never conſider how deeply it concernes them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, we ſhould be truly affected with the word of<note place="margin">6</note> God our ſelves; laying nothing on our peoples ſhoulders, but what we lift upon our owne; we ſhould ſpeake the truth from the bottom of our hearts, uttering the word
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42059:138"/>
of God with feeling and with a contrite heart; we ſhould be heavenly as the word is; that lip and heart, and word may be all a like. O if we did drop downe our Sermons as dew downe from heaven on our people, this would be a lively preaching indeed; as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did, <hi>He dropt the word of God on Ieruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 21. 2. if our Sermons did come dropping downe from us, as if they dropt downe from heaven. O how homely doe our Sermons come from our mouthes, as though they never were higher then the pulpit; we doe not preach, as if the word came dropping down from heaven; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore people doe not look up to heaven, while they heare, their mindes are no higher then our pulpits: whereas if we had heavenlier hearts and lippes, it would more quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a thouſand times, or at leaſt be a ſitter inſtrument to quicken.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, we ſhould get the Lord to goe<note place="margin">7.</note> along with our Miniſtry; for it is not our preaching it ſelfe, that hath any life; nay, it is but a dead letter as it iſſues from us; if we were ſuch men, that had the Lord going along with us throughout all our Miniſtry, what a deale of profit would there be in our Miniſtry? as <hi>Micha</hi> ſayes, <hi>I am full of power by the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> Micha. 3. 8. But I let this point paſſe; thus ye have heard the words as they have relation to the Miniſtry of the Church in Sardis. <hi>Thou art dead;</hi> that is, thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I come to the words, as they have relation to the Church it ſelfe. <hi>Thou art dead. Thou art a dead people;</hi> though thou haſt a name to live, yet, <hi>thou art dead;</hi> that is, thou art outwardly reformed, thou haſt goodly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd congregations, good ſober, civill and faire car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaged people, all profeſſing the true religion, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42059:138"/>
frequenting the good Ordinances of God, yet, <hi>thou art dead;</hi> that is, thou art even as good as nothing; the doctrine hence is, a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is as no Chriſtian at all. Ye know we are all <hi>dead</hi> by nature, in treſpaſſes, and in ſins; that is, we are alive to the workes of the fleſh, and to the world, but <hi>dead</hi> towards God. And a true Chriſtian is he that is made <hi>dead</hi> unto ſinne and the world, but alive unto God; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead unto ſin, but alive unto God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6. 11. this is a true Chriſtian, that ſo leaves his ſinnes, and ſo takes up the worſhip and ſervice of God, that he is <hi>dead</hi> to his ſinnes, and alive towards God; now when a man it may be leaves his ſinnes after a manner, and takes up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Gods Service, and yet he is alive ſtill unto the fleſh, and <hi>dead</hi> towards God, this is juſt nothing.</p>
               <p>By <hi>dead</hi> I meane things; firſt, <hi>deadneſſe</hi> of guilt; when a<note place="margin">1.</note> man is guilty of any offence, that is death by the Law, he is ſaid to be a <hi>dead</hi> man; therefore every man hath ſinned againſt God, which is death by Gods Law, ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is <hi>dead</hi> by nature; when a man is pardoned of God, then he is alive again; and therefore it is called <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life,</hi> Ro. 5. 18. now when a man is not pardoned of God, he is <hi>dead,</hi> though he have never ſo many hopes and conceits of forgiveneſſe, thought to apprehend himſelfe to be pardoned, yet as long as God hath not pardoned him indeed, he is a <hi>dead</hi> man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, deadneſſe of minde, when the minde is<note place="margin">2.</note> Ignorant of God, in regard of ſaving knowledge, when a mans minde is without ſaving underſtanding, then his minde is ſaid to be <hi>dead;</hi> true ſaving underſtanding is the life of ſo many mindes; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>give me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and I ſhall live,</hi> Pſal. 119. 144. then my minde ſhall be alive ſayes he, then I ſhall know thee

aright; now let a man have never ſo much knowledge and learning, yet, in divine things is otherwiſe, and have nothing; his minde is ſtill <hi>dead;</hi> he is a <hi>dead</hi> man to all the things of God; he cannot ſee God in all his wayes no more then a <hi>dead</hi> man; he cannot minde God; he may minde earthly things; but he cannot minde God; nay, though he can mind learning &amp; divinity, learning &amp; learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about God, yet he cannot minde God; his minde is <hi>dead</hi> to ſuch ſavoury knowledge; even as <hi>dead</hi> as a <hi>dead</hi> man; he knowes not how to pray to God, as a childe to his Father; he knowes not how to doe any duty, in a godly gratious manner; his minde is as <hi>dead</hi> to theſe things, as a ſimple Country-mans is to Latin, or Greeke or Hebrew.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, deadneſſe of heart when the heart is not<note place="margin">3.</note> inclined towards God, then we ſay it is <hi>dead</hi> towards God and all goodneſſe; though he goe to good duties every day, yet as long as the heart is not inclined to them, it goes about them in a <hi>dead</hi> manner; when a mans heart is once inclined towards God, now it begins to be alive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>the heart ſhall be alive that ſeekes God,</hi> Pſal. 69 32. that is, you whoſe hearts are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſerve God, your hearts are alive; now when a man hath no divine inclinations to all heavenly duties and courſes, though he doe never ſo much profeſſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of them, he followes them with a <hi>dead</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, deadneſſe of conſcience, when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">4</note> hath no force; it may be it finds fault with ſuch and ſuch wayes, but it hath no power over the man, to make him to leave them; perhaps it approves ſuch and ſuch holy performances, yea, but it hath no power over him, to cauſe him to buckle to them indeed; this is a <hi>dead</hi> conſcience; it hath no life at all in it; when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath life in it once, then it hath power; it hath a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42059:139"/>
mighty force over a man; as the Church, <hi>my ſoule made me like the Chariots of Aminadab,</hi> Cant. 6. 12. that is, my conſcience was very forceable and powerfull in me, it made me not onely to goe after God, but it carryed me as it were in a Chariot very willingly. But when the conſcience can whiſper onely and finde fault, and hath no power at all with it to make one obey from day to day, this is a <hi>dead</hi> conſcience.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, deadneſſe of affection; when the affections<note place="margin">5.</note> are clumbzie, and will not ſtirre towards God, and all heavenly things; when a man is like a block in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he hath no affections to them nor in them; when the affections are all alive to earthly things, when they are ſtill out of order; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>mortifie your inordinate affections,</hi> Col. 3. 5. that is, your affections muſt not be out of order, if they be alive to other things ye muſt kill them, that way, that they may be alive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the things that are above; now when the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will not move that way at all, then they are <hi>dead.</hi> But I will ſpeak no more of this; well then let us come to the doctrine; a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is even as good as no Chriſtian at all; goe through all Chriſtianity, and we ſhall ſee this to be true in every paſſage; ſhould a man have all Chriſtianity in him, and yet be <hi>dead</hi> and dull and without life, it is even all one, as if he had juſt nothing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for converſion; ſhould a man ſeeme to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.<note place="margin">1.</note> O what a changed man is this, he was a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, and now he is ſober; he was a whorer, and now he is chaſte, he was a Prophane beaſt, and now he is cleane another man; this is well; I, but if thou beeſt <hi>dead</hi> to the wayes of God; if thou beeſt not quickened up to them, this is <hi>magnum nihil;</hi> converſion is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <hi>when we were</hi> dead <hi>in ſinnes, he hath quickened us</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:42059:140"/>
                  <hi>together which Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2. 5. converſion is not onely a turning of a man from wicked wayes to good, but to be quickened up in them; converſion puts another life into a man; a man may be converted from prophaneſſe to civility; from not praying conſtantly to praying conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from not hearing to hearing, from not preaching to preaching, from not profeſſing to profeſſing. True, this man ſhall have the leſſe hell, yea, but this is nothing towards heaven; except a new life be put into this man; to be alive in all theſe good ways; except he be quickened together with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly faith; ſhould a man leane himſelfe upon<note place="margin">2.</note> God, and upon Chriſt, ſhould a man apply all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell to his ſoule, and beleeve all that's contained in the covenant of grace; alas what of all this? if this man be <hi>dead</hi> ſtill, without ſuch a faith as produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces life; it is little better then nothing; as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>He that lives and beleeves in me,</hi> Joh. 11. 26. true faith carries life with it, whereſoever it is; and therefore if a mans faith be without life, it is but equivocall faith. faith it may well be, But true faith it cannot be; for if thou wouldſt be able to ſay thou beleeveſt in Jeſus Chriſt, thou muſt be able to ſay that thou liveſt too in him; it's impoſſible a man ſhould rightly beleeve in Chriſt and be <hi>dead;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o, <hi>he lives that beleeves in me,</hi> ſayes Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as ye heard heretofore, to be a member of<note place="margin">3.</note> the viſible Church of God, to be a ſtone in Gods build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; were a man the fineſt and the moſt carved ſtone of all, put in by Baptiſme, kept in by profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith; this is a poor thing, if this man now be not a lively ſtone; <hi>ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all houſe, a holy Prieſt-hood, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. The right
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42059:140"/>
ſtone; in Gods ſpirituall houſe are all lively ſtones; if thou beeſt but a logge, a heartleſſe, dull, dead mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thou art none of Gods ſpirituall houſe, houſe, no part of his holy Prieſt-hood, thou art no more a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an then a <hi>dead</hi> man is a man. Thou art but a ſit roome, thou haſt nothing but a name of a true Chriſtian; The body of Chriſt, is all full of life, derived from him the head; all the branches that are in him, have the life of the root in them; if thou beeſt but a <hi>dead</hi> branch, thou haſt no communion with Chriſt at all, though thou beeſt in the body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for hope; it may be thou haſt hope that<note place="margin">4.</note> thou art a good Chriſtian, that thou haſt a part in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world by Jeſus Chriſt, thou haſt a hope of the heavenly inheritance, that thou ſhalt be ſaved in that day; now if thy hope be a <hi>dead</hi> hope, if it doe not quicken thee up to trample on the world, to beat down thy worldly luſts, to ſcrue thee up to a gratious life more and more, to carry thee on through thick and thin, this is not a gratious hope; no, no; the grace of hope is a lively hope, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes. <hi>Bleſſed be God, &amp; father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which according to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy, hath begotten us againe, to a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. this grace of hope it quickens up all them that have it, it is not a <hi>dead</hi> hope, that lyes ſluggiſhly and blockiſhly in the ſoule, and does not ſtirre it up every day; no, it revives him towards God, it makes him eager af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſt things; if thy hope be a <hi>dead</hi> hope, that lies like a carcaſe in thy heart, to little or no purpoſe, it is no good hope through grace, but a hope in a dreame.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, for repentance; what ever thou haſt to ſay<note place="margin">5.</note> for repentance, canſt thou plead a 1000 changes and reformations, yet if thou haſt not gotten out of a <hi>dead</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:42059:141"/>
temper, thou art yet under an impenitent heart. That repentance that is the gate of heaven, the Evangeliſt cals it <hi>repentance unto life,</hi> Act. 11. 18. true repentance it rends the heart, it ſhewes ſinne to be the greateſt evill, and it rowzes a man up daily to take heed of it; it makes us ſee what a God we have diſhonoured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it awakens the ſoule to be earneſt to pleaſe him in all things for the time to come; the ſoule was dead and careleſſe, and drowzie, and neglectfull of obedience, goodneſſe, holineſſe, humility, pureneſſe, ſtrictneſſe, preciſeneſſe of walking, it cared not for theſe things afore, but when true repentance comes in, it wheeles about the life of the ſoule towards God, now the cares ſhall be to him, now the endeavours make af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; paines, labours, cautious, watchfulneſſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derativeneſſe, ſtudious ſtriveings, and all's active that way now; ſo that if a man be ſtill <hi>dead,</hi> his repentance is falſe.</p>
               <p>Againe to goe over all the duties of religion; they all muſt be done with life; to doe them with a dead heart,<note place="margin">1</note> is as good as not to doe them at all. Firſt prayer, ſuppoſe we pray at Church, and pray in our families, and pray in our cloſets, is this all? to pray with a dead heart, as if we cared not whether we ſped or no, no pullings of our heart downe before God; no wraſtlings with God for what we aske, no liftings of our ſoules up, no faſtnings of our minds upon his preſence, no cryes, no mournings, no importunity, but the heart as lumpiſh and unweldy as a ſtone; is this praying? no, ſayes <hi>David; quicken us O Lord that we may call upon thy name,</hi> Pſal. 80. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for hearing of the word: It is not thy hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſo many times a weeke, though thou muſt heare it as often as ever thou canſt, and thoſe that will
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42059:141"/>
not no hearing as frequently as they may, are high deſpiſers of God &amp; his Ordinances; but yet if thou heareſt the word with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, thy hearing is made as no hearing; it is ſaid of thoſe primitive converts <hi>that they were pricked in their hearts as they were hearing,</hi> Act. 2. 37. they onely got good by their hearing, they heard the word with life; ſo it is ſaid of many of Chriſts hearers, they did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>they laye upon him, they preaſed upon him,</hi> Luk. 5. 1. in another place, it is ſaid that they hung upon him, they were attentive and eager to him; our Saviour Chriſt ſays, <hi>it is a very great judgement to be dull of hearing,</hi> Matth. 13. 15. when people ſet as if the word did not concerne them, when they heare without any motion or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the word hardly joggeth their hearts, it hardly ſhaketh their conſcience at all, the word does neither delight them, nor wound them, nor pierce them, it heales none of their ſinnes, it cannot get betweene them and their luſts; when they have heard a Sermon, they goe away juſt as they came, they ſinde nothing now to doe, it does not dragge them one jot more out of the world, nor an inch neerer heaven; their carriage is much at one as it was; when they come home, it cannot be perceived that ever they were at the word; as earthly as ever; as carnall as ever; as backward to all goodneſſe as ever; this is no hearing at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for ſanctifying of the Lords day; <hi>it is ſaid of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>the Sabboth, that we ſhould call it our delight,</hi> Iſa, 58. 13. that is, we ſhould keep it with life it ſhould even quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up our hearts to think it is coming, we ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived to conſider Gods goodneſſe, that he would give us ſuch a day, ſeeing we have ſo much need of it; when we have been ſix dayes about our owne buſineſſe in the world, that we ſhould have a ſeventh given us of God,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42059:142"/>
leſt we ſhould be over head and ears in the world to take off our hearts; now when this is no delight to us, our hearts are <hi>dead</hi> to it, we doe not ſanctifie it indeed but prophane it, as though it were not honorable and the houſe of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for taking hold of an opportunity to doe<note place="margin">4.</note> good; this is a duty too to be done with all life; how glad ſhould we be; if there be any opportunity for us to ſhew our love to God, or our hatred to ſin; we ſhould be willing to ride or goe, or be at charges, nay we ſhould deny our ſelves, and lay downe our gaines and credits, and goods, and friends, and all that we have at Chriſts Foot, and bleſſe God that gives us ſuch a price in our hands; but now we have a <hi>dead</hi> heart to this; what a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing is this? though we doe take the opportunity, yet to goe about it as though we were ſorry that God hath given it unto us; this is meere folly; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes; <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a Foole to get wiſedome, ſeeing he hath no heart to it?</hi> Proverbs 17. 16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In one word for all the wayes of God, there's<note place="margin">5.</note> neere a one of them all, that can be walkt in aright, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a live heart as the Prophet ſayes. <hi>Lord turne away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me in thy way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 37. now when we goe dreamingly on, as though we could not doe withall, though the way be God's, yet our going in it is ſtark naught, and little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then not going in it at all; and therefore the Lord accepts not of it, when we humble our ſelves before God, to hang downe our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eads <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ike a bull-ruſh, it's naught, it's naugh, the Lord cannot away with it; when we conferre about the word, or any gracious and Godly theme, to ſpeake as if we had no ſaveur of it, no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it, when our hearts would rather be on another
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42059:142"/>
ſubject, and never lin till they have wound all good talke out; if we ſpeake one word to edification, there ſhall be twenty to that one, that ſhall ſerve to no other end, but to the hardening of one another; when Chriſt and the two diſciples were communing together, their hearts burned in them; <hi>did not our hearts burne within us, while he talked with us by the way?</hi> Luk. 24. 32. that was talking with life. But when our hearts are as cold as a flint, this we may call talking, but holy conference it cannot be termed</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee a dead Chriſtian, is as good as no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an at all, no grace is without life, no duty can be done without life; the reaſons of this are.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe this is all one as to have no grace at all;<note place="margin">1.</note> though a man be a member of the congregation of the Lord, though he have the ſeales of the covenant, and profeſſe the faith of Jeſus, and be as morall in his life as ever any of the heathen, and as full of good duties as ever any hypocrite was, and more too, yet if he have not life yet, he is but a tinckling cymball; he hath no grace at all. I meane no ſaving grace at all; ſaving grace the Apoſtle cals it <hi>the grace of life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 7. It is the grace of life, it breeds life in him that hath it, it makes him alive towards God, it lets out the life of his heart in every good word and worke; it makes him pray with life, heare with life, uſe the ordinances in publike and private with life; the naturall life that is in the ſoule it turnes it to God, it turnes the man about, as a ſhip is turned on the Sea; that ſayled before towards North, now it ſayles towards South. So when grace comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule; ye know the man had life afore, but it ſayled towards the world, and the things of the world, but when grace does come in, it makes it row and ſayle and ſteere towards God; ſo that when a Chriſtian is <hi>dead,</hi> he is as no Chriſtian at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:42059:143"/>Secondly, a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian hath not Chriſt dwelling in his<note place="margin">2.</note> heart by faith; he is no Chriſtian indeed, that hath not Jeſus Chriſt dwelling in him by a truly and a lively faith. It is the indwelling of Chriſt that makes one a true Chriſtian; now when Chriſt does dwell in any man, Chriſt is a quickening ſpirit; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>the ſecond Adam was made a quickening ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. that is Chriſt; he is the ſecond Adam; he is a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit where ever he dwels; he quickens all the ſoule. He makes it <hi>dead</hi> to that, which by nature it was alive to; and alive to that which by nature it was <hi>dead</hi> to; he inclines the ſoule unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he infuſes a principle into it to ſhine with life towards God, he does more and more hale the ſtrength of the ſoule towards him; though he doe not doe it at all once, yet he does it more and more; now when a man is ſtill <hi>dead</hi> to God and all goodneſſe, he hath not Chriſt dwelling in him by a lively faith; for if he were in once, though the ſoule may complaine ſtill of deadneſſe, as commonly thoſe that are alive complain moſt of deadneſſe, yet it hath a ſupernaturall quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it ſhall have more and more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian was never yet ſoundly<note place="margin">3.</note> wrought upon by the word; the word of Chriſt is a word of life, and it quickens where it doe effectually work; and therefore though ſuch a one have heard a 1000 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sermons, he never fed upon them in all his life; as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever,</hi> Joh. 6. 51. it is better then ordinary bread; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bread indeed, if a man have a naturall life, it will feed it and preſerve it. But if a man be <hi>dead,</hi> it will not revive him. But the word of God is ſuch a bread, that as it feeds a ſpirituall life in them that have it, ſo it is able through the eternall ſpirit, to quicken the <hi>dead;</hi> it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42059:143"/>
is able through God, to put life into men, that never had any; and it does ſo to all that are of God, ſooner or latter; now when a man is <hi>dead,</hi> it's a plaine ſigne that the word hath not yet wrought upon that man; it may be it hath ſhaken him many a time; yea, but if he be yet <hi>dead,</hi> it never wrought upon him ſoundly; <hi>the oracles of God, are lively oracles, as Steven cals them,</hi> Acts. 7. 38. they make their hearts lively that they come to worke ſoundly on; though they were never ſo <hi>dead</hi> to God and good things afore, yet now they waxe lively, they make their hearts to receive a divine ſtrength, that now they waxe able in ſome meaſure to live towards God, to hunger and thirſt after God, to delight in the ſeeking of him; be their luſts never ſo mighty, now they can compoſe themſelves to oppoſe them, and to ſwimme againſt the ſtreame; now they can pray, and they cannot abide to have blockiſh hearts in that nor in any other duty, they have a life that reſiſts that ſame deadneſſe that dwelleth in them. So then this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, that a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is as good as no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian at all, the word hath never wrought ſoundly on that Man.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is; firſt, if the <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtians in Sardis<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> be as good as nothing, what are the riff-raffe in the Towne, that are not ſo much as Chriſtians in name? if a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian be rejected of God, what's a <hi>dead</hi> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard? a <hi>dead</hi> whormonger, a <hi>dead</hi> prophanling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if one that walkes in good courſes be refuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he is <hi>dead</hi> in them, then what ſhall become of them that will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low good courſes at all? if ſuch that are Saints to them, cannot be ſaved, where ſhall they appeare? it is ſaid that Chriſt <hi>loved the goodly fine carriaged young man,</hi> Mark. 10. 17. Chriſt is never ſaid to love a drunkard; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42059:144"/>
wretch; no, he regards one that carries himſelf in a ſayre civill honeſt way, more then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, except onely his own children; and therefore if he counts meer civill men ſtark naught, how much more does he thee, that art a very beaſt compared with them? thou art ſo vile, that we that are men doe know thou art in a fearefull eſtate; nay, the Lord pronounes a woe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that dare ſpeake well of thee; theſe ſinnes are to be puniſhed by the Iudges; if thou haſt lived in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, thou ſhouldſt have been put to death; a drunken Son ſhould have been ſtoned; an adulterer, a fornicator ſhould be burnt; a blaſphemer ſhould be brained to death. Thy ſinnes are ſo palpable, that pillaries, and ſtockes, and priſons, and gallowes, ſhould be thy fare, if thou wert well ſerved. Thou art not onely <hi>dead,</hi> for the manner of thy life, but for the matter too; not onely the Saints doe abhorre thee, but all that have any civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them, doe loath thy filthy doings; and would not doe as thou doeſt; no, no, for a world; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes ſuch as thou art, <hi>are not onely dead but in the depth of hell,</hi> Pro. 9. 18. There be many though they be not right, yet they are ſo much reformed that the Saints of God cannot ſay but that they may be good Chriſtians; But thou art ſo foule, that he that hath but one eye may ſee the devill leads thee; there be ſome that a man may be to blame for judging them wicked, but he that judges thee other wiſe, hates his own ſoule; poor creature, does thy fooliſh heart promiſe thee hopes to finde mercy? alas the devill does but lead thee in a ſtring, he knowes well enough, though he will not let thee ſee it, there is no mercy for them that goe on ſtill in their wickedneſſe. Thou haſt not ſo much as a name that thou liveſt, how <hi>dead</hi> then art thou? Thou art <hi>dead</hi> and rotten, and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42059:144"/>
not onely in the noſtrils of God, but of all that have any common grace in them. Others may be in a damned condition for all their profeſſion, but to be ſure thou art in a damned condition, there's nothing between thee and hell, but onely the poore thread of thy life; How canſt thou keep out of hell, that canſt hardly keep out of the Ale-houſe. O heare this ye that have not ſo much as any face of Religion. See the word of the Lord, and thinke upon it for your good, if ye have any eare to heare before it be too late.</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt, thou art farre from the Kingdome of<note place="margin">1.</note> God; ſuch as are ſober and morall and frequenters of the ordinances of God, &amp; profeſſe godlines, though they be not alive, <hi>yet they are not farre from the Kingdome of God; as Chriſt ſaid of the diſcreet Scribe,</hi> Mark. 12. 34. But thou art a hundred hundred degrees farther off; thou art ſo farre off, that thou haſt need to haſten quickly, thou haſt a 1000 degrees of reformation to paſſe over, before thou canſt get ſo neere as ſome of them that are ſhort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>thou art altogether become unprofitable,</hi> as the<note place="margin">2.</note> Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. thou art good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to doe miſchief in a pariſh, to infect, to ſpoile youth, to trouble thy wife, and thy poore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; to corupt thy ſervants and thy neighbours, to ſpill the good creatures of God, to be a very ſlave to thy fleſhly-luſts; others that are well governed in their lives, though they be dead, yet they doe a great deale of good, they help the Saints, they are I ſay gotten to ſtand for good order; but thou art a very burden to all well diſpoſed people, the very ſhame of the Towne, the diſgrace of the family where thou art; what will people ſay yonder's a drunkard, yonder goes a fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42059:145"/>
a diſſolute fellow, though he be a gentleman, yet he is fit for none but rogues, and raſeals, and tinkerly companions, a man that hath but a ſpark of honeſty would be aſhamed of him; a Chriſtian? no, he is a very beaſt, he cannot govern himſelfe. But what doe I ſtand ſpending of time to ſpeak againſt ſuch wayes which the Apoſtle ſayes ſhould ſcarcely be named in Chriſtians mouthes? The very heathens ſhall judge thee; the Lord open thine eyes, to ſee what a curſed creature thou art, that thou maiſt come out of the ſnare of the devill.</p>
               <p>I have hindered my ſelfe from going on; I ſhould ſhew you, firſt, a reproof of thoſe that are Chriſtians and yet <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhould ſhew you the danger of being a dead Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what it is to be a lively Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, how we may know whether we be <hi>dead</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or no.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, how farre forth a childe of God may be <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, what is the reaſon that ſo many are <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, how we ſhould all come to be lively.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, what motives there be to induce us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for life in our Chriſtian courſe. But of theſe at another time.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe laſt doctrine that we gathered out of theſe words was this, that a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is as good as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42059:145"/>
no Chriſtian at all; though a man be orthodoxly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, baptized, reformed, though a man profeſſe the true faith towards God, repentance and amendment of life, and follow all manner of good and honeſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the matter of them, yet if he be <hi>dead</hi> to them, he is even as good as nothing.</p>
               <p>I told you what I meant by a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian. I ſhewed you this in five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, deadneſſe of guilt; when a man is guilty of any<note place="margin">1.</note> offence, that is death by the Law, he is ſaid to be a <hi>dead</hi> man; ſo every man hath ſinned againſt God which is death by Gods Law, and therefore every man is <hi>dead</hi> by nature; when a man is pardoned of God, then he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live againe; and therefore it is called <hi>Iuſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. now when a man is not pardoned of God he is <hi>dead;</hi> though he have never ſo many hopes and conceits of forgiveneſſe, yet as long as he is not forgiven indeed he is but a <hi>dead</hi> man. Let a man have never ſo much Chriſtianity about him, if he be not forgiven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deadneſſe of minde; when the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<note place="margin">2</note> of man is dead; my beloved ye muſt know it is not bare knowledge that quickens the minde; a man may have the knowledge of all Chriſtian divinity, and yet have a <hi>dead</hi> underſtanding; it is ſaid of Chriſt, &amp; every true Chriſtian, <hi>that he is of a quick underſtanding in the feare of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 11. 3. then is the underſtanding quick, when it is quick in the feare of God; when it feeles the weight of all divine truth; we may ſee this in worldly minded men, their underſtandings are quick in the things of the world, if there be any booty to be had, preſently they feele it, you may lead them any way, ſo you doe but let them ſee profit and gaine, there
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42059:146"/>
is weight in ſuch reaſons. But now ſhew them divine reaſons, why they ſhould beleeve the ſacred writings of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and yeeld obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the form of wholſome words delivered in the Goſpell, though they underſtand well enough what we ſay, yet they feele no weight in theſe reaſons; whole Sermons doe not ſtirre them; their underſtanding is here <hi>dead;</hi> ſo that this is a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian, who though he have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much knowledge, yet his underſtanding is <hi>dead,</hi> he feeles not the weight of divine things; he hath divine things in his ſpeculative underſtanding, and carnall in his practicall; gracious truths in his fore dictats, and carnall in his laſt; when he knowes heavenly things, but mindes earthly; my meaning is this. O ſayes his underſtanding, I ſhould live thus and thus, this is the rule, this is the will of God. But then his owne corrupt will ſuggeſts unto him for to doe otherwiſe, and His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding does not hinder.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, deadneſſe of heart, when the heart is not<note place="margin">3.</note> inclined towards God. The life of the heart, conſiſts in the inclinations and bents of the heart; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Incline mine heart to thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119. 36. what followes? <hi>quicken thou me in thy way,</hi> This is the quicking of my heart to thy Teſtimonies, when it is inclined unto them; now though a man goe to good duties everyday, yet as long as the heart is not inclined unto them, it is <hi>dead</hi> to them all; it goes about them in a <hi>dead</hi> manner; as a Boy that is not inclined to his Book, though he doe goe to Schoole, it is with a <hi>dead</hi> heart. This then is another expreſſion of a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian; he is a man though he be a profeſſour of Holineſſe, yet his heart is not inclined towards God, and all goodneſſe; and therefore he goes on in good duties with a <hi>dead</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:42059:146"/>Fourthly, deadneſſe of conſcience; when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath no force; it may be it finds fault with ſuch and ſuch wayes, but it hath no power over a man, to make him to leave them; it approves ſuch and ſuch holy courſes, yea, but it hath no power over him to make him to buckle to them indeed. O ſayes the conſcience, I ſhould not doe thus; I ſhould be more mindfull of God, I ſhould not be ſo vaine, I ſhould not ſpend my time as I doe, I ſhould make another uſe of Gods warning then I doe; I ſhould be better. But it hath no force over the man whoſe conſcience it is; this is a <hi>dead</hi> conſcience; there's no life in it at all; when the conſcience hath life in it once, then it hath power over a man; as the Church ſayes, <hi>my ſoule made me like the Chariots of</hi> Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6, 12. that is, my conſcience was very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and powerfull in me; it made me goe after Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nay, it carried me freely like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab.</hi> But when the conſcience can whiſper and onely finde fault, and hath no power at all with it to make one obey from day to day, this is a <hi>dead</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, deadneſſe of affection, when the affections are<note place="margin">5.</note> clumbzie, and will not move towards God, and all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall things; when a mans affections are lively e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in other things, and too lively; But hee's like a block in good duties, he hath no affections to them nor in them. Theſe are affections out of order; <hi>mortifie your inordinate affections ſayes the Apoſtle,</hi> Coloſ 3. 5. that is, your affections muſt not be out of order; if they be alive to the things here below, ye muſt turne the life of them another way; ye muſt kill them that way, and let the life of them run out towards God, and his ſervice and worſhip; now when the affections will not move this way
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42059:147"/>
at all, then they are <hi>dead.</hi> Thus ye ſee what I meane by a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian. Now that ſuch a one is as good as no Chriſtian at all, is very plaine; goe through all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and you ſhall finde this to be true in every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for converſion; converſion is not onely the<note place="margin">1.</note> turning of a man from wicked wayes unto good, but ſo as to be quickened up in them. Converſion puts another life into a man; <hi>when we were</hi> dead <hi>in ſinnes, he hath quickened us together with Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is the quickening of a man, not onely the turning of a man from not praying to praying, from not hearing of the word to hearing of the word; from not ſober to be ſober, from not chaſte to be chaſte, from not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtian religion to be a profeſſor of it, but alſo it is the quickening of a man up in it; it is the putting of a new life into a man; and therefore to be converted meerely from the one to the other is juſt nothing; as long as a man is <hi>dead</hi>-hearted to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for beleeving; ſhould a man leane himſelf<note place="margin">2.</note> upon God, ſhould a man apply all the promiſes of the Goſpell to his ſoule, and credit all that's contained in the Covenant of grace, alas what of all this? if this man be <hi>dead</hi> ſtill. True faith produces life; as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>he that liveth and beleeveth in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Joh. 11. 26. True faith carries life with it, whereſoever it is; and therefore if a man have ſuch a faith as lets him be <hi>dead</hi> ſtill, it is as good as nothing; faith it may be, Put true faith it cannot be; if thou wouldſt be able to ſay thou beleeveſt in Jeſus Chriſt, thou muſt be able to ſay that thou liveſt in him too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is impoſſible that a man ſhould rightly beleeve in Chriſt, and be <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for hoping in God; it may be thou haſt hope<note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:42059:147"/>
that thou art a good Chriſtian, that thou haſt a part in the redemption of the world by Jeſus Chriſt, thou haſt a hope of the heavenly inheritance that thou ſhalt be ſaved in that day; now if thy hope be a <hi>dead</hi> hope, if it doe not quicken thee up, to beat downe thy worldly luſts, to ſerue thee up towards God more and more, to carry thee on through thick and thin, thy hope is not worth a ruſh. True hope is lively; <hi>he hath begotten us again to a lively hope</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. it is not a <hi>dead</hi> hope, that lies ſluggiſhly and blockiſhly in him that hath it, not ſtirring him up every day, but it lies like a carcaſe in the heart to little or no purpoſe; no, no, this is as good as no hope at all. True hope is a lively hope; it revives a man up to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, it beares a man aloft in good duties, it fortiſies a man againſt daily temptations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for repenting; what ever thou haſt to ſay<note place="margin">4</note> for repenting, canſt thou plead never ſo many teares for thy ſinnes, a thouſand changes and reformings, yet if thou haſt not gotten out of a <hi>dead</hi> temper, thou art yet under an impenitent heart, <hi>true repentance is to life,</hi> Act. 11. 18. True repentance rends the heart, it ſhewes ſin to be the greateſt evill, and ſo it rowzes a man daily up to take heed of it; it makes us ſee what a God we have diſhonour'd and therefore it awakes the ſoule to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, to pleaſe him in all things for the time to come. The ſoule heretofore was <hi>dead</hi> to all holineſſe and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and preciſneſſe, and humbleneſſe, and mortified<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of walking, it was <hi>dead</hi> to ſuch things heretofore, but when true repentance comes in, it turnes about the life of the ſoule towards God, now the cares ſhall be to him, now the endeavours make after him; paines, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſneſſe, watchfulneſſe, circumſpection, conſideration, all are active now towards him; ſo that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42059:148"/>
if a man be ſtill <hi>dead,</hi> his repentance is falſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, for praying; ſuppoſe we pray at Church and<note place="margin">5.</note> pray in our Families, and pray in our Cloſets, is this all? alas if we pray with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, no pullings of our heart downe before God, no wraſtlings with God for what we aske, no heaving of our ſoules up, no faſtnings of our mindes on his preſence, no favouring of Jeſus Chriſt, no yearnings to the throne of grace; this is as good as no praying at all; no; ſayes <hi>David quicken us O Lord, and we will call upon thy name,</hi> Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 80. 18.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, for hearing of the word. Though thou heare<note place="margin">6</note> it never ſo often and duly, yet that is not it; if thou heareſt it with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, thy hearing is little better then no hearing; our Saviour Chriſt ſayes, <hi>it's a great Iudgement to be dull of hearing,</hi> Matth. 13. 15. when the people ſit as if the word did not concerne them, when they heare without any motion or affection, the word hardly joggeth their hearts, the word does neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light them, nor warme them, nor pierce them, nor touch them, it heales none of their ſinnes, it cannot get between them and their luſts; when they have heard a Sermon, they goe away juſt as they came, it does not drag them one jot more out of the world, nor an inch nearer heaven; the carriage is much at one as it was, when they come home, it can hardly be perceived, that ever they were at the word; as earthly as ever; as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as ever; as backward to all goodneſſe as ever. This is as good as no hearing at all.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, for taking hold of opportunities to doe<note place="margin">7</note> good. This is a duty too to be done with all life. How glad ſhould we be if there be any opportunity for us, to ſhew our love unto God, or our hatred to ſinne, we ſhould be willing to ride or goe, or be at charges, nay,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42059:148"/>
we ſhould be willing to deny our ſelves, to lay downe our names and goods, and friends, and reſpects, and all that we have at Chriſts foot, and bleſſe God that gives us ſuch a price in our hands. But now to have a <hi>dead</hi> heart to this, what a horrible thing is it? though we doe take the opportunity, yet to goe about it, as though we were ſorry that God hath given it unto us; This is meere folly; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes; <hi>wherefore is there a price in the hand of a foole to get wiſdome, ſeeing he hath no heart to it?</hi> Prov. 17. 16.</p>
               <p>But I will not repeat any more; you ſee now that a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is as good as no Chriſtian at all; I ſhewed you the reaſons of this point: but I will let them paſſe. I come now to the uſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt this is for the reproof of the deadneſſe that<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> is now among us; the Lord may ſay to us, as he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sardis,</hi> I know thy workes, thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, <hi>and art dead;</hi> for notwithſtanding the great means of life, that the Lord hath placed among us, O how does deadneſſe of heart reigne; we are like them the Prophets ſpeakes of, <hi>that drew nigh to God with their mouth, and honoured him with their lips, but their heart was far from him;</hi> Matth. 15. 8. they had no heart to his holy worſhip. So it is with moſt of us; we draw nigh to God with our outward man, but our heart is farre from him; no heart to prayer, no heart to the word; we heare it peradventure, but no heart to it at all; how ordinarily doe we come to Gods houſe, but heartleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hath dominion over the moſt of us; the doctrine of the Goſpell does not quicken up our hearts, we deale with it as <hi>Phinehas</hi> his wife did with her Sonne, when the women about her told her ſhe had a Sonne, the text ſayes ſhe did not regard it. So what little regard have
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42059:149"/>
we of the Goſpell of God! <hi>I ſtretched out my hands and no man would regard,</hi> Prov. 1. tell us of our damned eſtate by nature, how curſed we are from the wombe, what infinite need we have to be ſenſible of it, we know it, but how <hi>dead</hi> is our knowledge of it? it does not ſtirre up our hearts to conſider of it; neither does it prick us ſo much as the pricking of a pin; tell us of the the redemption of the world by Jeſus Chriſt, his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud, his paſſion and merits, whoſe heart is enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and quickened up by them? nay, our ſoules are hardly moved at all at the hearing of them. Tell us of the Kingdome of heaven, the marriage Supper of the lamb, his Oxen, and his fatlings; O they are all ready, come Sirs, come to the marriage; we are even as they in the parable, <hi>they made light of it,</hi> Matth. 22. 5. theſe things are made as if they were of no moment, as if they were light matters, they finde poore entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at our hands; what little irk ſomneſſe do we feele in ſinne, what little dejectedneſſe of heart, what little remorſe of conſcience nay, few know by experience, what humiliation meanes; we can confeſſe in our prayers, how vile we are, and how unworthy and how wretched and ſinnefull but as though theſe were words of courſe, our hearts are ſo <hi>dead,</hi> that there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no relenting at it; we can ſay we are undone if God doe not heare us, our prayers are all nothing except they be with faith and life, and yet who ſtrives to awaken and rowze up himſelfe? we can ſay, O how are we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God, for life, for health, for his daily good providence, for his patience, his bounty? and we can ſay it is not the bare naming of his Bleſſings before him that is counted thankſgiving without being affected with his infinite goodneſſe; and yet who does unſeignedly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42059:149"/>
to be affected with them from day to day? no body of us dares deny but that we ſhould ſet the Lord alwayes before us, tthat he may be at our right hand, and yet who hath the heart to provoke this hereunto? The devill may be of their right hand &amp; not God for all the pains that they take to have him there. So that dead-heartednes is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon evill, now a dayes; as Chriſt ſaies of the laſt times. Becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, <hi>The love of many ſhall waxe Cold,</hi> Matth, 24. 12. ſo it is now; becauſe iniquity abounds the moſt are prophane, and diſſolute, and licentious and looſe, therefore many that profeſſion love to Jeſus Chriſt, their love does grow cold; and <hi>dead</hi> no life heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at all, no ſigne that they are alive from the <hi>dead;</hi> if they doe beleeve after a manner, there's all, they doe not live in Jeſus Chriſt; if they have any hope of mercy or heaven, that's all they have, it is not a lively hope, that may quicken them up in Gods holy wayes, if they doe ſee their ſinnes, there's the utmoſt, it is a <hi>dead</hi> ſight, that does not excite them up unto ſtrictneſſe and preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of living, if they doe follow good and godly duties, alas there be few that doe ſo, but if they doe goe ſo farre it is cleane without heart and life; as though any thing would ſerve Gods turne well enough; what a horrible thing i'ſt when a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is as good as no Chriſtian all. No matter how many Chriſtians we have, alas none of us are true, but ſuch as are alive from the <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, is it ſo that a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is even as good<note place="margin">2.</note> as no Chriſtian at all; then learne hence my Brethren, what a dangerous thing it is to be a <hi>dead</hi> hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p>Firſt, all that we doe with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, 'tis as good as<note place="margin">1.</note> nothing; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of love; <hi>had we all faith, and all</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:42059:150"/>
                  <hi>knowledge; yet if we have not love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 2. Whatſoever we doe, if we doe not doe it out of love, all's nothing; ſo I may ſay of life, whatſoever good duty we doe, if we doe not doe it with life; it is but a <hi>dead</hi> worke; and therefore it is no more then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; when the prophet <hi>David</hi> would doe good duties, ſo as to doe them to good purpoſe indeed, you ſhall ſee how he labours againſt a <hi>dead</hi> heart, <hi>Quicken me after thy loving kindneſſe, ſo ſhall I keepe the Teſtimony of thy mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119. 88. ſo we may ſay too, <hi>Lord quicken me after thy loving kindneſſe,</hi> ſo ſhall I preach, ſo ſhall I heare, ſo ſhall I doe thy holy will, ſo ſhall I goe up and downe doing good; now as long as a man does it with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, it is even all one as if a man had not done it at all; a <hi>dead</hi> man is no man, as the Apoſtle ſayes; God quickens the <hi>dead,</hi> and calls things that are not; marke, <hi>dead</hi> things are no things; ſo <hi>dead</hi> workes are no workes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes. There is no worke, and no deviſe, and no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and no purpoſe in the grave whether thou goeſt; that is, when men are <hi>dead,</hi> then they can doe nothing, ſo it is here; as long as we are <hi>dead,</hi> we can doe nothing. True, becauſe we have the life of ſenſe and of nature, and of a naturall conſcience in us; we may counterfeit good workes as a painter may make a man. True he cannot make a living man; ſo as long as we are <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,</hi> we doe but paint out good duties before God; all our Prayers are but painted prayers, all the good workes we doe, are but paint; there's none of them to the life; as God ſayes of the Jewes; you will ſay they did very many good workes; they faſted and prayed, and ſacrificed, and many other things they did. But what ſayes God? <hi>they are vanity, their workes are nothing,</hi> Iſa. 41. 29. as a <hi>dead</hi> Corps; there be eyes, and noſtrils

and eares and mouth; But when the life is out, they are as good as nothing; ſo it is with a <hi>dead</hi> heart; we may thinke we preach much, and ſtudy much, and heare much, and profeſſe much, and doe much; the truth is, we doe nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all that we doe with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, it does<note place="margin">2</note> not pleaſe God; God ſayes, <hi>my Son give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. ye know the heart, that is <hi>primum vivens</hi> that's the firſt living thing in us; now if we give God never ſo many performances, yet if all our heart be not with them, what cares he for them all, when they are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of heartleſſe things? when the Apoſtle had ſaid, that to be fleſhly minded is death, by and by he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes; ſo then ſayes he, <hi>they that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Rom. 8. 8. would that pleaſe any of us, that one ſhould come and rake up a <hi>dead</hi> ſtinking carcaſe, and lay it before us? no more can it pleaſe God, to lay a <hi>dead</hi> duty before his heavenly Majeſty; ye know a <hi>dead</hi> cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is loathſome, as long as life remaines in it, that's a ſweet thing, and it preſerves it from ſtinking; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heathens called the ſoule the ſalt of every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing; becauſe the life is a preſerving thing it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a thing ſweet; but when the life is gone out, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it becomes odious; ſo is all that we doe, when we doe it with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, it is odious with God, it cannot be accepted of him; as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes; <hi>Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe a holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to offer up ſpirituall Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. that is; the Apoſtle had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared true Chriſtians unto ſtones, now he correcteth himſelfe, did I call true Chriſtians ſtones? I pray doe not miſtake me, I doe not meane for deadneſſe, but for firmeneſſe; a ſtone is a <hi>dead</hi> liveleſſe thing. O ſayes he,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42059:151"/>
ye muſt be ſtones I, but ye muſt take heed of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ye muſt be lively, otherwiſe ye cannot offer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifices unto God; this is even as if a Jew ſhould have taken a <hi>dead</hi> ſheep out of a dich, and laid it on Gods Altar. This is abomination to God; even ſo are <hi>dead</hi> doings to Almighty God; <hi>as Vinagar to the teeth, and ſmoke to the eyes. ſo is a ſluggard to him that ſends him,</hi> Prov. 10. 26. that is, when a Maſter ſends a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant on his errand, if he goe dully about it, even as if he had no life nor heart in him at all, to doe his Maſters buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; this will not pleaſe him, nay, it will offend him, <hi>as ſmoke does the eyes; or as Vinegar does the teeth.</hi> it will make him looke with a ſowre looke upon ſuch a ſervant, ſo beloved when God bids us ſerve him, in all our wayes may be we are not ſo groſſe, as not to goe about it at all. But we goe about it with a dull and a <hi>dead</hi> heart, this does not pleaſe God one whit, nay, he takes it ill that we ſhould thinke he will accept it at our hands; as when the Jews had no heart to Gods holy and pure worſhip, it was too chargeable to them, it put them to too much charges; what a whole ſheep, and a whole lamb every morning, beſides many whole ones at other times, whole Bullocks, whole Oxen, and whole Goates, this was even as death to them, they went up to Gods Temple with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, nay, they thought much to give him of the beſt, they gave him the torne &amp; the maimed, now mark what he ſays; <hi>ſhould I accept this at your hand, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Malac. 1. 13. He took it ill, they ſhould thinke he would accept it, ſo when we thinke much to be ſo preciſe and ſo ſtrict, to pray ſo much, to heare ſo much, to minde him ſo much, and to deny our ſelves ſo much, to watch ſo much over our hearts, to humble our ſelves ſo much, what? may we not keep one luſt? may we have no more
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42059:151"/>
liberty then ſo? may be we doe ſome thing this way, but God knowes how with a <hi>dead</hi> heart it is, the Lord takes it ill, that we ſhould hope he will accept this at our hands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, all that we doe with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, it cannot<note place="margin">3.</note> yeeld us any comfort true if we were quickened up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, if we ſerved God with all our heart and ſoule and life, this would comfort us indeed; to ſeeke him daily in a lively manner, to goe into his preſence with all our minde; if we went eagerly a dayes to the throne of grace, if we were earneſt in prayer, earneſt againſt ſinne, earneſt for all goodneſſe, this were a ſigne of his favour, and a Teſtimony of the true grace of life this would comfort our hearts exceedingly; this would breed peace in our conſcience as the Apoſtle ſpeakes. <hi>To be ſpiritually minded is life and Peace,</hi> Rom. 8. 6. there's life, and therefore there is peace. The reaſon is thus; becauſe lively works alone can truely pacifie conſcience; when a man hath beene a profeſſour all his dayes, and done never ſo many things; yet if the conſcience can ſay, yea, but all theſe are <hi>dead</hi> workes, all this while I have gone on with a <hi>dead</hi>-heart, this fowles the conſcience; it can never have true peace. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge your conſcience from dead workes, to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. it ſhall purge the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from <hi>dead</hi> workes; <hi>dead</hi> workes foule the conſcience; whether they be dead for matter or manner; ſinne is a <hi>dead</hi> worke for matter, and good duties heartleſſely done are <hi>dead</hi> workes for manner; now both fowle the conſcience; the conſcience remaines under guilt; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues without peace; it is an ill conſcience; why? becauſe the conſcience knowes it hath the living God to ſerve that will not like of ſuch workes; when a man payes in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42059:152"/>
his rents onely by halves, or by dribblets or with light money, the Kings receiver will not give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance; my brethren, conſcience is Gods receiver, no wonder it does not give you an acquittance, when ye pay in onely waſh duties, clipt obedience; if ye ſerved God with life, conſcience would give you an acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; when ye have prayed, it would give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance; when ye have done a dayes worke in his harveſt, it would acknowledge the receipt of it, well done good and faithfull ſervant; it is well done in ſome meaſure. This made <hi>Paul</hi> full of life every day. <hi>Herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe to have always a conſcience void of offence towards God, and towards men,</hi> Act. 24. 16. that is, I doe not onely goe on in good duties both towards God and towards men, but this I doe always, I do even exerciſe my ſelfe, that I may have an acquittance from mine owne conſcience when I have done; that my conſcience may give me a true diſcharge; well done, I have done well in ſome meaſure; now as long as we are dead-hearted and hollow in Gods wayes, our conſcience can never give us a diſcharge, no marvell, that ſo few of us have Peace of conſcience, when we are ſo <hi>dead</hi>-hearted as we are; if we would ſtirre up our ſelves to ſerve God with all heart and life, we ſhould have Peace; but till this will be once, we can never looke to have Peace and comfort.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though we have comfort in time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,<note place="margin">4</note> yet we cannot have comfort in affliction, if we be of a <hi>dead</hi> heart; how many are there that ſeeme to have comfort while they are well, but when they come to be ſick, and at deaths doore, then they are all to peeces? then they ſee they have no grace, no faith, no good cards to ſhew; then they are ſtript ſtark naked, then
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42059:152"/>
their conſcience ſees what they are; O, I am a wretch; how have I deceived my ſelf; ſo beloved, though we have comfort in time of proſperity, yet if we be dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, we can have no comfort in affliction. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſayes, <hi>this is my comfort in affliction, thy word hath quickened me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 50. when the word of God hath quickened our hearts, and made us lively in all manner of goodneſſe, this will yeeld us comfort in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But if we be <hi>dead</hi> to all ſpirituall wayes, though we ſcramble up hopes now, they will not hold when affliction comes; now what a fearefull thing is't we ſhall all come to affliction ere long; for man is borne to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the ſparks that fly upward, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes; nay we know not how ſoone; man knoweth not his time as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeakes; but as the Fiſhes are caught in an evill Net, ſo are the Sonnes of men ſnared in an evill time, when it falleth ſuddenly on them. And God onely knowes what ſore afflictions we may have; the Cup of affliction is in Gods hand, and he tempers it and powres it out as his pleaſure is. I ſay what a fearfull thing is it not to have comfort then; then we have moſt need of comfort, and if we have not comfort then, we are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undone; now my brethren it is not a <hi>dead</hi> dull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will yeeld us comfort then? Let us thinke of this; as God ſayes, <hi>What will ye doe in your day of viſitation? to Whom will ye flye for helpe then?</hi> Iſa. 10. 3. ſo may I ſay, though ye can be quiet and comfortable enough now, in the dayes of health and peace, your deadneſſe does not trouble you now; but what will ye doe in the dayes of viſitation? doe but conſider what a ſorry comfort ye ſhall have then; aſſuredly a <hi>dead</hi> heart will aſſord not a ſyllable of true comfort then.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we can never bleſſe God with a <hi>dead</hi> heart; a<note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:42059:153"/>
                  <hi>dead</hi> heart is not able to affirme upon any good ground that God is his, or that the promiſe is his; or that Chriſt is his; the ſoule knowes Chriſt is a quickening ſpirit, and they that have him, are quickened up by him, the promiſe is a promiſe of life, and they cannot be <hi>dead</hi> that are the poſſeſſors of it, we cannot bleſſe God either for love or mercy or grace, or any thing elſe, when we would bleſſe God for any of theſe things, the deadneſſe of heart, it will be objected to us, O I am ſo <hi>dead,</hi> that how can I hope that theſe things belong unto me? <hi>Let my ſoule live, and it ſhall praiſe thee,</hi> Pſal. 119. 175. when the ſoule is alive towards God, then it can praiſe God; then it knowes all the good it hath, it hath it in mercy; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deadneſſe doe ever goe together, or it's a great marvell. And indeed what is deadneſſe of heart towards Chriſt, and all his holy Goſpell, but a ſecret doubting whether it have any part in it or no; as when a poore man ſees a rich treaſure, it does but <hi>dead</hi> him the more, becauſe he ſees no intereſt he hath in it; if he could ſee he had an intereſt in it, this would quicken up his heart, and put it out of it's dumps. And is not this now a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition when a man cannot praiſe God? if he pray, it is but in a ſorry manner, no life, no heart at all. But for bleſſing and praiſing of God, that he cannot doe at all, except he be in a fooles paradiſe; and dreame of a falſe gift. This is a dreadfull condition, when we are hindred from that which God moſt delighteth in; what is there that more delighteth God, then to bleſſe him and praiſe him? The Lord ſayes we never honour him otherwiſe, <hi>who ſo offereth me praiſe, he glorifieth me,</hi> Pſal. 50. 23. now we can never offer God praiſe, except our heart live</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Religion is a very irkſome thing unto us, as<note place="margin">6</note>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:42059:153"/>
long as we are dead-hearted; what is it that takes away the grievouſneſſe of it, but a lively heart? when the heart is <hi>dead,</hi> it muſt needs be very tedious; very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be thinking of God, to be meditating of death or the world to come; to be imployed in prayer, to be conſtant in the humbling of the ſoule, or the abſtaining from our naturall inclinations, to be diſcourſing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or ſtudying of Gods heavenly Kingdome; to be imployed in the word, or to goe through dirty and frozen wayes to it, to goe and repeate it in our Families or to urge it upon our hearts, O what weary tedious duties are theſe, when the heart is a <hi>dead</hi> heart! This is the reaſon why the world lets them all generally alone, and never troubles their hearts with them at all, becauſe they have no life in them; and many that are better minded, fend them very tedious, becauſe they are dead-hearted; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>correction is grievous to him that forſaketh the way,</hi> Prov. 15. 10. now as long as we are out of the way of life, while we are dead-hearted, we forſake the right way, and therefore correction is grievous unto us, nay, all the commandements of God are grievous unto us; does a <hi>dead</hi> heart rejoyce to goe to Prayer? nay, generally he is loth to goe to it; is he glad that the Sermon Bell rings; is he glad at an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to doe good? nay, does he not ſhrinke, and winch, and draw back? we ſee thus in the Jewes, how irkſome the Sabbath was to them, when they were held from buying and ſelling; <hi>O that the Sabbath were over,</hi> Am. 8. 5. it may be men doe not finde the Sabbath ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious now, becauſe they help themſelves by talking of the world, by taking liberty that way; but if they were held to it, as they ought to be, would they not wiſh it to be over, The like we may ſee in the young
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42059:154"/>
man, what an irkſome thing was it to him, to heare that he muſt fell away all? the Text ſayes, <hi>he was ſad at that ſaying,</hi> Mark. 10. 22. now is not this too a very hideous thing to be dead-hearted, when it makes all the wayes of God tedious? nothing ſhould be more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto us then they; they are perfect freedome; there is great reward in them, they are the beſt wayes in the world; all his wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe, and all his pathes are peace; and if we were quickened in our hearts, we would ſay ſo too; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes; when he had ſaid, <hi>that none of Gods Commandements are grievous;</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. in the next words he gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; O ſayes he, He that is borne of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world; that is, he that hath the life in him that cometh from above, he hath gotten above the world, he hath paſt all the irkſomneſſe of them. The irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any commandement, does not lie in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that is ſweet and pleaſant, but it lyes in the deadneſſe of the heart; <hi>a dead</hi> heart will ever count them grievous.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, as religion is an irkſome thing to a <hi>dead</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7</note> heart, ſo a <hi>dead</hi> heart, if it ſhould take it up, it will in the end be weary of it; as we ſee in the example of Iſrael when they grew to be dead-hearted towards God, at laſt they were weary of his worſhip, they went and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed othergets worſhips, an eaſier kinde of religion, they were weary of his. <hi>Thou haſt beene weary of me, O Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 43. 22. we ſee this in Judah too. <hi>Behold what a wearineſſe is it?</hi> Mal. 1. 13. this is too plaine and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; how are we growne weary of God, and of his pure ſervice? we have had the Goſpell ſo long, till we are even weary of it; weary of ſanctity, weary of ſpirituall truth; whence are all innovations but becauſe people
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42059:154"/>
are weary of the old way? many that have been very forward in preaching, and in hearing, and very zealous of good courſes, they begin to abate, to ſide with the times, to remit of their former ſtrictneſſe; whence is all this? whence is it that we ſee ſo many apoſtates, that once loved good people, now doe not; once were very ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt diſorders, now are not; once were againſt humane deviſes, now are not; now they can brook any thing well enough; they are weary of their firſt pitch, they were wound up too high, now they let themſelves downe againe; all this is becauſe men have no life in them; they are <hi>dead</hi> to what they did profeſſe; you ſhall ſee many a man ſmitten at the word, and there he is knockt downe, and ſees what wretched courſes he hath taken that will lead him to hell; well, he goes and reformes and growes very preciſe, and now there ſhall not be a Sermon but hee'l heare it. There ſhall not be any good Chriſtian duty, but he will take it up, hee'l leave his old acquaintance, hee'le joyne himſelfe to good people, hee'le have very good orders in his Family; all this is well; if't would hold; I but if this man doe not goe on to get the grace of life, in the end hee'le be weary; a <hi>dead</hi> heart be it never ſo forward, it will end in wearineſſe. It is meerely for want of quickening, that any man growes weary of well-doing; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes; <hi>Be not weary of well-doing, for in due time, ye ſhall reap, if ye faint not,</hi> Gal. 6. 9. take heed ye doe not let quickening goe; if ye let your quickening goe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly you'le grow weary; if ye ſuffer your ſelves to faint, if ye doe not get aqua-vitae, to cure your fainting ſits; you'le be weary of well-doing; now beloved what a pitifull thing is this, that we ſhould be weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing? if any of us have begun to doe well, O how
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42059:155"/>
ſhould we labour, that we may never grow weary; how ever things goe, though perſecution ariſe, what ever dealings we meet with at the hands of the wicked world, yet never to give in; what ever fleſh and bloud ſay, what ever diſcouragements we meet with, from without or from within, we ſhould earneſtly labour, that we may never be weary of wel-doing; never weary of preaching to their conſcience, never weary of attending on the word, or of preaching of our hearts, or of reſiſting of ſinne, or of redeeming our time, or of keeping our garments, never weary of waſhing our hands in innocency, and keeping of our ſelves, that the wicked one touch us not; and therefore what a dangerous thing is it to be dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted? for that's the high way, to be weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing at the laſt. This then is the ſecond uſe, that we are to make of this point; to ſee what a dangerous thing it is to be a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian.</p>

               <p>I Come now to the fourth thing, and that is this; what it is to be aliving Chriſtian. Firſt, I will deſcribe it by the efficient cauſe. Secondly, by the Inſtrumentall cauſe. Thirdly, by the parts of it.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the efficient cauſe that makes one a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">1.</note> Chriſtian, is God; as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life,</hi> Pſal. 36. 9. He is the fountaine of al life; it is he that makes one a living man. <hi>He giveth life and breath to all,</hi> Act. 17. 25. if he ſhould take away our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life, we dye and turne againe unto our earth; as
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42059:155"/>
long as he breatheth on us we live; as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>the breath of the Almighty gives me life,</hi> Job. 33. 4. yea all the world would be a <hi>dead</hi> Chaos, if he did not quicken it; there's a kinde of life in every thing that hath being. But it would be a <hi>dead</hi> Maſſe, if he did not concurre with it; what is money, and meat, and clothes, and friends, and life, and health it ſelfe? men thinke they are well to live when they have them all. True, if he bleſſe them and quicken them unto us; but if he be wanting to them, they are <hi>dead</hi> things, and can doe us no good; nay, the word of life it ſelf, it is but a <hi>dead</hi> letter without him, all the ordinances of God, we ſee they Miniſter life to ſome, becauſe God puts life into them, but if he doe not put life into them, they are ſappeleſſe and cadaverous things; ſo that God is the author, even of our naturall life; as <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>in him is life, and his life is the life of men,</hi> Joh. 1. 4. in him we live, and move and have our being; and therefore it is a great ſinne not to be thankfull to him for our naturall life; <hi>David</hi> bleſſes God for his naturall life very often; life is a very great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a poor thing that hath life, a living dog, is better then a <hi>dead</hi> Lyon. A man will give skinne for skinne, and all that he hath for his life: I am ſure many of us may be very glad of life, for if it were gone now, we ſhould be in hell; and therefore we had need to make much of our naturall life, yea, every houre of it, leaſt we dye before we be converted, and brought home to God.</p>
               <p>But this is not the life that we doe ſpeake of; we ſpeak of ſpirituall life, and God is the author of that more eſpecially; when a man is alive towards God, he is the onely cauſe of it. He ſpiritually moveth our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, and begets us againe after a ſtrange, and an ineſſable manner; by joyning his ſpirit to our ſpirits,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42059:156"/>
his minde to our mindes, and his will to our willes, he revives all the powers of the ſoule with his preſence; and therefore this life is called the life of God; which the world are ſtrangers to and aliens from; <hi>being alienated from the life of God;</hi> Eph. 4. 18. ſo likewiſe it is called <hi>the life of Ieſus.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 11. He onely is the author of it. Thus ye ſee the efficient cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Inſtrumentall cauſe of this life, is true<note place="margin">2.</note> faith; this is the ligament that couples this life and a man together; that now he is ſaid to be a living man; ye know God is the onely living God; they that are not united unto him, remaine in the congregation of the <hi>dead;</hi> now faith unites a man unto him; faith is the having of him; <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh 5. 12. when a man cleaves unto God, by a true and lively faith, this man hath life; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes, <hi>That thou mayſt love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayſt obey his voyce, and that thou mayſt cleave unto him, for he is thy life,</hi> Deut. 30. 20. Though a man hath not that ſtrong faith that ſome have, whereby he hath a cleare evidence of Gods love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in Jeſus Chriſt, though a man have not this faith, yet if he have a faith of adherence, and cleaving unto God, this man is a living Chriſtian; this man is joyned unto the true life; This is the true God, and even life, and therefore whoſoever cleaves to him, hath life; if he will not away from him, he will ſtill ſeeke him, ſtill pray unto him, ſtill make him his refuge, though he have no feelings, that is not it; if a man will never give over ſeeking of God; He beleeves God is the fountaine of all life and peace, and grace and comfort, and Gods way, is the onely way; he beleeves himſelfe is a curſed wretch in himſelfe, and that all hope is in Chriſt, now
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42059:156"/>
if this man have ſuch a faith whereby he adheres, though with never ſo much weakneſſe, this man is a live. This is the faith whereby a Chriſtian lives; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>the life that I live, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Thus ye ſee the Inſtrumentall cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, now for the parts of it. The parts of it are<note place="margin">3.</note> three.</p>
               <p>The firſt part is the life of Juſtification; ye know eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">1.</note> man by nature is a <hi>dead</hi> man; as a malefactour that hath committed an offence that is death by mans Law, we ſay he is a <hi>dead</hi> man; ſo we have all offended God from the womb which is death by Gods Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are <hi>dead</hi> men; now when God hath juſtified a man freely by his grace, when God hath given him a pardon in Chriſt Jeſus; now he is a live man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Juſtification as ye heard, is called <hi>Iuſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. now beloved this life is not in the man that does live, but in Chriſt that he lives by; this life ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no life in this party; no, it lookes upon him as a <hi>dead</hi> man in himſelf. But God counts him alive in Jeſus Chriſt; as the Apoſtles ſayes, <hi>Chriſt is our life;</hi> Col. 3. 4. q d this life is not in us, but in Chriſt; ſo that this life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominats aman alive; as Chriſt denominated the demoſel alive, that was yet <hi>dead. The Damoſell is not dead, ſayes he</hi> Matth. 9. 24. ye know the Damoſell was <hi>dead</hi> at that time, when Chriſt ſaid ſo; and yet he ſaid ſhe was not <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe he had life for her; ſhe had life in him; now when he raiſed her up, then ſhe had life in her too.</p>
               <p>And ſo I come to the ſecond part of this life; and that<note place="margin">2.</note> is the life of Sanctification, and this life is in him that doth live; for though he were <hi>dead</hi> before to all goodneſſe and holineſſe, and alive unto ſinne, yet now he is made
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42059:157"/>
                  <hi>dead</hi> unto ſinne, and alive unto God; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>likewiſe alſo reckon ye your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſinne, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6. 11. this life is called the life of grace, and new obedience, when a man is quickened up to all the wayes of God; <hi>you hath he quickened, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. and this is the quickening that I would faine open to you.</p>
               <p>The third part of this life, is the life of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;<note place="margin">3.</note> ye know when a mans eyes are opened to ſee his ſinnes, and his damned eſtate, by reaſon of them, the Law comes and that kils him, his very heart dyeth in him; now when God propounds to him a Saviour, and cauſes him to beleeve in him, this revives his heart againe; this yeelds him ſome joy and comfort ſo that true joy is a life too; we may ſee this in the Children of God, let their joyes and comforts be all gone, this makes them all amort, this makes them very heavy and ſad, as if they had no life at all in them; as the Church ſayes; <hi>Wilt thou not revive us againe? that thy people may rejoyce in thee,</hi> Pſal. 85. 6.</p>
               <p>Now my brethren, all this is onely by way of preface; to come then to the queſtion, what is it to be a quickened Chriſtian? a Chriſtian that hath not onely a name to live, but is <hi>dead? dead</hi> towards God? <hi>dead</hi> to all good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? no: But is quickened up to them. I anſwer, that as death is taken in a metaphoricall ſenſe, when we ſay ſuch a one is <hi>dead</hi> to God, <hi>dead</hi> to the holy ordinances of God, we doe not meane properly <hi>dead,</hi> as if he were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <hi>dead,</hi> and had no ſoule in his body; but we take it in metaphoricall ſenſe; ſo is life here to be taken too; namely for the activeneſſe of a thing; when a thing is not active, we uſe to ſay it is <hi>dead;</hi> as <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe is
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42059:157"/>
ſaid to be <hi>dead; he conſidered not the deadneſſe of Sarahs womb,</hi> Rom. 4. 19. that is, her womb had no activity to conceive; now when a wombe is active this way, then we ſay it is quick; ſo a coale that hath ſire in it, is ſaid to be a live coale: <hi>There flew one of the Seraphins, having a live coale in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 6. 6. we call it alive coale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is active; it is able to burne; whereas if that fire were out, then it were not able to burne, and therefore then we call it a <hi>dead</hi> coale; ſo when a man is active to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, Take him in prayer, there he can act now; take him in ſelfe deniall, in reconciling of himſelfe, in humbling of the heart, in mourning for ſinne, in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering after righteouſneſſe, even as a man does after his appointed food, take him in any of the things of God, though he were like a <hi>dead</hi> coale afore, yet here he can act now; now he can move this way; when one is like a block in good duties, that man is <hi>dead;</hi> we call mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things living things; <hi>Every moving thing that liveth,</hi> Gen. 9. 3. when a thing cannot ſtirre, that we call <hi>dead;</hi> when a man is not ſtirring in heavenly things, he is ſtirring enough in earthly, but he cannot ſtir in heavenly things; that man is a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian, though he profeſſe never ſo much, yet if he be not ſtirring towards God from day to day, he is <hi>dead; I thinke it meet to ſtirre you up,</hi> ſayes Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. that is, I think it meet to quicken you up. Now beloved, this being ſo, if ye would know what it is to be alive towards God, let us but finde out a little, what is the life of a man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is the life of a mans underſtanding; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">1.</note> thinke that bare knowledge is, and approving of Gods wayes, and thinking of them now and then; they thinke this is the life of their underſtandings. But you ſhall ſee theſe are not it; therefore we will ſearch out what is the life of the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:42059:158"/>Secondly, what is the life of the will or of the heart;<note place="margin">2.</note> people are apt to thinke that wiſhings and wouldings, and velleities, if they have ſome volitions towards God and all holy courſes, they thinke their wills are alive; no; theſe are not it; therefore we will ſearch too, wherein the life of the will does conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what is the life of the conſcience; people<note place="margin">3.</note> generally doe conceive that if their conſciences doe check them for their ſinnes, and ſmite them for evill, and excuſe them in other things that are good, then their conſcience is alive; now we deſire to enquire, what is the life of the conſcience indeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what is the life of the affections; I gave<note place="margin">4.</note> you a touch of theſe when I ſhewed you what it is to be <hi>dead;</hi> now let me ſpeake of them more fully, to ſhew you what it is to be alive.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, what is the life of the underſtanding; ye know there be many things in the underſtanding; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, approving, ſtudying; determining; now the world thinks that when the underſtanding is ſo far wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to know Chriſtian religion, to approve it to ſtudy it to determine aright upon things; evill things to be evill, good things to be good; duties to be duties, ſins to be ſins: now they ſuppoſe their underſtandings are alive. But the truth is, none of all theſe are the life of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. The underſtanding hath another life beſides theſe. The underſtanding may have all theſe, and be <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As firſt, for knowledge, I need not ſtand to prove that; the <hi>dead</hi> Heathens, the Apoſtle ſayes they knew God; <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,</hi> Rom 1. 21. knowledge is not enough; as cur Saviour Chriſt ſpeakes; <hi>iſ ye knew theſe things, bleſſed are ye if ye doe them,</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:42059:158"/>
Joh. 13. 17. nay, literall knowledge does not ſo much as give them underſtanding, true light, much leſſe life; a great learned divine that is wicked, his underſtanding is ſtill in darkneſſe; nay, it may leave him more <hi>dead,</hi> then thoſe that are groſlely Ignorant; as the Prophet ſayes of them that had knowledge; <hi>I will get me to the great men, for they have knowne the way of the Lord, but theſe have altogether broken the Yoke,</hi> Jer. 5. 5. they were more <hi>dead,</hi> their hearts were more averſe from all goodneſſe. Bare knowledge is a poore thing, and yet people are apt to glory in it, the Apoſtle makes a piſh at it; <hi>we know we have all knowledge,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 1. q. d. is that ſuch a peece of matter? never tell me of your knowledge; I know ye all have knowledge; but that's a poore thing; nay, the greater is thy woe, if thou haſt not a quickened mind; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>he that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow,</hi> Eccl. 1. 18. thou increaſeſt thine owne ſelfe condemning, the more thou haſt, the greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in thy Boſome, thou knoweſt, the more thou feeſt to condemne thee; thy knowledge is like a ſword in thy bowels, that daily galls thee, and wounds thee; and therefore little reaſon to thinke that knowledge is the life of the minde, it is not ſo much as the light of the minde; take heed ſayes our Saviour, <hi>that the light that is in thee be not darkneſſe,</hi> Luk. 11. 35. that is, thou mayſt have a great deale of light, and yet be in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; nay, in worſe darkneſſe, then Ignorant blinde people that have no light at all; <hi>if the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe,</hi> Matth. 6. 23. ſuch people are more ſenſeleſſe at the word, harder to be wrought on, they have the more diſtinctions to deceive their owne ſoules, they thinke to well of themſelves; they are too wiſe to be fooles, that they may be wiſe,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42059:159"/>
they are farther of from confeſſion; if they had leſſe knowledge, it may be there might be more hope to doe them good. But having ſo much knowledge in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall minde, it is made a ſtrong hold againſt grace; it is with ſuch people as it was with <hi>Babylon; thy wiſedome, and thy knowledge hath perverted thee,</hi> Iſa. 47. 10. true knowledge is a good thing; but when a man is fleſhed with it, that he takes himſelfe to be ſome body, this marres all; but I will ſpeake no more of this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for approving of the truth; that cannot<note place="margin">2</note> be the life of the minde neither; when a man approves goodneſſe, and good people, this indeed is an excellent mercy of God to make a man approve goodneſſe, and good men, O how are ſuch bound to be thankfull! few goe ſo farre. But alas if thou goeſt no farther, thy minde is not yet quickened up to God; as the Apoſtle ſhewes, that a man <hi>dead</hi> in his ſinnes ſtill, may yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the beſt things. <hi>Thou knoweſt his will, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveſt the things that are moſt excellent,</hi> Rom. 2. 18. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> approved <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and his preaching. <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath</hi> approved <hi>David</hi> and all his wayes; nay, the devill approved Chriſt. <hi>I know thee who thou art, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of God;</hi> Mark. 1. 24. Suppoſe thou approveſt all the wayes of Chriſt, O what good wayes they be, thou likeſt his promiſes, thou counteſt his Ordinances admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good and lovely, O conſider what the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>happy is the man that condemneth not himſelfe in that he alloweth,</hi> Rom. 14. 22. ſo may I ſay to thee, doſt thou allow of all ſtrictneſſe and pureneſſe and preciſe people? O ſayeſt thou the preciſer the better! this is well; now thou art a happy man, if thou doeſt not condemne thy ſelfe in that which thou alloweſt; thou alloweſt of the ſtricteſt Servants of God, but if thou condemneſt thy
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42059:159"/>
ſelfe now; and thy conſcience can tell thee, I but I doe not ſet my ſelfe to be as they are. I can loſe my ſelfe; poore creature, thy allowings and approvings will riſe up in Judgement againſt thee; ſo that this is a poore thing too; approving of goodneſſe may be in a perſecutor; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us that the Jewes did allow of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; <hi>and yet they would not leave perſecuting of him,</hi> Act. 24. 15. nay, Chriſts perſecutors they allowed of all goodneſſe, they profeſſed ſo much at leaſt; for a good worke we ſtone thee not; therefore approbation cannot be the life of the minde neither.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thinking of God and of the word, that is not<note place="margin">3.</note> the life of the minde; and yet many men hang upon this too; that they thinke of God, and of his wayes, and of their latter end. True ſome are ſo graceleſſe, that they come not thus farre; God is hardly in all their thoughts, Pſal. 10. 4. But though a man doe thinke of God, and of heaven, and of Gods Lawes, indeed it's a great mercy of God; thus far it might doe a man a world of good, and it did <hi>David;</hi> this made him return into the way whereſoever he went. <hi>I thought upon my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119. 59. yet if this be all, this is no argument of life. The wicked Jewes, Chriſt confeſſes they thought upon God and upon the Scriptures, nay, more they thought to have eternall life in them; <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye thinke ye have eternall life,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. This is ſo farre from being an Act of life, as that if a man live in ſin for all that, it aggravates a mans ſinnes. The drunkard when he goes to the Ale-houſe, it may be he thinks of the word of God, that ſayes a drunkard ſhall not inherit Gods Kingdome, and yet he will goe though; a lyer when he lyes, it may be he thinks at the ſame time, of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42059:160"/>
word of God, that ſayes the devill is a lyer, and lyers ſhall lie in the lake that burnes with fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſtudying is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the life of the minde; this is<note place="margin">4</note> that which bewitches many Miniſters; they ſtudy all the day of God and his Kingdome and of eternall life; they are all the day ſtudying of Jeſus Chriſt, and of faith and repentance, perhaps they thinke this is heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. O they love a life to ſtudy Divinity; as the Jewes ſaid, <hi>we delight to know thy wayes,</hi> Iſa. 58. 2. I grant ſtudying is an intenſe act of the minde, but that it is a lively act of the minde, that I deny; that is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo; nay, ſtudying may be in the higheſt degree in a minde that is <hi>dead</hi> to what it ſtudies, though never ſo eager to it, as it is <hi>ſcibile</hi> of divine things: for what is ſtudying? ſtudying is nothing elſe but the boulting out of the logique in the Scripture; now if a man reſt there, he is never the neerer, if it doe not recoyle on his owne minde, when he ſtudies of grace, if he doe not ſeek how to get it; when he ſtudies the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, if he doe not get it mortified in himſelfe, all this is nothing; we ſee the poore ſimple Ignorant people ran after Jeſus Chriſt; who were the great ſtudents of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, were ſo farre from doing ſo, that they ſat and derided them for their labour, yea, and called them ſilly ſimplicians, as though it had been a giddy humour in them; therefore ſtudying cannot be it neither.</p>
               <p>Well then it remaines to ſhew you what is the life of the minde that if the minde doe give that unto God, it is alive towards God, I anſwer. All theſe are the dull acts of the minde, they may be in the minde concerning God and all his wayes, yea, in a very high degree, and yet the minde <hi>dead</hi> towards the ſame. The Apoſtle tels the Jewes in his ſecond Epiſtle and the firſt Chapter, <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:42059:160"/>
                  <hi>they knew all theſe things before; I ſayes he in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the firſt verſe,</hi> I would ſtirre up your mindes, that is, I would quicken up your mindes; as we uſe to ſay, when a man lookes about him; when a man gives his minde to a thing, this is the ſtirrings of the minde, now the minde is quickened up.</p>
               <p>Now there be ſix ſtirring acts in the mindes of men; now looke which way they ſtand, it's moſt plaine the minde is alive, whether to God, or to the things of the world.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is the application of the minde.<note place="margin">1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, is the meditating of the minde.<note place="margin">2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third, is the conſidering of the minde<note place="margin">3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth, is the remembring of the minde.<note place="margin">4</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, is the deviſing of the minde.<note place="margin">5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth, is the Judging of the minde. Theſe are all<note place="margin">6.</note> the ſtirring and lively acts of the minde, and the minde does not let out theſe acts any way, but that way, that a man is alive to, whether it be to the world or the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay the application of the minde; the minde<note place="margin">1.</note> hath this nature in it, though it know a thing never ſo much, or approve it, or thinke of it, or ſtudy it, yet except it doe incorporate with the thing, it doth not come to apply it; if it incorporate with the minde, then it will apply it; as we ſee in a worldling, whatſoever good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry he knows, if he know any way of getting of gaine, he applies it, and takes it to himſelfe; why his minde is alive to the Profits of the world, he can relliſh ſavour in them; ſo when the minde begins to be applying of divine things, now it is alive unto God; as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iob. Heare it and know it for thy good;</hi> Job. 5. 27. that is, doe not onely know it, but be quickened up to apply
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42059:161"/>
it to thy ſelfe for thine owne good; as the Prophet ſayes; <hi>hearken diligently, and eat ye that which is good,</hi> Iſa. 55. 2. that is, I would have your mindes not onely to attend, but let them be quickened up to apply, and feed upon what ye know; let it be your food; a quickened minde is like the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt; when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>one of you ſhall betray me; they were all very ſorry, and they began every one of them to ſay, Lord is it I?</hi> Matth. 26. 21. they all did apply it, you ſee how his ſpeech ſtirred their mindes, they fell preſently to apply; ſo when a man cannot heare any ſinne ripped up; but preſently he cryes out, <hi>Lord it is I:</hi> Is it I that am guilty of this ſinne? O if it be I, let me ſee it that I may leave it; if he heare of any threatning; he ſayes <hi>Lord is it I?</hi> O teach me, that I may be humbled; when he heares of any grace; <hi>Lord is it I,</hi> that have this grace? O if it be not I, O let it be I; a quickened minde, is an applying minde; now if the minde be yet <hi>dead,</hi> it cares not for applying, though it know never ſo much, yet it lets the word ſtill be a ſtranger unto it, it does not take it home to it ſelfe; like the hearers there in <hi>Hoſea;</hi> as God ſayes, <hi>I writ to them the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 12. they would not take them home, now a quickened minde takes them home; this reproofe is to me, this Commandement is to me; this reproof is to me; nay, when a reproof to ones thinking of all other ſhould ſeeme leaſt to concerne him; as when our Saviour Chriſt ſpake againſt rich men; <hi>O how hardly ſhall a rich man enter into the Kingdome of God!</hi> yet the Apoſtles took it to themſelves; <hi>they were amazed ſayes the Text,</hi> Matth. 19. 25. one would have thought the doctrine ſhould little concerne them; alas, they were not ſo rich, but they applyed it though, fearing leaſt that little that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42059:161"/>
they had ſhould draw their hearts away from God; this then is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the meditating of the minde; this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">2</note> ſtirring act of the minde; a naturall man may think of his eternall good now and then, but this is nothing, his minde is <hi>dead</hi> for all that. But when a mans minde runnes on ſuch things, now it is alive; look what your mindes doe run on, that your mindes are alive to; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is moſt certane, that that is it which you reſpect moſt; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes; <hi>I will meditate on thy precepts, and have reſpect unto thy wayes,</hi> Pſal. 119. 15. A <hi>dead</hi> mind may light on good thoughts, but when a man meditates of them, when his minde runneth upon ſuch themes; this mans minde is alive to them, he gives his minde to them; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to <hi>Timothy; meditate on theſe things, give thy ſelfe wholly to them, that thy profitting may appeare,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 15. you may ſee this in ungodly men, they doe not onely thinke of the world, for ſo a godly man may doe and muſt doe, but their mindes runne on the world; they give their mindes to it; it is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaying; <hi>they minde earthly things,</hi> Phil. 4. 19. it may be they know gracious things, I but they minde earthly; they cannot finde in their heart to give their mindes to Gods word and will, ſo that would you prove your ſelves and your mindes to be alive towards God? labour that your mindes may bend their meditations that way; let your mindes runne on him, and how ye may have his favour, and how ye may keep it, how ye take heed of offending of him; a man is yet <hi>dead,</hi> that does not give his minde to theſe things; whoſe minde does not runne on them daily. And therefore beloved as ever ye do deſire to have a proofe of your life towards God, let your mindes runne on theſe things, give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42059:162"/>
heed that they may not ſlip out of your mindes; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>ye ought to give ſo much the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heed to the things which ye have heard, leaſt at any time ye let them ſlip.</hi> Heb. 2. 1. if they doe ſlip away ye know not how, as the fleſh will let them goe, if ye doe not take heed, call for them againe as God. <hi>ſayes Bring it againe to minde, O ye tranſgreſſors,</hi> Iſa. 46. 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the conſidering of the minde; when the<note place="margin">3.</note> minde lookes curſorily on things, what is this but the remiſſeneſſe and looſeneſſe of the minde? now when the minde comes to conſider ſeriouſly of them, now it quickens up it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now it lookes wiſhly and intentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on them indeed; alas all our knowledge of the truth, all our approving of good courſes, all is nothing without conſideration; our knowledge and approbation are <hi>dead</hi> things without this; even as good, as if we had no knowledge at all, for all the good it will doe us, if we doe not conſider; as God ſayes; <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doe not conſider,</hi> Iſa. 1. 3. looke what our mindes doe conſider from day to day, that our minds are lively on; conſideration is the eagerneſſe of the minde, when the minde cares not for an object, it will not trouble it ſelfe to conſider of, a leſſe act will ſerve ſuch a thing well enough; but looke what the minde is inclined unto, there it will not goe ſlightly and lightly to worke, there 'twill take paines, nay, it counts it no paines to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and to weigh things as in a Ballance; as it is ſaid of <hi>Mary, looke what ſhe heard from Chriſt, ſhe kept it and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it in her heart,</hi> Luk. 2. 19. ſhe pondered it, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in a ballance, O it was matter of great weight with her minde; where the minde is alive, there it will conſider and ponder and weigh, nay, there is not a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, but the minde will take it to conſideration.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42059:162"/>
Take a man that is alive to the things here below, how conſiderative is that man, in all matters of that nature: As for example now, for his gaine; he takes every thing into conſideration that may make for his gaine; He will have his wits about him, when he buyes or ſels, when he ſowes or reaps; he conſiders with himſelfe; that he will not ſow too ſoon, or too late in the year, or a grain that the ground will not beare, he conſiders how long it was ſince it was fallow, how long it will beare, till it be laid fallow againe; he conſiders when he may ſell deareſt, when he may buy cheapeſt; when is the beſt time to put off a commodity. This is the lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his minde in theſe things. Take this man now for his ſoule, his minde is ſtarke heavy, any looſe thoughts ſhall ſerve turne for that, he does not conſider here. But when a man is a live unto God, now his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations runne out this way, now he is conſiderative this way, for his ſoule, for his ſpirituall and eternall good. Beloved conſideration is a lively act of the minde; as you may ſee there in <hi>Moſes. Know therefore this day and conſider it in thy heart; that the Lord he is God in heaven above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon the earth beneath,</hi> Deut. 4. 39. that is, doe not onely know it, but quicken up thy minde to conſider it; this will doe thee good indeed; this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect Act of the minde; as we ſee in <hi>David; when I conſider the Heavens the worke of thy hands, the Moone, and the Starres which thou haſt ordained; then I ſay, Lord what is man?</hi> Pſal. 83, 4. you ſee how ſtirring his minde was, when he conſidered the heavens and the earth, it wrought mightily on him; it made him the more humble. Others ſee the Heavens every day, and it does not move them one whit to Humiliation before God. But when the minde comes once to conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it ſhakes off its dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42059:163"/>
and remiſſneſſe, then it growes buſie, ſuch a man will not goe to Prayer, but he conſiders what he goes about, what a great God he is to ſpeake to, what a vile creature himſelfe is that is to pray to him; he will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he may pray with faith and hope and feeling of his wants; how he may riſe up from his knees not without profit. Now he will not goe to the word, but he will conſider what it is he repaires to, now all his mind is how he may get good, now he is buſie in every duty; when he is tempted to doe as others doe, he conſiders what the iſſue will be, and this makes him forbeare. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this is the life of our mindes, when they conſider things; when we conſider our latter end; when we conſider Gods promiſes; when we conſider his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when we take his commandements into our deep conſideration, when we conſider the danger of ſinne, we doe not onely know all theſe things but we conſider them. Though we know neere ſo much, yet except we conſider what we know, our mindes are lumpiſh and dead; conſideration is the activity of the minde; and therefore if we would prove our ſelves to be alive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, let us put on conſideration a dayes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the remembring of the minde; when the<note place="margin">4.</note> minde forgets it ſelfe every day, this is nothing but the deadneſſe of the minde; for if it be alive to a thing, it will be ſure to remember it ſelfe of that, if it oan; <hi>Can a maide forget her ornaments, or a Bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me dayes without number,</hi> Jer. 2. 32. that is, my people are dead-minded to me; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded me, they would remember themſelves every day, to ſerve me; looke what a man is alive to, the minde will be ſure to remember us of that; we can have no journey to take, but our mindes remember us of it;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42059:163"/>
no buſineſſe to doe, to feed our Cattell, to milke our kine every morning, and evening, to ſheare our ſheepe every <hi>Lammas,</hi> if we forget any thing in this kinde, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it's a 100. to one, but we remember our ſelves; now when a man is alive to the beſt things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he will remember himſelfe of them every day; ſo <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I remembred thy name O Lord, yea, in the night too, and ſo I kept thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 55. I remembred my ſelfe, and I would be ſure to doe what God bid me do; it may be his heart began to ariſe, but preſently he remembred himſelfe, and beat it downe againe; it may be ſome other luſt began to be up, but by and by he remembred him, and checked his owne ſoule; when the minde is alive towards God, the knowledge of the word does not lie <hi>dead</hi> in that man; but ſtill he remembers it at every need; when the Sabbath is coming; then thinkes he I remember what God bade me doe. Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy; when the Sacrament comes, then he remembers himſelfe, O thinkes he, let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eat of that Bread and drinke of that Cup; now the minde thinkes, I will labour to remember God continually; what ever I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, I will not forget him; when I riſe up, when I lie downe, ſtill I will ſet my ſelfe to remember him; when I goe out, when I come home; what ever the Devill ſay, what ever the fleſh whiſper, I will labour ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God; if I be tempted to wrath; then I deſire to remember what God ſayes; give not place to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; when I feel ſpirituall lazineſſe, then I will unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to remember what God ſpeakes unto me, curſed is he that does the worke of the Lord negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the inventings or the deviſings of the heart;<note place="margin">5.</note>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:42059:164"/>
where the minde is naturally bent and alive, there it is witty, if riches, if preferment, if pleaſure, if learning be a mans luſt that he lives, in there he is witty; ſo when a man is a live unto God, his wit will have that way it's vent; as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>I finde out witty inventions</hi> Prov. 8. 12. he ſpeakes not onely of himſelfe, But of his grace in every one, that is this; when the minde is alive &amp; ſet towards Chriſt, it will finde out witty inventions; nay, it's a ſtrange thing though men have no parts, yet if they be worldly, how witty they are for ſuch matters; and ſo for good people, whoſe mindes are turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, though they be of very weake parts, yet how witty they will be in good things; what pretty ways they will have to doe good, to ſhunne offences; to break occaſions of ſinne; as a Miniſter in his preaching; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I caught you with guile,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 16. ſo let man have a liberall minde, the Prophet ſayes he <hi>will deviſe liberall things,</hi> Iſa. 32. 8. <hi>mercy and truth ſhall be to them that deviſe good;</hi> Prov. 14. 22. whence comes the bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhneſſe of our mindes; but from this, that our mindes are ſo <hi>dead;</hi> if our mindes were more alive towards God, it would make us more graciouſly witty, we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe good things, finde out admirable inventions, it would teach us plots againſt Satan, plots againſt the fleſh, as the wicked, their mindes are full of ſinfull deviſes, fetches, ſtratagems, policies, a man would wonder to ſee how witty the devill is in them, to carry them headlong to hell, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, the judging of the minde. But I<note place="margin">6.</note> ſpake of this not long agoe; and therefore I will let it alone now; thus I have ſhewed you, what a lively Chriſtian is in regard of his minde.</p>
               <p>Now the next is, that we ſhew you what a live Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is in regard of the heart, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:42059:164"/>And then in regard of the conſcience, &amp;c. and then in regard of the affections, &amp;c.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe point we are in, is this; That a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is as good as no Chriſtian at all. Firſt, we have opened the meaning of this point; and ſhewed you what is meant by a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian. Secondly, we have ſhewed you that this is ſo, by going over all the graces of Gods ſpirit; a man hath near a one of them all that is <hi>dead;</hi> againe by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all the duties of Chriſtian Religion; ye heard, a man does neare a one of them all, as long as he does them onely in a <hi>dead</hi> hearted manner. Thirdly, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the reaſons of this point, why a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian is even as no Chriſtian at all; there be many reaſons of it, it ſtands with good reaſon that it ſhould be ſo. Fourthly, we began to ſhew you the uſes of this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how wide then are they that are profanely wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> if they that are Chriſtians, and do the things contained in the Goſpell are rejected, becauſe they doe them with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, where ſhall they appeare that will not doe them at all?</p>
               <p>Secondly, another uſe was to condemne theſe times<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> of ours, wherein for the moſt part people are <hi>dead.</hi> There be not many that doe live like Chriſtians at all in outward appearance, and yet how many of that little number are even <hi>dead</hi> and without life? <hi>they draw neere unto God with their outward man, but their hearts are farre from him,</hi> Matth. 15. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:42059:165"/>Thirdly, another uſe was to ſhew you the danger of<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> being a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſtian, I ſhewed it in ſeven things. But I will not name them againe.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place we are come to ſhew you, what it<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> is to be alive Chriſtian; a Chriſtian quickened up towards God; and here I ſhewed you, Firſt, who is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and prime cauſe of this life and quickening, and that is God, who quickeneth the <hi>dead;</hi> God the Father quickens whom he will; God the Son he quickens whom he will, and God the Holy Ghoſt, he is the ſpirit of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhewed you what is the Inſtrument of this life, and that is faith; this faith when it is a true and a lively faith, it makes a man adhere to the fountaine of life. <hi>That thou maiſt cleave unto him, for he is thy life,</hi> Deut. 30. 20. Faith is the having of God for our God, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhewed you the parts of this life; and the parts of it I ſhewed you were three. The firſt is, <hi>the life of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. The ſecond is, <hi>the life of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Eph. 2. 5. The third is, <hi>the life of conſolation or comfort,</hi> Pſal. 85. 6.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the life of ſanctification is here principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended, when a man is quickened up towards God, and all his holy wayes; therefore I deſcended downe to the branches of this life, and quickening in all the powers of the ſoule. The laſt day we began to ſearch about the underſtanding, what is the life and quickening of that towards God.</p>
               <p>And firſt, we ſhewed you that bare knowing is not it;<note place="margin">1.</note> a man may know God &amp; all his ways contemplatively, &amp; yet not be quickened up to them; as <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, <hi>my God we knowledge thee,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 2. and yet as it followes, they
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42059:165"/>
were not quickened up for all that; <hi>the Gentiles knew God,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. I but they did not glorifie him as God; it was <hi>dead</hi> knowledge; nay, we ſhewed you that bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not ſo much as the light of the underſtanding, much leſſe the life of it; as our Saviour Chriſt ſayes, <hi>if the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is the darkneſſe,</hi> Matth. 6. 23. that is, a man may have that light, and yet be in darkneſſe, and therefore much more in deadneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhewed you that approving of God and his<note place="margin">2</note> wayes is not the quickening of the underſtanding neither. Saint <hi>Paul ſhewes that a man may approve the beſt things and yet be dead,</hi> Rom. 2. 18. The Devill approved admirably of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I know thee who thou art, even the holy one of God,</hi> Mark. 1. 24. ſuppoſe thou proveſt and alloweſt of all goodneſſe; O ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Happy is the man that condemneth not himſelfe in that which he alloweth,</hi> Rom. 14. 22. ſo may I ſay, thou mayeſt allow of ſtrictneſſe, and of all the ſtricteſt orders of God, and yet have a <hi>dead</hi> minde, and condemne thy ſelfe. I but, I am not ſtrict though.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhewed you that thinking of God and of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly<note place="margin">3</note> things; this is not the life of the minde neither; a man may thinke of them all now and then, and yet be <hi>dead</hi> to them all notwithſtanding; nay, this may increaſe thy condemnation; therefore when a ſinner ſins, it may be he thinkes of Gods word at ſome time, Gods word forbids this, and yet he does it, though this increaſes his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhewed you that ſtudying of God, and of<note place="margin">4</note> faith, and all the Doctrine of life; this is not the life of the minde neither; and this is that which deceives indeed; when a mans ſtudying is practicall; this is an argument of life; <hi>the heart of the righteous ſtudieth to anſwer,</hi> Prov. 15. 28. Schollers becauſe their minds are not of the world, may be all the day long, but from morning till night, their mindes
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42059:166"/>
are about God, and all Divinity. And they think it may be they are heavenly minded; alas, no, their mindes may be as <hi>dead</hi> towards God for all this, as the worldlings, that is muſing on his pelfe as long a time.</p>
               <p>Then I came to ſhew you affirmatively what the life of the minde is; the life of the minde is, when it is ſtirred up towards God and all his gracious wayes; as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes; <hi>I will ſtirre up your pure mindes,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 1. that is, I would quicken up your mindes; when the minde is ſtirring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, it was ſtirring towards other things before, but now it is ſtirring towards heaven, towards repentance and amendment of life, and Chriſt, and how to pleaſe God and the like, now it is quickened up towards him. I ſhewed you there be ſix ſtirring acts of the minde.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, the applying of the minde; when the minde<note place="margin">1.</note> does not onely know a thing, but it applyes it to ones ſelfe; this is a ſtirring Act of the minde; looke where the minde of man is alive, if it be alive towards the world; if it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know any way unto profit, or preferment, or the having of what it likes, preſently it will apply it; ſo when a man is alive towards God, now his minde hath a applying diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, looke what he knowes about God, he applyes it to himſelfe, for his owne edification, inſtruction, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, direction and guide; as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſayes; <hi>ſo this it is, heare it and know it for thy good,</hi> Job. 5. 27. that is, doe not onely know it, but be quickened up to apply it to thy ſelfe; hath thy minde an applying diſpoſition, doeſt thou apply the word of God to thy ſelfe to make it thine owne. Thou knoweſt what God is, I but haſt thou a diſpoſition in thy minde, to apply him to thy ſelfe? this is a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minde, a man will not let his knowledge lye ſwimming in his minde, but he turnes it upon himſelfe, and makes it his owne.</p>
               <p>2. The meditating of the mind; the minding of the minde<note place="margin">2</note>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:42059:166"/>
a naturall man may thinke of God and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements as ye heard. I but doeſt thou minde them? if thou doeſt minde them from day to day, now thy minde is quickened indeed; carnall men think it may be of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, alas, that is nothing but <hi>frigus &amp; ſocordia</hi> as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſpeakes, I ſayes as Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> but they minde earthly things; looke what a man is alive unto, his minde runnes on that, whether it be God or the creature; if thy minde be quickened up towards God, then thy minde runnes on him from day to day; how thou mayeſt approve thy ſelfe unto him, how thou mayeſt pertake of his favour, how thou mayeſt eſchew the temptations of Satan, how thou mayeſt follow after Chriſt, be ſenſible of thy ſinnes be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards holy duties, does thy minde runne on ſuch things? this is it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The conſidering of the minde; when the<note place="margin">3.</note> minde lookes curſorily on things, what's this but the lookes and remiſſeneſſe of the minde, now when the minde comes to conſider ſeriouſly of them, now it quickens up it ſelfe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes; <hi>Know and conſider that God he is God,</hi> Deut. 4. 39. that is, doe not onely know, that's but a <hi>dead</hi> thing, but ſtirre up thy ſelfe and conſider wiſhly of it; hath the Lord turned about thy minde that now thou haſt begun to have a conſidering frame in thy minde, to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy wayes; to weigh the Sermons that thou heareſt, as it is ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe pondered Chriſts words in her heart; now thou conſidereſt how to pray, how to come to Gods ordinances, how to carry thy ſelfe in thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; now thou doeſt not goe haire-brainely on his before, but thou takeſt things into conſideration.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the remembring of the minde, when the mind<note place="margin">4.</note> knowes how to doe well, but the man does it not, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets himſelfe every day, what's this but the deadneſſe of the minde; if the minde be alive to a thing, it will be ſure
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42059:167"/>
to remember it ſelfe of that. <hi>Can a maid forget her Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? but my people have forgotten me,</hi> Jer. 2. 32. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are dead-hearted towards me; can a man forget to put on his clothes in the Morning? Can the worlding forget to plough his fields in time; to reape his Corne, when it's ripe; to milk his kine at night; nay, certainely hee'le be ſure to remember ſuch things, why? his minde is alive to them; if he ſhould chance to forget himſelfe for a fit, by and by he remembers himſelfe, ſo if the minde be alive towards God, it hath a remembring diſpoſition towards him. O ſayes <hi>David, I will not forget thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly the inventing and deviſing, and plotting and<note place="margin">5</note> ploding, and contriving of the minde; if the minde be alive towards God, theſe Acts goe towards God too, as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>A liberall man will be deviſing liberall things,</hi> Iſa. 32. 8. Let a man be of weake parts, that's all one, yet when it is alive to the world, it's a ſtrange thing to ſee how witty ſome are for the world to gather pelfe, they have great reaches in theſe things; ſo when a man is alive toward God, though he be of weak parts, yet how witty he will be for good things; what pretty deviſes to do good, to underſtand evill, to ſhunne offences, to balke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſinne; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I caught you with guile,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 16. whence comes the blockiſhneſſe of our mindes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the beſt things, but meerly of deadneſſe, if our minds were more alive, they would help us to preach, help us to pray, help us with matters for edifying, diſcourſe, they would help us from a 1000 ſnares, they would be the more active, they would ſooner ſmell a luſt, ſpy Satan, obſerve the dealings of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The judgement of the mind; when the minds luſt dictate is for God; when a man is judicious, this is it that leads men a days, their judgements not all their knowledge
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42059:167"/>
nay, learning; you ſhall have many a learned man will uſe to play the foole, and does every day very fooliſhly, becauſe his Judgement is fooliſh; the reaſon is a mannever takes any courſe, nor ſpeakes any word, nor thinkes any thought, but firſt his judgement tels him, it is beſt to doe ſo at that time; never does the drunkard turne in at the Ale-houſe, but his judgement ſayes to his will, chooſe to turne in; you will ſay, it may be he knowes he ought not to do ſo, I but it is not mens knowledge that leads men, but mens judgements; when mens judgement ſayes, this is not for me, this is moſt pleaſant, this is moſt profitable, this is moſt honourable, this is moſt delightfull; now when the judgement of the minde is in ſome meaſure ſet towards God, now the minde is quickened; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I eſteeme all thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 128. that is, by the mercy of God, I have good judgement, be the way what it will be, though never ſo pleaſing to the fleſh, ſtill my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſayes chooſe Gods way, that's ever more beſt.</p>
               <p>Thus farre we proceeded the laſt day namely to learne or ſee what is the quickening of the minde; that ye may know whether our underſtanding be <hi>dead</hi> or alive; now what remaines but this that we all labour for ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; many of us underſtand much, ſo much that if it were quickened up to us, it would doe us a world of good; if we did uſe to apply it and make it our owne, if we would give our mindes to it, if we would ponder it and ſeriouſly weigh it, and remember it for our uſe in all our wayes, if we had a deviſing minde for good a minde plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for heaven, and continuing how we may beſt glorifie God, and ſecure our owne ſoules. A judicious minde, a practicall minde. This is a good underſtanding indeed; as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>a good underſtanding have they that doe thereafter,</hi> Pſal. 111. 10. when what we underſtand does
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42059:168"/>
not lye <hi>dead</hi> in our heads, but our mindes are quickened up to it, this is a good underſtanding my brethren, this underſtanding is not to be had in Books, God onely can help us with it, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>O Lord give me underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and I ſhall live,</hi> Pſal. 119. 144 you will ſay what need he keep ſuch a ſtirre for underſtanding? had not he the Law before his eyes? could not he read there, and get underſtanding: O but it will be all <hi>dead,</hi> Lord unleſſe thou give me underſtanding from above, if thou wilt give me underſtanding, then I ſhall live.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the heart, to ſearch what the life of the heart is, every Act of the heart, is not an argument of life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there be outſide Acts of the heart; people thinke<note place="margin">1.</note> if they doe not diſſemble before men; then they are no Hypocrites. O they are hearty they ſay; as there is an outſide of the outward man, ſo there is an outſide of the heart. Thou mayeſt be hearty in ſome ſort in good duties, and yet be ſtarke <hi>dead;</hi> namely if it be onely the outſide of thy heart; <hi>my Sonne keepe my ſaying in the midſt of thy heart,</hi> Prov. 4. 21. not in the outſide of thy heart, no, no. I would have the inſide of thy heart too; a man that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to the world, the world hath not onely the heart, but the very inſide of the heart, the word is deep in the heart; ſo if thou beeſt alive towards God, God is in the deep of thy heart, the word is deepe in thy heart, nor like the ſalt water in the Sea onely, on the Top. Ye know what became of the Seed, <hi>that wanted depth of the earth,</hi> Matth. 13. 5. ſo it is with the heart, when the word does not get into the depth of it, it never quickens in it. The heart may be ſo farre towards goodneſſe, as to bring a man to good duties a dayes, it may bring one to Sermon or to Prayer, to others of the Ordinances of God, and other good courſes, but what's all this, as long as it is <hi>dead;</hi> the

life lies in the bottome of the heart, look what the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the heart ſtands unto, that's a man alive unto, then thou art alive towards God, when the bottom of thy heart is unto him; when thou laboureſt to obey him from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of thy heart, when thou calleſt upon him from the bottome of thy heart, like Sugar at the bottome of the Cup, ſtirre up the bottome, the beſt is at bottome, ſo thou muſt ſtirre up the bottome of thy heart, <hi>the heart is a deep thing,</hi> Pſal. 64. 6. though religion be on the top, yet if the world be in the deepe, thy heart is <hi>dead</hi> towards God; as it is with a puddle, it may be cleare at the top, faire water at the top, but there's nothing but mudde at the bottome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there be flitting Acts of the heart, be they<note place="margin">2</note> never ſo deep in the heart, yet if they doe not ſtay there, the heart is <hi>dead</hi> ſtill. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes of his Father; <hi>he ſaid unto me, let thy heart retaine my words, keep my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and live,</hi> Prov. 4. 4. though the word does ſtirre neere ſo much for the preſent, this is not life, except thou retaine it, and hold it faſt, a man may have many flaſhes of life in him, but as long as the heart does not keep them, it remaines <hi>dead, they that ſeeke the Lord, the heart ſhall live,</hi> Pſal. 22. 26. that is, when it is not a flaſh, but it is an Act that abides by a man, the heart is ſtedfaſtly ſet towards God, now his heart lives; now when people are moved onely by fits, they are humbled by fits, and ſtartled by fits, their righteouſneſſe is like a morning dew, ye know there the dew is every morning, but all the day it is gone, may be when morning comes, there it is againe, but all the day it is gone. It is true there may be horrible offs and ons in the Children of God, to the confounding of their faces before God. But I doe not ſpeake to diſcourage them. But let us take heed we may have admirable flaſhes of life, fits of humblings, fits of enlargements, fits
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42059:169"/>
of ſelfe-denyall, ſits of great eagerneſſe after God, the heart may be towards God for a ſit, a falſe heart; as the Land of Iſrael; their heart was firmely towards him for a ſit, they remembred that God was their rock and that the high God was their redeemer, <hi>but their heart was not right with him, they were not ſtedfaſt in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78. 37. mark. it was but a fit; like <hi>Eſays</hi> crying for a fit. This is a poore argument of life then; no, no; the flitting acts of the heart, may be no acts of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there be wouldings and wiſhings in the heart;<note place="margin">3.</note> and theſe cozen the world more then any other; theſe they thinke verily are effects of true life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe theſe are not in the outſide of the heart,<note place="margin">1.</note> but lye, or at leaſt ſeeme to lye very deepe in the heart; it is very certaine, that many naturall men would give the whole world if they had it, as they doe verily conceive, that they had true grace, that they were Saints, that they could leave their ſinnes, that they were in a childe of Gods caſe, they deeply wiſh it, it is a profound <hi>would</hi> in their hearts; and therefore now when they ſee ſuch yearnings in their hearts, they doe verily apprehend, this is life cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. Hence it is that they will ſay they would from the bottome of their hearts ſerve God, they have nere a luſt but they would full faine have God deliver them from that; indeed they confeſſe in their conſciences, if they might have a 1000 worlds, they cannot give it over, I but they would faine they could, and thus they deceive themſelves; becauſe this act ſeemes to be from the depth of their heart; this fancy you may ſee to be in mens hearts out of <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 6. 7. where ye ſee, though they could not finde in their hearts to walke humbly before God, to live juſtly and righteouſly, yet they would give thouſands they could. O ſay they what would not we give for the ſin of our ſoules? no queſtion but they thought they were alive, but God told them they were not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:42059:169"/>Secondly, another reaſon why they thinke this is a token of life is, becauſe this is no flitting act neither; But they have theſe wouldings every day; nay, you can never come to them, but ſtill they have theſe, they would doe well; nay, they would doe as well as the beſt; thus they hope they have a fountaine of living water in them that ſpringeth up daily; thus it was with them in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>they ſeeke me daily ſayes God,</hi> Iſa. 58. 2. they thought it was their every dayes work to ſerve God, and where they did faile, they thought they could ſay, they would doe better, they ſought the Lord daily.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they finde that this is attributed to the<note place="margin">3</note> Saints; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>ye cannot doe the things that ye would,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. nay, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, ſpeakes it of himſelfe, <hi>the good that I would doe, that doe I not, and the evill which I would not doe, that doe I,</hi> Rom. 7. 19. So that thus they argue now, when they finde this ſame woulding in their hearts, and cannot doe as they would, O ſay they, I may ſay with the Apoſtle, the good which I would doe that doe I not; I cannot doe as I would. Thus they hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke their owne ſoules. It is very true theſe be the Saints groanes, and a part of their ſighing towards God, that they cannot doe as they would, this makes them a burthen to themſelves; and ſo againe when they finde themſelves diſturbed and limited and ſtraightened by their fleſh, this is a comfort to their ſoules, and an argument of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe unto them, that they can unfeignedly ſay, they would doe better; they doe pleaſe him in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure through his grace, and they would pleaſe him better; they doe ſome good by his heavenly ſpirit, and they would doe more; they doe reſiſt every ſinne, and they would reſiſt it more. This is very true. But yet how many a thouſands lul themſelves aſleep in ſecurity, by the fancy of this thing. The heart may put forth daily wouldings, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42059:170"/>
be as <hi>dead</hi> as a carcaſſe to all the workes of grace; as our Saviour Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate, for many ſhall ſeeke to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13. 24. q. d. O ſtirre up your ſelves, quicken up your hearts, doe not onely ſeek to enter in; many ſeeke to enter in, O they would enter in, and they would feigne enter in, alas, alas, they are <hi>dead,</hi> they cannot therefore quicken up your hearts, and doe ye more then ſo; I acknowledge that woulding is an argument of life in the heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when a man does beleeve God in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,<note place="margin">1.</note> and then would beleeve more, does oppoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowne ſinne, and would oppoſe it more; does follow all manner of goodneſſe, and would follow it more, when a mans would is above the ſimple will, as when a man will reach as high as he can, and then ſtreins himſelf to reach higher, he takes all the Stooles and Ladders that he can, and ſtands on tip-toes and would reach higher; this is an act of the will with ſome life; and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>when he ſays that Chriſtians would more then they do,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. in the verſe going before, he tels them they muſt walke in the ſpirit though. q. d. if ye ſhould ſay, ye walke in the ſpirit and doe not, ye deceive your own ſelves; ſo that the woulding it ſelfe, is not a living act.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a woulding is an act of a living heart, when<note place="margin">2</note> it is a laborous woulding; ſo that there is another thing in the will, that is the living act and not woulding; namely, when the heart labours, and therefore the woulding is not it; I labour ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>yea, I laboured more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. marke though he ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place that he would; the good which I would doe; yet that was not all, that had been a <hi>dead</hi> act, if that had been all; therefore he laboured together with it. Well then; let us come to ſhew you, what the life of the will is. In a word, the life of the heart is, when the heart will doe a
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42059:170"/>
thing, it may be it is hindred a thouſand times, but in ſome meaſure it will do it, coſt it never ſo much, though fleſh and bloud, and world, and devill, and all be againſt it, yet it will doe it; now the heart is alive it will beleeve, it will repent, it will ſtrive againſt ſinne, it will ſet God before its eyes, it will love him above all, feare him above all, regard him above all. I ſay though it meet with never ſo many hindrances without and within, pull-backes, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, yet it will doe it, now it's alive; <hi>when the ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is willing,</hi> Matth. 26. 41. as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>To will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me,</hi> Rom. 7. 18. when a man can ſay it from the bottome of his heart, that a will is preſent with him. I will be ruled by God, I will deny my ſelfe; though the fleſh be never ſo violent, and it may be many times, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beares downe all before it, yet there is a will preſent, that will ſtand it out, and that can never be borne downe, the act may be borne downe, now affections may be borne downe. I but this ſtill is preſent, I will be for God, he is my beſt, his will is my rule, his Law is my line, and I will be at his diſpoſe; when it is thus in generall, through all the wayes of God, this is a living heart; when to will is preſent with it, as the author to the Hebrewes ſayes, <hi>his will was to live honeſtly,</hi> Heb. 13. 18. As ſoone as ever the prodigall Sonne was come to this paſſe, that he could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly ſpeake, <hi>I will ariſe, I will goe to my Father,</hi> Luk. 15. 18. you ſee his father preſently ſayes he was alive; this my Sonne was <hi>dead,</hi> but he is alive againe; you will ſay, what if one had bound him hand and foot? that is all one; he will goe, he will wraſtle, he will bite the cord a ſunder, if he cannot doe that, O how he will cry out. O how they binde me here. I will ariſe; he will ſtrive, he will not be quiet, he muſt goe, and he will goe; his will is abſolutely to goe, ſtopt or not ſtopt, his will is ſimply to goe, if he can but get away, and leave an arme behinde,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42059:171"/>
nay, a foot behinde, nay both; he will crawle, but he will to his Father; ſo when a man will leave his ſinfull courſes, and he will have God for his God, he will have Chriſt, and there he will hang; come death, come feares, come temptations, there he will hang. This is that which God accepts, when the hearts will is to God, <hi>if there be firſt a willing minde it is accepted,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>Now that this is the life of the heart I prove it thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe this is the prefecteſt operation of the heart,<note place="margin">1</note> when it abſolutely willeth a thing. There be many ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the heart, but none of them is perfect but this as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to his Sonne; <hi>my Sonne know thou the God of thy Father; and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minde,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. q. d. this is a perfect heart; when thy will is to ſerve him; how ever things goe, thou wilt ſerve him; then thy heart is abſolutely ſet towards God, this is the whole heart; <hi>I eryed with my whole heart, heare me O Lord, I will keepe thy Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 119. 145. what's all the deadneſſe of men, but becauſe either they have no heart to Gods wayes or but halfe hearts, as it is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> their heart is divided, and God hath but a peece; but when a man hath an abſolute will hereunto, now he is alive, now his heart is perfect towards the Lord his God; as it is in ſinne, when a man does nos onely goe on in ſinne, but he will doe it, his will is abſolute that way, this man hath a perfect heart towards Satan, ſo it is here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe this is the might and ſtrength of the<note place="margin">2</note> heart; while a mans heart puts forth inferior acts towards God, he is <hi>dead</hi> to every good word and work. If he have any heart at all, it is but ſo ſo, as God ſaid of <hi>Iudah, how weake is they heart?</hi> Ezek. 16. 30. ſuch a man the devill can eaſily take him off at any time for a need; ſuch a one can never ſtand it out to the end. But he is off and on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the might of his heart is not towards God; now
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42059:171"/>
when the will is abſolutely towards God, this man muſt needs be alive; for the might of his heart is towards God; as the Lord himſelfe ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might,</hi> Deut. 6. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe this makes every thing poſſible; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">3</note> a man cannot beleeve, he cannot reſiſt his owne fleſh, he cannot overcome the world, he cannot live godly in all his wayes, he cannot forgoe his beloved luſts. But now when the heart comes once to be willing towards God, now every thing is poſſible. I may ſay of him, as Chriſt ſaith of faith. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that beleeves,</hi> Mark. 9. 23. ſo all things are poſſible to him that willeth; as we uſe to ſay, there is nothing hard to a willing minde. And therefore godly men in Chriſt Jeſus the Apoſtle cals them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. 2 Tim. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe this takes in the manner of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">4</note> too. as well as the matter; it is more a thouſand times, then the bare doing of them; a <hi>dead</hi> heart will ſerve to doe them. Put when the heart is made willing, this is more then the bare naked deed; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about Almes, ye have begun not onely to doe, but alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to be willing a yeare agoe,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 10. as he ſayes of his preaching; <hi>if I doe it willingly I have a reward; but if againſt my will, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 17. that is q. d. I may preach indeed, I may have ſo much heart to it, as to doe the deed alas that is nothing; becauſe if I doe it willingly this is it; this is it brethren, this is the right manner too.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this is an argument that the heart hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">5.</note> principle; what is the life of the heart but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of acting? looke where the heart is alive, there it workes from within; there needs no compulſion to a covetous heart, to have regard of his profit; no; he regards it moſt willingly; he hath an inward principle to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42059:172"/>
regard it; and therefore he is alive to it; now when the heart puts forth its will towards God, now it hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of agency; it needs no conſtraint, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes to Miniſters; <hi>feed the flock of God, not by conſtraint but willingly,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2. that is, doe it very lively; doe it with an inward principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not becauſe ye ſee others feed, not becauſe ye ſee the diſgrace, what will people thinke, if I ſhould not preach conſtantly; not becauſe ye dare not doe otherwiſe, conſcience will flye in your face; alas, ye may doe it, that's with a <hi>dead</hi> heart. But doe it willingly; where note this is the hearts life, this is an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the heart; now the heart will doe it, though no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe doe it, though he be hated for his labour, though he have no thanke for his paines among men. Thus ye ſee this is the life of the heart.</p>
               <p>Now for your better underſtanding, we will open this more particularly this willingneſſe of the heart you ſee in the life of the heart, and it containeth ſeven things. Firſt, the inclinations of the heart. Secondly, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart. Thirdly, the Elections of the heart. Fourthly, the averſations of the heart. Fifthly, the appropiating of the heart. Sixthly, the ſavourings of the heart. Seventhly, the carings of the heart. Beloved, theſe are the living acts of the heart, if theſe be converted to God in you, now your hearts are alive towards him. Theſe make up the whole willingneſſe of the heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the inclinations of the heart; it may doe a<note place="margin">1.</note> thouſand thouſand good things; with a <hi>dead</hi> heart. But marke if your hearts be inclined towards God; then ye ſerve God with a live heart, if the Lord hath inclined your heart to him; <hi>I have inclined my heart to performe thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes alwayes, even to the end</hi> Pſal. 119. 112. Hath God made you doe thus, hath he inclined your heart to his name? once ye were without heart, but now he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42059:172"/>
your heart to doe good, now ye finde ſweet incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to every good duty, ye doe not goe to them as a Beare to the Stake, but now ye have an inward diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, he hath given you a feeling of your ſinnes and your wants, and that caryes you to Prayer; a feeling of your Ignorance, and forget fulneſſe; and that carries you to Sermons, that ye may learne more of God, that ye may ſee more into your owne unworthyneſſe, that ye may be ſtirred up in all his wayes; ye doe not onely ſhunn your owne iniquities, in ſome meaſure, but your heart is inclined unto it, inclined to thinke of God, inclined to holy talke, inclined towards them that are Godly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ye had no diſpoſition to the works of God, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but now the Lord hath not onely put you upon them, but inclined your heart towards them; ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ele inward impreſſions, that bowes you; others may be have good talke, but you feele an unfeigned deſire to be ediſied, and that bowes you unto it. Others may be doe good things, but the Lord hath bent your heart to them; when you went to good duties heretofore, ye went againſt the hare, as a Stone does upwards; but now in ſome meaſure, the Lord hath put in a new nature, and ye feele an internall mover. This is life now.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the intentions of the heart; we have a ſaying<note place="margin">2</note> in Divinity <hi>voluntas ſua natura vult finem;</hi> the heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wils the end; now if God were our end, if communion with him, and ſanctifying of God in our hearts and lives, were our end, our heart could not be <hi>dead</hi> towards his wayes, nay, we ſhould be very eager after them all; all our deadneſſe comes from this, that God is onely a matter by the by, with us: But if he were our end, then we would be mainely for him, and how to approve our ſelves to him. Would we talke as we doe, if edification were our end? would we keep ſuch company as we doe, if mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42059:173"/>
helpe towards eternall life were our end? Looke what the heart does intend from day to day, the heart is very earneſt after it; therefore thoſe that intend to riſe if they can in the world, they are very earneſt in the purſuit after the ſame, flatter fawne, pleaſe, humor, they will doe any thing to the attaining of it; if it be to rid a 100 miles, it's nothing with them; if it coſt them never ſo much, O how greedy are they! if a man intend to gather an eſtate if he can, or to live in pleaſure if he can, all the world are eager in their intentions; the heart runnes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally on after it's ends. Now when the heart is alive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, theſe intentions are towards him, now the heart ſtandeth thus, ſo I may obey God, ſo I may take heed of diſhonouring God, ſo I may keep my heart cloſe to him, this is that I doe deſire; now I goe to worke, ſo I may keep the world from carying away my heart, I ſhall be glad; now I am going to Prayer, ſo I may draw down a bleſſing, and get ſome farther help to walke before God, this is the thing I ayme at; now I goe to be in ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſo I may diſcharge a good conſcience, carry my ſelfe well, and not bring diſhonour to God, and the like; you may ſee this in <hi>Paul,</hi> what was the matter, he was ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to deny himſelfe, I count all droſſe and dung? the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of his heart, were after Chriſt; O ſayes he, <hi>that I might know him,</hi> Phil. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the elections and chooſings of the heart; this<note place="margin">3.</note> is another part of the hearts life; no man is <hi>dead</hi> to that which he chooſes rather then any thing elſe; now if we did ſtill chooſe the wayes of God, we could not be <hi>dead</hi> to them; when we are <hi>dead</hi> to them at any time, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we could even finde in our heart, to make another choyce; and therefore if we would know whether our heart is alive unto goodneſſe, whether doe we chooſe the way of goodneſſe every day before any other way? as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:42059:173"/>
ſayes, <hi>I have choſen the way of truth,</hi> Pſal. 119. 30. as the Lord ſayes of the good eunuches; <hi>they chooſe the things that pleaſe me,</hi> Iſa. 56. 4. Beloved what ever we doe or thinke, or ſpeake, ſtill there be two wayes propounded to us one that is Gods way, another that is our owne way, now which doe we chooſe every day; what thoughts doe we chooſe rather of the two to thinke, what words doe we chooſe, what actions, what courſes, when we are together, what conference doe we chooſe, when alone, what doe we chooſe, there be two kinds of eating, and drinking; which chooſe we? when we are provoked, there be two wayes to take, either to be impatient, and ſuffer our paſſions to ariſe, or to quell them, and beat them down, which doe we chooſe; doe we ſay as that good man ſaid; <hi>Lord let thy han help me, for I have chooſen thy precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119. 173.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the averſions of the heart, ye know the<note place="margin">4</note> heart it chooſes what it likes, ſo there is ſome thing that it ſhuns; now if thou wouldſt know whether thy heart be alive towards God, doe but thinke with thy ſelfe, what it uſes to ſhun when thou art angry, is it diſgrace or ſinne; it ever ſhuns ſome thing or other; either what God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, or what thou, every day and houre, ſomething it puts off; does it put off things that are offenſive to thy fleſh, or things that are offenſive to God; Here lies thy hearts life; if thy heart be alive towards God, it is of this temper, to put off thoſe things that are diſpleaſing to God; <hi>I hate vaine thoughts ſayes</hi> David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 113. marke his heart was of this temper, to put of all thoſe things that were contrary to God; it may be many of thoſe thoughts, his own heart would have rather kept. I but when his heart was alive towards God, he put them off though; <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evill way, that I may keep thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 101. now when good things ſhall be put to a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42059:174"/>
man every day by the word, and by conſcience, and a man hath a refuſing heart to them, this is a <hi>dead</hi> heart; as God put to <hi>Iudah</hi> to returne, <hi>but they refuſed to returne,</hi> Jer. 5. 3. God put ſhame before them for their ſinnes, <hi>but they refuſed to be aſhamed,</hi> Jer. 3. 3. now my brethren, examine your boſonies, how ſtand the refuſals of your hearts, doe you refuſe good or evill every day? if thou canſt refuſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall evill and not ſpirituall, thou haſe a <hi>dead</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the ſavourings of the heart; this is another<note place="margin">5</note> peece of the hearts will; ſomething there is that every heart ſavours moſt, and that it is which it is alive unto: now then if thy heart be alive unto God, it will ſavour the things of God moſt; it will not onely doe good duties but ſavour them too; not onely heare the word of God, but it will have an admirable ſavour with the heart, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes <hi>it will have the ſavour of life unto life,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. as the Church ſayes to Chriſt, becauſe of the ſavour of thy <hi>good oyntments, therefore the Virgins love thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 3. Oh how it will ſavour a reproofe, how it will reliſh; but if holy things have no ſweet ſavour in thy heart; it may be thou canſt not for ſhame of the world not ſeeme to ſtand for them, thy conſcience will not let thee, but thou wilt give them a good word, and ſeeme to approve them, but there's no more ſavour in them, then in the white of an egge, nay, they are irkſome, and untoothſome, they doe not goe merrily down with thee, like ſweet conſerves; aſſure thy ſelfe, thy heart is a <hi>dead</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the cares of the heart, this is another ſhow of<note place="margin">6.</note> the hearts will; what the heart is alive to, it carketh and careth for it, and therefore if thy heart be alive towards God, how carefull will it be that it may not offend him? <hi>yea what care,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11. As the Apoſtle ſayes to <hi>Titus; I will have thee affirme conſtantly, that they which beleeve in</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:42059:174"/>
                  <hi>God, muſt be carefull to maintaine good works,</hi> Tit. 8. 8. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a Miniſter be alive towards God, he will be full of care for his people, how he may pull them from their ſins, how he may draw them to God, how he may moſt doe them good; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of <hi>Timothy; he will naturally care for your Eſtute,</hi> Phil. 2. 20. True, a man hath many things to doe in the world, many cares how to live, how to pay rent at quarter day, what may become of his poore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c. I but if the heart be alive towards God, it will labour to caſt theſe cares upon God; <hi>caſt all your care upon him,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. But for heavenly things, for the having and keeping of a good conſcience, it will be full of cares about theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea it how may get to be more afraid of ſinne, how may I get a weaned heart from the earth? it will be caring how he may be provided for evill times, how he may ſtand in the wofull day.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the appropriating of the heart; the eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">7</note> of the heart; what's the hearts jewell, that's the heart moſt alive to; now thinke, what does thy heart prize moſt of all; if it be alive towards God, he is deareſt to thee; his will dearer then thine, his glory then thy credit, his word then thy life; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I doe not count my life deare, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy,</hi> Act. 20. 24. this was the Jewell of his heart, how he might doe the worke that God ſet him to doe, that he might finiſh his courſe; ſo likewiſe if thy heart be alive, <hi>love will be like a precious oyntment,</hi> Pſal. 133. 2. <hi>heavenly wiſedome more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then Rubies,</hi> Prov. 3. 15. <hi>a promiſe will be precious to the heart,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>So alſo faith will be a precious thing;</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. But above all Chriſt will be precious to the heart, <hi>to you that beleeve he is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7. theſe are heart Jewels; theſe it endeares moſt; it will rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art with any thing then theſe; nay, it will morgage any thing to redeeme theſe againe. Theſe things are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42059:175"/>
eſteemed among men, in their conſciences; indeed they ſay they are better then the whole world, I but their heart does not greatly eſteeme them, nay, it ſlights them and ſeekes them accordingly; this is a <hi>dead</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, thus ye ſee what is the life of the heart; it is the<note place="margin">8.</note> abſolute will of the heart, when the heart is inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, God when it intends God, when it maks choice of his wayes, and puts off whatſoever is contrary to them, when it prizes and endeares every one of them all, when it ſavours them, and is full of care for them. I might adde another, the cleaving of the heart, when the heart cleaves to the Lord, as it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah, that he clave to the Lord,</hi> 2 King. 18. 6. when the heart cloſes in with God, and will not let him goe, no nor let his wayes goe, it ſticks to a Godly courſe, all the world cannot pull him away, not firenor faggot; though it be never ſo much hindred, and interrupted by the fleſh, yet now it hath a ſticking qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I have ſtuck to thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119. 31.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe when the heart is made willing on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion towards God, there is left ſtill an adverſe unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by reaſon of the fleſh; ſo that the heart can never put forth theſe acts, without horrible clogges; therefore now in a live heart towards God, there be other acts, that are not in a heart that is alive to the world. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this. Becauſe when the heart is alive to the world, the hearts of it own nature is willing unto that, and there is no unwillingneſſe mixed together with it; never was it heard, that the heart ſhould be willing, and unwilling to the ſame thing, till ſaving grace came to divide aſunder the will in two; ye know the regenerate are two men apeice, and they have two wills, one towards God, and another towards ſinne and the world; nay, it's the ſame will; that hath both theſe branches in it, and this does
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42059:175"/>
much puzzle the hearts, when they finde ſuch a deale of unwillingneſſe in them towards God.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſay there be other acts of life in the heart towards God, aud they are five.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is the preparing of the heart, whereby the heart prepareth it ſelfe towards God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18. 19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is the Combating of the heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>I beate downe my body,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 27.</p>
               <p>The third, is the endeavouring of the heart, it reaches forth it ſelfe <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. it ſtirres up it ſelfe; it awakens it ſelfe; why art thou ſo ſad, O my ſoule? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the binding of it ſelfe by determinations, and purpoſes; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> bound his owne heart, with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before he came unto <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>Daniel</hi> knowing how unwilling his heart would be to abſtaine from the Kings meat, though by grace he was willing; therefore his heart, bound it ſelfe with a purpoſe; he purpoſed not to defile himſelfe with the Kings meat, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 8. So <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
               <p>The fifth, is the groaning and ſighing of the heart, as<note place="margin">5.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> though he were willing, yet feeling the unwillingnes of the fleſh therewithall fetch a groane; <hi>O that my wayes were ſo direct, that I might keepe thy Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 119. 5. So <hi>Paul</hi> groaned earneſtly to be diſſolved, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. This is the putting of the heart more forward. Theſe I have named you may; name more it may be. But thus if the heart be alive towards God, it will doe: becauſe it feeles a great deale of unwillingneſſe, it gets what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it can of it ſelfe, to make it ſelfe willing; as the Church, ere ever was aware, <hi>my ſoule made me like the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Aminadab.</hi> Cant. 6. 12. it ſets it ſelfe right; as the ſoule when it's <hi>dead,</hi> it neglecteth this act quite and cleane from day to day, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayes of dull <hi>Iſrael, he calls</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:42059:176"/>
                  <hi>them a generation, that ſet not their heart aright,</hi> Pſal. 78. 8.</p>

               <p>WE are come to declare what it is to be a live Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, quickened up towards God, and all his holy wayes, and after ſundry paſſages we came to enquire what is the life of the ſoul; &amp; here I propounded five things. Firſt, what is the life of the minde. Secondly, what is the life of the heart. Thirdly, what is the life of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Fourthly, what is the life of the memory. And Fifthly, what is the life of the affections.</p>
               <p>We have ſpoken of the firſt, what is the life of the mind; ye know by nature, the minde is alive to the things of the world, and <hi>dead</hi> towards God; and therefore we enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what the life of the minde is; it cannot be the bare knowing of things; it may be <hi>dead</hi> to what it knowes; it cannot be the bare thinking of things, nor the bare appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of things, nor the bare ſtudying of things; the minde may performe all theſe acts to a thing that it is <hi>dead</hi> to; no, no; the life of the minde is, Firſt, the applying of the minde. Secondly, the meditating, and minding of the minde. Thirdly, the conſidering and weighing of the mind. Fourthly, the remembring of the minde. Fifthly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing and plotting, and projecting, and contriving of the minde. Sixthly, the Judgement of the minde. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the minde; looke where the minde is alive, there it puts forth theſe diſpoſitions; and therefore when the minde is alive towards God, it lets out theſe towards him.</p>
               <p>Then in the ſecond place, we came to enquire what is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42059:176"/>
the life of the heart; and this we ſpake of the laſt day; we ſhewed you the heart, may be ſomewhat towards a thing and yet be <hi>dead</hi> towards it for all that?</p>
               <p>Firſt, there be ſhallow acts of the heart, the outſide acts<note place="margin">1.</note> of the heart; there may be ſo much heart, as to bring a man to good duties, to conſtant preaching, and hearing, and praying, and the like; and civill carriage, and the like; and yet the heart <hi>dead</hi> to them all. This is not the life of the heart, The life of the heart lies at the bottome of the heart; not in the outſide; no, it lies deep within; as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayes, <hi>my Sonne keepe my ſayings in the midſt of thy heart;</hi> Prov. 4. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there be flitting acts of the heart. Though<note place="margin">2</note> they be never ſo deep in the heart, yet if they be ſuch as doe not ſtay there; the heart is <hi>dead</hi> ſtill; for if it were alive it would keep them. <hi>Let thy heart retaine my words; keepe my Commandements and live;</hi> Prov. 4. 4. Though the word doe ſtirre one never ſo much for the preſent; This is no life except thou retaine it and hold it faſt; a man may have many flaſhes of life in him, but as long as the heart does not keep them it remaines <hi>dead;</hi> when people are moved onely by ſits, humbled by fits, ſtartled by ſits, their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is onely as a morning dew, a man may have ſits of quickening, ſits of awakening, ſits of enlargements, and ſits of humiliation, &amp; remaine in a <hi>dead</hi> ſtate; what a fine fit had Iſrael? they remembred that God was their Rock, and that the holy God was their redeemer; <hi>Yet their heart was not right with him; they were not ſtedfaſt in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78. 37. mark it was but a ſit; like <hi>Eſaus</hi> crying for a fit. Therefore, this is not it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there be wouldings and wiſhings in the heart;<note place="margin">3</note> and theſe cozen the world more then any other; theſe they thinke verily are effects of true life; I told you reaſons why people thinke verily theſe are arguments of life; and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42059:177"/>
then I ſhewed you reaſons, why they are not; and then I ſhewed you the difference betweene the wouldings of a live heart, and the wouldings of a <hi>dead</hi> heart. But I let all theſe paſſe.</p>
               <p>Then I proceeded to ſhew you what the life of the heart is; namely, when it puts forth an abſolute will to a thing; ſo that when the heart puts forth an abſolute will towards God and all his holy wayes, then it is alive towards God, when a man is at this paſſe, that he will beleeve, come what can come of it, he will beleeve, and he will repent and he will hate every ſinne, love God above all, feare God above all, and he will ſet God before his eyes, though it meet with never ſo many hinderances without and within; pul backes, rebellions, yet it will doe it for all them; now it's alive; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>to will is preſent with me,</hi> Rom. 7. 18. when a man can ſay from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his heart, that to will is preſent with him; I will be ruled by God. I will deny my ſelfe, though the fleſh be never ſo violent, and may be many times and often, beares downe all before it, yet he hath a will preſent within that will ſtand it out, and that can never be borne downe, the act may be borne downe, and affections may be borne downe. I but this will is ſtill preſent; I will be for God; he is my chiefe good, his Law is my rule, his will is my will, and I wil be at his diſpoſe; as the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes; ſayes, <hi>His will was to live honeſtly,</hi> Heb. 13. 18. As ſoone as ever the prodigall Son was come to this paſſe, that he could unfeignedly ſpeake it; <hi>I will ariſe, and I will goe to my Father,</hi> Luk. 15. 18. you ſee the next newe; ye heare of him was, he was alive; his Father ſaid he was alive. This my Sonne was <hi>dead,</hi> but now he is a live; you will ſay, what if one had bound him hand and foot, that is all one now, he will goe; he will bite the cord aforeſaid if he can, if one ſhould hold, he'ele wraſtle, he ele bite, he will
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:42059:177"/>
ſcratch, he'le ſpit in his face, if he cannot get looſe, he'le cry out, O how they bind me here; O my father, my father, I wil goe to my Father, he cannot be quiet without his Father, he will goe to his Father; if they ſhould cut off his Legges, he will crawle to his Father; I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the will is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute once towards God, then it is alive towards God.</p>
               <p>I gave you reaſons of this, why this muſt needs be the life of the heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe this is the perfecteſt operation of the heart; when it abſolutely willeth a thing. There be many opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, but none of them is perfect but this; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to his Sonne, <hi>my Sonne, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. q d. this is a perfect heart; when thy will is to ſerve him how ever things goe, thou wilt ſerve him; now thy heart is perfectly ſet towards him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe this is the might and the ſtrength of<note place="margin">2</note> the heart; ye know the heart is a very hard luſty thing, where it is abſolutely ſet; and therefore when a man will goe on in ſinne, what ever come of it, reprove him, threaten ſay what you will, he will ſtill goe on; we ſay he hath a hard heart; nay, the Scripture cals his heart a Rock, or a Stone; I ſay the reſolute will is the ſtrength of the heart; now therefore, when that is towards God, his ſtrength and might is to God; as God ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might,</hi> Deut. 6. 5. a <hi>dead</hi> heart gives onely a few ſick and weake acts towards God; <hi>How weake is thy heart,</hi> Ezek. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. therefore that is not it; an abſolute will that onely is it; for that's the might of the heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe this makes every thing poſſible; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">3</note> a man cannot beleeve he cannot habitually reſiſt his owne fleſh, he cannot overcome the world, he cannot live
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42059:178"/>
godly in all his wayes, but now when the heart comes once to be willing towards God, now every thing is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I may ſay of this as Chriſt ſayes of faith; <hi>all things are poſſible to him that beleeveth,</hi> Mark. 9. 23. So all things are poſſible to him that willeth. And therefore thoſe that are godly in Chriſt Jeſus; <hi>are called</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 2 Tim. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this takes in the manner of good duties too;<note place="margin">4</note> as well as the matter, it's more a thouſand times, then the bare doing of them, a <hi>dead</hi> heart will ſerve for to doe them. But when the heart is made abſolutely willing, this is more then the naked deed; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about Almes, <hi>ye have begun not onely to doe, but alſo</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>to be willing a yeare agoe,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 10. as he ſayes of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>if I did it willingly, I have a reward, but if againſt my will &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 17. q. d. I may preach, I may have ſo much heart, and ſo much will as to preach, alas, that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But if I doe it willingly; that is, if my will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely thereunto, this is it. Brethren: This is the right manner too.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this is an argument that the heart hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">5</note> principle; what's the life of the heart, but an inward principle of acting? looke where the heart is alive, there it workes from within; There needs no compulſion to a covetous heart to have regard of his profit: no; he regards it moſt willingly; he hath an inward principle to regard it; as a Stone hath an inward principle to tend down-wards; &amp; therefore hee's alive to it; now when the heart puts forth its abſolute will towards God, now it hath an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of agility; it needs no complaint, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes to Miniſters, <hi>feed the flock of God not by conſtraint but willingly,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2. that is, doe it very truly, doe it with an inward principle; not becauſe ye ſee others feed, not becauſe ye ſee it's a diſgrace not to feed, or becauſe your conſcience
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42059:178"/>
will not let you doe otherwiſe, alas ye may doe it thus with a <hi>dead</hi> heart; but doe it willingly, doe it out of an inward principle; no obedience is good without it be done with an inward principle; <hi>if ye be willing and obedient,</hi> Iſa. 1. 19. that is, if ye obedient with an inward principle of obedience; I this is it indeed. Thus you ſee an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will is the life of the heart.</p>
               <p>Now leaſt any ſhould be deceived, I ſhewed you what this abſolute will of the heart is.</p>
               <p>I ſhewed you, firſt it is the inclination of the heart; ye<note place="margin">1</note> know the heart that is alive to the world, all its incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are that way, and therefore the will runnes maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out that way; but its averſe from God, backward to all heavenly things; now when the will is abſolutely ſet towards God, God inclines it towards him, and makes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it ſelfe; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes; <hi>I have inclined my heart to performe thy ſtatutes alwayes, even to the end,</hi> Pſal. 119. 112. it may be the world may wonder that any man ſhould be ſo ſtrict as ſome are, to forgo the pleaſures of the fleſh as ſome doe, be ſo preciſe and ſo taken up with God as ſome are; the reaſon is this, their wills are abſolutely ſet that way, the Lord hath inclined them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the intention of the heart; we have a ſaying<note place="margin">2</note> in Divinity <hi>voluntas ut natura vult finem;</hi> the heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wills it own ends; looke what men aime at, looke what they would have, what they beat at, what they drive at, that they will naturally, that they will eagerly; now when the hearts intentions are towards God, then the will is abſolutely towards him. Beloved what is it ye would have, what doe ye drive at a dayes, what is the ſouls ſcop? if that be God, if that be to commune with him, if that be to pleaſe him, doubtleſſe ye are alive towards God; for then the wills are abſolutely to him. This is a rare worke, and therefore true grace of life is a rare thing;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42059:179"/>
for how few doe attaine this? you come to Church, if God were your aime, certainly ye would heare otherwiſe then ye doe many: would ye ſet in your pewes ſo as ye doe, if your aime were to pleaſe God, or that the word ſhould direct you? if this were your aime, ye would heare in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother gats manner; ſo when ye diſcourſe, if your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aime were, O now I will diſcourſe to be ediſied, would ye talke ſo looſely as ye do? nay ye would ſpeake more to the purpoſe a great deale? you may ſee this in <hi>Paul</hi> what made him ſo eager to deny himſelfe? I count all things droſſe and dung ſayes he; O ſayes he, the intention of my heart is to Chriſt; <hi>that I may know him, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 3. 10. But I muſt haſten.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the election of the heart; ye know all our life<note place="margin">3</note> is in <hi>Bivio.</hi> There be two wayes in everything; there be two wayes of thinking; two wayes of ſpeaking; two wayes of doing; the one godly, the other not. There be two wayes in eating and drinking, in ſleeping and waking; in ſtudying, in praying, and in all our cariages, one gracious, and the other not; now which doe your hearts chooſe? if your hearts have ſuch a diſpoſition to chooſe the gracious way, then your wills are ſet abſolutely that way; there ye are alive, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I have choſen the way of truth,</hi> Psal. 119. 30. marke he had this diſpoſition in him to chooſe the true way.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the converſation of the heart; the heart ever<note place="margin">4</note> ſhunnes ſomething, or other; every day and houre, the heart puts off ſomething or other; now what does thy heart ſhun every day? does it ſhun things offenſive to thee or things offenſive to God? if thy will be ſet abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards God, then thy hearts ſhunnings will run there, in things diſpleaſing to him; as the Prophet ſayes; <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evillway, that I may keep thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 101.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:42059:179"/>Fifthly the appreciatings of the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the eſtimations<note place="margin">5.</note> of the heart; what's the hearts Jewell, that the hearts will is abſolutely to; now doe but thinke, what does thy heart prize moſt of all; what's deareſt to thee? O ſayes <hi>Paul, I doe not count my life deare; ſo that I may finiſh my courſe,</hi> Act. 20. 24. this was his hearts Jewell, how he might doe the worke that God ſet him to doe; how he might finiſh his courſe; Gods commandements were deareſt to him, not his owne credit but Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the ſavouring of the heart; this is another<note place="margin">6.</note> piece of the hearts will; ſomething there is that the heart ſavours moſt. Now doth thy heart ſavour the things of God moſt; thou ſavoureſt a buſineſſe, where there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; I but doeſt thou ſavour Gods word moſt, canſt thou finde the beſt reliſh of all in holy duties, canſt thou ſavour life in them; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>there's the ſavour of life in theſe things,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the cares of the heart. This is another ſigne<note place="margin">7</note> of the hearts abſolute will; worldly minded men are full of cares above the things of the world, but art thou full of cares about heaven; does heaven fill thy head full of cares about it, how thou mayſt get it, &amp;c. Thus ye heard what an abſolute will is.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe when the will is made abſolutely to be for God, yet there is an unwillingneſle in the ſame will in regard of the unregenerate part; therefore I ſhewed you there be other acts of life in the heart towards God, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that unwillingneſſe in the fleſh. But I muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity breake off; ſo much for the heart.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be inquired about is the conſcience; what is the life of the conſcience; and here the world is deceived too; for the conſcience may be awakened very much, and yet never quickened indeed. Firſt, à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science awakened, may like all good things. Secondly, a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42059:180"/>
conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may oblige a man to all manner of good things. Thirdly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may be troubled about his ſinnes. Fourthly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may urge one exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to good things. Fifthly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may be very eager in this urging. Sixthly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may prevaile very farre with it's eagerneſſe. Seventhly, a conſcience ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, may make one looke at God, ſo farre as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes; all this may be in conſcience, and yet the conſcience never quickened indeed, ſo that you ſee what need there is to enquire what the life of conſcience is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay the conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may<note place="margin">1.</note> like of God, and all his wayes; it may like of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be they never ſo terrible; as we ſee there in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when God plagued Aegypt; his conſcience liked of Gods dealings he thought in his conſcience the Lord dealt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry righteouſly with him. The Lord is righteous, ſayes he, <hi>and I and my people are wicked,</hi> Exod. 9. 27. So when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was horribly beſet with Enemies, his conſcience juſtified God, O he deales very rightly with me. <hi>The Lord is righteous,</hi> 2 Chron. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 6. ſo <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> when the Lord brought that lamentable judgement on his head, his conſcience lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods doings; as I have done, ſo God hath done to me; ſo againe the conſcience awakened may like of Gods commandements; as <hi>Moſes</hi> tels <hi>Iſrael, that God gave them no other Commandements but ſuch as were right, and wiſe and good in the ſight of the Heathen,</hi> Deut 4. 6, 7, 8. that is, they were ſuch commandements that the Heathens thought in their conſcience were good. Againe the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſomewhat awakened, may like of Gods people that walke according to thoſe Lawes and Commandements; you may ſee this in <hi>Balaane, O that I might dye the death of the righteous!</hi> Numb. 23. 10. his conſcience lik't of their
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42059:180"/>
courſes; ſo <hi>Sauls</hi> conſcience did approve <hi>Davids</hi> courſes. <hi>Thou art more righteous then I,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 17. A conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may like of the beſt preaching; and the ſtricteſt preachers; never man ſpake like this man; O how mightily they lik't him! <hi>Herod</hi> lik't <hi>Iohn</hi> admirably, he was glad for to heare him; profane <hi>Iſrael</hi> did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully like the Sacrament of Gods preſence; when the Arke of God came into the Camp; <hi>they ſhouted with a great ſhout, that the earth rang againe,</hi> 1 Sam. 4. 5. now when a carnall man perceives this work to be in him, he is apt to conceive, this is true grace of life. Beloved, you ſee this is very falſe, Thou mayſt like of Gods dealings with thee, yea, thou mayſt thinke in thy conſcience, he deales very rightly with thee, though it be never ſo bitter, thou mayſt thinke in thy conſcience, his commandements are good, though they be never ſo ſtrict, thy conſcience may like his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and like his precepts, and like his Ordinances, and his Sacraments, and yet be a <hi>dead</hi> conſcience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<note place="margin">2.</note> a man to all manner of good things; it may lay the commandements of God to his charge, conſcience may make him ſay not onely that the commandements are good, but that it is his duty to doe them; we ſee this by experience in many carnall people; tell them of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, what is their anſwer? Oh you ſay well, I confeſſe it is my duty; every drunkard will ſay thus, I it is my duty never to be drunken, the ſwearer will ſay thus, you ſay right, it is very true, I confeſſe I ſhould not take Gods name in vaine; <hi>and therefore they are ſaid to be under the Law,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. that is, they are bound in conſcience to the Law; their conſcience tels them they ought to doe it; their conſcience layes it on them as a bond; as the mad Prophet ſaid; <hi>muſt I not take heed to ſpeake what God bids me ſpeake?</hi> Num. 23. 12. conſcience layed a <hi>muſt</hi> upon
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42059:181"/>
his ſoule. And this is the reaſon, why a naughty heart will put off a commandement of God, if he can, when he ſees it goes againſt his profit, or his eaſe, or his credit, for he knowes if he yeeld it to be a commandement of God, his conſcience will come over him and ſay, why then ye muſt doe it; as we read of the Prieſts and the Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would not yeeld that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme was from heaven; O if we ſhould yeeld that, why then, Chriſt will ſay, <hi>why doe ye not beleeve?</hi> Mat. 21. 25. mark the conſcience comes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a man in all that he knowes God hath commanded, and it layes it to his charge; and you muſt doe this, and you muſt doe that, this is your duty; now when men ſee this, they are apt to conclude that their conſcience is alive; they thinke this is the life of their conſcience to lay Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to their charge. Alas brethren, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be <hi>dead</hi> for all this, you ſee this in people that are <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. <hi>All that the Lord ſpeakes, that muſt I doe,</hi> Num. 23. 26. it was the ſpeech of a very wretch; thou mayſt have this principle in thy conſcience, all that the Lord bids me, that muſt I doe; and yet be a <hi>dead</hi> man. O how does this beguile people: becauſe they feele ſuch a principle in their conſcience a dayes! O thinkes one, all that the Lord bids me, that muſt I doe; when people feele ſuch a principle as this, they thinke they are well; now if they doe offend at any time, they hold it to be but their infirmity; and there's an end. But this is very falſe; the conſcience may have this principle in it and be <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may be<note place="margin">3</note> troubled about his ſinnes; he may be troubled before he commits, he may be very loth to commit them; as we ſee there in <hi>Herod,</hi> when he was betrayed with his raſh Oath. and he was now tempted to behead <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, his conſcience made him very loth to doe it; the Text
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42059:181"/>
ſayes, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> was exceeding ſorrowfull,</hi> Mark. 6. 26. and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhewes it was meerely, becauſe he thought in his conſcience, he ſhould doe very ill to behead ſo good a man, and therefore he was very loth; he was troubled in conſcience about it; ſo was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Darius,</hi> when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had wound him to caſt <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions Denne, he was moved &amp; troubled in conſcience about it, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loth to doe it, he ſought a good while how to put off the temptation by getting away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how to avoyd this great ſinne, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14. ſo was <hi>Pilot</hi> troubled in conſcience about the condemning of Chriſt, he went to it with a heavy heart; and as a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may be troubled before the committing of ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he may be troubled in the committing of it. An example of this we have in <hi>Saul,</hi> when he committed that ſin, in ſacrificing before <hi>Samuel</hi> came, he was troubled in conſcience in the very act. <hi>I forced my ſelfe and offered a burnt offering,</hi> 1 Sam. 13 12. Marke, he did not commit the ſinne hand-ſmooth, as ſome doe, but he felt a reluctancy, againſtit. Againe, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may be troubled exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly after the committing of ſinne; when <hi>Iudas</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed our Saviour, you ſee how his conſcience was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled after he had done. <hi>O ſayes hee, I have ſinned, in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent blood,</hi> Matth. 27. 4. eſpecially at the hearing of a ſearching Sermon, or at a Faſt alſo, then the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if it be onely awakened a little, will be troubled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly for his ſinnes; when <hi>Samuel</hi> kept a Faſt there at <hi>Mizpah,</hi> the Text ſhewes how they were ſmitten in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for their ſinnes, in ſo much that they cryed out in the open congregation, <hi>we have ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 7. 6. and yet many of theſe very men, by and by ſhewed the rottenneſſe of their hearts, ſo that this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gall; when men feele a lothneſſe in them to commit ſinne, trouble of conſcience before, and at, and after, they
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42059:182"/>
thinke this is true grace doubtleſſe; doubtleſſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may urge<note place="margin">4</note> one to good things, and no queſtion but many of you that are yet in your ſinnes have found this to be true, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have your conſciences urged you to give over your ſinnes? to looke after the getting of Chriſt, to lead a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life? how many heaves have your conſciences given at you? to hoyſe you up out of the ſtate ye wallow in, to make you more earneſt for heaven, more ſtrict in your walking, to provide for your latter end, when ye are at Prayer? how often does it urge you to dwell longer at it? As it is ſaid of <hi>Doeg, he was detained before the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 21. 7. he was held there, he would have gone away afore, but he was held, now what ſhould that be but his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? his conſcience urged him to ſtay long; ſo your conſciences urge you to be more attentive in hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more mindfull of preaching, more humble in your mindes, leſſe worldly, more heavenly; you may thinke this is a lively conſcience; no, no; it is not, the truth is, the more your conſciences doe urge you a dayes, the greater is your ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ye yeeld not. But this is ſo farre from life, that it argues you to be the more <hi>dead,</hi> if ye doe not obey; and urging conſcience is a great bleſſing, I, if men have eyes to ſee what the Lord does for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deliver their ſoules from the pit. This is the taking of men by the ſhoulders; now if thou pull away thy ſhoulder. <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and pull'd away their ſhoulder,</hi> Zach. 7. 11. that is, the Lord ſet conſcience upon them, and urged them to obey, as if a man ſhould take another by the ſhoulder, ſo dragge him and hale him, and yet they would not. So when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> he felt an urging in his conſcience, O let me be a Chriſtian, and he confeſt as much two, <hi>Paul,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian; it was almoſt
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42059:182"/>
done; he had a great heave; he was urged. But it would not doe, ſo that this is no argument of life neither.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, conſcience ſomewhat awakened may be very<note place="margin">5</note> eager in urging, it may be very importunate, every day digging in his ſides, every day whiſpering in his boſome; O thinke of God, O conſider thy ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O remember death; conſcience may be earneſt and wonderfull eager with a man, O doe not live as thou doeſt, O be not ſo careleſſe of God; what wilt thou dye and be damned? wilt thou to hell? wilt thou never have done? away with thy ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſes; away with thy dreamings; O be ſtirre thy ſelfe; or thou wilt periſh; ſuch a conſcience had <hi>Pilat</hi> about Chriſt, it was eager with him not to condemne him. This conſcience is an admirable bleſſing; &amp; woe be to thoſe that ſtand out againſt it; it is like <hi>Iacob</hi> with the Angell, <hi>He would not let the Angell goe till he bleſt him,</hi> Gen. 32. 26. like the man that was importunate with his friend, <hi>and knockt, and knockt, and would have no nay,</hi> Luk. 11. 8. I am in bed; never tell me of your being in bed; I pray let me have three loaves; my children are in bed, I pray trouble me not; that is all one, ſtill he knocks, he will have him up; ſo when conſcience is thus awakened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and will not be anſwered &amp;c. many a wretch hath ſuch an impudent conſcience as this. But this is ſo farre from an argument of life; as that it is a ſigne of a greater death.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile<note place="margin">6.</note> very farre by its eagerneſſe, it made the King of <hi>Iury</hi> doe many things; <hi>it made the Heathens doe the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. when the Phariſees came to tempt Chriſt, with the woman taken in adultery, <hi>conſcience made them ceaſe and goe out one by one,</hi> Joh. 8. 9. it made <hi>Paul</hi> live ſo unblameably as he did; <hi>ye know concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteouſneſſe that is in the Law, he was blameleſſe,</hi> Phil. 3. 6. now if ye looke into the 23. of the Acts and the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42059:183"/>
firſt, you ſhall ſee it was his conſcience, that made him doe ſo; men and Brethren, I have lived in all good conſcience before God to this day; as ſince his converſion, his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied conſcience made him live godlily in Chriſt, ſo before his converſion his naturall conſcience holpen by good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made him live unblameably; ſo that, what with one, and with the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could ſay he had lived in a good conſcience to that day; that is either morally good, or ſpiritually good. And therefore it was conſcience, that made him doe all that he did; people thinke, I indeed, if they did good duties for outward by reſpects, then they ſhould thinke they were unſound, but conſcience ſets them a worke, and therefore they gather, they are ſound and alive towards God; no beloved, conſcience may make a carnall man goe againſt all outward by-reſpects, and doe very good dutie; this we ſee in <hi>Balaam,</hi> he went againſt all outward ſelfe reſpects, and followed conſcience; <hi>for a houſe full of Silver and Gold, he would not goe beyond the word of the Lord to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſſe or more,</hi> Num. 22. 18. ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> went againſt his credit, and his profit, and all; ye know, when his conſcience told him the money was unjuſtly taken, he went and threw it downe: ſo did <hi>Michah,</hi> the man was an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Idolater, and had ſtollen 1100 Peeces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from his Maſter, yet when he heard his mother curſe, he reſtored all againe, O thought he, what ſhall I heare my mother curſe, his conſcience roſe up againſt that and made him make reſtitution; why doe carnall men pray in ſecret, no queſtion but it is conſcience that makes them; may be when they are tempted to a ſinne in ſecret, they will not doe it, and it is the conſcience that with holds them; in this ſenſe they doe good duties out of conſcience; now is this Conſcience alive? no, it does not follow, ye ſee this may be in naturall men and women.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may make<note place="margin">7</note>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:42059:183"/>
one looke at God ſo farre as it prevailes; you may ſee this in <hi>Laban.</hi> the man was a wicked man; yet he lookt at God in not hurting of <hi>Jacob;</hi> though it were in the choyſe of his hand, yet he would not hurt <hi>Jacob;</hi> and he lookt at God in the thing. O ſayes his conſcience, <hi>the God of your Father ſpake to me yeſternight,</hi> Gen. 31. 29. he abſtained from hurting of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and he lookt at God in the abſtaining from it. Becauſe God had forbidden him, therefore he will not hurt him; ſo it was with King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he was a naturall man too; yet when he tooke order for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> his conſcience made him look at God in the thing. O ſayes he, <hi>the Lord God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, hath charged me to build him a houſe,</hi> Ezek. 1. 2. ſo when <hi>Jehu</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, and <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, he himſelfe ſayes, how he lookt at God in the thing; come ſee how zealous I am for the Lord of Hoaſts; ſo when the Philiſtines ſent home the Arke of the Lord, they would ſend it home honourably, with a very rich preſent, and the Text ſayes, how they lookt at Gods glory in the thing. O ſay they, <hi>let us give glory to the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> 1 Sam. 6. 5. Thus you ſee how the world are deceived about the life of the conſcience; when people have theſe operations of conſcience within them, they thinke their conſcience is alive and good towards God.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe cannot be the life of conſcience, I prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe all may be in naturall men, as ye have<note place="margin">1</note> heard in <hi>Laban,</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in <hi>Balaam,</hi> in <hi>Micah,</hi> in <hi>Saul,</hi> in <hi>Darius,</hi> in <hi>Iudas,</hi> which were <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſins; what life can be in a <hi>dead</hi> man? it is very true, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is leaſt <hi>dead</hi> of all the powers of the ſoule; the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the will is a pure virgin; that's as falſe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the devill is falſe; if any faculty be a pure virgin it's the conſcience; all the religion that is left in a naturall man, God hath
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42059:184"/>
planted there; <hi>there's the effect of the Law there,</hi> Rom. 2. 15. The whole nature of man is like a Countrey taken by the Enemy, except one little Fort; may be that's batter'd too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is not quite taken; ſo is the conſcience, after the whole man is quite vanquiſh't by ſinne, except onely that and that's batter'd too in a wofull manner. But it is not quite taken, the Lord will ever keepe a part in that, to have the man at controll when he pleaſes, and as farre as he pleaſes. But yet it is ſo farre taken too, that there is no ſpirituall life left at all in it; man is <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, and ſo is the conſcience too.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the conſcience notwithſtanding all theſe may<note place="margin">2</note> be deader then ever it was. I confeſſe theſe are flaſhes of life, that God ſparkles into mens conſciences, but they uſe to goe out againe, and leave the conſcience as <hi>dead,</hi> and deader then ever before they came; we ſee it in <hi>Pharaoh, that hardened his heart worſe afterwards,</hi> Exod. 9. 34. ſo did <hi>Balaam,</hi> though his conſcience were ſo quick for a ſpurt, <hi>yet within a while, he could goe and lay a ſtumbling block before the Children of Iſrael to make them ſinne,</hi> Rev. 2. 14. and we ſee it to this very day, many ſmitten in conſcience for a time, afterwards their ſmitings ceaſe, and they grow more ſtiffe then ever they were; like water that hath beene heated, it freezes afterwards the more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the conſcience notwithſtanding all theſe is ſoon<note place="margin">3.</note> pleaſed; though it ſeeme to be eager, and earneſt, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for God, yet any little thing will content it; if it were alive nothing would content it, but meerely indeed, the favour of God, the Image of God, ſincere conforming to God. But this conſcience is ſoone pleaſed againe; it is but angry a while, if but halfe the Lords due be brought in, this conſcience is ſatisfied. <hi>Like the unjuſt Steward, that ſet downe</hi> 50 <hi>for a</hi> 100 Luk. 16. 6. When the man goes on praying, and doing good duties, may be, the conſcience is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42059:184"/>
whiſt, though it be but a forme; when he hath reformed a little, conſcience thinkes it hath enough; we may ſee this in <hi>Balaam;</hi> when he had found that worke of conſcience, that he could deny <hi>Balac's</hi> houſe full of Silver and Gold, to ſtand for God, preſently he concluded that God was his God; <hi>if</hi> Balac <hi>would give me his houſe full of Silver and Gold, I cannot goe beyond the word of the Lord my God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Num. 22. 18. Like the wretched Jewes, <hi>they brought God the blinde and the lame, and the torne and the ſick, and then they thought much that they ſhould be called deſpiſers of God,</hi> Mal. 1. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Saul</hi> was commanded to deſtroy all the Amalekites, now though he ſpared ſome, his conſcience was content. I have done the will of the Lord ſayes he; ſuch a conſcience as this is ſoone pleaſed, like little Children, it cryes, it takes on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſets up its Pipes, but a little thing ſtills it; may be a Rattle, or an Apple, or a Braſſe Counter; ſo my brethren though a mans conſcience be thus as ye have heard, yet it is a very childe, it will be ſoone ſtilled; let him but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre himſelfe a little towards God, and goe on in a pretty handſome way, this conſcience will quickly ſay it's well.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the conſcience that hath but theſe ſtirrings, is<note place="margin">4</note> ſo farre from being alive, that many times it will be a help unto ones luſts; which if it were a live it could not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But thus it is though, when theſe works are reall, it will ſerve to help a mans luſts; when a mans luſts would faigne have ſome thing or other don, then ſteps in thy conſcience, and will help the lame dogge over the ſtile; as we ſay <hi>Herod</hi> had a luſt to make away <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt. <hi>O but he's a good man ſayes his conſcience, and thou muſt not cut off his head,</hi> Mark. 6. 20. O but he was urged now to doe it, by <hi>Herodius</hi> her daughter; and he had ſworne to grant her hearts requeſt; now ſee how his conſcience helpt him to doe it. Thou haſt ſworne an Oath, and thou muſt make
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42059:185"/>
conſcience of that; therefore cut off his head. So it was with the Iewes, when they have a luſt to crucifie Chriſt, their conſcience found out a trick for it; <hi>we have a Law ſay they, and by our Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhould dye, becauſe he mado himſelf the Sonne of God,</hi> Iohn 19. 7. mark, they made it a matter of conſcience; what they murder Chriſt? they put him to death unjuſtly? no, God forbid; we have a Law, and are bound in conſcience to keepe it; ſo when a man hath a luſt, as to weare long haire; by and by he makes it a matter of conſcience to weare it; forſooth his head will ake; and he is bound in conſcience to have a care of that; ſo if a man have a luſt of covetouſneſſe, and not to give where is need; forſooth his conſcience findes a place in the Apoſtle to help it. He is worſe then an Infidell, that provides not for his owne; and ſo he will make conſcience of that; ſo when a man hath wronged him, he hath a luſt of revenge, anon he findes out a trick, O it may tend to the diſhonour of the Goſpell, if he put it up, the matter is not ſo. But he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to thinke ſo; and he will make conſcience of that; is he revengefull now? no God forbid. It was a diſgrace to religion, and he did it out of conſcience of that. Thus men will have what luſt they pleaſe, they can finde ſome Text or other, which they wreſt to make conſcience of that, O how common is this.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this conſcience is not all, it cals out onely ſome<note place="margin">5</note> particular ſinnes to be violent againſt, and lets alone others may be as bad; like <hi>Ahabs</hi> for the Vineyard; and let his <hi>Baaliſme</hi> alone; or if the conſcience be againſt all manner of ſinnes, it is but in a fume, <hi>cito redibit in gratiam.</hi> they are but like new Wine, in old Bottels; at laſt the Bottels break and the Wine is all ſpilt; ſo all theſe workes in an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience, are onely then while the conſcience cannot ſleep. But when it can fall aſleep againe, then the man can be quiet againe; the conſcience is an old conſcience
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42059:185"/>
and not renewed, and therefore it is not able to hold them; well then ye ſee theſe are not conſciences life.</p>
               <p>What then is the conſciences life? for this ye muſt know. Firſt, the conſcience hath a Teſtimoniall life; a life whereof it lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the ſoul lives; for it is the reflexion of the ſoule, the ſoules privity to it ſelfe, betweene God and it ſelfe. And therefore if the ſoule be alive towards God, then the conſcience is alive too; as the Apoſtle ſayes; <hi>How much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit offered himſelf, without ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to God, purge your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from</hi> dead <hi>workes, is to ſerves the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. marke, when a mans <hi>dead</hi> workes are purged away, the conſcience is alive; when a mans ſelfe is alive, and his workes are alive, the conſcience is alive; as we ſay of the goodneſſe of conſcience, though the conſcience be never ſo good in it ſelfe, yet as long as the man is not good, his conſcience can never be good; conſcience is ſaid to be good, as a Meſſenger is ſaid to be good; namely when he bringeth good tydings; though he be never ſo good a man, yet if he doe not bring good tydings, we ſay he is an ill Meſſenger; <hi>he ſent evill Angels among them,</hi> Pſal. 78. 49. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinkes it may be meant of good Angels; yet ſaid to be ill Angels, becauſe they brought evill Plagues upon <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſo ſtands a good conſcience, that can bring good tydings of a man, that he is a good man; true, a wicked mans conſcience may report well of him, as <hi>Abſolon</hi> did of the people, O your matters are good ſayes he, when they were ſtark naught; ſo thy conſcience may flatter thee, and ſay thy matters are good. But when conſcience can ſay truly, thy matters are good. The conſcience is like a Regiſter or a Bill; now then it is a Bill of good Items, when all thy ſinnes are blotted out; ye know we call it a fowle bill, that hath fowle crimes written in it. Item this man ſtole a horſe. Item he brake into ſuch a mans houſe.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42059:186"/>
Item he murdered ſuch a man; when ſuch a Bill as this comes in at the Aſſizes againſt a poore Priſoner, this is a black Bill; this is a fowle Bill; ſo as long as thy conſcience is a fowle Bill; Item I was born in ſinne; Item I have lived very looſely; Item I have heard ſo many Sermons, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten litte good; Item I was at ſuch a Sacrament and was nere the better, thy conſcience is a fowle Bill, this is a fowle conſcience; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>a defiled conſcience,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. This is a bad conſcience; now when the conſcience is cleane, then it is a good conſcience; ſo I may ſay of a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcience, the conſcience is alive, when the man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live towards God, then it beares witneſſe, but that is not all, the conſcience hath other acts. Secondly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath another life of it's own, namely the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſaid to be quickened up to its duty, when it quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens up the whole man to doe his. As the conſcience of the good people that offer'd to the Tabernacle, was a quick conſcience; their conſcience was quick to doe its duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it quickened them up to doe theirs; <hi>their heart made them willing,</hi> Exod. 35. 29. that is, their conſcience made them willing; though the conſcience be never ſo eager, that is not it; it never does its duty with life, till it make thee doe thy duty with life. The conſcience of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may be is not ſo eager, neither does it keep ſuch a doe, as many a wicked mans conſcience. The eagerer conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is faine to be, it's a ſigne the man is the more <hi>dead;</hi> when a man is alive, the conſcience ſtirres him up with more eaſe; like a man that is willing to pay his debts, the creditor need no more then aske; whereas when the debter is a ſlye fellow, there needs the more Bawling; ſo that if thou would'ſt know whether thy conſcience be quick, the queſtion is not whether it be eager or no; But whether does it quicken thee up to doe thy duty or no.</p>
               <p>This then is the life of conſcience, when it makes a man
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42059:186"/>
doe his duty towards God and man; when it makes a man beleeve with all his heart, when it makes him love God with all his ſoule, and mind, to ſerve him in truth, to doe his holy will, to humble himſelfe ſoundly before God for all his ſinnes, to make his peace with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> daily to pleaſe him, and to walke before him in newneſſe of life. This is a living conſcience, this conſcience hath the grace of life in it, whether it doe it by eagerneſſe or not, that is not it; whether with much a doe, or little, that is all one.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the conſcience does not onely check, but it<note place="margin">1.</note> checkes to ſome purpoſe, <hi>as when</hi> David <hi>had numbred the people, his heart ſmote him,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 10. ſuch checks there may be in a wicked heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a man is made to doe the Lords will for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When it does not onely accuſe for ſinne, ſo a<note place="margin">2</note> naturall conſcience may doe, but it pulls a man downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and cites himſelfe effectually before God. The juſt man firſt accuſeth himſelfe; as the Greek, and the Latin read it <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when it does not onely condemne one for ſinne,<note place="margin">3</note> for ſo the wicked have condemning conſciences; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes, <hi>if our heart condemneth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 20. that is, if we be wicked; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes; <hi>knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted and ſinneth, being condemned ef himſelfe,</hi> Tit. 3. 11. that is, he is a wicked wretch, ſo that a wicked mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may and will, and ſhall condemne himſelfe. But I meane, when the conſcience does not onely condemne one for ſinne; but it tramples upon ones ſelf as a damned wretch in himſelfe; to ſave God a labour; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be Iudged,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 31.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when it does not onely pull a man a dayes;<note place="margin">4</note> ſo it may doe the wicked and the ungodly; they feele many puls every day, and may be their conſcience makes
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42059:187"/>
them leave many particular ſinnes. But when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence puls a man out of every known ſinne, withall the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and loathing; out of unbeleife, out of inpeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and heardneſſe of heart, out of formality and all; this is a lively conſcience; as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayes, <hi>my heart ſhall not reproach me as long as I live,</hi> Job. 27. 6. Theſe are the lively acts of conſcience about ſinne.</p>
               <p>The lively effects whereof are three.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is penitent ſhame that ever he hath done it;<note place="margin">1</note> conſcience makes him flye from it as a horrible ſhame and confuſion of face before God; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>what fruit have ye of thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another is penitent griefe, and compunction<note place="margin">2.</note> of heart; ſo ye may ſee this effect in the new converts. <hi>They were pricked in their hearts,</hi> Act. 2. 37.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another effect is penitentiall feare, whereby<note place="margin">3.</note> he is afraid to ſinne againſt God againe, 2 Cor. 7. 11.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another is humbling deſpaire in himſelfe, that<note place="margin">4</note> he ſees nothing in him, but death and damnation and ſo he lies at Gods Gate, as a man utterly undone in himſelfe; having no hope but onely in Chriſt; for as God dealt with <hi>Paul</hi> in regard of his recovery out of his ſickneſſe, <hi>he brought him to deſpaire of life in himſelfe,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 8. ſo does a lively conſcience in regard of miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, now for the lively acts of conſcience, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<note place="margin">2</note> of good; when the conſcience hath life, it does not onely excuſe in part, for ſo it may doe in a wicked heart, nay a wicked man hath ſuch an excuſing conſcience when he does good for the matter of it; as we read in the Heathens; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. But it does ſweetly excuſe him, and tels him he hath done it unfeignedly in the truth of his heart, that he does beleeve, that he does truly repent, that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42059:187"/>
he does in ſome meaſure, walke in new obedience from day to day; and that he ſtands guiltleſſe before God through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When the conſcience does not urge a man onely to that which is good. <hi>As it urged</hi> Agrippa, <hi>almoſt thou perſwadeſt me &amp;c.</hi> 26. 28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, approbation, when the conſcience either may<note place="margin">3</note> or does pronounce a man to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>The lively effects of theſe acts are 1 <hi>Ioy.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is boldneſſe, &amp; freedome from ſlaviſh feare. <hi>The righteous is bold as a Lyon,</hi> Prov. 28. 1.</p>
               <p>Againe, a lively conſcience is a ſudden conſcience. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a tender conſcience.</p>

               <p>THe point we are in, is, when is the conſcience alive, when is that quickened up in a man ye have heard? Firſt, what is the quickening of the minde? Secondly, what is the quickening of the heart? now I ſay it followes what is the quickening of the conſcience? I ſhewed you how thouſands are deceived here; for the conſcience may be awakened very much, and yet never quickened indeed. Firſt, the conſcience ſomewhat awakened may like of good things. Secondly, the conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may oblige a man to all manner of good things. Thirdly, a conſcience ſomwhat awakened, may be much troubled about ſinnes. Fourthly, a conſcience ſomewhat awakened, may urge one to good things. Fifthly, it may be very eager in this urging. Sixthly, it may prevaile ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre with its eagerneſſe. Seventhly, it may make one
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42059:188"/>
looke at God in ſome ſence, ſo farre as it prevailes. All this may be in conſcience, and yet the conſcience never quickened indeed; and we have ſhewed you all theſe, and cleared them unto you; ſo that you ſee what need there is to enquire what the life of conſcience is.</p>
               <p>After the handling of theſe ſeven particulars; we gave you five reaſons to prove that theſe are not arguments, that the conſcience is truly alive; that the conſcience may doe all this, and yet not have the grace of life in it. Firſt, becauſe all theſe workes of conſcience may be in a naturall man. 2. Becauſe the conſcience notwithſtanding all theſe may be deader then ever it was. Thirdly, becauſe ſuch a conſcience as this may be fooliſh, and childiſh and ſoone pleaſed; if the conſcience were alive indeed, nothing would content it but the favour of God, and the Image of God, and true faith', and true peace, &amp;c. But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be ſoone pleaſed; if it have but any colour of grace and goodnes, that's able to ſtill it &amp; quiet it. Fourthly, becauſe the conſcience though it be thus ſtirring as ye heard, it is ſo far from being alive, that it uſes to be a help &amp; furtherance unto ones luſts. Fifthly, becauſe this conſcience is not univerſall, it culs out onely ſome particular ſinnes to be violent againſt, and lets alone others; it picks out ſome particular duties and good courſes to be very eager for, and is careleſſe of others.</p>
               <p>You will ſay then, what is conſciences life? when is the conſcience ſaid truly to be quickened? For the opening of this, ye muſt know there be two lives of conſcience in a godly man.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a relative life; whereby it's alive, when the man is alive.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a ſimple life. The firſt I ſay, is a relative life, whereby it is ſaid to be alive, when the man whoſe it is, is alive; for conſcience is the reflection of the ſoule, the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42059:188"/>
ſoules privity to it ſelfe, between God and it ſelfe. And therefore if the ſoule be alive towards God, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is alive too; as the Apoſtle ſayes; <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, who through the eternall ſpirit offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead workes to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. Marke when a mans dead workes are purged away, the conſcience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, when a mans ſelfe is alive, and his workes are alive, the conſcience is alive alſo; as we ſay of the goodneſſe of conſcience, ſo it is the life of conſcience; though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be never ſo good in it ſelfe, yet as long as the man is not good, his conſcience can never be good; conſcience is ſaid to be good as a Meſſenger is ſaid to be good; namely, when he bringeth good tidings; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himaaz, he is a good man, and he bringeth good tidings,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 27. Though a Meſſenger be nere ſo good a man, yet if he doe not bring good tideings, we ſay he'es an ill Meſſenger. <hi>He ſent evill Angels among them,</hi> Pſal. 78. 49. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinkes it may be meant of good Angels, yet ſaid to be evill Angels, becauſe they brought evill upon Aegypt; ſo that's a good conſcience that bringeth good tidings to a man; that he does beleeve; that he is in Chriſt, that he is a good man. True, a wicked mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may report well of him, as <hi>Abſolon</hi> did of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, O your matters are good ſayes he, when they were ſtark naught; ſo thy conſcience may flatter thee, and ſay thy matters are good; but when conſcience can ſay truly, thy matters are good. The conſcience is like a Regiſter or a Bill; now when it is a Bill of good Items; when all thy ſinnes are blotted out, and good things are written in; now it's a good conſcience; ye know we call it a fowle Bill, that hath fowle crimes written in it; though the Bill be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo faire written, yet if it have fowle crimes written in it, it's a fowle Bill. Item, this man ſtole a Horſe. Item, he
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42059:189"/>
broke into ſuch a mans houſe. Item he murdered ſuch a man; when ſuch a Bill as this comes in at the Aſſizes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a poore priſoner, this is a black Bill; this is a fowle Bill; ſo as long as thy conſcience is a fowle Bill, Item I was borne in ſinne. Item I have lived very looſely. Item I have heard ſo many Sermons, and yet I have beene nere the better. Item I have beene at ſo many Sacraments, and yet I have gone on in my vile courſes, thy conſcience is a fowle Bill; this is a fowle conſcience; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>a defiled conſcience,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. now when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is cleane, then it's a good conſcience; ſo I may ſay of a lively conſcience; the conſcience is alive, when the man is alive; when his mind is quickened up towards God, &amp; his heart which before was <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, now it's alive towards God; this mans conſcience is alive. The reaſon is becauſe now his conſcience may ſay, I am alive; for conſcience is the reflection of the ſoule on it ſelfe, and therefore if thou beeſt alive thy ſelfe, thy conſcience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live too. This is the firſt life; the relative life of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Now that this is one life of conſcience, is plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if a mans ſelfe be <hi>dead,</hi> conſcience will ſay, I am <hi>dead;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, ſpeaking of himſelfe and the <hi>Epheſians</hi> before their converſion. O ſayes he, <hi>ye were dead in ſinnes,</hi> Eph. 2. 5. looke what a man is, if the conſcience be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, it takes it on it ſelfe, when <hi>David</hi> had ſinned. I have ſinned ſayes his conſcience; ſo let a man be holy the conſcience preſently takes it upon it ſelfe; as we ſee there in <hi>David,</hi> when he was holy; <hi>I am holy ſayes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Lord preſerve my ſoule, for I am holy,</hi> Pſal. 86. 2. So that if thou beeſt <hi>dead,</hi> thy conſcience is <hi>dead;</hi> if thou beeſt alive, thy conſcience is alive. But I let this paſſe.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond life of conſcience, and that is, it's ſimple life, conſcience hath another life of its owne; for
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42059:189"/>
as when the man is alive, the conſcience is alive ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is quickened up to doe its duty, when it quickens up the whole man to doe his, as the conſcience of the good people that offered to the Tabernacle was a quick conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; their conſcience was quick to doe its duty, becauſe it quickened them up to doe theirs; <hi>their heart made them willing,</hi> Exod. 35. 29. that is, their conſcience made them willing. Though the conſcience be never ſo eager, that is not it; it never does its duty with life, till it make thee to doe thy duty with life. The conſcience of the godly may be is not ſo eager, neither does it keep ſuch a doe, as many a wicked mans conſcience. The eager conſcience is feigne to be, it's a ſigne the man is the more <hi>dead,</hi> when the man is alive, his conſcience ſtirres him with more eaſe; like a man that is willing to pay his debts, the creditor need no more then aske; whereas if the debtor be a very ſlye fellow, there needs the more bawling; ſo that if thou wouldeſt know whether thy conſcience be quick, the queſtion is not whether it be eager or no, but whether does it quicken thee up to thy duty or no?</p>
               <p>This then is the life of conſcience, when it makes a man doe his duty ſincerely both towards God and man; when it makes a man beleeve with all his heart, when it makes him love God with all his ſoule; and minde to ſerve him in truth, to doe his holy will, to humble himſelfe ſoundly before God for all his ſinnes, to make his peace with God, daily to pleaſe him and to walke before him in newneſſe of life. This is a living conſcience. This conſcience hath the grace of life in it; whether it doe it by eagerneſſe or not; whether with a horrible ſtirre or a great pudder or no; that is not it if it make a man doe his duty aright, then conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does its duty; this is Conſciences life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the Conſcience does not onely check, but it<note place="margin">1.</note> checks to ſome purpoſe, when it ſmites ſo that all the ſoule
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42059:190"/>
feeles it, and lies downe under it, when the Conſcience does not onely doe duty in this thing, but it makes a man to doe his, it makes him ſmite himſelfe as the Publican did, <hi>he ſmote upon his breaſt,</hi> Luke 18. 13. as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>I ſmote upon my thigh,</hi> Jer. 31. 10. when a man is made to Check himſelfe, <hi>what have I done?</hi> Jer. 8. 6. when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> numbred the people, the Text ſhewes how his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was quick, <hi>his heart ſmote him,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 10. Dull checks there may be in a wicked heart, yea, mighty checks, and mighty ſmitings, yea, greater for quantity then in any Childe of God, but all to little or no purpoſe, <hi>Davids</hi> Conſcience ſmote him to purpoſe you ſee there, it made him doe his duty indeed, it was a Divine Check, it was a Check that put him into a right way againe, ſo except thy Conſcience thus Check thee a dayes, may be thou forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelfe now and then, and then thy Conſcience gives thee a Check, O what a beaſt am I, and ſo ſets thee to rights againe, ſometimes thou art over taken in paſſion, but then comes Conſcience, and tels thee what God ſayes, O why doe I give place to the Devill; and then thy paſſions goe downe againe. This is Gods Bit, that he guides his people by, as the Rider does his beaſt with a Bridle. The wicked are like your ſturdy horſes, that get their Bridle in their Teeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God may pull hard at them, give them fiercer twitches, then he does his owne Children, but they get the Bridle in their Teeth, and ſo they are unrulier: But when it is Gods Bridle to lead a man by, now his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is alive, when it Checks to purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it does not onely accuſe for ſinne, ſo a<note place="margin">2</note> naturall Conſcience may doe, but it puls a man downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and Cites himſelfe effectually before his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall. I make this a different work, for the accuſation of Conſcience differs from its Checking; the Check is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall laſh the Conſcience gives the ſoule, now the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42059:190"/>
gives the reaſon of its laſhing. O thou haſt ſinned againſt God; ye know this is a duty of Conſcience too in regard of ſinne, to accuſe. And then Conſcience is alive, when it does this duty to purpoſe, to make a man to doe his; namely to goe and Confeſſe his ſinne in a penitent manner. True a wicked mans Conſcience does accuſe, but that drives a man from God; as it's ſaid of the Scribes and the Phariſees, <hi>when their Conſciences accuſed them, they went cut,</hi> Joh. 8. 9. But when Conſcience is alive, it accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before God, it Cites a man ſoundly before God; and what a vile wretch am I! it ſo does its duty in accuſing, that it makes a man to doe his; freely to accuſe himſelfe. <hi>The juſt man firſt accuſeth himſelfe,</hi> Prov. 18. 17. So it is in the Greek and the Latin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Haſt thou ſuch a Conſcience as this? this is a lively Conſcience; when thy Conſcience does not onely doe its duty to accuſe thee for every ſinne that thou doſt, but it makes thee to doe thine, freely to accuſe thy ſelfe before God; a wicked Conſcience may accuſe, I but it does not mak the man to do his duty; he does not freely accuſe himſelfe; it is onely forced in him; it is with Coaction and Compulſion. But its free in Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; when <hi>Daniel</hi> went to confeſſe his ſinnes before God, the Text ſays, he ſet himſelf to do it; <hi>I ſet my face unto the Lord God,</hi> Dan. 9. 3. that is, his Conſcience did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe its duty, in this thing, but it made him to doe his.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when it does not onely Condemne one for<note place="margin">3.</note> ſinne; for ſo the wicked have condemning Conſciences, as the Apoſtles ſays; <hi>if our heart condemne us,</hi> 1 John 3 20. that is, if we be wicked; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes; <hi>Knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted and ſinneth being condemned of himſelfe,</hi> Tit. 3. 11. that is, he is a very wicked Creature; ſo that a wicked mans Conſcience does Condemne. But I meane when the Conſcience does not onely condemne one for
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42059:191"/>
ſinne, it does not onely doe its owne duty in this thing, but it makes the man to doe his; it makes him trample upon himſelfe; as a damned wretch in himſelfe, to ſave God a labour, as the Apoſtles ſpeakes; <hi>if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 31. when Conſcience makes a man freely to accept of damnation; <hi>thou ſhalt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thy puniſhment, then I will remember my Covenant,</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 26. 41. 42. when it makes thee lay thy Neck on the block; Lord the worſt place in hell is too good for me. I have often told you a ſtory in the acts and monuments of the Church; when <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, one of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> was a hunting, and one of the ſtanders by had diſpleaſed him, the King rid after him with a drawne ſword for to ſtab him, the man runne away for his life; the King rid over hedge and ditch to overtake him, and when the man ſaw he had no way to eſcape, he fell downe, and held up his throat to the King, if it pleaſe your Majeſty here is my throat. The King melting towards him, ſhewed him mercy. So when Conſcience makes thee ſay Lord here is my throat, here is my ſoule, if it pleaſe thee thou maiſt ſend Satan to take it, and carry it to hell with him. Thou haſt no way to eſcape, therefore offer thy ſelfe unto God; may be thy Conſcience does Condemne thee; alas that is not it, thy Conſcience does not its duty with any life, till it make thee doe thine; doeſt thou freely Condemne thy ſelfe; accept of thy puniſhment, lay thy head on the block, does thy ſoule lye groveling before God? this is a live Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when it does not onely pull a man a dayes<note place="margin">4</note> from ſinne and Iniquity; ſo it may doe with the wicked and the ungodly; they feele many pulles every day, and may be their Conſcience makes them leave many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinnes, though that's very rare as the times now be, but when the Conſcience pulles a man forth of every
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:42059:191"/>
knowne ſinne, when it ſo does its duty in this kinde, that it makes thee to doe thine; when thou pulleſt thy ſelfe withall deteſtation and loathing out of pride, out of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, out of unbelief, out of heardneſſe of heart, out of formality and all; this is a lively Conſcience; as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayes, <hi>my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live,</hi> Job. 27. 6. that is; as my heart does its duty towards me, ſo it ſhall make me doe mine, I will yeeld to mine owne Conſcience in every thing; whatſoever ſinne it tels me off, I will be ſure to ſet my ſelfe againſt it; it ſhall not lie heaving at me, and I never ſtirre; then it would reproach me, but it ſhall never reproach me ſo long as I live. Theſe are the lively acts of Conſcience about ſinne.</p>
               <p>The lively effects whereof are foure.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is a penitent ſhame, that ever a man ſhould ſin<note place="margin">1</note> againſt God; when Conſcience does thus as ye have heard, then it produces this effect, that the man is aſhamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>what fruit have you of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21. people are apt to be aſhamed before men, <hi>Diodorus Cronus,</hi> when <hi>Stilpo</hi> askt him a ridiculous queſtion, and he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him; he was ſo aſhamed, that he fell downe ſtarke <hi>dead;</hi> he thought it was ſuch a diſgrace to be nonpluſt But if Conſcience were alive, and did doe its duty indeed, it would make us aſhamed for our ſinnes before God; <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was aſhamed before God for the ſinnes of the people, I bluſh ſayes he to lift up mine eyes unto thee; when a man is Ignorant of God in Jeſus Chriſt, this ſhould be a ſhame. <hi>I ſpeake this to your ſhame,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 34. that is, if there be any grace in your hearts, certainely ye will be aſhamed that ye ſhould have no more knowledge of God. I ſay when the Conſcience is alive againſt ſinne, it makes a man aſhamed before God; It ſhewes him his nakedneſſe before heaven, it propounds God before his eyes, ſeeing all his
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42059:192"/>
uncleaneneſſe, and ſo it makes him aſhamed before him; doeſt thou Count it a diſgrace to doe evill, a diſgrace to offend God, a confuſion of face to doe iniquity, though it be never ſo ſecret? Canſt thou not looke upon thy unworthy dealings with God, but it makes thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed in his ſight? this is the effect of a living Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<note place="margin">2</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, another effect is penitent griefe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of heart; ye may ſee this effect in the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; <hi>they were prickt in their hearts,</hi> Act. 2. 37. when their, Conſcience began to be alive to ſmite them for their ſinnes, to accuſe them and Condemne them, it grieved them exceedingly; it went to the quick; it was like a Dagger in their heart; it prickt them; it made them mourn for all that they had done. True, a naturall Conſcience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces griefe; ther's nere a wretch but if his Conſcience be awakened to Check him, and accuſe him, and condemne him, it will make him to grieve for his ſinnes. But this is onely legall and ſurly. Now when the Conſcience is alive to doe its duty, as to make the man to doe his, now it makes him grieve out of love to God, out of love to grace and goodneſſe; now he grieves becauſe he hath broken thoſe Commandements that he loves; he loves to obey God O it is the unfeigned deſire of his ſoule to obey him and, therefore he grieves, that he hath done the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.<note place="margin">3</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, another effect is, penitent feare. It makes a man afraid to ſin againſt God againe; as the Apoſtle ſayes; <hi>Yea, what ſeare?</hi> 2 Cor 71. 1. a natural conſcience may cauſe a kind of feare too, nay, a horrible feare. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearefulneſſe ſaith ſurprized the Hypocrites,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 33. 14. for a guilty Conſcience cannot but worke feares when its awakened, but this feare is meerely out of ſelfe love, and of Bondage. But when the Conſcience hath
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42059:192"/>
done ſo its owne duty upon a man, that it hath made him to doe his, now it makes him filially afraid to ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; as a true Childe feares to offend his Father, when a man hath this feare in him, this is a ſigne of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another effect is trembling deſpaire in ones<note place="margin">4</note> ſelf, it maks him ſee nothing but hell and damnation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and it flings him downe at Gods Gate, as a man ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undone in himſelfe, having no hope in himſelfe, for as God dealt with <hi>Paul.</hi> in regard of his recovery out of ſicknes <hi>he brought him to deſpaire of life in himſelfe,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 8. ſo does a living Conſcience in regard of mercy; a naturall Conſcience the effect of that, is to deſpaire too. But that is to deſpaire in God. becauſe when there is nothing but nature in the Conſcience, how can it be otherwiſe? But when there is grace in the Conſcience, grace in the heart, now though Conſcience repreſent to him his damned eſtate, it repreſents withall the free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, to all ſuch as are heavy laden, and ſo it is onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire in himſelfe; now haſt thou ſuch an effect in thee, to deſpaire in thy ſelf; to fling of all thine own hopes, and thy own dependences, hangings, holdings; ye know the ſoule hath a thouſand thouſand ſuch, wiſhes, wouldings, purpoſes dutyes, performances, theſe the ſoule hangs on. But now haſt thou this effect in thee, that thou doeſt abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire in thy ſelfe? I meane ſelfe confidence with whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good is in thee, be it grace, or what ever; doeſt thou deſpaire in thy ſelfe? this is a ſigne of a living Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; now thou hang'ſt upon nothing, but the meere mercy and good will of God. And this is the beſt hold in the world, though the world cannot abide it. Thus ye ſee for ſinne. The livingneſſe of Conſcience in regard of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, now for the livingneſſe of Conſcience in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<note place="margin">2.</note>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:42059:193"/>
of good. Then is the Conſcience alive to that which is good.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when it goes and it does not onely urge a man to<note place="margin">1</note> that which is good; ſo it did <hi>Agrippa. Almoſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian,</hi> Act. 28. 28. when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake unto him, it ſeemes his Conſcience tooke hold of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, and it did mightily urge; it had almoſt done the deed; alas this is not it; a <hi>dead</hi> Conſcience may doe this yea, with admirable importunity; as it is in many. But when the Conſcience doth not onely urge, when that does not onely doe its duty in this point, but it makes a man doe his duty too; the man freely urges himſelfe; and freely ſets himſelfe to it and about it; as it was with <hi>David; when thou ſayeſt, ſeek ye my face, my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face Lord will I ſeek,</hi> Pſal. 27. 8. that is, when thou ſayeſt thus in my Conſcience, ſeeke my face, my heart ecchoed back, I will doe ſo indeed; marke his Conſcience did not onely doe its duty, but it made him to doe his; as his Conſcience did urge him, ſo he tooke theſe urgings, and urged himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the Conſcience hath life towards good,<note place="margin">2</note> it excuſes, and it does not onely excuſe in part, for ſo it may doe in a wicked heart; many a wicked man hath ſuch an excuſing Conſcience, when he does good for the matter of it, as we read in the Heathen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences accuſing or elſe excuſing; their Conſcience did excuſe in part. But it excuſes full out; it tels him, he hath done it unfeignedly in the truth of his heart, that he does beleeve in God, that he does truly repent from <hi>dead</hi> workes, that he does in ſome poore meaſure, walke in new obedience from day to day; and that he ſtands guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe before God, by faith in Chriſt Jeſus; or if it doe not excuſe thus, it is meerly out of Ignorance of the things given him of God; a living Conſcience is an excuſing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42059:193"/>
conſcience; it does not onely ſay the thing that he does is good but that he does it unfeignedly withall his heart; true a naturall Conſcience not awakened may doe thus, but that's a miſpriſion; for when it comes to ſee its owne condition indeed, then it will be in another tale; ah I am rotten; I have beguiled mine owne ſoule to this very day; but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conſcience can never be confuted, as it excuſes, ſo its excuſes ſhall ſtand before God, becauſe it is quickened by the grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt, his bloud is ſprinkled on it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the Conſcience hath life towards good,<note place="margin">3.</note> it approves a man and his wayes; it either may or does pronounce a man to pleaſe God. As it was with <hi>Enech,</hi> he had a conſcience that told him he was approved of God; <hi>before his tranſlation, he had this Teſtimony that he pleaſed God,</hi> Heb, 11. 5. this is the nature of conſcience, if it be alive, to do its duty, and ſo as to make a man to doe his, to tell a man that he is allowed of God; which is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mercy, that a childe of God ſhould have ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer in his owne boſome, that can tell him he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, no creature is able to expreſſe what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort this is; none but good people can have this, others may be approved of men, others may heare that ſuch and ſuch doe approve them, but they can never heare that God does approve them. Theſe are the conſciences one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards good, which it can never doe except it be alive.</p>
               <p>Now the effects of theſe be. Firſt Joy, when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">4</note> does its duty towards God, and makes a man doe his duty too, this worketh Joy in his heart; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays. <hi>This is our rejoyeing even the Teſtimony of our conſcience, that with ſincerity and godly pureneſſe we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. There is no joy like this joy; wicked men may laugh, and ſeeme as merry as crickets, but in the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42059:194"/>
of their laughter, their conſcience gives them but cold comfort; now when a man hath ſuch a conſcience as this, that ſets him about that which is good, this makes him have truer joy then all the world beſides; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the world are beſotted, that they doe not looke after God: Yet the conſcience knowes it is goodneſſe onely that will pleaſe God; and therefore when the conſcience is privy to this, no tongue can ſpeake what a joy this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one.</p>
               <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another effect is boldneſſe and freedome from<note place="margin">2</note> ſlaviſh feare: There's a deale of feare in a mans heart, as long as he does not ſerve God, and doe the things that are pleaſing in his eyes though it may be people doe not feele this ſame feare as long as they are well and luſty; but let but conſcience be awakened, or let death ſeize upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then a feare will appeare, O how afraid are they to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. But let a man have ſuch a living conſcience as this, this gives a man boldneſſe. <hi>The righteous are as bold as a Lyon</hi> Prov. 18. 1. thy conſcience is an admirable thing; without this all a mans boldneſſe is nothing. Thou maiſt hold up thy head very high, and out face all the world for a time, as bold as can be; tuſh thou art well thought of among all thy neighbours, but what ſayes thy conſcience? if that cannot ſay thou art a gracious man, I tell thee thou canſt have no boldneſſe. But now if thou haſt this ſame living conſcience, now thou maiſt be as bold as a Lyon; though the world doe accuſe thee, yet what ſayes thy conſcience? if that excuſe thee, thou maiſt ſhew thy face, where thouſands ſhall be confounded; when <hi>Auſtin</hi> was accuſed by <hi>Secundinus</hi> to have come from the <hi>Maniehees</hi> for feare of loſſe, and for hope of preferment, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelfe with his conſcience, I eſteeme not ſayes he what <hi>Secundinus</hi> thinkes of me, ſo long as my conſcience approves me before God; ſo alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> when the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42059:194"/>
accuſed him, O ſayes he, <hi>it is a very ſmall thing with me, that I ſhould be judged of you,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 3. Thus ye ſee for good; what is the livingneſſe of conſcience towards good. This is the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, now about Poth; both ſinne and goodneſſe,<note place="margin">3.</note> when is the conſcience alive about both? namely when it does inſtruct a man, and not onely ſo, but it guides a man to ſhun the one, and to imbrace the other. This is a living conſcience indeed, when it is a mans privy counſell from day to day. This is a Divine Counſell; its like a little privy Counſeller in a Childe of Gods boſome, that the Lord in mercy hath placed there to direct him; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I will bleſſe the Lord for giving me Counſell, my reines inſtruct me in the night ſeaſons,</hi> Pſal. 16. 7. By his reines he meaneth his conſcience, now that did inſtruct him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the day time, but alſo in the night; if he were tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſinne, his conſcience inſtructed him, nay, I muſt not yeeld to that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he found himſelfe backward to any good duty, nay, ſtill his conſcience adviſed him, nay, I muſt be forward to that. I confeſſe a <hi>dead</hi> conſcience may give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable counſell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Inſtruction to the wicked; I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience proves it unto them. But it does not do its duty, for it does not make them to doe theirs. Thus ye ſee what a living conſcience is, when it ſo does its duty, that it makes us to doe ours.</p>
               <p>But it may be humbled conſcience is <hi>paedagogus animae,</hi> it is the ſoules Schoole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Maſter, as <hi>Origen</hi> cals it; now a Schoole-Maſter may doe his duty, though he doe not make his Scholler doe his; for if he be diligent in teaching and doing of his office, the Scholer may be a dunce for all him; the beſt Schoole-Maſter, may have a block head and a dunce in his Schoole. I anſwer, the reaſon is not alike.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Schoole-maſter teacheth another. But conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a Schoole-Maſter not to another but to a mans ſelfe;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42059:195"/>
and therefore if the conſcience doe its duty indeed, it muſt needs make the man to doe his, becauſe his conſcience is a Schoole-Maſter to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, againe a Schoole-Maſter is not alwayes by his<note place="margin">2</note> Scholer, ſometimes his back is turned; but conſcience is ever by a man, and therefore if it did alwayes doe its duty it might make the man to doe his.</p>
               <p>Againe, Thirdly a Schoole-Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be his Scholer<note place="margin">3</note> is duller then himſelfe; and then though himſelfe be never ſo learned, yet he cannot put his learning into his Scholer. But it is not ſo here, here the Scholer and the Schoole-Maſter is all one; one is no more dull then another, for looke how dull the one, ſo dull the other; look how active the one is, ſo active is the other, becauſe conſcience and the man is all one; it is very true, the conſcience by accuſation is eagerer then the man; for God may take a <hi>dead</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſur it exceedingly, and he does ſo ordinarily in men; but theſe ſtirrings of conſcience, are none of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſtirring but Gods, <hi>my ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. they are his ſtrivings with men. But the conſciences own quick enings, and the mans are all one; you will ſay how ſhall I know whether the quickening that is in my conſcience, be my conſciences, or onely the Lords ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in my conſcience. I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when thou art glad that thy conſcience is ſo buſie<note place="margin">1.</note> with thee, it is very welcome unto thee, then the Lord hath made thy conſcience alive; then God does not onely ſtrive in thy conſcience, but thy conſcience it ſelfe is alive; as we ſee there in <hi>David. I will bleſſe the Lord for giving me counſell, my reines doe inſtruct me,</hi> Pſal. 16. 7. when his conſcience did inſtruct him, he was glad of it, he bleſt the Lord for it; his conſcience was alive. But now in a wicked heart, the more his conſcience accuſes, and condemnes, and checks, the more buiſie it is with him, the more unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42059:195"/>
it is, and therefore he labours to ſtill it; may be he will ſtop it with ſome thing; may be ſome little reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the time, may be with Prayer, or ſome yeeldings thereunto; nay, there be ſome labour to drown it out right, they will goe to the Ale-houſe, or to Cards, or among their boone companions, and ſo ſhake of thoſe dumps; therefore my Brethren, if ye would have a ſigne, that your conſcience is alive, be glad at its dictates, give them all their deare intertainement ye can. Bleſſe the Lord for them, and make very much of ſuch, they are the ſweet motions of Gods holy ſpirit, quench them not; doe not ſtop the mouth of them by halfe payments, let them have their full ſway.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when thou calleſt upon thy conſcience to be<note place="margin">2</note> buiſie; when thou uſeſt to ſtirre up conſcience every day, wind it up as a man does his Clock, that it may be in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion. So the Prophet did; <hi>Why art thou ſo heavy O my ſoule? why art thou ſo diſquieted within me, hope thou in God,</hi> Pſal. 42. 11. marke he took his conſcience and ſtir'd up himſelfe with it, a wicked man does not thus; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience comes before it is ſent for, it is like an unbidden gueſt. And therefore if thou wouldſt know whether thy conſcience be alive, doe but conſider whether this be thy courſe, if thou doeſt daily awaken thy conſcience, if thou doeſt ſet it a worke, this is a ſigne of life in it; as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>here in doe I exerciſe my ſelfe, that I may have a good conſcience, voyd of offence,</hi> Act. 24. 16. He laboured for his conſcience, he called it up every day, he was active about it, ſo that the ſtirrings that are in wicked men, they are none of theirs; but Gods meerly to pull them out of the bottomleſſe pit, if it might be; in the meane time, his conſcience is as <hi>dead</hi> as himſelfe. Thus ye ſee what the life of the conſcience is. Firſt, there is a relative life of conſcience; the conſcience is alive, when the man is alive. Secondly, the conſcience
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42059:196"/>
is alive, when it makes duty ſo, that it makes the man do his duty too; when it does not onely check for evill, and accuſe for evill, and condemne for evill, and prompt a man that he ſhould take heed of evill, but it make a man doe his duty in all theſe; ſo alſo when it does not onely urge a man to that which is good, and excuſe him and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him, but in all theſe, it makes him doe his duty too; ſo likewiſe when it counſels, it does not onely counſell and dictate what is to be done, and what not; but it ſo does all theſe particulars, that it makes the man to doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſincerity from day to day. This is alive conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Now that this is the live conſcience, I prove it unto you by five Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe conſcience was made not onely to doe all theſe<note place="margin">1</note> acts, but to make a man to doe his; ſo that when conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does its own acts never ſo much, that's nothing to the life of conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does thy conſcience check thee, and ſmite thee, does it whiſper never ſo much in thee? this is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it's alive, except it make thee to be obedient unto God Conſcience was given man for this purpoſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then onely is it alive, when it is for this purpoſe in thy Boſome: when <hi>David</hi> would get up out of his temptations, you may ſee how he got up by conſcience; <hi>I communed with my owne heart, and my ſpirit ſayes he made diligent ſearch,</hi> Pſal. 77. 6. that is, he communed with his conſcience, what he knew about God, and ſo got himſelfe up; this is thy conſciences office to tell thee what thou haſt heard out of the word, and that is not all, but to lead thee, guide thee as the helme does the Ship. It is given thee to be thy keeper, as he ſayes, <hi>J was upright before him, and I kept my ſelfe from my iniquity.</hi> Pſal. 18. 23. that is, this is my iniquity, this is the ſinne that I am moſt inclined to, I muſt keepe my ſelfe from that. Thus his conſcience was his keeper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:42059:196"/>Secondly, another argument is, becauſe this is the way<note place="margin">2</note> whereby godly people doe their duties, their conſcience makes them doe their duty, it makes them beleeve, it makes them feare God, it makes them eſchew evill and doe good from day to day. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits,</hi> Pſal. 103. 2. when the Prophet would doe this duty, he made his conſcience preſſe it ſoundly upon him to doe it; ſo when he would waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, he ſet his owne ſoule and conſcience upon him, to make him to doe it; <hi>waite on the Lord, be of good courage, he will ſtrengthen thy heart, waite I ſay upon the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 27. 14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another argument is, this is the deſcription of<note place="margin">3</note> thoſe that have a live conſcience, they are ſuch as make themſelves doe their duties continually; as the Apoſtle ſayes. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, puriſieth himſelfe, even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 3. that is, he is a man that makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doe his duty, his owne ſoule and conſcience ſayes thus unto him, Chriſt is a pure Chriſt, and I muſt be like him, as ever I hope that he will bring me into his kingdom; and this makes him doe his duty; he puriſieth himſelfe, even as he is pure; I could quote abundance of places to prove this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another argument is; when God ſpeakes to<note place="margin">4</note> any that are alive from the <hi>dead,</hi> to doe their duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he bids them make themſelves to doe their duties on this manner; ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the ſight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. that is, goe and aske your owne ſoule, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what have I not theſe and theſe promiſes? why then I muſt labour to be cleanſed from all manner of ſinne, I muſt perfect holineſſe in the feare of God; now ſayes he, let us make our ſelves doe our duties thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:42059:197"/>Nay fifthly, when God ſpeakes to them which are yet<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>dead,</hi> and would turne them home unto him, he bids them doe thus in regard of the meanes; <hi>turne your ſelves and live you,</hi> Ezek. 18. 32. that is, Let your owne ſoules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences conſider this is the way to live, ye cannot be ſaved without turning; as ever I would live for ever, I muſt be turned from all my ſinfull courſes; make your ſelves doe your duties in this manner; that is, uſe all the meanes, that the Lord hath given you to uſe, make your ſelves goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, not as though any man hath free will to turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; But he ſpeakes of the uſe of all meanes, that he puts into your hands; make your ſelves to uſe them; nay no ſoule can ever look to be ſaved, except he doe not onely let his conſcience check him, and tell him thus and thus his duty is, but alſo let his conſcience make him doe his duty too; ſo that this muſt needs be the life of the conſcience; when it does not onely doe its owne duty, to check and to whiſper but alſo it makes a man to doe his.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is; firſt, then we ſee here how few have<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> live conſciences, for people have conſciences that doe onely tell them they ſhould be more carefull; they ſhould give over ſuch and ſuch ſins, they ſhould beleeve, and they ſhould be zealous, and they ſhould be more ſetled, but O how few have conſciences that make them doe their duties? Numb. 15. 40. <hi>that ye may remember and doe all my commandements and be holy unto your God.</hi>

               <p>WE are come to ſpeake of this neceſſary point when is a man quickened up towards God and all his holy wayes? We have ſhewed you three things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this already. Firſt, what the life of the minde is, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what the life of the heart is. Thirdly, what the life of the conſcience is. Now there remaines two more, the one is the life of the memory; the other is the life of the affections.</p>
               <p>Fourthly then, what is the life of the memory? for the<note place="margin">4</note> memory too may be <hi>dead,</hi> and the memory may be alive.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the memory may be <hi>dead;</hi> when a man may be<note place="margin">1.</note> remembers, if ye aske him a thing, he can tell it; aske him of a Sermon, he can tell the Text and the points, and the particulars that were delivered in the Sermon, but here's all, it's a <hi>dead</hi> memory, he never remembers it to any purpoſe; this is to remember, even as if a man did not remember; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes, <hi>remember and forget not that thou provokedſt the Lord to anger in the wilderneſſe,</hi> Deut. 9. 7. that is, remember it, and doe not remember it with a <hi>dead</hi> memory. As <hi>Balaam</hi> remembred that God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him in the way, no queſtion but if a man had askt him about it a weeke or two after, he would have ſhewed that he did remember it, he could tell the place, the time, and the manner, and how it was in his journey, and how the Lord ſtood before him with a drawne ſword. But alas this was a <hi>dead</hi> memory; for this practice ſhewed plainly that he had forgotten it in effect. I ſay there is a <hi>dead</hi> memory, a man may have an excellent memory to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42059:198"/>
goe from point to point, nay, a better memory in this ſenſe then many of Gods deareſt Children, and yet this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be a <hi>dead</hi> memory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a living memory; a memory that<note place="margin">2</note> hath life in it; as God ſayes of penitent <hi>Ephraim; I doe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly remember him ſtill,</hi> Jer. 31. 20. marke, God did not onely remember him, ſo he does remember all men, he remembers reprobates and all, but he did very earneſtly remember him; ſo when a man does earneſtly remember God; the remembrance he hath of him is earneſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members his word earneſtly, he is earneſt in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of his will, though there be never ſo many things, to put God out of his thoughts, he is daily tempted to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelfe in ſome thing or other about God, but he is earneſt to remember, when a mans memory is eager after a thing, now it is a live memory.</p>
               <p>Now the queſtion is, when the memory is alive, for the handling of this. Firſt, I will ſhew you what the memory is. Secondly; what a great bleſſing of God it is that we have a memory. Thirdly, when the memory may be ſaid to be alive. Fourthly, we will prove it, and then we will make ſome uſes of the point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what memory is. It is the conſervation of what we apprehend, as a man hath many things in common with a beaſt, ſo memory is in his fancy and imagination, for look what a man hath ſeen, or heard, or taſted, or ſmelt, or felt, memory is the conſervation of the ſame; ſome can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſhape of men, of towne; and creatures, we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what colour things are of, what a taſte ſuch and ſuch meats have, ſuch a memory beaſts have, <hi>as we ſee in the milch Kine, they remembred their Calves,</hi> 1 Sam. 6. 12. they went lowing as they went; thus the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> remembred the fleſh that they had in Aegypt, <hi>we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the fleſh, which we did eat in</hi> Aegypt, Numb. 11. 5. and this we call a ſenſitive memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:42059:198"/>Secondly, memory, moſt properly, is a faculty of the<note place="margin">2</note> minde, whereby it preſerves the ſpecies of what it once knew and therefore when a man is ſaid to remember he is ſaid to be mindfull, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>be ye mindfull alwayes of his Covenant,</hi> 1 Chro. 16. 15. that is looke you alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Covenant, for when the minde once knowes a thing, memory is a certaine Paper of the minde, to retaine it and to keep it, and therefore it is called the ſoules ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; it is the ſoules treaſury, as our Saviour Chriſt ſpeakes; <hi>a good man out of the good treaſury of the heart, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things; and an evill man out of the evill treaſure of the heart, bringeth forth evill things,</hi> Matth. 12. 35. memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the ſoules cheſt, where it keeps all its Jewels; that look what a man knows, ſpecially if he like it, preſently he layes it up to keep by him, as it is ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſtill when ſhe knew any thing of our Saviour, when ſhe knew of any ſaying of his, ſhe kept it in her heart; Mary <hi>kept all theſe ſayings,</hi> Luk. 2. 19. properly I ſay memory is a faculty of the minde, whereby when it knowes a thing once, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep it. This we call intellectuall memory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by conſequent, memory is in the conſcience;<note place="margin">3.</note> for the ſoule of man being privy to it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what it knowes, what its told of God, what notions it hath, what it does, what it hath done, or what it hath not done, it hath a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to record this; and therefore in this ſenſe, we call memory the ſoules Regiſter; for thus it is in the conſcience; ſo when the Sonne, of <hi>Iacob</hi> were privy to themſelves, that they had ſold their brother <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ye know how their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience remembred what they had done, above twenty yeares after. <hi>O we are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoule, when he beſought us, and we would not heare.</hi> Gen. 42. 21. their conſcience had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred their fact up, and did remember it againſt them, ſo many yeares after. So <hi>Adonibezek</hi> being privy to himſelf,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42059:199"/>
                  <hi>when he cut off the thumbes &amp; the great toes of threeſcore and ten Kings, and made them to gather ſcraps under his Table, you ſee how his conſcience had regiſtred this, and could remember it againſt him another day,</hi> Judg. 1. 7. ſo that memory is by conſequent in the conſcience too. And this memory we call the Booke of a mans conſcience. Theſe three are all the proper memories that we have, becauſe memory can properly be nowhere but where apprehenſion is; either ſenſitive apprehention as in fancie; or intellectuall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as in the minde; or reflective apprehenſion as in the conſcience; <hi>they underſtood not thy wonders, neither did they remember them,</hi> Pſal. 106. 7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, memory in an improper ſenſe, is in the will<note place="margin">4.</note> and heart of a man, becauſe there is ſome retention too of what is paſt and gone; as let a man love or hate his brother, though that act be paſt and gone, yet there is ſome reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that act againſt another time, for when a man hath hated one heretofore, he is the more ready to hate him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; which is a ſigne that the heart does retaine what it did before; nay, ſayes <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there is <hi>memoria in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus;</hi> there is memory in the feet; there is memory in the hand; as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes; <hi>if I forget thee O Ieruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning,</hi> Pſal. 137. 5. this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led remembring too in the Scripture; but this is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; this we call a habit or faculty, or a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in acting, by reaſon of precedent actings. Thus ye ſee what memory is. Now this memory is of things that are paſt; for if things be preſent, we are ſaid to ſee them, or behold them, or ſo. But when they are paſt, now if we can ſee them ſtill, this is by way of remembring; indeed we may be ſaid to remember things both preſent and to come, in regard that our knowledge of them is paſt; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Remember them that are in Bonds; as being bound with them;</hi> Heb. 13. 3. that is, though the thing be
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:42059:199"/>
now preſent, yet I would have you remember it; becauſe your warning is paſt; this is a duty, ye have been told in times paſt, therefore looke ye remember it. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Remember thy creatour in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> Pſal. 12. 1. That is, though thy creatour be not paſt, yet thy creation is paſt, and thou art not ſo yong but thou haſt been told of thy duty in this thing in times paſt; O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember that; nay, thus a man may remember that which is yet to come, as for example the day of his death, that he muſt dye and come to Judgement; for though the thing be yet to come, yet he hath had warnings of it in times paſt; as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſayes of <hi>Ieruſalem, her filthineſſe is in her skirts, ſhe remembred not her laſt end, therefore ſhe came downe wonderfully,</hi> Lam. 1. 2. the Lord finds fault with her that ſhe did not remember her time to come. The reaſon is, becauſe ſhe was told of it aforehand in times paſt.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſecond thing; that this is a great bleſſing,<note place="margin">2</note> beloved it is a great bleſſing of God, that we have ſuch a faculty in us as to remember; it was a naughty ſpeech of <hi>Charoone</hi> that an excellent memory is needfull for three ſorts of men. Firſt, for great Trades-men, for they having many buſineſſes to do many reckonings, many Irons in the fire, had need of a good memory. Secondly, great talkers; for they being full of words, had need to have a good Store-houſe in their heads to feed their tongues. Thirdly, for Lyars; <hi>oportet mendaeem eſſe memorem,</hi> for they telling many untruths, had need of a good memory, to be able to remember what untruths they have told, leſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they be taken in their lying, contradicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I ſay this a prophane ſpeech, as though a good memory were of no other uſe, then for engroſſers of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and talkative fellowes, and forging compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whereas memory is a great bleſſing of God, and the more we have of it, the more advantage we have unto
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42059:200"/>
our owne eternall good, if we have a heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a great bleſſing that what we once knew, we <note place="margin">1</note> may alwayes know; now this may be by memory; were it not for this, we ſhould be Ignorant againe as faſt as we learne; whence is it that ye ſtill know how to read but becauſe ye remember your letters and ſpelling; whence is it that ye ſtill know your Trades and your callings, which ye were taught ſo long agoe, but ye remember how ye were taught. Ye once knew the grounds of religion, may be ye were taught heretofore; if ye know them ſtill, it is becauſe ye remember them; were it not for memory, we ſhould be as much to ſeek, as if we had never learnt ought; as <hi>Iude</hi> ſayes, <hi>I will put them in remembrance, though ye once knew this,</hi> Jude. 5. that is, as ye once knew it, ſo I deſire that ye may know it ſtill; that it may ſtick by you, that you may make it your own; what a mercy is this? we cannot undertake to have alwayes the meanes of knowledge, we may want preaching; God knowes how ſoone; now if we have memory to lay up ſome knowledge, we may have the benefit of it, how ever things goe; may be God gave us a warning, to take heed of ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, now if we have a good memory, this warning may be ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us; we have had ſuch motions, ſuch convictions, ſuch ſights of ſinne, ſuch ſtirrings, ſuch manifeſtations of God to us, what a mercy is it that God hath given us ſuch a thing as memory is? as we had them once, ſo we may have them ſtill if we remember them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, memory is a great bleſſing, to bring our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">2</note> to act upon all occaſions. How many thouſand truths doe we know, that we doe not, neither can we actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thinke of; now when we have uſe of thoſe truths, it is a great mercy, that the Lord hath framed a memory in us, where we may have them upon all ſuch occaſions; e. g. we know we ſhould be patient, may be we doe not
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42059:200"/>
thinke of this duty for a day together, but now when we have uſe of it, then we may remember it; So for meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we know it, and for forgiving of wrongs, to reſiſt temptations, to deny our ſelves, to ſhunne the occaſions of evill, we know all theſe things, but our knowledge cannot alwayes be in act; now when we have uſe of theſe truthes, what a mercy is it that we have ſuch a thing as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is to remember them afreſh? did <hi>David</hi> actually think of Gods gracious judgements alwayes? no, but when he had uſe of them, when he was at a <hi>dead</hi> lift, then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory brought him to minde. <hi>I remembred thy judgements O Lord and comforted myſelfe,</hi> Pſal. 119. 52. may be <hi>Peter</hi> had no occaſion actually to thinke of thoſe words of Chriſt, that <hi>Iohn</hi> indeed Baptized with water, but ye ſhall be Baptized with the holy Ghoſt: but having a memory, that gave him the uſe of thoſe words in due time; <hi>then I remembred the word of the Lord ſayes he,</hi> Act. 11. 16. may be this truth is not thought of a 12. moneth together, that ones enemies may be they of our owne houſhold; now perhaps all on a ſuddain; we have uſe of this truth, then we remember it: now is not this a great mercy, that God hath given us ſuch a thing; that we may put up his truths, as a man does his memory in his purſe, to take it out when occaſion is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a great bleſſing to have God alwayes with<note place="margin">3</note> one; this memory is ſuch a faculty, that if a man have a heart, he may have God alwayes with him, and heaven with him; ye know that moſt men are without God in the world, what is the reaſon of it? but becauſe they will not remember him? how many doe know God very much? as the Heathens did, they knew him to be eternall, to be Almighty, to be every where, to be holy and juſt, they knew him, but they did not like to retaine him in their knowledge, Rom. 1. 28. that is, they let him goe away
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:42059:201"/>
from them, they would not keep him in remembrance, as <hi>Nebuchadezer</hi> ſayes of his dreame, when he had forgotten his dreame, <hi>it is gone away from me, ſayes he,</hi> Dan. 2. 5. ſo people forget God, they let God goe away from them; now beloved this makes us without excuſe, when God hath given us a memory, we might have God alwayes with us, if we had a heart; we need not let him goe away. The memory is a deep vault in the ſoule, where it may hide what it hath a mind too, that, nor men nor devils can take it away from us; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> hid their corne from the <hi>Midianites,</hi> ſo we may hide what ever our heart hath a likeing unto in our memories, that we may have it always with us, if we will; as it is ſaid of the good Merchant, when he had found the rich Treaſure he hid it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44. that is, he laid it up in his ſoules ſtorehouſe; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>my Sonne if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my Commandements with thee,</hi> Prov. 2. 1. I ſay the memory is a deep vault in the ſoule, where a man hides what he hath a minde to, that it may never be taken away from him; ſo that memory is an excellent thing; a man may have God alwayes with him, and heaven and all heavenly things, if ſo he have a minde to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is a great bleſſing, that if a man chance to<note place="margin">4</note> goe out of his way, he may put himſelfe in againe, ſeeing he hath a memory; I ſpeake of a Chriſtian, that hath once heard the wayes of God he cannot goe out, but by memory he may put himſelfe in againe; memory is the ſoules Map; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>all the ends of the earth ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member themſelves and turne unto the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 22. 27. he ſpeakes of all Gods Elect; marke how they get into the way againe, they ſhall remember themſelves ſo when are a man ſteps aſide by pride, thus he may come in againe by remembring himſelfe; O, God reſiſteth the proud, the Lord ſayes he will give grace to none but the humble; thus
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42059:201"/>
he may come in againe; ſo if he ſtep aſide by too much yeelding to the world, thus he may ſet himſelfe to rights, O woe is me, what have I done? now I remember the love of the world is enmity with God; if he chance to have by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts at the hearing of the word, let him remember himſelfe, O what a beaſt am I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I forgot I was in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him, I remember my ſelfe, that I am before him; and thus he may correct himſelfe; ſo the prodigall Sonne did, when he had fetcht his wilde vagary, at laſt he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred himſelfe; <hi>O how many hired Servants of my Fathers have bread enough?</hi> Luke 15. 17. he remembred what a good Father he had runne away from, this fetcht him home againe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it's a great bleſſing to help a man to beleeve;<note place="margin">5</note> though a man do not beleeve for the preſent; he heares the word of God, he hears that which might do him good, but for the preſent he does not beleeve; yet who knowes but this very word may doe him good another day, memory may bring it to minde, through the goodneſſe of God, and then he may beleeve it; as the Diſciples of Chriſt, ye may read how that Chriſt ſpake ſome words, that did them little good for the preſent. But the Text ſayes, that when he was riſen againe, then they remembred the words that he had ſaid unto them, and beleeved, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 22. many times we are untoward for the preſent, and then the word does us little good, I but it's a bleſſing that we can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the ſame word may be repreſented by our memories to us, and may doe the deed; as we ſee in the ſecond ſonne in the Goſpell; his Father ſaid to him, <hi>goe worke to day in my Vineyard; ye know how diſtemper'd he was for the preſent, he anſwered and ſaid, I will not,</hi> Matth. 21. 29. I but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he repented himſelfe and went, that is, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred afreſh what his Father ſaid to him, and that made him doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:42059:202"/>Sixthly, it's a great help to better knowledge; it may be at the firſt, when we are taught, the word does not ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, we do not underſtand it. But yet remembring what it was we were told, afterwards through the mercy of God ſome thing or other comes in, that now we can ſay, bleſſed be God, now I underſtand ſuch a truth, ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſuch a commandement; and yet no new teaching, but remembring onely what we read or heard; as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time one of the Iewiſh Doctors not underſtanding that place in the Prophet, where it is ſaid, <hi>that God would ſweep them away with the</hi> beſom <hi>of deſtruction,</hi> iſa. 14. 23. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeeing a maide come with her beſome to ſweep the houſe, now he ſaw the meaning of the place; ſo when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> that before the Cock crowed twice he would deny him thrice; that <hi>Peter</hi> had a poore weak heart, and that he had a horrible deale of faint-heartedneſſe in him, and that he would deny his own Maſter, <hi>Peter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not his words, he ſaw no ſuch thing in his heart, as to thinke thoſe words to be true. But when he had been in the High Prieſts Hall and there had abjured his Maſter, and had heard too the Cock crow twice, and his Maſter look at him, <hi>now he remembred his words, and went out and wept hitterly,</hi> Matth. 26. 75. that is, now he ſaw the truth of Chriſts words, now he ſaw what a wretched heart he had, and lamented it. I ſay memory is a great help unto knowledge; as God ſayes; <hi>O my people, remember now what</hi> Balak <hi>King of</hi> Moab <hi>conſulted; and what</hi> Baalam <hi>the Son of</hi> Beor <hi>anſwered him from</hi> Shictim <hi>to Gilgal, that ye may know the righteouſneſſe of the Lord,</hi> Mieh. 6. 5. How many things have we heard and ſeene, when we were children, that then we never knew the meaning of? yet afterwards when we come to have more wit, then remembring what they were, we underſtand them; as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he went to waſh his feet; <hi>what I doe thou knoweſt not</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:42059:202"/>
                  <hi>now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter,</hi> John. 13. 7. that is, when thou remembreſt it hereafter, then thou ſhalt know my meaning in it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, memory is as excellent helpe for a man to<note place="margin">7</note> preach to himſelfe; Beloved we can but preach to you an houre or ſo, but ſeeing God hath given you memories, ye may preach to your ſelves all the day long; memory may help you to repeate the word every day in your hearts; as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>ſpeaking unto your ſelvs,</hi> Ep. 5. 19. ſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this bleſſing of God, ye may ſpeake to your ſelves from day to day.</p>
               <p>Nay eighthly, it's an excellent thing, for it may let you<note place="margin">8</note> have the benefit of things before they be; your death is not yet, your laſt ſickneſſe is not yet, your ſalvation is not yet; the day of judgement, the Kingdome of glory, theſe are things that are not yet. I but, you having a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ye may have much Benefit by them in the meane time; ye may repreſent them to your ſelves as things preſent, and have a world of good by them; and ſo all the things that are paſt, no act of the ſoule can make them ſtill preſent but memory; your childe-hood is paſt, all the Sermons that ye heard heretofore are all paſt. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes have ye committed in times paſt! and how many dealings have ye had of God in the dayes that are paſt? now having a memory, except ye have graceleſſe hearts, ye may doe your ſelves good by all theſe, even as if they were now before you; if a childe of God be at a loſſe for the preſent, he may helpe himſelfe by memory; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſayes, <hi>I remembred the dayes of old; I call to remembrance my Song that I have had,</hi> Pſal. 77. 5. 6. ſo if any of you beſecure, ye may remember ſome thing or other that is paſt, which may awaken you againe; hath God never ſhewed you your damned eſtate heretofore? were ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſick heretofore, and did you not ſee that if ye had
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42059:203"/>
dyed in that caſe, ye had periſht; ye may remember that now, and awaken your ſelves; and how if God ſhould take you away in ſuch a caſe as that? It cannot be related what a bleſſing it is that we have a memory.</p>
               <p>But let us come to the third thing; and that is this, when may the memory be ſaid to be alive? I anſwer, there be two parts of the memories deadneſſe towards God. The firſt is an aptneſſe to forget God and all his commands. Secondly, an aptneſſe to remember thoſe things that are not ſo good for us; now when thoſe two faults are rectified in ſome meaſure then the memory is alive towards God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There's aptneſſe in your memories to forget God<note place="margin">1.</note> and all his commands; <hi>ye know God commands us to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath day to keepe it holy,</hi> Exod. 20. 8. how apt are we to forget it? how commonly is it out of our minds? ſo in the 78. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and the 7. <hi>verſe,</hi> God ſayes there, <hi>he would not have us ſorget his workes, but that we ſhould keepe his commandements;</hi> now O how apt are we to let them leake out of our hearts? we have a helliſh art of forgetfulneſſe; how often doe we forget our ſelves herein, and ſuffer the remembrance of God to be taken away from us? <hi>ye have forgotten the exhortation that ſpeakes to you as to Children,</hi> Heb. 12. 5. how often doe we forget to keep our ſelves unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? though we be told of the will of God, yet any little thing is enough to put it out of our minds, <hi>ſtay them not leaſt my people forget it;</hi> though we be told of our miſery, and the infinite danger we are in, may be at the firſt it moves us a little, but how ſoon doe we forget it, and other things take us up? now when this aptneſſe is rectified in ſome meaſure; when God hath a ſound impreſſe on our minds that we muſt needs remember him, and all the things that concerne our peace; when there's a Law in our mindes, that we will not forget God; as ye may ſee there in <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:42059:203"/>
                  <hi>Bleſſe thou the Lord O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits,</hi> Pſal. 103. 2. when our memory is ſanctified, and is made the good Treaſury of our heart; when the Lord hath lifted up our memory unto him, then it is alive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as by nature there's an aptneſſe in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory<note place="margin">2</note> to forget God, ſo there's an aptneſſe to remember other things that either are not good for us, or not ſo good; we are apt to remember injuries; nay, one injury will be thought one more then many good turns; ſo likewiſe idle tales, we are apt to remember them; whereas good things goe out in our hearts like ſparkes in wet tinder. We may ſee this in the hearing of the word; the Apoſtle tearmes <hi>us forget ſull hearers,</hi> James 1. 25. if a tale be told us in a Sermon, that we can remember; how many are apt to carry that way; whereas that which is wholeſom, and might doe us more good, how apt we are we to forget that? as a Divine ſayes, our memories are like ſtrainers, all the pure milke runneth through, but if there be any droſſe, that ſtayes behinde; or like a grate that lets the pure water run away, and if there be any ſtrawes and ſtickes and filth and mud, and dregs, that it holds, ſo it is with our memories by nature trifles, and toyes, and worldly things, them we are apt to remember, like the Shepheard in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> that could remember all his flock, he kept a thouſand ſheep, and if one ſhould but change one Sheep and put in another, he could tell which it was. But for gratious things our memories does ſoon forget them; like Iſrael, <hi>they ſoon forgot all the workes of God,</hi> Pſal. 106. 13. now what is this but the corruption &amp; deadnes of our memories towards God? may be we are apt to excuſe it, alas we have weak memories true, if we were as weake memoryed in other things, it were ſomething; but when we can remember our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and profits and tales, and any thing; when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>we goe to buy, weel'e be ſure to remember our ſelves there, when
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42059:204"/>
to ſell, wee'le be ſure to remember our ſelves there, that we will have to the worth if we can. But in matters of God there we forget our ſelves; this cannot be excuſed. Now when this is rectified in ſome meaſure, then our memory is alive; when we will rather forget any thing elſe then God; rather forget our ſelves in all the world, then forget our duty towards God, when this ſtudy is once ſet up ſoundly in the ſoule in ſome meaſure, now the memory is alive. Thus ye ſee the third thing.</p>
               <p>Now for the fourth, that this muſt needs be the life of the memory, I prove it by arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the memory hath hardly any other<note place="margin">1</note> quickening, then the quickening of the man whoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is, ſo that when the mans mind is quickened together with his conſcience and heart, the memory is quickened too; as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou haſt quickened me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 93. that is, my memory is quickened up to thy precepts, becauſe with them thou haſt quickened me; for we ſee commonly, that the faculty of memory is much at one after converſion that it was before converſion; if it were a weake memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo it is after; onely this; as the ſtrength of it was let out towards the world and ſinne, and ſelfe before, ſo now the ſtrength of it is in ſome meaſure let out towards the beſt things. And therefore what can the life of the memory be, but the aptneſſe of a man to remember God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe this is the onely practicall memory;<note place="margin">2</note> ye know a man may have an admirable memory, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Sermons, whole Chapters in the Bible, and yet have a <hi>dead</hi> memory to God; a Sanctified memory, is a practicall memory; as the Lord ſayes, remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to keep it holy; q. d. ye may remember ſtill when the Sabbath is come, I this is the Sabbath day; that is not it; that's onely a contemplative memory. But I
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42059:204"/>
would have you have a practicall memory; not onely to remember the duty, but remember for to doe it; for as the contemplative underſtanding hath a faculty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its ſpecies; ſo the practicall underſtanding, hath a faculty of conſerving its ſpecies too; as long as a man hath not this practicall memory, it is nothing. <hi>Becauſe he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not to ſhew mercy,</hi> Pſal. 109. 16. marke, the Lord does not ſinde fault with a man for not remembring of that duty, for may be he did remember that, I but he did not remember to doe his duty; this is a live memory, when a mans practicall memory is towards God and his wayes. Now when a man is made againe to remember God and all his holy wayes, now his memory muſt needs be made practicall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe this is the onely memory that<note place="margin">3.</note> repreſents things lively to the ſoule. I ſay when a man is made in ſome meaſure apt and inclined to remember God, then and onely then does his memory repreſent God and his wayes lively to him; ye know reaſon ſayes the life of the memory muſt needs be in this, that it repreſents things lively and powerfully unto us; when it does not onely ſhew us what we doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but it ſhewes it to the life; when it ſhewes it dully and bluntly and obſcurely, that's with a kinde of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; then a man remembers it to the full, when a man remembers to the utmoſt of what he once knew; ſo that if a mans memory be alive, it muſt remember to the full in a perfect manner; as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>I have remembred thy name O Lord in the night, and have kept thy Law;</hi> Pſal. 119. 55. that is, I remembred it, and remembred it to the full, I repreſented it powerfully to my ſelfe, ſo that I made my ſelfe to keep thy Law by it. I affected my owne heart by what I did remember; as the Church ſayes, <hi>my Ieule hath them ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ll in remembrance, &amp; is humbled within me,</hi> Lam. 3. 20.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42059:205"/>
well then ye ſee, that a lively memory is it that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents things lively to a man; now when a man is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to remember God and his wayes, then and never till then does he repreſent God lively to himſelfe. Thoſe that have not this aptneſſe wrought in them, may be they remember God now and then, and the duties now and then, but they never remember them in a lively perfect manner.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, firſt, if this be the onely lively memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> to be apt to remember God, then let us labour to get this ſame aptneſſe into our mindes to remember God in all our wayes. Let us conſider. Firſt becauſe without this memory, all mens other cryes are nothing. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a memory to remember God; <hi>they remembred that God was their Rock, and at the high God was their redeemer,</hi> Pſal. 78. 35. but that remembrance was nothing. So that if we be not thus mindfull of God, we are yet in our ſinnes; as God tells <hi>Iudah. Becauſe thou haſt forgotten me, and caſt me behinde thy back, therefore be are thou thy lewdneſſe,</hi> Ezek. 23. 35. if a man were once pulled out of his ſinnes, if he once had that true conviction, and godly ſorrow, and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and faith and amendment of life that is in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the ſoule would have the lively remembrance of it ſtill, to make him goe on as he hath begun, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have not this bleſſed remembrance yet in us, it is moſt plaine we are yet in our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thy heart can never retaine Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">2</note> without this ſame memory; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes; <hi>My Sonne forget not my Law, but let thy heart keepe my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> Prov. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthy, The want of this remembring of God is the<note place="margin">3</note> cauſe of all ſinne; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of all the ſinnes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>they have forgotten the God that formed them,</hi> Deut. 32. 18. ſo againe in another place; <hi>they have perverted</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:42059:205"/>
                  <hi>their way, they have forgotten the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3. 21. ſo againe it is ſaid in the Booke of the Judges, <hi>the Children of Iſrael did evill in the ſight of the Lord, and forgot him,</hi> Judg. 3. 7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the want of this memory, is the high way to<note place="margin">4</note> deſtruction, the Lord will deſtroy them, that forget him; that doe not remember to feare him, that doe not preſſe it upon their minds ſtill to regard him; the Lord will in the end, deſtroy all ſuch people; as he ſayes, <hi>Iſrael hath forgotten his maker, therefore I will kindle afire, that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 14. Beloved how doe we looke that God ſhould remembers us, if we will forget him. <hi>I will utterly forget you.</hi> Jer. 23. 39.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another uſe is to ſhew you, how ye may get<note place="margin">2</note> alive memory. There be ſeven cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is a true knowledge of God. I told you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance<note place="margin">1.</note> is moſt properly in the underſtanding; now looke how a man underſtands God, ſo he does remember; if a man know God onely literally, he remembers him no otherwiſe; but if a man know God aright, then he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers him aright. The underſtanding can keepe no other ſpecies then it hath; if it have a ſaving knowledge of God, then it hath ſaving ſpecies of God; no man can have other money in his purſe, then he puts into his purſe. If he would have Gold in his purſe, he muſt put Gold into his purſe; ſo if we would remember God aright, let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get a right knowledge of him. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord, that thou mayſt remember, &amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 16. 62. 63.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a new and a true heart; mens memories ever<note place="margin">2</note> follow the nature of their hearts; they ever will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that their memory is ſet to; let a man be proud, he will ever remember his reſpect; let him doe any thing that ſeemes to deſerve praiſe, he will ever remember to jet himſelfe; let him be at any time diſparaged, he will
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42059:206"/>
ever remember to be very much ſtirred; ſo let a man be covetous, he will ever remember his profit, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member never to goe againſt his profit, if he can otherwiſe chooſe; what ever he forgets, he will not forget that; ſo let a man be Bookiſh, let a mans luſts be to have learning, he will be ſure to remember that; now if a mans heart be ſet truly towards God, this will draw his minde towards God, now he will remember to pleaſe God, to have his heart in a ſweet frame; if he ſinde any diſtemper in his heart, he will remember to remove that if he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; when the heart is upright, it runnes thus; <hi>we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy love more then wine, the upright love thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. ſo that if we would remember God with this alive memory, we muſt get an upright heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a cleare and a diſtinct eſtate before God; as long as a man is confuſed in his conſcience, he knowes not<note place="margin">3.</note> what to make of himſelfe; this breakes the neck of true memory; <hi>methodus eſt mater memoriae,</hi> diſtinctneſſe is the mother of memory as we ſay. Let a man be confuſed in his notions, this ſpoileth all memory; ſo it is here, as long as we are confuſed in our conſciences, we know not where we are; we cannot remember God; we know not what to call to minde; his juſtice or his mercy, his promiſes or his threatnings; as <hi>David</hi> when he was to ſeeke at one time, he could not remember God to any purpoſe, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God and was troubled ſayes he,</hi> Pſal. 77. 3. He was troubled horribly in remembring of him; like a man in his wooing, he is troubled to remember ought; now when a man hath cleared up his Eſtate, it's ſtrange to ſee how cleare he is in his Prayers, how cleare in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, cleare in his apprehenſions, where as another man knows not where he is; ſo that if we would remember God in all our wayes, let us labour to cleare up our eſtates; this will help us to remember him a thouſand times better
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42059:206"/>
then ever we did before; then we ſhall ſee his promiſes diſtinctly, and every thing diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a delight in good wayes; this is a very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable help of memory; what's the reaſon, we are apt to<note place="margin">4.</note> forget any thing, but becauſe we do not regard it; the more the mind regards any thing, the more it remembers it; as the Prophet ſayes, <hi>I will delight my ſelfe in thy Statutes, I will not forget thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 16. <hi>And ſo for hope too.</hi> Pſ. 78. 7.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, meditation is another cauſe of this remembring<note place="margin">5</note> of God; <hi>meditationes ſalvant memoriam</hi> ſayes <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> the more a man thinkes of a thing, it is the deeper in his minde; when the good man had ſaid, <hi>he would remember Gods workes,</hi> Pſal. 77. 11. O ſayes he, <hi>I will meditate of them,</hi> verſe 12.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the rubbing up of our memories. The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">6.</note> is a very lazie faculty, if it be not every foot rubbed up, it will be forgetfull; therefore we ſhould rub up our minds, if we ſee them ready to let his word ſlip, we muſt call it back againe; as the Lord ſayes, <hi>remember this and ſhew your ſelves men, bring it to mind O ye tranſgreſſors,</hi> I ſa. 46. 8. our memories are naturally exceeding ſlippery, they are apt to leake out that which is good; and therefore we ſhould take paines with our mindes, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things that we have heard, leaſt at any time we let them ſlip,</hi> Heb. 2. 1.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, which is the maine of all, and that<note place="margin">7</note> is the holy Ghoſt. <hi>But the comforter which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> John. 14. 26.</p>
