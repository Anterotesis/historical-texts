            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been an antient and a laudable custome, and even in latter times not altogether out of use, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Inaugurations, Triumphs and Vertues of Princes, upon every happy Turn of State, memorable Success, or glorious Action; and that by way of Panegyrick, or laudatory Oration. Thus <hi>Isocrates</hi> to <hi>Philip, Mamertinus</hi> to <hi>Julian, Ausonius</hi> to <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Nazarius</hi> to <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Trajan.</hi> And it ought chiefly to continue, where the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64909:3"/>
Peoples peace, liberty and safety become enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised and restored by so happy a revolution, as the Divine providence has now wrought in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing Your Sacred Majesty to us, who have so long bowed and groaned under the yoke of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppression. And although I Your Majesties most loyal Subject am far unfit for so great an undertaking, a work that requires the best and most assured Pen to the due celebration of the vertues and greatness of so Excellent and so mighty a Prince; yet it may not be the greatest wonder that the happy Influence of your Royal beams have wrought, that a man how much soever a stranger to all the ornaments, and even the method of Art, should nevertheless pour out his Joy at the sacred feet of so gracious and so indulgent a King and Soveraign. Now then is a time to imitate so beautiful Examples, and after our Hosanna's and Hallelujahs to Almighty God for your many great and miraculous Deliverances, to give Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty a most loyal and hearty Welcome to Your just, and so long unjustly usurped Inheritance, and to all that (by Your gracious Indulgence) we doe or may call ours.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to Your Majesties faithful Subjects, by what an unparallel'd Rebellion, what vile confederacies, and what unexampled cruelty Your Royal Father (of blessed memory) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from his undoubted and hereditary Empire; nor by what an irreligious power Your Majesty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64909:3"/>
has since been so long opposed and kept from the Government of Your faithful and affectionate people: Nor with what admirable patience, and absolute resignation of your self and affairs to the will of the most Mighty, You have embraced dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and sustained afflictions, that nothing but so Heroick a Spirit could oppose, or suffer. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the great mercy, and mighty power of God was never more manifested in any humane affair, then in the miraculous preservation and most happy restauration of your Royal Person to your Crowns and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>It were an unseasonable, and perhaps an inoffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious work, to repeat a story Your Majesty in Your own grace and goodness are willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get: It were otherwise not hard (chiefly to a mind not yet weaned from the sense of Your past suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) to trace You through the unhappy progress of Your misfortunes; and to let Your Majesty know, that although our hands were manacled from the service of Your cause, and our feet fettred from the pursuit of Your fortunes, yet our hearts went along, and were wounded with every impious stroke that was made to the danger of Your Sacred Majesties life, or to the prejudice of Your Royal Interest.</p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>(Sir)</hi> we dare speak our selves honest, even when we lay griped in a Tyrants talons, and panting under his weight; when upon every Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites suggestion, or his own perpetual Jealousie (his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64909:4"/>
more frequent Intelligence) mens lives, which were his sport, only served to make way to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which were his business. And although good and prudent Subjects ought to measure their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or affliction by the Rulers scale, yet since all men are not principled at that honest and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rate, it may not be impertinent to consider, that as Your own particular sufferings (if a Prince can be said to suffer alone) have made Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties person most welcome to some, so I hope the common calamity they were involved in, and are now freed from, will endeare it to all, even the most blind and violent, of Your most seduced, or most wilfully offending Enemies. Men now look back into their lives, and see so many deformities behind, that they run affrighted from themselves, and can find no refuge but in Your Princely armes, no safety but in Your mercy, nor no peace of mind till Your Royal word hath assured them of Your Love, without which Your Pardon would only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them of their unnatural guilt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(Mighty Sir)</hi> wee find You apt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and so sweetly inclined to mercy, that You prevent the offender, by obliterating the offence; so that the most obnoxious find themselves absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before they aske; and become more ashamed of their misdemeanours, then afraid of their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note n="*" place="margin">Seneca de Clem. lib. 1</note> 
               <hi>Verecundiam peccandi facit ipsa Clementia regentis;</hi> and Your Majesty has made so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an improvement of this excellent Maxime,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64909:4"/>
that methinks the Crimes could be no less, that could serve to manifest so Christian, and so Heroick a vertue.</p>
            <p>By Your gratious Pardon to your people, this Nation that has been for some unhappy years, and that through the particular guilt of a few, a general scandal to all her Neighbours, shall now become reconciled to the other obedient parts of the world, and wipe off a blemish, that such as were strangers to the true English nature, unjustly laid upon the whole. <note n="*" place="margin">Plin.

            <p>Let us therefore now celebrate our Countries Redemption, Joy and Dignity, and forget her old bondage, wounds, and afflictions.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64909:5"/>
Princes of the earth, endowed with all the true real ornaments and graces, that may render a Monarch feared, and adored of his own people, or make him an illustrious and unimitable president to all the future Rulers of mankind. A Prince nourisht and bred up in all the extreames of adverse Fortune, who by the great favor and assistance of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Providence, has victoriously run through all the threatning accidents of treacherous Designs, bloody Arms, deaf and tumultuous Seas, unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sickness, and what ever else may in the greatest malignity of force, or fortune, threaten or attempt the life of man.</p>

            <p>A Prince who has not only, and that fearless, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his magnanimous brest to all these; but which is more, and still more shining, even in the midst and fury of mischance, and in the lowest ebbe of his greatest necessities, through the purety of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and the constancy of his vertue, has defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself from the snares of insinuating policy, when drest in all the gaudy ornaments of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and disguis'd in all the subtilty of distorted reason. A Prince whom no allurements, no secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of His own endangered person, no reflections upon His immediate and clamorous wants, could ever draw from His firm pietie towards God, or from the Dignity and Majesty of His own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>

These tryals <hi>(Royal Sir)</hi> have made you thus superlatively eminent, and acquired not only the consent of all, even the worst of men, but have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also one Jewell more to the Crown, and given You a general and undisputed choyce, to Your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and hereditary succession. And these are those tryals that have approved You to be that good King, that other people pray their Kings may be, and have taught You to prize a lasting and immarcessible vertue, before all the unstable and fading glories of Crowns and Scepters. <note n="*" place="margin">Erasm: Ep. 17. lib, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ab hoc cardine praecipue pendet orbis faelicitas, si principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus maxime cordi fuerint, quae sunt optima.</hi> And it is from this natural and constant love to vertue, that wee expect a reformation of times and manners, and stedfastly hope (through a continued provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) that wee and ours shall see Your Majesties happy Throne established to all posterity. And doubtless that great and unerring Councel, that has stil had the conduct of all your Majesties affairs, saw this the fittest time to restore You to Your desolate people; for never yet was so great necessity of a good Prince, nor ever so good a Prince to supply so great a necessity. Never so distracted a face of men, and business, such confusions of Arms and Councels, such fears and jealousies, whisperings and expectations, every one ignorant of his distinct office, and few resolved upon their common duty: Nothing but clouds, and murmuring noise and fluctuation, shifting and unsetledness, while the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64909:6"/>
Actors themselves were amazed at all they did, neither knowing how nor why. But when the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running Phospher of Your Majesties bright, and so long miss'd day, The thrice Noble and ever to be recorded <hi>General</hi> appeared, and that the face of affairs began to unvaile it self, then the glorious and Majestick light even of Your dawning, so cheared the hearts of some, and illuminated the minds of others, that they all returned into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural channel of their duty, and ran with a smooth and untroubled current, to kiss and court those noble feet, which the violence of their giddy and intestine stormes had once tript up, and hurried the sacred Frame as a prey to the insensible Ocean.</p>
            <p>Neither was this an ordinary conflux of men either in respect of their number, or quality, but such an one as might rather seem to oppose, then secure Your way; and in a better sence serve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Your eye of the strength, and Your Princely heart of the Joy and Loyalty of this Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties now most happy Kingdom. <note n="*" place="margin">Plin.

No man now regards his danger, or suspects his safety; Every mans loyal love to his Prince, has overcome the fears he had of himself. We

look upon our selves now as under protection, and the protection of a King that can, and will protect us; A King that has vanquisht Danger, and fetter'd Mischance; A King that with his own victorious sword has cut through thousands of prevailing Enemies, and even in the miscarriage and treachery of an unfortunate day, remained a Conqueror, and won the hearts of those men, whose ill taught hands were exercised to an unnatural war against their own lawful Head.</p>

the subversion of what has ever been most dear to all good men in this life, to wit, Religion, Prince, Laws, and Country; disciplin'd to nothing but Blood and Rapine, Plunder and Insolence; till He (who is indeed the Glory of Military Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) taught a new Army a new lesson, appeased their fury, moderated their ambition, and reformed their riots. <note n="*" place="margin">Plin.

            <p>What things, with Your own courage, Your Kingdoms wealth, and Your Peoples fidelity, may Your Majesty not do? Secure Your Subjects at home, and enlarge Your Dominions abroad; repay injuries, reward friendships, and shake foreign Scepters, as well as defend Your own: Your cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency may nourish us, whilst Your arms chastise Your Enemies; and when Your Royal pleasure shall summon Your Subjects to the test, they who have smiled at Your misfortunes, may see that You can command, and that You govern men who dare and will obey.</p>

A Prince that grasps three Scepters in one hand, may conquer all he will, with both. Neither is there any thing so impossible to do, or so hard to suffer, that You have not already suffered, or done; and although Your Majesty cannot out-do Your self in the quality, yet You may increase the number of Your glorious actions, at your own generous choise.</p>
            <p>We have found Your Majesty a King through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in all Your trialls and misfortunes: Nothing in all your dangers, and calamities, unworthy Your birth, and greatness; no low addresses to Your flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Neighbors, no unprincely offers or unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehensions; no more abated with Your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than we find you elated with Your success, but constant and unshaken in all the stormes and violencies of fortune. <note n="*" place="margin">Plin.
