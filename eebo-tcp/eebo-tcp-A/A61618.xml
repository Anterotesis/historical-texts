            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>St. Luke xv. 18.</bibl>
                  <p>I will arise and go to my Father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the foregoing Verse, we find the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son so far awakened and <hi>come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> as to be sensible of the Miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he had brought himself into by his own folly and wickedness. But, before he came to this, there is a Remarkable Turn in the course of his Life, set down by our Saviour in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Excellent Parable. For, He was first very Impatient of being under the Wise Conduct of his Father, and thought he could manage his own affairs far more to his Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Satisfaction, if he were but permitted to use his Liberty, and were not so strictly tyed up to the Grave and Formal Methods of Living, observed and required in his Father's House. Which might pass for Wisdom in Age, and be agreeable enough to such whose Life and Vigour were decayed; and who were now to maintain their Authority over their Children by seeming to be so much wiser than they: But it is a rare


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51247:3"/>
thing for Youth and Age to agree in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wisedom: For it is not the Care, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the Judgment of a wise and tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that can allay the Heats, or calm the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or over-rule the Violent Inclinations of Youth; but whatever is cost them afterwards, some will be still trying the Experiment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it doth not more conduce to the happiness of Life to pursue their own Fancies and Designs, than to hearken to another's Directions (though a Father's) whose Circumstances are so much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their own. Thus our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our represents in the Parable this young Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, as weary of being rich and easie at Home, and fond of seeing the Pleasures of the World: and therefore nothing would satisfie him unless he were Intrusted with the Stock which was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for him, that he might shew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his Father's Conduct and his own.</p>
            <p>And this very soon appeared; for this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Manager had not been long abroad, <hi>but he wasted his substance with riotous living.</hi> And to make him the more sensible of his Folly, there happened a more than ordinary scarcity, which made his low and exhausted Condition more uneasie to him. But the Sense of Shame was yet greater with him than that of his Folly; and whatever shifts he underwent, he would by no


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51247:3"/>
means yet think of returning home; but rather chose to submit to the meanest and basest em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in hopes to avoid the Necessity of it. But at last, Reason and Consideration began to work upon him, which is called, <hi>his coming to himself:</hi> and then he takes up a Resolution to go home to his Father, and to throw himself at his Feet, to confess his fault ingenuously and freely, and to beg pardon for his former Folly, in hopes of Forgiveness and Reconciliation. <hi>I will arise and go to my Father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this Parable, our Saviour sets forth the state of a Sinner, (1.) In his wilfull degeneracy from God, his Father, both by Creation and Providence; his uneasiness under his just and holy Laws; his impatience of being restrained by them; his casting off the Bonds of Duty to him; and running into all kind of Disorders without regard to God, or his own Soul. (2.) In the dissatisfaction he found in his evil Courses; being very much disappointed in the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations he had in the Pleasures of Sin; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting his health, interest, reputation, estate, and above all, the Peace and Tranquillity of his Mind, which was more valuable than any other Delight whatsoever, and he now found impossible to be enjoy'd in a course of Rebellion against his heavenly Father. (3.) In the Conviction of his


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51247:4"/>
Folly upon due Consideration of what he had done; which is Emphatically called <hi>Coming to himself</hi>; having before acted so much below himself, and against himself; unworthy of the Relation he stands in to God; of those Faculties he had bestow'd upon him; and of those hopes and expectations he might have had from him either as to this or another World. (4.) In the Resolution he takes upon this Conviction, no longer to delay his purpose of Repenting and Returning home, but to embrace the present opportunity of doing it freely, heartily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, <hi>I will arise and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Having formerly in this Place, and on a like Occasion considered the Prodigal Son's <hi>coming to himself,</hi> I shall now pursue the Method of his Repentance in the <hi>Resolution</hi> he here takes <hi>to arise and go to his Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And therein I shall enquire into these things,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What Grounds a Sinner hath to incourage him to Repent; or to form such a Resolution in his Mind <hi>that he will arise and go to his Father,</hi> when he knows he hath so much provoked and offended him.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How necessary it is in order to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to form a fixed and steady Resolution to go through with it, <hi>I will arise and go,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What Grounds a Sinner hath to incourage him to Repent; or to make Application to his


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51247:4"/>
Father in order to Forgiveness, since he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he hath so justly offended him. For, if we consider the Circumstances here mention'd, he had no such Reason to hope to be receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Favour upon such easie Terms, as are here expressed; For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He had wilfully forsaken his Father's House, without any just Cause of Complaint of and hard usage there.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He had embraced such a Course of Life, which he knew was displeasing to him, living riotously and disorderly, in a way contrary to his Will.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He never thought of Returning home, till mere necessity forced him; till Hunger and Poverty made him <hi>come to himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what could be more disobliging to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than such Circumstances as these?</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) His Father never forced him from home, nor made his Condition uneasie there. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here represents Almighty God, as dealing with Mankind like a tender and indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not like a severe and hard Master; his Laws being intended for our Good, and not for his own Advantage. There is no Duty of ours towards God, or our selves, or others, but is founded on this Relation to God as a Father to Mankind. Nothing can be more reasonable in general than that the Father should order and


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51247:5"/>
direct his Children, and give such Rules which are fitting for them to observe; And if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the particular Laws of Nature, or the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Reason as to Good and Evil, we shall find them very agreeable to God's Paternal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>What is the Duty of Prayer to God, but asking daily Blessing of our heavenly Father? What is our Thanksgiving, but a solemn own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Paternal Care and Bounty towards us? And in these two, the main Duties of Natural Religion consist. The Neglect whereof, is such a disrespect to our Heavenly Father, as is not consistent with our believing him to be so. For, as God himself argues in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Malac. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>A Son hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oureth his Father, and a Servant his Master: If then I be a Father, where is mine honour? And if I be a Master, where is my Fear?</hi> God was a Father by the Right of Creation and Providence: but he was a Master to the <hi>Jews</hi> in respect of the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Law; and as there was a Spirit of Bondage on that account in them, which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to a more servile Fear; so there ought to have been a natural Spirit of Adoption to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God as their Supreme Creatour and Father; which should excite all men to such a dutifull Love, such a Reverential Esteem, such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Awe and Kindness as is in Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Parents. Yea, it ought to be much


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51247:5"/>
greater than that can be supposed; because the Distance is Infinite between God and us; and our Dependence more immediate and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and there is in him a Concurrence of all Perfections, which may cause in us the highest Esteem, and the humblest Adoration. There is an unquestionable Duty owing by Children to their earthly Parents,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>but how much rather</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>ought we to be in subjection to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits?</hi> The Fathers of our Flesh may be very Kind, but not Wise in their Love; or Wise and not so Kind; or they may be both Wise and Kind, but not Able to help their Children. They may love and pity, and pray for them, when they are in Misery, or Sickness and Pain, but after all, they are unable to relieve them; For the most indulgent Father, when his bowels yearn, and his heart is ready to break at the sight of a Child lying under the Agonies of Death, is not able to give a Moments Respite to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Pangs, which he can neither behold nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. But our heavenly Father hath not onely Infinite Wisdom, but Infinite Kindness and Power; and where all these are joined together, what Honour, what Love, what Fear is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him! Although there be defects in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet Children are still bound to obey them, and to shew a mighty regard and Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; but here it is so much otherwise,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51247:6"/>
that if we could conceive our selves without this Relation to God, yet his Perfections are so many, so great, so infinite, as to deserve and require our utmost Veneration. The Prodigal Son could then have no Reason to complain of the Duty which he owed to his Father.</p>
            <p>And was it not fit for him to appoint the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Family, and to expect that his Children should behave themselves therein, as became the Relation they stood in to himself and to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? That they should have a decent regard to themselves in Sobriety, Temperance, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Passions, and care of their Words; That they should behave themselves towards their Brethren with Sincerity, Kindness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; which comprehend all the Duties we owe to one another?</p>
            <p>And what now was there in all this, that the Prodigal could have any Cause to complain of, or that should make his Father's House so unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to him? But his Father had just Cause to be provoked, when his Wise Counsels, and Prudent Care, and Constant Kindness, and Righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were so much slighted and despised by a disobedient and ungratefull Son; who had so little Sense of his Duty or his Interest as to be weary of being so well at home, and therefore impatiently desiring to find out new methods of Living well, as he then thought, when the best


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51247:6"/>
Orders of his Father's Family were become so displeasing to him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) But what were these new and fine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for his own happiness? He began to suspect his Wife Father did not allow his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Liberty enough at home, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from him the great Mystery of the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life, and therefore concluded, that if he did give way to those Desires which he found to be Natural, but his Father thought Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he should enjoy much more Pleasure and Satisfaction than he did at home. And being resolved upon this, he gives way to those Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations he found strongest in himself, denies himself no Pleasures of Life, accounts Vertue but a Name which sowre and morose Persons put upon their own humours; and Religion but a Device for Fools to deceive themselves, and Knaves to deceive others by. And so he throws off all checks and restraints upon himself, and never regards the Good or Evil of what he doeth, for his Lusts are his Laws, and the satisfaction of them he now looks upon as the onely real Happiness of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And could any thing be supposed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to his Heavenly Father than such a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dissolute way of Living? So contrary to his Father's Will, to his own Reason, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51247:7"/>
Interest, Reputation; and which soon brought him to Shame and Misery?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) But that which added yet more to the height of the Provocation was, that he did not think of Returning home to his Father, upon the first apprehension of his own Folly; But he resolved to undergo any difficulty, and submit to any hardship, rather than doe what was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in order to Reconciliation with his Father.</p>
            <p>How hard a Matter then is it to bring an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Sinner to Repentance! It is not Easie to bring him to any due and serious Conviction of the Evil of his doings; but it is far more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to change the inward Disposition of the Mind, and to alter all the great Designs and Pleasures of Life. It is but a mean Notion of Repentance which is apt to prevail in the World, as though it implied no more than some Acts of Contrition for greater Sins, when the Habit and Disposition remain the same. But true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the turn of the whole Soul from the Love, as well as the Practice of Sin; and this is not a thing to be done easily or suddenly; A Sinner will bear a great many Checks and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of Conscience before he will part with his beloved Sins; he will struggle a great while with himself; and endure many Conflicts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an awaken'd Conscience and rooted ln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations before the Penitent Sinner can assure

               <note place="margin">Is. 55.8, 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this, we are to consider, not onely that our Blessed Saviour doth here lay the force and weight of the Parable upon the tenderness of a Father to his Son; but that he elsewhere argues from it in such a manner as to convince us that God hath far greater Pity and Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion towards Mankind when they make due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him, than Fathers can have towards their Children even when they ask for necessary sustenance.<note place="margin">Matt. 7.9, 10, 11.</note>

such Passions in Mankind as dispose them to doe good to others, by fixing such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on their minds of others Misery as doth excite them to doe what is fitting for their Ease and Support. And Compassion is not, as some imagine, such a mean and selfish Passion, as doth arise onely from the apprehension that we may suffer the same things our selves, which we pity others for; but it is a generous Sense of what others feel joined with a Readiness to help them according to our Power. And in this Sense, our Saviour not onely allows it in Fathers towards Children, but looks on it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in humane Nature in order to the good and advantage of Mankind; and therefore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self taking our Nature upon him is said <hi>to be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note>

            <p>But although this be allowable in humane Nature, how can such a thing as Compassion be attributed to the Divine Nature which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of such impressions and motions, which we are subject to?</p>
            <p>And yet the Scripture is very full and clear in attributing Pity and Compassion to Almighty God with Respect to his Creatures. The Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist saith,<note place="margin">Ps. 103, 8.</note>

               <hi>Like as a Father pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth his Children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi> And when the Prophet speaks of God's thoughts and ways being so much above Man's, it is for this end to prove thereby that God may shew more pity to Mankind, than they find in their hearts to shew to one another. <hi>Let him return unto the Lord,</hi>

But setting aside all this, the whole Scheme of the Gospel is drawn upon the Supposition of God's Pity and Compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Penitent Sinners; which is the Reason our Saviour insists so much on the Proof of it in this whole Chapter. Wherein we not onely reade of <hi>Joy in Heaven at the Repentance of a Sinner</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 7.10.</note> but the Compassion of God Almighty towards a Penitent Sinner is set forth with all the tenderness of an Indulgent Father running


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51247:9"/>
into the embraces of his Son, when he saw him at a distance coming towards him.</p>
            <p>What now is the meaning of all this? Are we to conceive of God as one like to our selves, who either do not see faults in those we love; or do not hate them, as we should do; or are too apt to pass them over; or are at first, it may be, apt to be angry upon a slight provocation, and then as easily made Friends upon as little Reason as we were made Angry? But none of these things ought to enter into our Minds concerning God with respect to the Follies of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And in this Case, if we will form in our Minds right and true Conceptions of the Divine Nature (as we ought to doe) we must have a great Care lest we attribute any thing to God, which looks like Weakness and Imperfection, as the Motions and Changes of Passions do; therefore to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his Pity and Compassion, and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Penitent Sinners, we must first know what his Anger and Displeasure against Sinners mean.</p>
            <p>Some think that <hi>Epicurus</hi> did in earnest believe a God,<note place="margin">Lact. <hi>de Ira Dei. c.</hi> 4.</note> but he was therefore forced to deny Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, because he could not conceive that the Government of the World could be managed without such resentments as were inconsistent with the complete happiness of the Divne Being; and therefore he rather chose to make him Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51247:10"/>
and Easie, than Active and liable to Passion. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> attributed to God all that was Good and Kind and Obliging; but would by no means endure that ever he should be said to be Angry or Displeased; which Doctrine did in effect over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Providence with Respect to Moral Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as much as the <hi>Epicureans.</hi> For if God did not regard the difference of Mens Actions, but was equally kind to them whether they did Good or Evil, such a Providence would have as little Influence on Mens Lives as if there were none at all. We must then suppose, if we would uphold Religion and Morality in the World, not onely that there is a Providence, but that God hath a different regard to Men according to the Good or Evil of their Actions. The Regard he hath to Men for being Good and doing Good is called his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Kindness,</hi> his <hi>Good-will,</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi>; that which he hath to things that are Evil is called his Hatred; that which he hath to Persons for doing Evil is his <hi>Anger, Wrath, Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Indignation</hi>; according to the different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Circumstances of their Evil Actions.</p>
            <p>But in order to the preventing any false or mean Apprehensions of the Divine Nature, when the Passions of Mankind are attributed to it, we must consider these two things;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51247:10"/>(1.) That we must by no means attribute to God any thing that is unreasonable in our Selves; such are all irregular Motions, which we call violent Passions, arising from Surprise, Mistake, Inadvertency, Weakness, or corrupt Inclination. But setting all these aside, the Original Passions of Mankind, which are agreeable to Reason, are no other than what arise from an Inclination to what we judge to be Good, and an Aversion from what we apprehend to be Evil; which holds as to the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That there is an observable Difference in the very Nature of some Passions, which imply a Repugnancy in themselves to the Divine Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which others do not. For Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Joy, and Inward Satisfaction have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them supposing their Object Good, but what agrees with the Divine Nature; but the Passions contrary to these, as Envy, Ill-will and Revenge are not onely Repugnant as Passions, but in their own Nature; for God cannot Envy the Good of his Creatures, nor bear Ill-will to them as such, nor take Pleasure in their Torments. And of this Nature <hi>Anger</hi> properly taken is, as it doth imply a present Disorder and Disturbance within, from the Apprehension of some Injury done or intended, with a Desire of Revenge on those who doe it; all which is inconsistent with


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51247:11"/>
the necessary Perfections of God; for they argue Meanness, Imperfection and Mutability.</p>
            <p>We must therefore fix on such a Notion of Anger as becomes the Almighty Wisdom and Goodness; and that lies in,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A Displeasure against the Sinner on the account of his Sins; For God cannot have any Complacency in those who displease him, as all Sinners do, whether they design it or not.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) A Will to Punish Sinners according to their demerits; which being according to the Rules of Wisdom and Righteous Government, cannot be said to argue an indecent Passion.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Actual Execution of his Justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great Provocations. And so God is said to be angry when he punishes; especially when he doeth it suddenly and severely; As Men in their Passion are wont to doe. But whatever God doeth in this kind, he doth it with the Wisdom and Temper of a Judge, and not with the Fury or Passion of an Angry Being.</p>
            <p>And there is nothing in all this unbecoming the Divine Nature, but very agreeable thereto. And this is all which in strictness of Reason is


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51247:11"/>
understood by God's being <hi>Angry</hi> with Mankind. For we must never imagine that God acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to sudden heats and Passions; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth is according to the Counsels of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom and Goodness.</p>
            <p>I do not deny that the Scripture doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Anger</hi> in God as if it were a Passion raised upon great Provocation, and capable of being laid by Submission and true Repentance. Thence we read, of <hi>God's Wrath waxing hot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32.10.</note> 
               <hi>of his Anger kindling against his People,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Is. 5.26. Jon. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>and his turning away from his fierce Anger,</hi> and many such Expressions; but so we read of the <hi>Fire</hi> of his <hi>Indignation,</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> of his <hi>Wrath,</hi> the <hi>Stretching forth of his Hand</hi>; which all grant are not to be literally understood. lf then in these Expressions, the Perfections of the Divine Nature are to be our Rule, according to which we must interpret them, because the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral sense implies an incongruity to the Divine Perfections which are all wholly Spiritual; then from the same Reason we must remove all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations from it which are as inconsistent with the absolute Perfection of it, as <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> are, although they are all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in Scripture.</p>
            <p>From whence we justly infer, that there is a wonderfull Condescention to the ordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and common Apprehensions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51247:12"/>
in the Language of Scripture, concerning the Divine Nature, which makes deeper impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on meaner understandings, and those who are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of finer thoughts will see Cause to attribute onely such a Sense of things relating to God, as is consistent with his Infinite and Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But what now shall we say to this Tenderness and Compassion of God towards Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Can he be moved by our Trouble and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Acts of Contrition for our Sins? If we be Righteous what doth it profit the Almighty? And if we be Evil, how can it hurt him? And if when we have Sinned, we Repent, we doe no more than is fitting for us; but why should we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Great and Wise God should have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion upon us, when we become sensible of our own Folly? For when we sin against God, wilfully, deliberately, knowingly, habitually, we doe what lies in us to provoke him to Wrath and Indignation against us; we reject his Wise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we slight his righteous Laws, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the pleasing our corrupt Inclinations and sensual Lusts before our Heavenly Father. And what can be more provoking to him than to be so despised by one who had his Being and all the Comforts of Life from him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51247:12"/>Suppose now such a Disobedient, Rebellious Son, as here in the Parable, be made sensible of his folly, is his Father bound to receive him? Was it not his own choice to go from him? If he hath suffered by his Folly, he may thank himself for it; and if his Father lets him alone in it, he hath no Cause to Complain.</p>
            <p>But such was the tenderness of the Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Repenting Son, that he shew'd the greatest Compassion imaginable; for he did not stay at home expecting his Son's solemn submission before his Family, but <hi>he ran towards him, and fell upon his Neck, and kissed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Conceptions now ought we to have of God's Compassion towards Penitent Sinners an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to all this? This I shall endeavour to clear in these Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That God's hatred is not primarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Persons who are his Creatures; but against that which is Evil, which is none of his making; and against Persons onely so far as they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Evil. <hi>Thou lovest Righteousness, and hatest wickedness,</hi> saith the Psalmist.<note place="margin">Psal. 45.7.</note> God hates nothing for its own sake, but Sin; and for the sake of that <hi>he hates all Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51247:13"/>(2.) There may be Good-will towards the Person of a Sinner at the same time when God discovers the hatred of his Sins. I do not say, God takes any Pleasure in him while he goes on in Sin, for that is against the Eternal Rules of Righteousness in God; but that he may have so much Good-will towards him, as to design to reduce him from his Evil Ways. And this every Father finds in himself towards a disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Son; while he hates his evil Courses, yet he would make use of the best Methods to bring him to himself, and to his Duty. And upon this is grounded that <hi>Love and Kindness of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mankind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.4.</note> in sending his Son to be our Saviour, and all the Promises and Invitations which are made to Sinners in the Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is very agreeable to Infinite Wisdom and Goodness for God to shew himself full of Pity and Compassion towards Penitent Sinners, <hi>i. e.</hi> so as to forgive them their former Sins, and to receive them into his Favour. For Pity and Compassion in God is to be judged, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inward Motions we find in our selves, but according to these Two things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51247:13"/>(1.) A readiness to doe Good to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to their Necessities. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, is his <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; but considered with Respect to the Persons of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is his <hi>Clemency,</hi> or readiness to forgive; and with Respect to the <hi>Punishment</hi> they deserve by their Sins, it is his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Pity:</hi> Which in us is <hi>Aegritudo ex Miseriâ alterius,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Misericordia,</hi> because the Heart is touched with the Sense of another's Misery; but we are not so to apprehend it in God; but that such is the Goodness of God towards Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sinners, that he is as willing to shew Mercy as they are to Repent.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) God's Pity and Compassion lies in the proper Effects of it; which here in the Case of the Prodigal were, passing by his former Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances, and receiving him into as much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as if he had not gone astray.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 24.32.</note> 
               <hi>This is my Son was dead, and is alive again; was lost, and is found.</hi> Those who think, they stand not in need of so much Pardoning Mercy as others do, are apt to repine at the Favour shew'd to great Sinners when they Repent; And therefore the Elder Brother could not bear the expressing so much kindness towards such a disobedient Son, though


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51247:14"/>
now a Penitent. But that there is nothing disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to Infinite Wisdom and Goodness in such Compassion towards Penitent Sinners, will more fully appear, if we consider,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That God is not bound to deal with Sinners according to the utmost Rigour and Severity of his Justice. Because he is under no fatal Necessity; no Superiour Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may act freely in the forgiving Offenders as seems best to his Infinite Wisdom. The whole Race of Mankind is a perpetual Evidence that God doth not Act according to the Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Justice, for <hi>if he had dealt with them after their Sins, or rewarded them according to their Iniquities; their Spirits would have failed before him, and the Souls which he had made</hi>; they had been long since destroy'd from the face of the Earth, and not suffer'd to continue in their Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. But God hath not onely forborn Sinners long when he might justly have punished them; but he gives them many real Blessings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life, freely and bountifully. Now if God deal so Mercifully with Sinners while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue such, is there not greater Reason to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he will be far more so, when they cease to be such?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51247:14"/>(2.) A Penitent Sinner doth what in him lies to vindicate God's Honour. I do not say, he can make satisfaction to Divine Justice; for that is impossible for him to doe; and God hath provided for that by his own Son, whom he hath made <hi>a Propitiation for the Sins of the World.</hi> But a true Penitent takes all the Shame and Dishonour to himself; he clears the Justice of God's Government, and the Equity of his Laws, and owns himself guilty of unspeakable Folly in his Disobedience. <q>O how justly, saith he, might God have taken me away in the midst of my Sins, when my Conscience checked me for my Sins, and yet I had no heart to repent of them! When I could not but see my danger, and yet was unwilling to come out of it. I can never be sufficiently thankfull for so great a Mercy as his bringing me to my Self hath been; I had gon on in the same secure, stupid, senseless condition, that others lie in, if he had not throughly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd me, and roused me out of my Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent State. How dreadfull had my Condition for ever been, if my first awakening had been in the Flames of Hell? Nothing but Infinite Goodness and Patience would have waited so long for the Repentance of such an Offender


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51247:15"/>
as I have been. I have sinned so often, that I am ashamed to think of the Number of my Transgressions; so deeply, that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the thoughts of them; so foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I am unworthy to be called thy Son, who have acted so unlike thy Children (so the Prodigal Son here speaks to his Father) And if thou wouldst admit me but to the meanest Condition of thy Servants, I shall ever esteem it as the greatest privilege of my Life, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to serve Thee for the future, though in the lowest Capacity.</q> Thus the Repenting Prodigal goes on, <hi>v.</hi> 19. And in a sutable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner every true Penitent behaves himself towards God with great Humility, and a deep Sense of his own unworthiness; and is thereby rendred more capable of Divine favour.<note place="margin">Jam. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>For God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> And therefore it is very agreeable to Infinite Wisdom and Goodness to shew pity towards a truly Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Penitent Sinner;<note place="margin">Ps. 51.17.</note> 
               <hi>For a broken and contrite heart he will not despise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If God were not so full of Compassion to Penitent Sinners, there would have been no ln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for Sinners to Repent; but they must have sunk into everlasting Despair. For if God should forgive none that sin, then all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51247:15"/>
must be condemned to Eternal Misery; for <hi>all have sinned</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.23. Eccl. 7.20.</note> and <hi>there is not a Just Man upon Earth who sinneth not</hi>; and so the best and worst, and all sorts of Sinners must here suffer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which would have taken away all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such thing as Mercy and Clemency in God towards Mankind. But if we set bounds to it as to some particular kinds and degrees of sinning; we limit that which is Infinite; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what we know not, <hi>viz.</hi> how far God's Mercy doth extend; we destroy the Power of Divine Grace in Changing and Reforming the Worst of Men. But the Scripture hath recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded some remarkable Instances of great Sinners, who have been great Penitents, and upon that have been pardon'd (such as <hi>Manasses,</hi> and some others) that no Penitent Sinner might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the Work of Repentance. For a True Penitent searching to the bottom, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his Sins before him, with their several Aggravations, can be kept from Despair by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than the Infinite Mercy of God to those who truly Repent.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Because there is nothing so provoking in Sin, as obstinate Impenitency, and Continuance in it.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51247:16"/>It is true, God hates all Sin for its own Sake; but not all equally; some Sins being of a higher Nature than others are; being against plainer Light, stronger Convictions, more easie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, stricter Obligations than others are; but yet it is the Temper of a Sinner's Mind, which is most provoking, when Sins are committed not through Infirmity, or sudden surprise, or a violent Temptation; but habitually, knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wilfully; especially when they are done in Contempt of God and his Laws, and with an obstinate Resolution to continue in the Practice of them. This is so provoking to God, that the chief Reason of the severe Punishments of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in another World is taken from thence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hates obstinate and impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.7.</note> 
               <hi>And thus he will by no means acquit the Guilty. There is a Sin unto death,</hi> saith St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5.16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>and there is a Sin not unto death.</hi> There is a Sin unto death, which <hi>Christ</hi> hath said he will never pardon;<note place="margin">Matt. 12.32.</note> and that is <hi>blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</hi>; a Sin which none who do truly own Christianity, are capable of committing.</p>
            <p>But is there then no <hi>Sin unto death</hi> to them? Yes, it is possible for Men who have clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions in their minds of the Truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to act so plainly, and wilfully, and directly against it, as either to provoke God to take them


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51247:16"/>
away by an extraordinary Judgment, and so it is properly <hi>a Sin unto death</hi>; or to withdraw his Grace from them, and leave them to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their own Hearts, and so it becomes a Sin unto a Spiritual death. But besides these Cases; Every Wilfull Sinner who adds Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to his Sin, commits <hi>the Sin unto death</hi>; because there is no other Condition of Pardon allow'd by the Gospel without True Repentance.</p>
            <p>How infinite is the Goodness of God that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no Sinners from the Hopes of Pardon who have a heart to repent sincerely of their Sins! And how just is God in the final Punishment of those Sinners, who still go on in their Sins, and refuse to Repent; after all the Invitations and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which are given them to that End! Can we in Reason suppose that God should stoop lower towards Sinners, than to offer them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of former Sins, if they do Repent; and to tell them they must Expect no Mercy in another World if they do not Repent?</p>
            <p>But suppose we are come thus far, that we are convinced we must Repent, what course and method must we take in order to it? Of this briefly, and so to conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I know no better than to follow the Example of the Prodigal Son here: and in the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51247:17"/>
first place to form a present, sincere, fixed and peremptory Resolution of doing it; <hi>I will arise and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c. If we suffer Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to cool upon our Minds, the force and spirit of them will soon be gone. It hath been of late observed by the strictest Enquirers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nature, that the beginnings of Life are very small, and hardly discernible. It is but as a spark that appears,<note place="margin">Harv. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erc.</hi> 16, 17, 18.</note> and may easily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished; but if it be incouraged by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual heat, a wonderfull Alteration soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the distinct parts begin to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; the first which is discerned is the Eye, but the Fountain of Life is in the Heart; and when the course of the Bloud is there setled, the other Parts come to their due formation with greater quickness. This may be a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Beginnings of Spiritual Life, that which answers to the Eye is the Conviction of the Mind, where the inward Change first appears; that which answers to the Heart is <hi>Resolution,</hi> and when that is fixed, a mighty Reformation will soon follow. But Spiritual Life as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is in its first beginnings a very nice and tender thing, it may be easily stopt, and very hardly recovered: It is therefore of very great concernment to keep up the Warmth of our first Resolutions, and to improve them into a


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51247:17"/>
present Practice agreeable thereto; as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son here did, who when he had Resolved upon it, <hi>did</hi> accordingly <hi>arise and go to his Father,</hi> v. 20.</p>
            <p>I do not think there are many Persons in the World who have Convictions upon their Minds of the Evil of their Ways; but do Resolve at one time or other before they die to Repent of their Sins, and to make their Peace with God. But alas! these are <hi>Ova subventanea,</hi> they make a fair appearance, but there is no principle of Life in them; or as St. <hi>Jude</hi> expresses it,<note place="margin">Jud. <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>they are Clouds without Water</hi>; of no Consistency, but <hi>carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with winds</hi>; hurried to and fro with the force and power of Temptations; and then their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions are like <hi>the Vapours</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> speaks of,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>which appear for a little Time, and then vanish away. Trees they are without fruit,</hi> as St. <hi>Jude</hi> goes on, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; not that make no shew or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Fruit; but it hath no such firmness and substance in it as to endure the nipping Frosts, and so it drops off, and withers away. Just such are the effects of faint and imperfect Resolutions, they never hold out long, and onely aggravate the Sins committed after them. For every such Sin is a plain sin against Conscience; or else they would never have made any Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it. And those who continue to sin


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51247:18"/>
after Resolutions against their Sins, not onely lose all the Peace and Comfort of their Minds, but make it much harder for them, either to make or trust their Resolutions again, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to be satisfied of the Sincerity of their Repentance.</p>
            <p>If we would then lay a sure Foundation for the Satisfaction of our Minds in a matter of such unconceivable Moment as the Truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is, let us call our Selves to an Account as to this matter of the firm Purpose and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our Minds. Have we strictly examin'd our Selves as to our particular Sins? For there is no Age, no Imployment, no Condition of Life but hath its Temptations belonging to it; which require not onely our Care and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but Resolution to keep us from them. But suppose we have been overcome by <hi>the Sin which doth so easily beset us</hi>; the Work is harder to recover the Ground we have lost, than at first to maintain it; but if we have sinned, we must Repent; and the sooner the better; but it is not to be done without awakening the drousie and benummed Faculties of our Minds, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the secret and hidden Powers therein. Not as though this were to be done without the Grace of God preventing and assisting us; but because <hi>God worketh in us to will and to doe of his


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51247:18"/>
good Pleasure,</hi> we ought <hi>to Work out our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then trifle no longer in a Work we can never doe too well, nor too soon; nor go about it with too much Resolution. It is the want of this, which ruins such a Number of those who would fain go to Heaven, but have not Courage and Resolution enough, to own their Repentance, and to break off their former Sins: They are half Penitents; they are inwardly troubled for them, and wish themselves able to withstand the next Temptation; but when it comes, they yield and suffer themselves to be drawn away,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his Life.</hi> Now in such Cases, Resolution is not onely a convenient and proper thing; but a very Wise thing. For, when once a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is found to be serious, and in good earnest, the former Companions in Wickedness will leave off to solicit; and if once a Penitent Sinner can endure to be despised, and exposed for a time by Evil Men for owning his Repentance, he will find the other parts of his Change grow more easie to him; and the Devil's Instruments in Tempting will be like himself; <hi>i. e.</hi> they will give over Tempting when they see no hopes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. And let no Men ever complain that they want Power to break off their former Sins, till


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51247:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have tried what the strength of a Vigorous Resolution will doe. But because we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Reason to suspect our selves, let us make our Devout Applications to Almighty God to give us the Assistence of his Grace through the onely Mediation of his Son <hi>Jesus Christ. To whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
