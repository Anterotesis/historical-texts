            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Parents having ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
me to be a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Physitian, thought fit
to make me begin the Studies
thereof by learning <hi>Chirurgery,</hi>
probably thinking I might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
acquire a better knowledge
of Mans Body, and its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts, together with their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as also its outward (at least)
Indispositions and Cures, than by
only reading such Treatises of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siologie</hi>
as were then extant, which
<hi>Modern Anatomists</hi> and other <hi>Authors</hi>
have since found defective.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106267:3"/>
But in the performance of their
just desires I found no small incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
for want of some short
and compendious Principles,
that might give me the Grounds,
and an <hi>Idea</hi> of that Art, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
to my then mean Capacity,
almost frighted with the bulk of
large and ill digested Volumes;
but there being no Remedy, I was
fain to compile out of them this
small Treatise, which I have since
reviewed altering some obsolete
<hi>Theorems</hi> into new ones, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some small agreements to
render its Reading less tedious;
And all for my own use without
any thoughts of ever troubling the
Press therewith. These late
years having brought forth seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
short Treatises of <hi>Chirurgery,</hi>
specially the excellent Principles
<pb facs="tcp:106267:3"/>
of <hi>Barbetty</hi> and <hi>Hornius,</hi> the former
whereof is lately made <hi>English:</hi>
but finding in mine some things,
which are purposely omitted in
theirs, as few dislike their own
Productions, I have resolved to
make this short <hi>Compendium</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
wishing that it may be to the
advantage of young Beginners in
<hi>Chirurgery,</hi> and to the Health and
Welfare of their Patients.</p>

four others to be subservient; for as

the sourish Vapors of the <hi>acid</hi> in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
which do gently <hi>Vellicate</hi> its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<hi>Thirst</hi> is the want of moisture.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Concoction</hi> three others are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.</p>

The two first whereof, together with

which take thus.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Arteries</hi> begin to swell, as

where they remain, when the

               <p>
                  <hi>Generation</hi> is a <hi>Function, whereby a

the Brood of an animal, whereunto they

grosser particles, do not enter in the
<hi>Pineal Glandule (Steno</hi> having shewed

some (yet unknown) more convenient
place of the Head, whence they sally out

into the Nerves, where they have
a power (which the learned <hi>Willis</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Muscles, and so move the whole
Body.</p>
               <p>To this manner of moving <hi>Respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

It kindleth sometimes the Humours so
much, that it makes them apt to receive
a sharp volatile Salt, which is thought
the cause of <hi>putrid Feavers,</hi> and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

                  <p>The <hi>fourth,</hi> when they do decrease.</p>
                  <p>They are commonly termined in four
manners, namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. By <hi>Resolution.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Suppuration.</item>

which is worst of all.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Signs of resolution are an itching
of the diseased part, with the slacking
of <hi>Pulsation, Tension, Heat,</hi> and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                  <p>Those of <hi>Suppuration</hi> are the greatness
and vehemency of the Feavour, <hi>pain, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
and <hi>heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>diminution</hi> of swelling and pain,
and a hardness left in the affected part do
<hi>indicate</hi> its <hi>Induration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:106267:34"/>
And when the accidents of <hi>heat, pain,
pulsation</hi> and <hi>tension</hi> are greater, than
they use to be in <hi>Suppuration;</hi> when
the pain ceaseth suddenly, without any
manifest cause, if the part grows <hi>livid</hi>
and <hi>blackish,</hi> and lastly if it <hi>stinkes, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green</hi>
is more than fully signified.</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Indication</hi> in the Cure of all
<hi>Impostumes,</hi> is the prohibiting of <hi>Fluxion</hi>
by <hi>repelling</hi> and <hi>intercepting</hi> Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is an <hi>evacuation</hi> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
causing it, whether it be by <hi>resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
repulsion</hi> or <hi>suppuration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be caused by <hi>Congestion,</hi> then the
part is to be <hi>corroborated,</hi> and the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<hi>corrected;</hi> taking alwayes the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
from the most urgent.</p>
                  <p>We ought in this <hi>Cure</hi> to observe three
things, namely,</p>
                  <p>Whether the matter causing the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume</hi>
be ready to <hi>Flow, Floweth,</hi> or is
yet <hi>Impacted</hi> in the diseased part.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of all <hi>Impostumes,</hi> we
ought alwayes to use <hi>repelling</hi> Remedies,
unless it be,</p>
                  <p>1. When the matter is <hi>venenous, thick,
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> being but the <hi>Helper</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> ought chiefly in the <hi>increase,

what she aimeth at, whether it be

by an external Instrument, in any

                  <p>Their <hi>Causes</hi> are all such things as
may violate the outward circumference

it; and they are either animated, as the

                  <p>The general <hi>indication</hi> in the Cure of

wherein the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> ought
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106267:39"/>
to be furnished with five Intentions.</p>
                  <p>The first whereof is to extract all
strange Bodies, as <hi>Bullets, Darts, Arrows,
Splinters,</hi> &amp;c. if any do hinder the
Wounds agglutination.</p>
                  <p>The second, to bring the divided ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
together.</p>
                  <p>The third, to keep them so.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, to preserve the wounded
parts temperature.</p>
                  <p>The fifth to correct such accidents as
may fall out.</p>
                  <p>The first of these <hi>intentions</hi> is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either with the Fingers, or some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Instrument, at the first dressing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the extraction of the foresaid things
might occasion an <hi>Hemoragy,</hi> or some
other dreadful accident; for then the
safest is to leave their expulsion to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but since it may sometimes not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
be advanced by Medicaments, take
this following description.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> The Root of Iris of Florence, of
Panacis and Capers, of each three Drachms,
round Aristaloch, Manna and Frankincense,
of each one Drachm, beat them to a powder,
and incorporate them with Honey of Roses,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106267:40"/>
and Turpentine of Venice, of each two
Ounces. Make a Salve thereof.</p>
                  <p>The second and third <hi>intention</hi> in the
Cure of wounds are performed in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and maintaining together their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
by Bandages and Sutures; of
the first whereof there is three sorts,
namely,</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Incarnative,</hi> which is adapted
to simple Wounds, and is composed of
two heads, beginning from the part op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Wound, and proceeding
towards it.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Expulsive,</hi> which consisteth but of
one head, beginning from the bottom of
the Wound upwards to its Orifice.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Retentive,</hi> which is destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to fasten Topical Remedies, and is
made according to the figure of the part
which is to be bound.</p>
                  <p>There are several sorts of <hi>Sutures,</hi> but
of the <hi>Agglutinatives</hi> the most approved
is made with a needle held in the Right
Hand of the Chirurgeon, wherewith he
traverseth the two sides of the VVound,
opposing a pierced Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lle, held in the
Left Hand to the point of the Needle,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106267:40"/>
which passeth through it, with its
Thread, whereon is made a double
knot, cutting the thread a little above it,
and thence it is proceeded to the other
stitches, remembring always to make
the first stitch in the midst of the wounds
length.</p>
                  <p>There is also another <hi>Suture</hi> called <hi>Dry,</hi>
fit for wounds in the Face, and is made by
clinging some pieces of Linnen upon it,
which are, being dry, brought together
with threads pierced through them.</p>
                  <p>The third necessary <hi>Sature</hi> is like to
that, which Skinners make in sowing
their Skins together, and is appointed
for the Bowels and Gutts, when they
receive any hurt.</p>
                  <p>The others I think needless to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
these being doubtless the best,
whereunto the ingenious Artist may add
what he thinks fit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>temperature</hi> of the affected part
is preserved by a good Diet, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
use of the Universal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>The first of these ought to be cold and
moist, till the time obnoxious to acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
be passed. Spiced and salt meats
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106267:41"/>
are hurtful; the Patient must drink
Barley water, in stead of Wine; and
wholly abstain from any violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mind.</p>
                  <p>The most usual universal Remedies
are <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> and <hi>Purgation,</hi> which hav<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
virtue to refresh, divert and expel the
humours, that might prove burthensom
to the diseased part.</p>
                  <p>Amongst accidents, the most <unclear>urgent</unclear>
is a too great flux of Blood, which <unclear>must</unclear>
be carefully prevented, since it is <unclear>the</unclear>
Treasure of Life and Strength.</p>
                  <p>It is performed by <hi>astringent, refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>agglutinative</hi> Remedies: As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> Sealed Earth, and Bole Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
of each half an Ounce, Frankincense
Mastick, Myrrhe and Aloes, of each tw<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Drachms, Flying Flower, one Ounce. Make
a powder to be applyed with the Yolk of an
Egg well beaten.</p>
                  <p>If then Blood cannot be restrained in
this manner, the <hi>Vein</hi> or <hi>Artery</hi> must be
prest with the Thumb, till a <hi>Thrumbus</hi> be
made; but if that sufficeth not, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vessel ought to be bound, and this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106267:41"/>
yet not prevailing, we are to use <hi>Escaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides;</hi>
as are <hi>Burnt powder of Vitriol, and
of Mercury, with a portion of pure burnt
Alum,</hi> leaving the Scars full to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The last Remedy is the cutting off the
flowing Vessel, that its Extremities,
withdrawing in the Flesh, the same
may stop its flowing. But all these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
will doubtless come out of use as
soon as the <hi>Stiptick Elixir,</hi> to be bought
at Doctor <hi>Williams</hi>'s, his Majesties Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
will be known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pain,</hi> being commonly the cause of
much weakness and fluxion to the
wounded part, the sedation of it ought
to be carefully procured by expelling
and lenitive Remedies, such as is the
following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> Diacalcitheos Plaister, four

and Compresses in <hi>Oxicraton</hi> (Water <hi>and</hi>

Recipe, <hi>Oyl of Roses and Myrrhe, as much
as needs, and with a white of an Egg make
an irrigation.</hi> But if the pain continueth
and is too intense, we must with some
precaution use <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> whereof here
is a Description.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> The leaves of Henbane, and
Poppy roasted under the Ashes, of each three
Ounces, Hogs grease and Oyl of Roses, of each
one Ounce, Saffron two Scruples. Make a
Cataplasm.</p>
                  <p>There is often joyned to pain another
Symptom, called <hi>Convulsion,</hi> which is
defined a forced contraction of the
<hi>Muscles</hi> towards their <hi>Origin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is of two sorts,

<hi>Species;</hi> namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tetonos,</hi> when the whole Body stands
stiff, without being able to incline it
self.</p>
                  <p>The second is called <hi>Opisthotonos,</hi> when
it is forced backward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106267:42"/>
And the third <hi>Emprosthotonos,</hi> when it
is contracted forward.</p>
                  <p>A particular <hi>Convulsion</hi> is when the
<hi>Eye,</hi> the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or any other part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
with <hi>Muscles</hi> is contracted, or

                  <p>The Causes are <hi>Repiction, Emptiness</hi>

                  <p>That which cometh of <hi>Pain</hi> is Cured
by Remedies contrary to the cause of it,
and if it be poysonous, the wound must
be instantly amplified, that the matter
impacted may flow. And this <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacon</hi>
poured into the Wound, <hi>viz.
Treacle</hi> and <hi>Mithridate</hi> dissolved in
<hi>Strong water,</hi> in a sufficient quantity with
a little <hi>Mercurial Powder. Scarified Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings</hi>
are also very useful to extract vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
matter, taking care likewise that
the Patient, in that <hi>Symptom,</hi> have not
his Mouth fast contracted, lest he bites
off his own Tongue, as it often falls out,
but may conveniently be prevented, by
an Instrument called <hi>Speculum Oris,</hi>
which ought therefore alwayes to be at
hand.</p>
                  <p>Next to <hi>Convulsion,</hi> a <hi>Palsy</hi> ought to be
prevented, and cured.</p>
                  <p>It is defined, <hi>A Mollification of the
Sinews, with the privation of Motion and
Sense,</hi> not indeed of the whole Body, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106267:43"/>
commonly of one side. Its <hi>Causes</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>inward,</hi> as the humours of either
<hi>Ventricle,</hi> and especially <hi>Phlegm</hi> obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the progress of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi>
through the <hi>Sinews;</hi> or <hi>outward,</hi> as
<hi>Falls, Blows,</hi> and such other <hi>Accidents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is Cured by <hi>Diet</hi> and <hi>Purgation,</hi>
whereunto the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Indian wood,</hi>
will be very profitable, with this <hi>Topical</hi>
Remedy of <hi>Faventinus.</hi>

                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> Oyl of Laurel and Turpentine,

Petroleum, of each an Ounce, Malvesie,
four Ounces, Strong-Water two Ounces, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
Pepper, Mustard-seed, Iuniper seed, Ivy,
and Anacardium, pure Laudanum, of each
an Ounce and half. Let all be pounded
and mixed with Wine and Olives,
let them boyl in a double Vessel till the
Wine be consumed, a strong expression be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made, add Galbanum, Bdelium, Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,
Myrrhe, Castoreum, Bear, Duck, and
Storks Grease, of each two ounces. Make a
Salve in the Form of a Liniment, whereunto
a little Wax if needs be, may be added.</p>
                  <p>Exercise and Frictions are also very
powerful to awake the part affected,
and cause the motive Spirits to flow in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:106267:44"/>
There is another accident, when the
Patient either by weakness, proceeding
from the loss of Blood, poysonous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
or the sight of dreadful Objects,
falls into frequent Swounds.</p>
                  <p>It is discerned, 1. When <hi>Paleness</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades
the Face, with a <hi>Cold Sweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If a <hi>Coldness</hi> of the whole <hi>Body</hi> be
perceived.</p>
                  <p>3. And if the Party do <hi>suddenly Fall,</hi>
when it is in the <hi>Paroxysme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is prevented by casting cold Water
in the Diseased's Face; but if it proceeds
from too great <hi>Evacuation,</hi> the Patient
must be softly <hi>collected</hi> on the Ground,
or on his Bed, and a little <hi>Bread</hi> dipped
in <hi>VVine</hi> given him to taste, whereat the
Spirits may return. But if it proceeds
from <hi>Poysonous Vapours,</hi> Let the Patient
drink out of a Spoon a little <hi>Treacle</hi>
and <hi>Mithridate</hi> dissolved in <hi>VVine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which comes of <hi>Fear,</hi> is easily
cured, the <hi>Object</hi> being removed, with
encouraging and comfortable <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The loss of <hi>Blood, Pain,</hi> and <hi>Feaver,</hi>
whereunto Wounds are subject, do often
distract the Patient, in a temporary
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106267:44"/>
Phrensy called <hi>Delirium,</hi> which is defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>A tempor ary perturbation of the Phansy,
and other mental Functions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the Causes above mentioned,
<hi>poysonous Vapours,</hi> and a <hi>Lesion</hi> of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme</hi>

with the <hi>Brain,</hi> by the <hi>Nerves</hi> of the
sixth <hi>Conjugation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it proceeds from an <hi>Obstruction of the
Spirits,</hi> the same <hi>Remedies</hi> must be used,
as when the Body is subject to <hi>Swounding,</hi>
but if it coms from an <hi>Inslammation of the

<hi>Herbs,</hi> and a knot of <hi>VVhite-poppy

                  <head>Of Wounds made by Fire Armes.</head>
                  <p>THE Industry of men ever clear
sighted to their own destruction,
having for about 200 yeares since, found
out a very speedy way to it, namely
Gun-powder, and fire-armes; Whose
hurts being often waited on by other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
it obligeth us to treat especially
of their Curation.</p>
                  <p>They are either simple or composed,
with dilaceration, distemper, and tumor.
Their signs are commonly a round Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
little effusion of Blood, a swelling
of the part, and a greenish livid colour.</p>
                  <p>In the first apparel, the wound ought
to be dilated, if the wounded parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
can permit it, that unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Bodies if there be any, may be sought
out and expelled with the matter. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, if it be possible, the patient
must be scituated, as he was when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the wound. After the extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of strange Bodies, we must prevent
pain and fluxion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> by the repelling and lenitive
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106267:45"/>
Remedies above described, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplasme
appointed for its sedation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>last</hi> by Diet and Purgation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Clysters are commonly used, lest
Catharicks might cause too great an
agitation of Humours.</p>
                  <p>Thence we must proceed to Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in all other contused Wounds
whereunto that which is called digestive
and the following Oyl are most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
used.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> Oyl of Violets, four pound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
boyl two young Cats, new brought forth,
till the bones be loosed off, adding Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
duly prepared, one pound. Let them
boyl together on a slow fire, adding Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
of Venice, and strong-water, three Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
To be kept in a Glass, till there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to make use of it.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any danger of <hi>Gangrene,</hi>
we use profitably of <hi>Egyptiacum</hi> dissolved
in <hi>Wine, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the wound is brought to <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration</hi>
detersive Medicaments must be
applyed, such as is the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106267:46"/>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> Water of boyled Barley, the juice
of Plantain, Parsley, Agrimony, and of the
lesser Centory, of each an Ounce, let them
all boyl together, and in the end of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
add Turpentine of Venice, three
Ounces, Hony of Roses, two Ounces, flower of
Barley, three Ounces, Saffron, one Scruple.
Mix all together, and make a cleansing
Oyntment.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, having care to prevent other
accidents according to Art, the Wound
must be brought to a perfect Cure and
Sanation.</p>

                  <head>Of Gangrenes.</head>
                  <p>BUT since <hi>Gangrene</hi> is often a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
of Wounds, made by
<hi>Fire-Armes,</hi> and other <hi>Contusions,</hi> it will
not be amiss here to expound its Nature,
Signs and Curation.</p>
                  <p>It is defined, <hi>The mortification of a part
affected with inflammation.</hi> And is only
distinguished from a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> by the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106267:46"/>
more or less, this last being only when
the part is quite mortified and dead. The
onely Remedy being then its <hi>Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The general Cause of <hi>Gangrene,</hi> is a
corruption of the parts natural Heat, by
Cold, external Heat, want of Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
stopping of <hi>Transpiration,</hi> or by
the dreadful effects of some poysonous
substance.</p>
                  <p>Its proceeding is two-sold, either with
some humours in flowing, or without it.</p>
                  <p>We have deduced the signes of it in
the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Impostumes.</hi> And for its
Curation, since that which hath its
<hi>origin</hi> from the second cause is the most
general, and may in some measure be a
Rule for Curing the rest, Take these
following Precepts.</p>
                  <p>If the Body be in the least <hi>Plethorical,
Phlebotomy</hi> and <hi>Purgation</hi> being celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the <hi>Air</hi> by Nature or Art, ought
to be cold and dry, and the Patients diet
of the same temper.</p>
                  <p>Amongst <hi>Topical Remedies, Egyptiacum</hi>
boyled with some <hi>Aloes</hi> in salted Water,
adding a little Strong Water in the end,
is deservedly much esteemed; as also
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106267:47"/>
the <hi>Phadagenick</hi> water, or the <hi>Gray Salve,</hi>
which is made by adding a Drachm of
corroding <hi>Sublimate</hi> to an Ounce of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silicon,</hi>
in the mean time, to defend the
Body from the Influxion of <hi>Morbisical
Humors,</hi> and putrid Vapours, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
defensive may be applyed on the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
part, and often renewed.</p>

and Housleek, of each two Ounces,
the whites of Eggs, five; Bole Armeny and
Sealed Earth reduced in a subtil powder,
of each an Ounce, with as much Oxycraton
as is needful.</p>
                  <p>If it be too <hi>Intense,</hi> and yeilds not to
<hi>Catharticks</hi> and <hi>Topical Remedies,</hi> we are
obliged to use actual <hi>Causticks.</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Fracture</hi> is defined, <hi>A solution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity
in the Bones;</hi> and its Causes are
all such things as may break, cut, bruise,
and quash; whereby are also to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood

Their differences are manifold; for
some are termed <hi>perfect,</hi> others <hi>imperfect,</hi>
some are <hi>simples,</hi> others <hi>composed</hi> with <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moragy,
inflammation, gangrene,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They receive a common difference
from their figures, <hi>long, transverse, strait</hi>
or <hi>crooked.</hi> Whereunto are added, that
which is called in <hi>Greek Raphanidon,</hi>
when the bone is broken short in two
pieces; <hi>Cariedon,</hi> when it falls in small
Fragments loose from one another; and
<hi>Asphitidon,</hi> when it is ground small as
meal or flower.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fractures</hi> existence is known by a
vehement pain of the affected part, the
impotency of it, the change of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Figure, and chiefly by the vacuity
which appears to the fingers touching it.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Prognostick;</hi> in moist weather,
and in youth <hi>Fractures</hi> are sooner healed
than in dry weather and in old age; But
the precise time of the over-growing
<hi>Callus</hi> cannot be positively assertained,
that depending of the Body's, and <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Air's</hi> disposition, as also of the Bone's
thickness. Yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saies, the <hi>Nose</hi>
is glutinated in three days, the <hi>Iaws,</hi> the
<hi>Clavicles</hi> and <hi>Ribs</hi> in six, the <hi>Cubit</hi> in nine,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106267:52"/>
the <hi>Brachium</hi> in twelve, and the <hi>Tibia</hi> in
fifteen; Which may be a Rule for the
rest.</p>
                  <p>When the Bones are broken near the
Joynts, their motion is thereby rendred
stiff, and difficult, and if there be great
<hi>Contusions,</hi> the part loseth its motion,
and the Patient is in danger of Death.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of <hi>Fractures</hi> and <hi>Dislocations</hi>
being in many respects one and the same,
we shall speak joyntly of them both in
the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Dislocation</hi> therefore is defined, <hi>The
detrasion of a Bone out of its proper place.</hi>
And it is either <hi>Simple</hi> by it self, or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi>
with other Diseases.</p>
                  <p>Its <hi>Signes</hi> are the same as those of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;</hi>

                     <hi>Recent luxations</hi> are easier and sooner

in their Seat, than far separated
ones.</p>
                  <p>The common and general Cure of
<hi>Fractures</hi> and <hi>Dislocations</hi> is performed
by,</p>
                  <p>1. Setting the Bones in their natural
position.</p>
                  <p>2. Retaining them there.</p>
                  <p>3. Correcting the accidents.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these is performed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the broken or dislocated part
from its <hi>origin,</hi> either with the Hands or
some fit Instrument, then setting it in its
due place so that no eminency or rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be found to alter the figure of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> point is obtained by the

                  <p>These <hi>Signs</hi> appearing, if the <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi>
be called, he ought then to prepare
all things ready, and exactly observe
what is to be performed,</p>
                  <p>1. Before the <hi>Birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In <hi>Bringing forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Before the <hi>Birth</hi> a special care must
be had, that the <hi>Air</hi> of the <hi>Room</hi> must be
<hi>duly tempered</hi> with a <hi>moderate heat,</hi> and
then the <hi>Woman</hi> must be setled in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and middle positure, so that she
neither lie flat on her <hi>Back,</hi> nor be yet sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but have her <hi>Shoulder</hi> and <hi>Back</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
raised, that she may have a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
and more powerful endeavour
to bring forth, her <hi>Leggs</hi> being as much
separated as may easily be, and so bowed
that her <hi>Heels</hi> may reflect to her <hi>Buttocks,</hi>
which should also be something raised,
she holding her self to a Staff fitly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
cross the Bed, for that purpose, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106267:56"/>
when she feeleth the most pain, she must
be admonished to strive, as much as she
is able, stopping sometime her Breath
to express her <hi>Foster,</hi> whom the <hi>Midwife</hi>
ought in the mean time to thrust gently
from above downwards, having though
a care not to put her in that labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time be come, least her Forces
might leave her when they should be
most needful.</p>
                  <p>2. In the <hi>Birth,</hi> it is to be considered,
<hi>If it be according to Nature,</hi> which is when
the <hi>Foster</hi> issueth forth instantly after the
<hi>Waters,</hi> either the <hi>Head</hi> foremost or the
<hi>Feet,</hi> all other manners rendring the
<hi>Birth</hi> difficult, and being deem'd <hi>against
Nature;</hi> But if the <hi>Birth</hi> succeedeth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> ought to leave the
delivering of the party to the <hi>Midwife,</hi>
who ought to proceed in this manner;
The <hi>Child</hi> being brought forth she ought
presently to let follow the <hi>Secundine,</hi> but
if they do not instantly succeed, she must
gently thrust her <hi>Hand</hi> anointed with
Oyl, or the following Oyntment, along
the <hi>Navel</hi> in the <hi>Womb,</hi> and draw them
out.</p>
                  <p>The said Ointment is composed in
this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106267:57"/>
Take Oyl of Lin-seeds, one Ounce, Oyl of
Castor, half an Ounce, Nutinge, three Drams,
Laudanum, one Dram, and make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof.</p>
                  <p>And then free the <hi>Child</hi> of them, to
that end, the <hi>Midwife</hi> must bind the
<hi>Navel</hi> with a double thred two thumbs
breadth from the <hi>Belly,</hi> neither too strait
nor too loose, for fear of Accidents. The
knot being fitly made, the <hi>Navil</hi> must be
cut two fingers breadth beneath the
knot, and a linnen cloth dipt in Oyl of
<hi>Roses</hi> or of <hi>Almonds,</hi> wrapped about it,
with another linnen yet over, least its
coldness, till the time of its falling off,
might cause the <hi>Child</hi> some pain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency.</p>
                  <p>And thus far ought to be proceeded
in the <hi>Birth,</hi> when it happeneth without
extraordinary difficulty.</p>
                  <p>But because a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> is seldom cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unless the <hi>Birth</hi> be difficult, here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the Method, which he ought to
observe therein.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Birth</hi> is rendred difficult chiefly
by two Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106267:57"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> When the <hi>Waters</hi> which ought
immediately to precede it, are evacuated
too long before, whereby the <hi>Womb</hi>
groweth dry and intractable, which is
to be remedied by the following <hi>Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
wherewith the <hi>Midwife</hi> ought
often to anoint the <hi>Natural Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take fresh Butter without Salt, washed
in water of Mugwort, Mucilagines of Figgs,
of Lin. Oyl, and of Althea, extracted with
Water of Sabina, of each half an Ounce, Oyl
of Flower de Luce, an Ounce, make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The following Powder is also esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for hastening <hi>Child-birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take Cinnamon, Cassia fistula's burk, and
Dictamel, of each a Dram and a half, and
as much as the whole of white Sugar, make a
subtil Powder thereof, and let the labouring
Woman take half an Ounce of it at a time, in
a decoction of Lin-seed or White-wine.</p>
                  <p>The following Drink is also much
esteemed for the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106267:58"/>
Take broken bark of Cassia fistula, two
Ounces, Red Pease half a handful, Boyl them
with as much white Wine and Water as
needs, add in the end two Drams of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina,
and make a decoction; In the Colature
add for each dose a Dram of Cinnamon, and
six grains of Saffron, which being taken,
provoke the party to sneeze, putting in her
Nostrils a little pulverized Pepper, or white
Hellebore, and causing her, as aforesaid to stop
her mouth and Nostrils.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> and chiefest reason render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Birth</hi> difficult is the discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Figure of the <hi>Child,</hi> coming forth
otherwise than the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Feet</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
which being perceived, the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi>
ought to settle the Patient in a
convenient manner (as before) and then
gently bind her with a broad and soft
fillet (<hi>Fascia</hi>) in this manner; The said
fillet must first be applied to the <hi>Neck,</hi>
and thence brought cross-wise before
over the <hi>Shoulders</hi> to the two feet, where
being again crossed, and in many folds
about the <hi>Leggs</hi> and <hi>Thighs</hi> it ought to be
conveyed thence again to the <hi>Neck,</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106267:58"/>
there be firmly bound, so that the party
can in no wise stir, and to procure it the
better, she may set the plants of her <hi>Feet</hi>
against the Beadstead, a couple of honest
Servants keeping her <hi>Knees</hi> as much
from one another as may easily be, this
being so disposed; to keep out the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Air, and to perform the Operation
more modestly, a warm double linnen
cloth may cover the <hi>Natural parts</hi> and
<hi>Thighs</hi> of the Labouring <hi>Woman,</hi> and the
<hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> having first cut his <hi>Nails,</hi>
and anointed his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Arm,</hi> with
the abovesaid Liniment, must by degrees
gently as may be, thrust it into the <hi>Womb;</hi>
where having explored the position
of the <hi>Child,</hi> and whether it be alone or
with another, or a <hi>Mole,</hi> he ought to turn
it so, that he may come out the <hi>Head</hi> or
<hi>Feet</hi> foremost, as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>But if this do not succeed, or that the
<hi>Child</hi> be dead, which is judged, when
neither the <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> Hand, nor the
<hi>Mother</hi> can perceive it to move, and
most sure if the <hi>Waters</hi> are <hi>flowed out,</hi> and
the <hi>Secundines</hi> are <hi>come forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he ought to proceed in this
manner, having found one of the <hi>Feet,</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:106267:59"/>
he ought to draw it out, and having
bound it about with a soft and broad
fillet, put it in again, then seek the other,
which having found, draw it also out
with his hand, and together with it, by
the fillet, that which was bound before,
then having drawn the <hi>Child</hi> out to the
<hi>Flank,</hi> one of the <hi>Arms</hi> must be retruded
along the <hi>Neck</hi> over the <hi>Head,</hi> the other
being along the side, and so must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be drawn out.</p>
                  <p>It happeneth sometimes that one of
the <hi>Hands</hi> doth appear and is thrust out,
which must instantly be throst in again,
and the <hi>Child</hi> turned to a more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
figure; but if the <hi>Womb's Orifice</hi> be
so swelled that this cannot be done,
chiefly if the <hi>Child</hi> be dead, the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
is to cut it, the <hi>Bones</hi> as deep in
the <hi>Flesh</hi> as may be, least it might hurt
the said <hi>Orisice</hi> of the <hi>Womb,</hi> and then so
turn the <hi>Foster,</hi> that it may come out as
aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>But if the dead <hi>Child</hi> be so swelled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Tumor</hi> or <hi>Winds,</hi> that it cannot
possibly come out then a <hi>Hook</hi> must be
struck, if the <hi>Head</hi> be swelled under the
<hi>Chin,</hi> in the <hi>Mouth,</hi> in the hollow of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106267:59"/>
                     <hi>Eyes,</hi> or best of all in the <hi>Pole,</hi> if the <hi>Breast</hi>
under the <hi>Claviculis,</hi> and if in the <hi>Belly,</hi>
in the <hi>False Ribbs,</hi> or in the <hi>Bowels</hi> above
the <hi>Navel (Pubis</hi>) specially if the <hi>Child</hi>
cometh with the <hi>Feet</hi> foremost; Others
do endeavour to cut the <hi>Foster</hi> in pieces
in the <hi>Womb,</hi> with a crooked Knife and
then extract it by pieces apart, in doing
which, or the other operation, if it should
happen that the <hi>Head</hi> alone should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the <hi>Womb,</hi> a double <hi>Hook</hi> or an
Instrument called by <hi>Pareus,</hi> a <hi>Gryphins
Foot</hi> must be thrust in, with a hollow
<hi>Hand,</hi> and struck into some part of the
<hi>Head,</hi> as aforesaid, drawing it gently
forth; and thus far can Art be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Birth,</hi> ought to come in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
what must be done first to
the <hi>Mother,</hi> and then to the <hi>Child;</hi> For
the first, she must be exactly kept from
all cold and ambient <hi>Air,</hi> which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
more surely, it will not be amiss to

                  <p>Contrariwise if <hi>Moist Bodies</hi> be not
well exsiccated by <hi>Sudorisick Decoctions,</hi>
the <hi>Mercury</hi> draweth with him to the

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diarhaea</hi> is asswaged by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of <hi>Guaiac,</hi> mixt with a little
White-Wine, and taken for some days
in the Morning, whereby the humours
<hi>Acrimony</hi> is mitigated and sweetned.</p>
                  <p>But in general those evils are reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
by changing of Chamber and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
precipitating the <hi>Mercury</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                     <hi>Clysters,</hi> by letting Blood in the Foot,
and chiefly by purgations, wherein
some Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> must always be
added, to sweeten and drive down the
Humours.</p>
                  <p>Some do often swallow a <hi>Golden Pill,</hi>
which becomes white, but it carries
away the <hi>Mercury</hi> in so little quantity,
that the other Remedies are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be omitted.</p>
                  <p>The end of Friction is to stimulate a
<hi>Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s,</hi> which doth not proceed from
Nature, without it be provoked and
helped by some Medicament, whose
quantity ought to be adapted to the
vehementness of the Disease, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Patient; least the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being too strong, they cast him
into an incurable <hi>Consumption,</hi> or being
too weak, they do not eradicate the
Disease, which afterwards is found
much more intense, and incurable than
before.</p>
                  <p>The third Cure is by Plaisters, and
Cerowins, and is something slower
than the former, but more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in Relapses, and for the mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pain, and the resolution of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106267:66"/>
knobs and hardness, but because it
doth not act so speedily, the best of
Artists do joyn to it some Frictions.
Besides the Plaisters of <hi>De Vigo,</hi> the
following may be profitably used and
applied on the parts mentioned in the
Article of Friction.</p>
                  <p>Take of Melilot Plaister, and Saffron-Vinegar,
of each half a Pound, Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Quick-Silver, six Ounces, Oyl of
Laurel and Land Lavendel, as much as
needs; Reduce all to the form of a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
                  <p>The Scope of this Remedy, as of
the former, is the procuring of a
<hi>Crisis,</hi> either by insensible transpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Flux</hi> of the <hi>Belly,</hi> or <hi>Urines,</hi> but
oftner and better by a flowing of the
<hi>Mouth,</hi> which with the Gums and
Cheeks is thereby as aforesaid, often
exulcerated, because of the Humours
Tenacity and Acrimony, and these
<hi>Ulcers</hi> must by no means be repelled,
but be mitigated by <hi>Gargarisms,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Decocted Barley, Cows
Milk, and the like; which may dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106267:66"/>
the mouths inflammation, and
wash off the Humours sticking to it;
but if this accident, as it happens
sometimes, be too intense, that it
threatneth an extinction of the natural
heat, we must for some time defer the
proper Cure to cohibit so pernicious a
Symptom, according to Art. As for the
Teeths loosness, it is cured by astringent
Gargarisms, but more powerfully if the
Gums be touched with <hi>Aqua secunda</hi> of
the <hi>Goldsmiths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth manner by <hi>Suffumigations</hi>
is not so much approved, because of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evil dispositions, which it leaveth in
the Body. They nevertheless thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to it; The Patient being seated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Curtain, well and carefully extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they cast in a Chaffing-dish a good
quantity of persume composed of <hi>Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi>
mixt with <hi>Brimstone</hi> and <hi>Quicksilver,</hi>
whereunto is added <hi>Iris</hi> of <hi>Florence,
Frankinsence, Mirrhe, Iuncus odoratus,
Assaodorata, Terebenthine</hi> and <hi>Theriak,</hi>
and continue this <hi>Suffumigation</hi> till the
Mouth begins to flow; and that is its
<hi>Crisis.</hi>

                  <p>The Patient being conveniently sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
the <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> rubs the part,
which is to be opened with his hand or
a warm Linnen cloth, to cause the <hi>Bloods
attraction,</hi> then the said part is bound
with a <hi>Fillet</hi> a little above the place
of <hi>Incision,</hi> which is designed by a touch
of the Nail, and the <hi>Operation</hi> is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a fit <hi>Lancet,</hi> limiting its evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to the strength of the Patient and
the curative intention. <hi>Lastly,</hi> the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised</hi>
place must be carefully bound, least
an <hi>Hemoragy</hi> might happen.</p>

                  <p>When the matter is conjoyned and
impacted, <hi>Cupps</hi> are commonly applied.
I have commonly thus seen some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to operation, having something
rubbed the <hi>destinated place,</hi> they set on it
some kindled ends of <hi>Wax Candle</hi> fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106267:69"/>
on a <hi>Counter</hi> or such other thing, and
over it apply the <hi>Cup,</hi> which then draws
very powerfully the <hi>Humours</hi> up; then
taking them off, <hi>Incisions</hi> are made in
their circle with a <hi>Lancet</hi> or <hi>Instrument</hi>
called <hi>Scarrificatory,</hi> and they are again
applied in the same manner as before,
laying afterward Plaisters of <hi>Diapalma,</hi>
or <hi>Album Rasis</hi> over the <hi>Incisions,</hi> till they
be <hi>agglutinated.</hi>

                  <p>Where <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> or <hi>Cup-setting</hi>
cannot be performed, <hi>Leeches</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
applied either by making a little
<hi>Incision</hi> in the skin, or anointing it with
a drop of some other <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Sugard
milk,</hi> for then they will stick fast, and
when you will make them easily fall off,
touch but their head with a little <hi>Aloes,</hi>
or <hi>Salt;</hi> and if you will know what
quantity of <hi>Blood</hi> they have drawn, lay
them in the things aforesaid, and they
will revomit it; besides if you will have
them to draw more than their capacity
is, cut their posteriour part, when they
are well fast, and the <hi>Blood</hi> will run

through their Bodies, which also is
stanched, if it flowes when they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
