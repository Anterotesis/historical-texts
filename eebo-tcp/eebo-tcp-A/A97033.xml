            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>NEw years may well expect to finde</l>
               <l>Welcom from you, to whom they are ſo kind,</l>
               <l>Still as they paſſe, they court, and ſmile on you,</l>
               <l>And make your beauty as themſelves ſeem new:</l>
               <l>To the fair <hi>Villars</hi> we <hi>Dalkith</hi> prefer,</l>
               <l>And faireſt <hi>Morton</hi> now as much to her;</l>
               <l>So like the Sun's advance your titles ſhow,</l>
               <l>Which, as he riſes, does the warmer grow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But thus to ſtile you fair, your Sexes praiſe,</l>
               <l>Gives you but Mirtle, who may challenge Bays:</l>
               <l>From armed foes to bring a royal prize,</l>
               <l>Shews your brave Heart Victorious, as your Eyes;</l>
               <l>If <hi>Judith</hi> marching with the Generals head</l>
               <l>Can give us paſſion when her ſtorie's read,</l>
               <l>What may the living doe which brought away,</l>
               <l>Though a leſſe bloody, yet a nobler prey?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Who from our flaming <hi>Troy,</hi> with a bold hand</l>
               <l>Snatch'd her fair Charge, the Princeſs, like a brand,</l>
               <l>A brand preſerv'd to warm ſome Princes heart,</l>
               <l>And make whole Kingdomes take her Brothers part;</l>
               <l>So <hi>Venus</hi> from prevailing Greeks did ſhrowd</l>
               <l>The hope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſav'd him in a cloud;</l>
               <l>This gallant act may cancell all our rage,</l>
               <l>Begin a better, and abſolve this age.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Dark ſhades become the portrayt of our time,</l>
               <l>Here weeps Misfortune, and there triumphs Crime.</l>
               <l>Let him that drawes it hide the reſt in night,</l>
               <l>This portion only may indure the light,</l>
               <l>Where the kind Nimph changing her faultleſs ſhape</l>
               <l>Becomes unhandſome, handſomly to ſcape,</l>
               <l>When through the Guards, the River, and the Sea,</l>
               <l>Faith, Beauty, Wit, and Courage, made their way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As the brave Eagle does with ſorrow ſee</l>
               <l>The Foreſt waſted, and that lofty Tree,</l>
               <l>Which holds her neaſt about to be ore'thrown,</l>
               <l>Before the feathers of her young are grown,</l>
               <l>She will not leave them, nor ſhe cannot ſtay,</l>
               <l>But bears them boldly on her wings away;</l>
               <l>So fled the Dame, and o're the Ocean bore</l>
               <l>Her Princely burthen to the Gallick ſhore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Born in the ſtorms of war, this royal fayr,</l>
               <l>Produc'd like lightning in tempeſtuous ayr,</l>
               <l>Though now ſhe flyes her native Iſle, leſs kinde,</l>
               <l>Leſs ſafe for her, than either Sea or Winde,</l>
               <l>Shall, when the bloſſom of her Beauty's blown,</l>
               <l>See her great Brother on the Britiſh Throne,</l>
               <l>Where peace ſhall ſmile, and no diſpute ariſe,</l>
