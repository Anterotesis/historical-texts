            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>IRELAND</hi> hath been, and ſtill is even by ſome
Writers reputed a Barbarous and moſt Heatheniſh
Place: And indeed I believe it was ſo once, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
alſo; but all ſuch as have been there, and rightly
underſtood the Country of late, muſt (if impartial and
unprejudiced) own it to be far otherwiſe, and indeed a
Place of moſt excellent Government and Piety, and
much like that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> is an Iſland inviron'd with the Sea, and the
moſt Weſtern of <hi>Europe,</hi> lying between the Latitude of
51 and 56 Degrees North; and Weſtward from <hi>Holy-Head</hi>
in <hi>Wales</hi> about 14 Leagues; and from the South-Weſt
part of <hi>Scotland</hi> 8 or 9 Leagues; and is much more
temperate than <hi>England,</hi> cooler in Summer, and warmer
in Winter; ſo that when in the late great Froſt a Ox
was roaſted, and Coaches frequently went upon the <hi>Thames,</hi>
an Horſe-man durſt not venture over the <hi>Liffey,</hi> a much
leſs River, at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and thereby much more pleaſant
(and indeed, in the general, abundantly more fertile)
and plentiful than <hi>England,</hi> and free from all venemous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98803:4"/>
Vermin, Black Crows, Magpies, and Spiders, are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
there.</p>
            <p>In many places the Soil is ſo excellent, that it bears the
moſt devouring Grain, many Years ſucceſſively, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manuring; and in others it will bear three or four
Crops; and when it hath lain waſte but one Year, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further trouble than Plowing and Sowing Barly, will
again produce as many Crops more, and ſo Time after
Time with a <hi>continuendo;</hi> and in all places in general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
all ſorts of Grain <hi>England</hi> doth, as good, and in as
great plenty, with abundance leſs trouble and pains.</p>
            <p>There are indeed many large Mountains and Bogs, but
now, by the Induſtry of the Engliſh, made very good and
fertile Land, either for Tillage or Feeding; every where
watered with pleaſant Springs, Rivers, and Loughs or
Lakes of Water; indued with great plenty of Fiſh, wild
and tame Fowl, Horſes, Cows, Oxen and Sheep, as large
and good as any in <hi>England,</hi> and much more numerous,
till lately deſtroyed by the incouragement given the new
raiſed Forces, and other Iriſh Papiſts, by the now Duke
of <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome parts, eſpecially of the Weſt and North, a
Salmon above two foot long, may be bought for a Penny,
or two Pence. Forty five Eggs for one Penny. A fat
Gooſe for three pence. A fat Turky for ſix pence. A
fat Hen for three half-pence. A fat Lamb, or Kid, for
a Groat. But in <hi>Dublin,</hi> which is the deareſt part, they
fold, in time of peace, twelve or fourteen Eggs for a
penny. A large fair freſh Cod, two foot long, for three
pence. Plaice a foot long, and ſeven or eight inches broad,
two for a penny. Large Trouts as long, two or three for
a penny. Oyſters five or ſix inches broad, a penny a ſcore.
A fat Lamb for twelve or fourteen pence. A large fat Calf,
a month or ſix weeks old, for five or ſix Shillings. A large
quarter of Beef for three or four Shillings, as good as the
Markets of <hi>London</hi> afford, and other things proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably;
and yet all ſorts of Tradeſmen had greater Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and generally better Rates for their Goods than in
<hi>England.</hi>

And contrary to the general Suppoſition among the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
Scots, and other induſtrious Perſons, Mony was in
<hi>Ireland</hi> as plentiful, and with much more eaſe obtain'd
than in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that an ordinary Tradeſman, or Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
keeps a better Houſe, and lives much more plentiful
there than thoſe of four or five Hundred a Year can do
in <hi>England.</hi> None need labour long there, that will but
be Induſtrious, and any thing a reaſonable Husband, but,
unleſs very Unfortunate indeed, may ſoon acquire a Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
to live handſomly, and Gentleman-like. Scarce
any that went only private Souldiers thither in the laſt
Rebellion (unleſs Sots in earneſt) but were, before the
beginning of this Rebellion, Men of good Fortune and
Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The meer Iriſh are not really ſo Wild and Barbarous as
generally reputed, nor indeed Tame and Civiliz'd in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
as the Engliſh, but are as luſty, full, well-ſet, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
handſome, fair, and clear-skin'd as the Engliſh:
Mighty hoſpitable and kind-hearted to Strangers; ſo that
if any comes where they are eating, they will take it very
unkindly if he do not eat with them; and Travellers ſhall
have the beſt Entertainment they can afford them <hi>gratis,</hi>
and better than they will afford themſelves: For though
the Country be thus extream plentiful, yet the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
among the Iriſh fare very hard, and live moſtly upon
Potatoes, Parſnips, Cabbidg, Beans, Peaſe, Barley, and
Oat-Bread, ſour thick Milk, or Butter-milk; and unleſs
upon ſome certain Feſtival Days, as <hi>Chriſtmaſs, Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,
Eaſter, Whitſuntide,</hi> or <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> rarely eat a bit
of Fleſh, Butter, Eggs, or Cheeſe, unleſs they light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carrion
dead or drown'd. They are very naſty and ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
prefer ſtrong Butter, tainted Fleſh, and ſowr Milk,
before ſweet: Scarce ever wear Shifts or Shirts, or lodg
otherwiſe than upon Straw or Ruſhes on the Ground, with
their Cows, Calves, Swine, or Sheep, made faſt at the
Beds feet; or at the beſt, only a little Partition of Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
between them; uſe no Sheets, tumble all together,
only the Husband between other Men and their Wives,
and the Wife between other Women and their Husband.

The Common Women are generally Whoriſh before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and count it no Diſgrace to have a Baſtard or two,
but after Marriage are moſt conſtant to their Husbands;
they ſay, <hi>He that did before, muſt not do after:</hi> They are
very lazy, and inclin'd to Lice.</p>
            <p>Some of their Gentry are indeed very accompliſhed and
well-bred. They are in general the moſt zealous Roman
Catholicks in the World; and were always very obedient
and reſpectful to the Engliſh, and under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till King <hi>James</hi> the Second came to the Throne;
but after that they began to grow very Inſolent, infringe
the Engliſh Prerogative, and at length to inſult over and
deſtroy their Engliſh Maſters. Naturally in their own
Country the greateſt Cowards in the World, Spaniel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
the more they are beaten, the better; it uſed to be
common for one Engliſh Man to beat nine or ten of them;
but moſt Imperious Maſters: Naturally inclin'd to Theft
and Lazineſs; ſo that though employed by thoſe of their
own Country and Religion, they will idle away Time, and
ſteal what they can; ſo that if a Man employs but one or
two of them, he muſt have another to attend and watch
them.</p>
            <p>They are, from the higheſt to the loweſt, a People of
the leaſt fore-ſight in the World, never looking forward,
or taking care for to Morrow: believe it Damnation to
diſobey the Prieſts, and (as all other Papiſts do) meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to deſtroy all Proteſtants by every ſort of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and though they do not live ſo well under their own
Nation, yet they have a natural averſion to the Engliſh;
that to deſtroy them, they care not what Miſeries they
expoſe themſelves to, or who comes to govern over them,
yet have and dread an old Propheſy among them, which
ſays, <hi>The Iriſh ſhall weep over the Engliſh-mens Graves,</hi> as
they always do over each others many Years after bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
            <p>And though they have ſpared no Ruin they durſt bring
upon the Engliſh; yet now they dread coming under the
Yoke of <hi>France,</hi> who they have often, and indeed even
now invited to receive that Kingdom.</p>

<hi>Dublin,</hi> where he kept his Court; and with Tears in his
Eyes, marched through all the chief Streets of the City,
through a Guard of Souldiers placed on both ſides the
Way; and the Sword carried before him by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the now Duke of <hi>Ormond.</hi> Performed that Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with as pleaſant a Countenance, and as much chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as the loſs of his old Maſter, and fears of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miſery would permit. And the better to repel the then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
fearful Apprehenſions of the diſcerning Proteſtants,
there cauſed ſeveral Hogſheads of Wine to be placed at
the Caſtle-gate, <hi>Thoulſel,</hi> and Corn-market, for any that
pleaſed to drink; the Bells to be rung, and Bonfires to be
made at Night, and all other Teſtimonies of Joy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to be forthwith made. And ſuddenly after iſſued
Declarations, and other Aſſurances of his Majeſty's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Intentions and Reſolutions for maintaining the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, and Intereſt of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Which coming
from him, in whom next under God they repoſed their
greateſt Confidence at all Times, to be their then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
againſt the Abuſes they after ſuſtained by the
Iriſh, (by interceding for them upon all Occaſions to the
King) did in ſome meaſure abate thoſe gloomy Fogs
for the preſent, and give hopes the King would in ſome
meaſure make good his Promiſes to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98803:6"/>
But the Papiſts, who always during the two late Kings
Reigns at leaſt, had their Friends at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and from
them, by their Infallible Guides, the Prieſts, a certain
pre-knowledg of future Deſigns, and the beſt Intelligence,
well knew the contrary; and forthwith began to prick
up their Ears, repair their Old, and erect ſeveral new
Maſs-houſes; and every Raſcal that could but ſpeak a
little Engliſh, or write and read nothing but Nonſenſe,
and had but four or five Sheep, or three or four Cows or
Horſes, and never before the Honour to wear any thing
but Rags, or what was little better, forthwith ſold what
they had to buy new Cloaths, and carry them for <hi>Dublin,</hi>
with each a Sword at his Brich, (though ſcarce knew how
to draw or ſheath it there) ſet up for Gentlemen, and ſoon
worm'd the Proteſtants out, and got themſelves into all the
beneficial Imployments in the Kingdom, the Army,
and whatever was of any Value or Truſt: And then,
without reſpect to Maſter or Miſtreſs, or ſuch others as
had before better fed than taught them, and perhaps kept
them from ſtarving, though the beſt Church-Proteſtant
in the Kingdom, if any Affront hapned to be given theſe
new Gentlemen, the firſt and moſt friendly Salute was,
<hi>God damn you for a Figiſh Son of a Biſh,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
out with the Prick-Frog, or Bayonet; and if Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
gave Reſolution to reſiſt their Violences, (as often
it happened, and if alone to diſarm and beat them too)
then the Reſiſter was ſure (upon the Aſſaulter's eſcaping
his Hands) forthwith to have as many Hands upon one
Head and Body, as it had Arms and Fingers to reſiſt him,
or Legs, Feet and Toes to flee from them; and if happily
he eſcaped that Bout, they would certainly break his
Windows at Night, and as a Cat watches a Mouſe, watch
for another Opportunity; and if that fail'd, they never
did go to a Juſtice, but perhaps to ſome pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
creeping Raſcal, who for lucre of a few Pence,
and to keep his Employ, valued not how many good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Chriſtians he rid, and gall'd even to Death, to
ſerve the deviliſh End and Cauſe for which he had the
favour to ſtay to be the
Fop laſt devoured, who muſt be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98803:6"/>
ſure to tie him up to all imaginable hard Meat, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more ſeverely than a Papiſt would do, for being
kickt out of Commiſſion; and then it was well done, by
forſooth a Proteſtant, and not by the merciful Roman
Catholicks. If the poor Creature kept out of reach, then
out with a Warrant, break open his Doors, ſearch his
Houſe, rifle and take away what is liked; and if any
honeſt Proteſtant yet remained in Commiſſion, every
ſhabby beggarly Raſcal, ſpared not the impudence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
them to their Faces. I have heard a meer Teague,
that could ſcarce pronounce a word of true Engliſh, or
ſenſe, beard the Lord Mayor of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Sir <hi>John Knox,</hi>
when brought before him for Felony, who though a Man
of Courage, did not dare to commit the Criminal.</p>
            <p>Thus the poor Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> continued in this,
though miſerable, yet happy Condition in conſideration
to what they afterwards fell to, till the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>
was ſent thither Lord-Lieutenant, upon whoſe arrival
they began again to flatter themſelves with hopes of
more Comfort, through the Intereſt and Favour of him
that was ſo near related to the King, and an aſſured Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant;
but they, to their Sorrow, ſoon found his
Wings clipt, and <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> quickly ſent after him, with the
Honour and Title of Earl, the Office of Lieutenant-General
and Check-maſter of the Army; and Authority
and Power to place and diſplace whom he pleaſed;
who accordingly forthwith put his Power in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and iſſued out his Orders for modelling the
Army, which were no ſooner given, but obeyed, and in
all places the Army drawn into the Field, and about ten
or twelve of the oldeſt Men pick'd out, and their
Cloaths ſtript off, and their Arms given to Iriſh papiſts
before their Faces; and when thoſe parcels were diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd,
others were ſtill pick'd out, and ſo from time to
time, till the whole Army was weeded of its Proteſtants,
and repleniſh'd with Iriſh Papiſts. When all they could
call old were culled, then the Excuſe was Shortneſs, till
the Popiſh Party was the ſtronger; then they uſed no
further excuſe, but being Proteſtants, till the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98803:7"/>
ſtanding Army, which was raiſed and at vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
both of Men and Mony to <hi>England,</hi> there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for many Years to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion,
and Engliſh Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was, by Popiſh Craft,
and Favour and Means of the great God <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi>
peaceably in one Year wholly deſtroyed and inverted into
as Popiſh Power, the whole Treaſure of the Kingdom,
Cities and Gariſons, which were firſt conſtituted to keep
them out, wholly poſſeſt and diſpoſed of by the Native
Iriſh, and thoſe, who of all Men, were the greateſt haters
of the Engliſh, and their Religion, made the only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of both: and certainly muſt needs be in a bleſſed
State, when the Fox is ſet to watch the Geeſe, and the
Wolves the Lambs.</p>
            <p>Now all things became bare-fuced, and he that had but
half an Eye might eaſily diſcern what was like to follow;
and ſuch as had Stooks of Mony, began by degrees to
tranſmit it to <hi>England,</hi> and diſpoſe of their Effects, and
afterwards to ſteal away themſelves; while others, whoſe
Riches conſiſted moſtly in Stocks, which was in others Hands,
or had not wherewith to tranſport themſelves, and for a
Livelihood were forced to abide the approaching Storm,
ſome to the loſs, others their Eſtates, and moſt
inevitable Ruin.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were doing, <hi>Darrington,</hi> a reputed
Jeſuit, was ſent over, and made firſt Major, and after
Lieutenant-Colonel to the Royal Regiment in <hi>Dublin</hi> (to
fulfil that part of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s information in his diſcovery
of the Popiſh Plot); and one <hi>Barker</hi> (formerly Page to
the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and one of King <hi>James</hi>'s
Converts,) Major, and ſo proceeded to disband all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Officers in the Army; and firſt began with Sir
<hi>William King,</hi> then Governour of the Caſtle and City of
<hi>Limrick,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> his Brother, and ſuch
others as they had noted to be the moſt ſober and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Proteſtants, and placed Iriſh Papiſts in their places,
till all the Iriſh Army, both Officers and Souldiers, were
Papiſts, excepting only ſome few in the Regiments of the
Lords <hi>Ment joy</hi> and <hi>Forbes,</hi> and Col. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98803:7"/>
Proteſtants, and in a manner all the Proteſtant
Officers left that firſt Year in the whole Army, and who
were kept in only to blind the People till their other work
was finiſhed, and ſo have the favour to be devoured
laſt.</p>
            <p>Things being brought to this paſs, the whole Army
Papiſts, and none to oppoſe them, they thought they ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might, and accordingly fell to regulate the Civil. Part,
and at one blaſt removed ſive or ſix of the nine Proteſtant
Judges, and left but one upon each Bench for Ciphers, to
colour the Matter, and drag up the reſt to their own
Juſtice, and likewiſe the Proteſtant Chancellor, Sir <hi>Charles
Porter,</hi> and moſt of the Proteſtant Privy Councellors,
and fill'd up their places with others of their own Party,
with ſuch prodigious Broagues upon their Tongues, that
they could ſcarce pronounce one word of Engliſh truly;
and after theſe the Proteſtants which were the Attourneys,
Solicitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the King, were pack'd after the
Judges.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they ſet another Project on foot,
<hi>viz.</hi> To disband all the ſmalleſt of their own Souldiers as
ſoon as they were well diſciplin'd, but not before, and
ſtill took in larger, till they had the Flower of the
Country in the Army, and ſtill ſent the Old to exerciſe
the reſt of their Breed in the Country; So that when they
had occaſion to raiſe their freſh Forces, they were moſtly
in a manner diſciplin'd to their hand, not in expectation
of uſing them to their preſent purpoſe, but in caſe King
<hi>James</hi> had continued in the Throne, and not anſwered
their deſire of reſtoring them to their Eſtates, that they
might be able to reſtore themſelves, by deſtroying all the
Engliſh there; and <hi>Darrington</hi> made two certain Sizes,
one for Muſqueteers and another for Pikemen, and thoſe
that were too ſhort or long for his Standard, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplin'd,
muſt trip off.</p>
            <p>All things being now fitted to the purpoſe, <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi>
and the new Attorney General Sir <hi>Richard Neagle,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
to <hi>Whitehall</hi> with the Account, and to adviſe
about future Matters, the Project of compleating their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98803:8"/>
ſo ſucceſsfully begun Work; and after a ſhort ſtay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with Power to diſplace the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>
from the Government, (who indeed all diſcerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
there eaſily perceived was kept in ſo long, only
to deceive the People till the Work could be brought to
that ſecure perfection) who eight days after his arrival
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> took his place as Lord, Deputy-General, and
General-Governour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for Lord-Lieutenant he
could not be, becauſe born in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the good Earl
of <hi>Clarendon</hi> having an account of his approach, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
what might, and indeed did follow, reſolved,
before his departure, to conſecrate the Chappel in the
New Hoſpital near <hi>Dublin,</hi> built for the uſe of old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
Souldiers, (and is the fineſt in <hi>Europe</hi> of its kind;)
and accordingly, did, before well finiſhed, hoping thereby
to prevent its falling into the Papiſts Hands, becauſe the
King had declared he would maintain the Church of
<hi>England</hi> in all her Rights and Properties, as eſtabliſhed
by Law. But <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> (who though not ſo near related
to the King, yet knew his Mind much better) ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
that Scruple, and forthwith after the Lord <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's</hi>
departure, with the chief of the Popiſh Clergy in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> with Whips and Scourges, entred the ſaid Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
fell to laſhing the Walls and Floar to whip out He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,
pulled down the Communion-Table and Seats, and
erected in it an Altar; and took three or four of the
old Souldiers Rooms adjoining to it, for the Prieſts and
Friars, and while they exerciſed in the Chappel, the old
Souldiers, for whoſe uſe, and with whoſe Mony it was
built, were forced to have their Devotion in the open
Hall where they uſed to eat their Meat; and in the mean
time a Libel was fixed upon the Doon of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> to publiſh the Bains of Matrimony betwixt that
Church and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> bidding any that could,
forthwith to ſhew cauſe why they ſhould not be joined
together. So that now the Proteſtants expected no leſs
than all their Churches to be taken from them; but
whether through the murmuring of the People, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from the King to the contrary, they proceeded no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98803:8"/>
further as yet in that Buſineſs, only diſplaced all the
Proteſtant Chaplains in the Army, and gave their Places
and Benefits to Popiſh Prieſts; who thereupon began to
wear black Cloaks, made much like the Miniſters Gowns;
and yet it was a Crime to ſay the King had broke his
Promiſe, and infringed the Rights of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> for it ſeems, taking away Conſecrated Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
and Colledges, and giving its Members Livings to
Popiſh Prieſts, was not Infringing the Rights of the
Church, but maintaining them according to Law; and
it was ſo indeed according to the Laws of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the King never mentioned what Law he
therein meant; and therefore did not break his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>But before further progreſs was made in this Buſineſs,
it was thought fit to Summon all Corporations, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
Bodies in them, to ſurrender their Charters,
upon which <hi>Drogheda</hi> and two or three Towns more
obeyed, and one <hi>Thomſon,</hi> Chirurgeon to the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> being Maſter, and a pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
to ſhew his Loyalty, readily threw the Charter
of the Corporation of Chirurgions in <hi>Dublin</hi> at <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi>'s
feet, and is lately come for <hi>England,</hi> perhaps to
get it renewed by King <hi>William;</hi> or elſe, for that good
Service, to get to be Chirurgeon to another Regiment
here in <hi>England,</hi> for certainly the Man's Loyalty well
deſerves it and cannot fail of his Brethrens Certificate for
ſaving them the Charges, others were expoſed to in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Charters by Law; which all ſuch as did
not ſurrender, or were forced to do in the Exchequer,
where one of thoſe, a pretended Proteſtant, ſate, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
to Judg and give Sentence againſt them till all was
done, and is ſince likewiſe come for <hi>England</hi> to receive
his Reward:</p>
            <p>All Charters being thus taken away, partly by Fraud,
partly by Force, others were quickly prepar'd, and in
every of them, ſcarce one Perſon mention'd in the Body
of the Charter but Papiſts, or ſuch as were little better;
but particularly every Mayor, Sheriff, Portrief, Suffren,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98803:9"/>
Bailiff, Maſter, Warden, and Clerk, were meer Papiſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one <hi>Anth. Sharp</hi> a Quaker, was made, and there named
Maſter of the Corporation of Weavers in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and
one <hi>Colvert,</hi> much of the ſame Stamp, of a new Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Hoſiers; and by theſe the Common Councils,
and Councils of the ſeveral Companies, were either all
Papiſts, or Couſin-Germans to Papiſts.</p>
            <p>All the Proteſtant Chaplains that belonged to them
put out, and Popiſh Prieſts put in their places: Moſt
of the Proteſtant Juſtices, and all the Proteſtant Sheriffs
of every County except one, turn'd out; ſo that in one
Year, or a little more, after <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> aſſum'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
there was very few down-right honeſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Officers, either Civil or Military in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> except thoſe before named; and one
<hi>Keating,</hi> who yet continued Lord Chief Juſtice of the
Common Pleas, and one of the Privy Council, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
was the beſt Friend the Proteſtants had there.</p>
            <p>However things were not yet perfected, for thoſe
named in the Charters, were moſtly ſo indigent and
poor, that they were ſcarce able, with their whole For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
to pay three or fourſcore Pounds, which was
the Fees of each Charter; and all, or moſt of the
Proteſtants refuſed to contribute, till they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled;
ſome of them impriſoned, and forced to <hi>Habeas-Corpus's</hi>
for their Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> diſliking theſe Delays, ſent for ſome of the
principal of them, preſſed them to the Buſineſs, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them, that if they would join with the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and take out their Charters, he would defray all
Fees of each Charter above Twenty Pounds, which
would not amount to above five Shillings each Man at the
moſt, beſides their Freedom of the City, or Town,
which ſhould be granted them at the ſame Rate; and in
caſe they continued ſtill obſtinate, he muſt look upon
them as obſtinate and ſtubborn, and diſaffected to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Government. This made ſome for eaſe, and others
for fear, comply, and become again free; but others
who ſtood out to this time, were hamper'd, and had their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98803:9"/>
Shops ſhut down frequently, till the News of the Scale
turning in <hi>England,</hi> which then ceas'd. But the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Quakers, who before would not under a Proteſtant
Government take upon them ſo much as the Office of a
Conſtable, now under a Popiſh every where readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
and two of the chief of them are made Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Dublin, viz. Anthony Sharp</hi> before mentioned,
and <hi>Samuel Clarrage,</hi> who are excuſed from taking Oaths,
and frequently ſat in the Seat of Juſtice. <hi>Clarrage</hi> is at
laſt come for <hi>England,</hi> and as buſy about <hi>Whitehal</hi> and
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as he was with <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While theſe things were thus proſecuted in Publick,
the Popiſh Clergy, in all parts of the Kingdom, were as
buſy in private Caballing, and ſending their fitteſt Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to <hi>Whitchal, Rome, France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to
adviſe about, and receive Inſtructions for compleating
their Damnable Deſign of overwhelming and eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Proteſtant Religion, and Intereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> in
particular. And the better to delude the poor ſleeping
Proteſtants, <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> continually fed them with freſh
Aſſurances of the King's Gracious Reſolutions, of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Religion and Intereſt of the Proteſtants; and
that all this Work, was only to have an honeſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that would take off the Penal Laws, for eaſe of all
Diſſenters; and that nothing could contribute more to
the Advantage, Quiet, and Riches of any Government:
However, God be praiſed, all were not ſo ſtupiſſed, but
they did plainly diſcern to have Popiſh Parliaments, and
in <hi>Ireland</hi> meer Iriſh; and ſuch as ſhould not only have
deſtroyed the Proteſtants, but the whole Engliſh Intereſt
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which nothing but a gracious God, and the
glorious Inſtrument he uſed, could have prevented, as Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
then ſtood); but, bleſſed be his Holy Name, God
was pleaſed on a ſudden to blaſt all their Curſed Deſigns,
and for the preſent ſtrike them mute there as well as in
<hi>England,</hi> with the News of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>England;</hi> which no ſooner arrived, but <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>
prepared to ſend ſeveral Detachments of the then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces for <hi>England,</hi> and accordingly ſent away about

3000 of the faireſt and likelieſt of the Foot, who were
to be followed by more, till they began to fear if they did
that, the Proteſtants, who they knew they had deſerved
no better from, might riſe againſt them, and therefore
forbore that part of the Deſign for the preſent, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſpeeded the raiſing of more Forces, and by <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs</hi>
had their Army (which before conſiſted of about

            <p>Some conſiſting of 20, 22, or 24 Hundred: So that
the whole amounted to about 80000, compleatly Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and Diſciplin'd; all rais'd, cloath'd, and kept till
that time at the proper Charge of their ſeveral Officers,
many of which were before but Taylors, Coblers, and
ſuch others as perhaps were ſcarce able to procure before
Bread for their Families; but now, for managing this
Bleſſed Cauſe, ſell all that ever they have, and their
Friends too, to carry on the Holy Deſign.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, while the Men were raiſing, <hi>Tyrcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>
ordered all the Gun-ſmiths, Carpenters, and Joyners,
to be forthwith imployed for cleanſing, ſtocking, and lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the old Fire-Arms; and the Cutlers for cleanſing
and ſheathing the Swords, which ſince the laſt Wars had
lain ruſting in the Stores, and ſuch as refuſed, were ſent
to Priſon till they comply'd; who, beſides the old Locks,
were promis'd for each Muſquet <hi>10s.</hi> and every Piſtol <hi>6s.</hi>
but when they will get it I know not; ſome they were paid
all along, to keep Life and Soul together: So that with
the Arms he had the Summer before received from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Tyrconnel</hi> had not only Arms for his whole Army,
but many more; and by the Prieſts had made all the other
Papiſts in the Kingdom, the Men to Arm themſelves with
Half-pikes, and Skeins, or Bayonets, and the Women with
Skeins or Bayonets; and in caſe, after a certain day, any
in the Country went to Maſs without thoſe Arms, they
were by the Prieſts obliged to pay a Shilling, and curſt by
Bell, Book, and Candle: So that in leſs than five months
**
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98803:11"/>
time the whole Body of the Iriſh Papiſts were every where
Armed, to the great terror of the Proteſtants; and as
they were naturally inclin'd to Theft, ſo now they were
by Authority put into an excellent condition to perform it,
which with the inability of the new Officers to maintain
them, upon deſtroying the Proteſtants, which at firſt
they began moderately by way of ſtealth in the Night;
but when the Owners began to grumble and complain to
no purpoſe, with much more violence and boldneſs, and
by degrees increaſed their Spoils, till at length in open
Day they ſpared not, before the Owners Faces, to drive
away together often, from one Man 100, ſometimes 1000
Sheep, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 Cows, Oxen, and the like;
and ſuch as would not drive, and were not for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
they kill'd, and carried away the Skin, Hide, and
Tallow, and left the dead Carkaſſes as dirty and uſeleſs as
they could, fit for nothing but Vermin; and ſuch as was
not for their own purpoſe, they drove, or kill'd, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Fairs and Markets, and ſold to others of their own
Breed, who had not ſo much Courage (and a little more
Honeſty than) to ſteal a fat Weather, which ſix or ſeven
Months before was worth 9 or <hi>10s.</hi> for <hi>1s.</hi> and a fat Ox
worth 3 or 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a Cow of 50 <hi>s.</hi> for 5 or 6. <hi>s.</hi>
But at length they proceeded further, even to take away
the Corn and Houſhold-goods; ſo that he that over-night
was worth 9 or <hi>4000l.</hi> the next day, or week, had not a
Morſel to put in his Head, or Rag to hang on his Back,
but what Charity he received from other Proteſtants not
yet ſo abſolutely ruined. At length they were ſo glutted
with theſe Spoils, that they began to be more abſolute, and
fent or went to the Houſes of ſuch as their Mercy had not
yet deſtroyed, and ſuppoſed to have any Mony, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that if they did not forthwith, or within a certain
time by them limited, deliver to them ſuch Sums as their
Moderation thought fit to demand, they would, and did,
burn their Houſes and Corn, kill and leave their Cattel
dead upon the Ground Among the reſt, one <hi>Franeis Baker</hi>
a Merchant in <hi>Youghill</hi> in particular, having in the County
of <hi>Tipperary</hi> a ſtock of fat Cattel, went, about the latter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98803:11"/>
end of <hi>January</hi> laſt to fetch them home, hoping they
might be more ſecure in Barrels, and a Town of reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtrength, than in the open Fields; but as he was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a Crew of the new-raiſed Iriſh Forces, met, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him, whither he was driving thoſe Cattel, and
told him, they had more right to them than he, and unleſs
he ſatisfied them, muſt be content to leave them behind
him; whereupon he was forthwith forced to pay for thoſe
his own Cattel, 15 or <hi>16l. Sterling,</hi> which was as much
as they would have yielded in their Mountain Markets.
And to be ſhort, the Spoil was ſo general and great, that
in <hi>December,</hi> and part of <hi>January</hi> laſt, they had deſtroyed,
in the Counties of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kerry,</hi> above 4000 Head of
black Cattel, as Cows and Oxen; and there, and in the
County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> 2 or 300000 Sheep: And ſo in all
other parts, eſpecially the Provinces of <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
proportionably; ſo that before the beginning of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
it was thought they had deſtroyed in all parts of
Kingdom above 1000000 Head of Cattel, beſides Corn
and Houſes, and thereby utterly ſpoiled the moſt plentiful
Country in theſe parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo that 20 Years of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Peace cannot be thought to reſtore it to the State in
which it was at the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> alarm'd at theſe Devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
began to Arm, and provide themſelves againſt them;
and firſt the Citizens of <hi>London-derry,</hi> underſtanding that
two Companies of the new-rais'd Forces were marching
to quarter in that City, ſhut their Gates, and reſolved to
ſtand upon their own Defence, and when they came, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

the Proteſtants of that County) with ſix Companies of
his Regiment which he took from <hi>Dublins</hi> to reduce them;
who coming before the place, demanded, but was refuſed
Entrance for two days; In the interim it was concluded to
receive him into the Town ſingly alone; and being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it was concluded, that provided he procured their
Pardon within 14 days, they would receive two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98803:12"/>
of his Men, to he made up all Proteſtants, to Gariſon in
the Town, and at the beginning of <hi>March</hi> as many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
or as many more of any other Regiment; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perform'd on both hands, the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> returned
for <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Rice</hi> was ſent
for <hi>France</hi> to know the King's Pleaſure; but privately an
Account was ſent with him by <hi>Rice,</hi> that he held corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and ſtill remains cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>
This Lord was no ſooner gone for <hi>France,</hi> but his two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
left in <hi>London-derry,</hi> with the City, again revolted;
and <hi>John Hawkins</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a young brisk zealous Proteſtant
Gentleman, of good Fortune and Intereſt in that Province,
accompanied with about 100 others, well Armed and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
purſued the Example of the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
and march'd from place to place to ſtir up the Proteſtants
to Arm and Aſſemble together for their own Defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the common Enemy and Abuſes; and in a ſhort time
was ſo ſuccesful, as to induce the whole Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi>
ſo to do, (except the Towns of <hi>Carigfergus</hi> and <hi>Ardmagh</hi>)
and among them the Lord <hi>Mount-Alexander,</hi> Lord <hi>Blaney,</hi>
Sir <hi>Arthur Roden,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of Note and
Quality: And by their Example the Town and County of
<hi>Sleigo,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> was moved to riſe in
like manner by the Lord <hi>Kingston,</hi> and <hi>Chidly Coote</hi> Eſq.
And ſoon after the Town of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> ſeized and diſarmed
a Troop of Dragoons that was quartered there, and ſent
them away naked; and ſeveral other Towns did the like:
And ſo, and with Supplies they procured from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
armed themſelves indifferently, and formed themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Troops and Companies, under the Command of the
Perſons of Quality afore-mentioned, and began to take
Reprizals for their Loſſes; but <hi>Garrigfergus</hi> held out for
the Iriſh all along.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Iriſh made it their Buſineſs
to ſtop all Paſſages thither, however, many got to
them, ſome one way and ſome another, and a little
after <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> about fifty Proteſtants that belonged to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Companies in <hi>Dublin,</hi> about five at Night met, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98803:12"/>
with their Arms, marched toward the North all Night
long, and the next day, till they had got about 40 Miles;
but being diſcovered, Forces were ſent to purſue them,
ſo that being over-powered, they were taken and carryed
Priſoners bound into <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle, and thence commited
to Goals, where ſome of them ſtill remain without
tryal; others were enlarged, upon giving ſecurity for
their good Behaviour, and never to take up Arms againſt
King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day after they were brought in, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
among the Horſe were disbanded, and their
Horſes, Arms, and Cloaths taken from them; for which
ſome of them had afterwards <hi>5l.</hi> for what coſt them <hi>20l.</hi>
but many nothing to this day. And <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> had all the
Foot drawn out, and at the head of them, told them,
that ſuch as pleaſed might lay down their Arms and
Commiſſions; upon which all the Proteſtant Officers and
Souldiers that appear'd the next day did, which much
ſurprized his greatneſs, but the Drums and Trumpets he
would not permit, not having any that were Papiſts to
ſupply their places, ſo that much againſt their wills they
are forced yet to ſtay under them.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants in other parts being more intermingled
with Iriſh than thoſe of the North, could not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into ſo ſudden a defenſive poſture; however were not
idle, but as opportunity gave leave, ſo that they might not
be ſuſpected, provided ſuch Arms and Ammunition as
they could moſt conveniently procure, till they were
reaſonably well Arm'd throughout the Kingdom, and at the
beginning of <hi>February</hi> at a place called <hi>Summerhill,</hi> within
20 miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> there was got together about 300
Proteſtants; and near the King's County under Sir <hi>Laurance
Parſons,</hi> ſuch another Number, At <hi>Charlevile,</hi> the Seat of
the Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> within 12 miles of <hi>Limrick,</hi> under
Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> and Sir <hi>William King,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

<hi>Cork.</hi> Under the Earl of <hi>Barrymore,</hi> 200 Horſe, and 240
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98803:13"/>
Foot. At <hi>Caſtle-Marter,</hi> under Eſq. <hi>Boyle</hi> 60 or 80. And
in moſt other Towns and Caſtles thereabouts the like
numbers. In <hi>Bandon</hi> 7 or 8000 Horſe and foot, all forming
themſelves into Troops and Companies, and Exerciſing,
intending to put themſelves under the Command of the
Lord <hi>Inchiqueen,</hi> and the aforeſaid <hi>Boyle,</hi> and had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and agreed, that if any place were attacqued,
notice ſhould be forthwith diſpatch'd to all the reſt, and
all were to join and march to its relief within 24 hours;
which <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> having notice of, ſent Expreſs forthwith
to Major General <hi>Mac-Carty</hi> then in <hi>Cork</hi> to draw out
with three Pieces of Cannon againſt <hi>Caſtle-martyr,</hi> who
no ſooner came before it, but they received an expreſs,
from thoſe who intended to head them, that it was
thought fit and adviſeable for them to ſurrender,
which they did, upon Diſcretion, and <hi>Boyle</hi> was taken
and carried Priſoner to <hi>Cork;</hi> and upon the ſurrender, the
like advice was given (it is not convenient to tell here by
who) to all the reſt thereabouts, to depart to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Homes: but Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> with 245 Horſe
marched directly towards the North; but the Journey
being-near 200 miles compleat, and all through an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country, and Expreſſes ſent before to raiſe the whole
Country, and Forces every-where as they went, which
the poor Gentlemen puſhed through, till both they and
their Horſes, being thoroughly ſpent for want of Meat,
and no longer able to hold, were forced to ſubmit, and
ſurrender up their Horſes and Arms, upon condition to have
leave for themſelves to return to their ſeveral Habitations.
But as there is no Faith to be kept with Hereticks, ſo theſe
poor Creatures had no ſooner parted with their Arms,
but they were all bound, and drove like Dogs to the Goal
of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and the laſt Aſſizes there condemn'd to be
Drawn, Hang'd, and Quartered; but upon the ſecond of
<hi>April</hi> got a Reprieve for a month. One <hi>Brown,</hi> a Man of
conſiderable Fortune, was going with them, but fearing
to get thorough, returned back, went to a neighbouring
Juſtice, and told him where he had been, but diſliking
the Enterprize, was returned in obedience to the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty's
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98803:13"/>
Proclamation of Pardon, to give Security for his
future good Behaviour; however was forthwith, by a
ſtrong Guard, ſent priſoner to <hi>Cork,</hi> and was there after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
tryed and executed for High-Treaſon while King
<hi>James</hi> was there. And in <hi>Phillips-town</hi> in the Kings
County there are Sir <hi>Laurence Parſons,</hi> and about 50 more,
under the ſame condemnation; and in <hi>Marisborough</hi> in the
Queen's County, 13 or 14, and in ſeveral other parts the
like numbers, whoſe particulars are not yet come to the
Authors hands, which were taken much after the ſame
manner.</p>
            <p>Other parts being thus reduced, <hi>Mac-Carty</hi> Forthwith
drew all the Forces in <hi>Munſter</hi> againſt <hi>Bandon,</hi> a Town,
which till theſe Times, never permitted a Papiſt to dwell
within its Wallt, and likewiſe forced them to Surrender,
and give five of their Town Hoſtages for the payment of
<hi>1000l.</hi> for the trouble they had given his Army, <hi>500l.</hi> of
which they paid down, and the other five was remitted
upon a Petition to King <hi>James,</hi> upon his landing at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe Hurries in other parts, there was not any
riſing in the County or City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> however all
were not idle, but ſeveral Active Spirits, a knot of ſix or
ſeven in particular, whoſe Names are not convenient to
be mentioned here, being moſt ſtill under the Papiſts Laſh,
promoted, as 'twas thought, principally by one, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the landing of the now King <hi>William</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for
his Religion was ſingled out to taſte of Popiſh Mercy,
with an Intent to ſeize the Caſtle and Guards of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and ſend <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> And for the better effecting
thereof, had by Stratagems cauſed moſt of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
there to Arm themſelves, though at the ſame time
they knew not what for, further, than in caſe any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
were made by the Papiſts upon their Lives by way
of Maſſacre (as they certainly intended, till happily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by an unknown Hand of their own Party to a
Proteſtant Lord, on the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>December</hi>) which ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
all Proteſtants, that it was in vain to attempt it
after, and eſpecially while the Proteſtants were any where
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98803:14"/>
in Arms, (for that would have made all deſperate, and not
ſo eaſily to be reduced as they were); but before the
Proteſtants of <hi>Dublin</hi> could bring their buſineſs to bear,
and get Ammunition enough to reſiſt ſuch Force as might
be brought againſt them, before they could expect Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
from <hi>England, Tyrconnel</hi> began to ſuſpect them; and
forthwith call'd ſuch Supplies and Numbers of Horſe and
Foot thither, that with what was there before, made
up 14 or 15000 Men, whoſe Number and Preſence ſpoil'd
that great Project, which otherwiſe was ſo well laid, that it
had certainly taken effect, if put in execution, and brought
<hi>Tyrconnel</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſaved the extream Ruin and
Devaſtation the Proteſtants have ſince ſuffered through
his Villany. For any time before that great Force came to
<hi>Dublin,</hi> which was at the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> 5000 Men
well Arm'd in that City, and commanded, had been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
with what was ready and might have bin raiſed there,
to reduce, not only <hi>Dublin,</hi> but all <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the
noiſe of the forementioned deſigned Maſſacre, and the
Sufferings of others, put People to the flight for <hi>England</hi>
ſo faſt, and made thoſe that ſtayed ſo dubious, that it
was hard to know who to truſt there under the Noſe of
the Government; and there was not one Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then there that would undertake to Head them, tho often
importuned, and aſſured of 4000 Men well Arm'd at two
hours warning, and many of them well exerciſed, and
ſo many reſolute good Souldiers as would have attempted
to ſeize the Guards.</p>
            <p>About this time a French Man landed at <hi>Cork,</hi> and rid
poſt to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with aſſurance from King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>
of his ſpeedy coming to his relief; and on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>22d</hi> of
<hi>Feb.</hi> two of his Officers that had eſcaped from the <hi>Iſle of
Wight,</hi> came privately to the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and continued
there <hi>in cognito</hi> till <hi>Sunday</hi> following about 10 at night;
then on a ſuddain the noyſe was ſpread all over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that the King was landed with 5000 Men, and that
the two forementioned Officers came with the Expreſs to
the Lord Deputy, which on a ſudden put all into hurries;
and where Bonfires were not immediately made, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98803:14"/>
broke the Windows, Signs, and Doors, and rifled the
Houſes; and the next Morning by ſix of the Clock, ſtrong
Guards were placed at the end of every Street, and every Gate
about the City and Suburbs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all others of any
Note and Strength: So that it was generally concluded by the
Proteſtants, there were Forces landed from <hi>England;</hi> but they
were ſoon undeceived, being all diſarm'd and eis'd of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which for the preſent was judged by every place to be
only in it ſelf, but was ſoon known to be general to all parts
where their Power could then reach. In <hi>Dublin</hi> they ſeized all
the Churches to put the Arms in, which not being brought ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their expectation, <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> iſſued out a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all ſuch as had yet detain'd their Arms, ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
deliver them up upon peril of being left to the mercy of
his Souldiers; and that Gentlemen might keep their wearing
Swords: however ſome broke them to pieces, others flung
them into Ditches and Rivers, where many were afterwards
found, and ſome kept them ſtill. The two next days they ſent
Forces to ſuppreſs thoſe of <hi>Summerhil</hi> before-mentioned; and
one <hi>Price</hi> who had been Treaſurer formerly, was with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of 4 or 500 Horſe and Foot, in a Caſtle in the County of
<hi>Wicklow,</hi> 20 miles on the other ſide of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who took <hi>Price,</hi>
and ſeveral others, and committed them Priſoners to <hi>Newgate</hi>
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the reſt to <hi>Wicklow,</hi> whither <hi>Price</hi> and the reſt
were, after four days, carried and Indicted for High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but all the Iriſh being gone for Souldiers, and the Engliſh
fled out of the Country, there could not be a Jury got, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom they made Exceptions for want of Freehold; ſo
that their Trial was remitted to the Term now (at the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this) ſitting in <hi>Dublin;</hi> in the mean time all but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
were bailed, and after with their Bail fled for <hi>England,</hi>
where moſt of them now are to confirm the Tragical Story.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> having thus eaſily ſucceeded ſo far, the ſame week
ſent 24000 Men towards the North, under the command of
Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (who was once a Priſoner here)
with ſeveral Field-pieces and Mortars, who upon the firſt of
<hi>March</hi> were got near 50 mile, from <hi>Dublin</hi> and within five
miles of the Proteſtant Forces; who upon no ice of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
forthwith aſſembled what they could together, which
were not 1500, near a place called <hi>Drummore;</hi> but upon the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98803:15"/>
Enemies approach, they found them ſo numerous, that the
Lord <hi>Mount-Alexander</hi> thought fit to retire, and accordingly
did; which the Iriſh perceiving, purſued them about five
miles, and killed about 150 of the Proteſtants, and many of
them ſuch as never were in Arms, but running away in the
hurry: The Ld <hi>Mount-Alexander,</hi> and many others, got away
for <hi>England;</hi> ſome for <hi>Colerain,</hi> and afterward to <hi>London-derry,</hi>
or <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the mean time the Iriſh proceeded towards <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
and found no oppoſition till they came thither; but for
the firſt 15 or 16 miles found nothing but ruin'd Houſes, and
the Ditches fuil of Houſhold-goods, Meal and Corn, thrown
away by the Proteſtants to prevent its falling into the hands
of their mercileſs devouring Enemy; but afterwards they did
not find ſo much, the People having more time to carry it with
them, and ſo left the Iriſh without any Relief but what they
brought with them; ſo that both Men and Horſes in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Army were in a bad condition for want of Food and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>After all this Succeſs, King-<hi>James</hi> landed at <hi>Kingſale,</hi> on
<hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 12. and for want of Bells, was welcomed
with the Shouts and Acclamations of the People, Bonfires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and the next day went to <hi>Cork,</hi> and ſtayed there till <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>
came to him at Major Gen. <hi>Mac Carties;</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the
<hi>20th,</hi> ſet out from thence, and lay that Night at the Earl of
<hi>Cork</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Lifmore;</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night at <hi>Clonmel;</hi> on
<hi>Friday</hi> Night at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Caſtle; and
on <hi>Saturday</hi> night at Sir <hi>Maurice Euſtaces</hi> near <hi>Kilkullen</hi>-Bridg,
17 miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all along the Roads, had the Lanes
and Hedges lin'd with the Half-pike &amp; Bayonet-Rabble, call'd
<hi>Reparees:</hi> At <hi>Carloe</hi> he was ſlabber'd with the kiſſes of the rude
Country Iriſh Gentlewomen, ſo that he was forced to beg to
have them kept from him; and on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>24th</hi> about
Noon, he entred the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi> where all the Souldiers
were placed, from St. <hi>James</hi>'s-Gate (at his firſt entrance) to the
Caſtle-Gate, all along, for about a mile of Ground on both
ſides, the Streets which were every where ſtrewed with freſh
Cravel: And at his firſt entrance into the Liberty of the City,
there was a Stage built covered with Tapeſtry, and thereon
two playing on Welch-Harps; and below a great number of
Friers, with a large Croſs, ſinging; and about 40 Oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenches,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98803:15"/>
Poultry and Herb-women, in White (and among
them ſome known to have two or three Baſtards, yet paſſing
for Maids) dancing, who thence ran along to the Caſtle by his
ſide, here and there ſtrewing Flowers; ſome hung out of their
Balconies Tapeſtry, and Cloath of Arras; and others imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
them, ſewed together the Coverings of Turkey-work
Chairs, and Bandle-Cloth Blankets, and hung them out like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
on each ſide of the Street. He rid along through the
whole Country, moſtly on Horſe-back, but chiefly through
all the Towns and Villages. About a mile from <hi>Dublin</hi> he
call'd for a freſh Pad-Nag, which turning about to be brought
him, got looſe, and forced him to ſtay; which did in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
vex him, ſo that he ſaid to <hi>Tyrconnel, I think you are all
boder'd;</hi> but the Pad being ſoon brought him, he mounted,
and marched forward, and at the utmoſt Limits was met by
the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Common Council, Maſter, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and Brethren of the ſeveral Companies in their Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the King and Herald at Arms, Purſevants, and Servants
of the Houſhold, and there received the Sword of State,
(which he gave to <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> who carried it before him through
the City) and the Sword and Keys of the City, and there
had a Speech made to welcome him to that Loyal City and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by Counſellor <hi>Dillion,</hi> who that Morning was ſworn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder
in the room of Counſellor <hi>Barnwel.</hi> From thence he ſet
forward toward the Caſtle, preceded by five or ſix Coaches,
with ſix Horſes each, two Callaſhes, four or five Bung-Carts,
and one cloſe Waggon attended by five or ſix French Troopers;
next them followed about 200 of the Straglers of the City that
went out to meet him; and after them the aformentioned <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
Major to the Royal Regiment, bareheaded, giving Orders
to the Souldiers to keep the middle of the Street clear, and
ſtand with their Muſquets ſhouldred; then 29 Horſemen bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
ſhouting before Mr. <hi>Fitz-James</hi> who was alone in one
of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Coaches with ſix Horſes; cloſe after him followed
three Officers of the Guard on Horſeback, attended by 3 Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Horſes;
after them 15 or 16 Officers of the Army, cloſely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the five Trumpets and Kettle-Drums of State in their
Liveries; after them about 20 of the Gentlemen at large on
Horſeback; then the Meſſengers and Purſevants, Servants of
the Houſhold; next them the Herald and King at Arms; cloſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98803:16"/>
after them <hi>Tyrcounel,</hi> carrying the Sword of State immediately
before the late K. <hi>James,</hi> who rid on the aforeſaid Pad-Nag, in a
plain Cinnamon-colour'd Cloth Suit, and black ſlouching Hat,
and a George hung over his Shoulder with a blew Ribbon;
he was attended by the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> Lord <hi>Granard,</hi> and
the aforeſaid Maids running by him on his left hand, the Lord
<hi>Powis</hi> and <hi>Melfort</hi> on his Right, with their Hats on; cloſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him followed a Troop of Dragoons, ſeveral Gentlemen
and Officers, two Troops of Horſe, and many Attendants; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them ſix Lords Coaches, with ſix Horſes each; then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Judg <hi>Keating</hi> in Scarlet; and next after his three other
Gentlemens Coaches empty, with ſix Horſes each; then three
Coaches, with two Horſes each; and then laſt of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
Rabble on Foot.</p>
            <p>As he was riding along in this Order, one <hi>Flemming</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
mad Scots-man, in <hi>Skinner-row,</hi> the middle of the City,
ſuddenly ruſhed through the Croud, flung his Hat over the
King's Head, crying, in French, with a loud Voice, <hi>Let the King
live for ever,</hi> caught ſuddenly (mad-man like) faſt hold of the
King's Hand, and kiſt it, and ſo ran capering after his Hat.</p>
            <p>As he marched thus along, the Pipers of the ſeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
played the Tune of, <hi>The King enjoys his own again;</hi> and
the People ſhouting and crying, <hi>God ſave the King:</hi> And
if any Proteſtants were obſerved not to ſhew their Zeal
that way, they were immediately revil'd and abuſed by the
rude Papiſts: And being come thus to the Caſtle, alighted from
his Horſe, and was met at the Gate by the Hoſt, over-ſhaded
with a Canopy bore up by four Popiſh Biſhops, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a numerous Train of Friers ſinging, and others of
that Clergy; and among the reſt the Titular Primate with a
Triple Crown upon his Head repreſenting the Pope; who this
unfortunate and by-gotted Prince no ſooner ſaw, but he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
went down upon his Knees to pray to the Image, and for a
Bleſſing from this Iriſh Pope: And from thence conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chappel there, (made by <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> of <hi>Hen. Cromwel</hi>'s
Riding-houſe) where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung for his happy Arrival;
thence he retired into an Appartment prepared in a new Houſe
built before in the Caſtle by <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and there din'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
himſelf: The next Morning he call'd a Council, and
having turn'd out the Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> Chairman, Judg <hi>Keating,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98803:16"/>
&amp;c.</hi> and taken in their rooms M. <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> the Bp of <hi>Chiſter,</hi>
and Lieut. Col. <hi>Darrington,</hi> he ordered five ſeveral Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be publiſhed; one for raiſing ſuch Monies as paſſed
there, <hi>viz.</hi> a Guiny to <hi>24s.</hi> an Engliſh Shilling to <hi>13d.</hi> a Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoon
which was <hi>6s.</hi> to <hi>6s. 3d.</hi> a Cob of <hi>4s. 9d.</hi> to <hi>5s.</hi> a
Cob of <hi>4s. 6d.</hi> to <hi>4s. 9d.</hi> a French <hi>Lewis</hi> of Gold to <hi>19s.</hi> and
all others proportionably. Another for a Parliament to meet at
<hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> for regulating Matters Eccleſiaſtical. A
third to require all his Subjects of that Kingdom that had lately
left the ſame, upon any Pretence whatever, to return Home,
with aſſurance of his Protection, but no Penalty or Forfeiture
for not returning, or Pardon for any Offender that did; and
requiring all his Subjects, of what Degree or Perſwaſion
ſoever, to join with him againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> A
fourth, commending all his Roman-Catholick Subjects for their
Vigilancy and Care in arming themſelves; yet, whereas it had
incouraged ſome certain Robberies, required all but ſuch as
were actually under Command and Pay in the Army, to lay up
their Arms in their ſeveral Abodes. The fifth, to invite the
Country to carry Proviſion to his Army in the North; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all Officers and Souldiers not to take any from them but
what they made good pay for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From thence went into the Field
to ſee the Forces drawn out, and there made <hi>Darrington</hi> Colonel
of the Royal Regiment in the room of the Duke of <hi>Ormond;</hi> and
returning to the Caſtle, created <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day he received an Expreſs that his Forces in the
North, having ſate down before <hi>Colerain,</hi> were deſtroyed for
want of Meat and Forrage, and by a great Snow that then
fell among them, were beaten off with the loſs of 5 or 600 Men,
one Morter, and 3 Field-peices: whereupon he call'd another
Council, and ordered 14000 Men more forthwith to be ſent to
reinforce the remainder of the 24000 that went before; and
on the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> ſent after them the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and
the two French Liutenant-Generals, <hi>Roos</hi> and <hi>Mamoon;</hi> and the
<hi>Munday</hi> following, about 8 in the Morning, ſet out from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
towards the North himſelf; but thoſe of <hi>Coleraine</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their infuſſiciency to reſiſt ſo powerful a Force, quitted the
Town, and got ſome for <hi>London-Derry,</hi> ſome for <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and others for <hi>England,</hi> ſo that all being clear, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hinder their Progreſs to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> where being
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98803:17"/>
arrived, the late King ſent in a Letter to the Governor, Col.
<hi>Lundee</hi> (who before they left <hi>Dublin</hi> they reported to be their
own Creature) to require him peaceably to ſurrender, and
that all with him ſhould have free Pardon and Protection, and
not be moleſted or ſpoyl'd of any thing they had; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhown to the Mayor, Aldermen, and other Officers, ſome
inclin'd to ſurrender, others not, ſo that time was deſired and
granted to conſider of it; in the interim Col. <hi>Richards</hi> and
Col. <hi>Cunningham,</hi> with their Regiments, arrived before the
place, and being inform'd that it was upon ſurrendering to
King <hi>James,</hi> returned back (with 14 or 1500 perſons that fled
from the Town to them, intending for <hi>Leverpool</hi>) for which both
the Colonels were turn'd out of Commiſſion, yet their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with three others, were forthwith ordered back; and
its hoped have ſince entred the place, which is in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for Defence, and therein 20000 Men, but not above
9000 Arm'd, with Proviſion for three months, reſolved to
defend it to the laſt, having before their arrival, committed
the Governor, and ſeveral others to Priſon, on pretence for
endeavouring to betray it to their Enemies, and made Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
(a Miniſter) their Governour.</p>
            <p>The late King perceiving his Preſence could not procure
this Important Place at the eaſy rate he expected, was forced
to wave his ſpeedy Deſign for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and leaving his Army
to proſecute the moſt convenient meaſures for its Recovery,
returned back towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> to meet his Parliament, where
he was expected the laſt of <hi>April,</hi> and where upon his firſt
arrival, he gave orders to disband Col. <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Newcome,</hi> and ſuch others Proteſtants as till then continued in
that Army, except Drums and Trumpets, who are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>per</hi> force.</p>
            <p>There came with the late King to <hi>Kingſale</hi> 22 Ships, great
and ſmall, all with Guns, of which 12 were Capital Ships,
and with them 4 Fireſhips, and in them not above 50 perſons
of all ſorts, of which were the Kings two Sons, the Biſhop of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> Lord <hi>Melfort,</hi> Col. <hi>Darrington, Sarsfeild,</hi>
9 or 10 French-men, 1 Footman, and other Scoundrels that
followed him from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That day week after his Arrival, and before he left <hi>Cork,</hi>
the late King gave orders for the Fleet to return to <hi>Breſt,</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98803:17"/>
joyn a Fleet of 13 Sail more which they left fitting out there,
and expected to bring them 5 or 6000 Engliſh, Scots, and
Iriſh, raiſed in <hi>France</hi> for that purpoſe, but not yet come. He
brought with him a conſiderable quantity of Powder, Ball,
and Lead, and Arms for 15000 Men, and <hi>120000l. Sterling,</hi>
and nothing more, all which is ſaid to be diſpoſed of by one
ſent with him by the French King, and who hath promiſed
four Times as much more if that be well imployed. The
giving <hi>Ireland</hi> to the French is not certain, but moſt ſure that
it is the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> to give King <hi>James</hi> all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
he can, both by Sea and Land, to keep <hi>England</hi> out of
his own Bowels, which without that Diverſion he expects
forthwith to make a violent Eruption therein; and as certain,
that if any reaſonable Force be in reaſonable Time ſent for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> its conqueſt will be both ſpeedy and eaſy; for tho
the Iriſh Forces are with much pains and beating reaſonably
diſciplin'd, and numerous, yet all that know the nature of
them, know they will not ſight but upon great Advantage;
and if once broken, all the Art of Man will never bring them
together again: And thoſe of their preſent Army, both
Officers and Souldiers, are moſtly the very ſcum of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Cow-boys, and ſuch traſh, as tremble at the fireing a
Muſquet, much more will at many; and what one Engliſh Man
uſed formerly to make nothing to beat 9 or 10 of, and now
are only like ſo many tied Dogs let looſe, which with a little
Correction, will ſoon be reduced to Obedience. There are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
enow yet in <hi>Ireland</hi> to do the Work alone, if they could
but get together, have Arms, and good Officers to head them,
and will, as faſt as even they can, join with the Army that
comes to their relief, to be revenged upon the devouring Iriſh,
who having now all, will be rich plunder for an Army, and
cannot hold out againſt 30000 Men, beſides what is already
there, till <hi>Michalmaſs</hi> next, though now poſſeſt of the whole,
except <hi>London-Derry</hi> and <hi>Inneskillen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> there is not
now above 16 or 17 hundred Souldiers, and yet at leaſt
20000 Proteſtants, fighting Men, but all diſarm'd, or as good
as diſarm'd, brave brisk curious Lads, mad to be at work: So
that 4 or 5000 Men might take and ſecure that City and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and be in one Month 20000 Men, if Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were ſent with them, in ſpight of any reſiſtance the Iriſh
could make.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:98803:18"/>
Among the Iriſh, the moſt miſchievous Perſon is the Lord
<hi>Galmoy,</hi> who, upon the late King's coming to the Throne,
preſum'd to enter in time of Divine Service, <hi>St. Warborous</hi>
Church in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and debauchedly offered Abuſes to ſome
modeſt Women, for which he was brought upon his Knees:
But in Revenge, upon the firſt motion to the North, he haug'd
one <hi>Dix,</hi> and another who belonged to the Colledg, upon a
Sign-poſt, pretending he found them in Arms.</p>
            <p>Of Turn-coats, there were many pittiful mean-ſpirited Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
to keep and creep into Buſineſs, none worth noting, but
one <hi>Marby</hi> Dean of <hi>London derry,</hi> a Papiſt born, but brought up
in the Colledg of <hi>Dublin:</hi> and one <hi>Turner,</hi> who in his Time
had turn'd through almoſt all Sects and Opinions; and for his
laſt turning got to be Recorder of <hi>Limerick.</hi> However the
Popiſh Clergy have not been wanting, by all manner of ways,
to pervert whoever they could, nor the Proteſtant Miniſters to
preach againſt their Hereſy and Idolatry; among the reſt, one
<hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Palmers.</hi> Town near <hi>Dublin,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi>
briskly decrying their Idolatry, was by the Biſhop of
<hi>Dublin</hi> ſilenc'd in the midſt of his Sermon.</p>
            <p>Many Perſons endeavouring to bring Mony for <hi>England,</hi> had it ſeiz'd by the
Iriſh; and among others one <hi>Lindon,</hi> who all along ſate with two Papiſts, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Judg of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> to try ſeveral Proteſtants, and puniſh them too
for no other Crime, out being Enemies to Popery; and particularly one
<hi>Whalley,</hi> there famous for Aſtrology, for publiſhing and ſpreading an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing in <hi>England,</hi> his Declaration, and
Succeſs, was, by their worſhipful Lordſhips, ſingled out, and made the
firſt publick Sacrifice by their Popiſh Mercy, for his Zeal to the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to the extream hazard of his Life, and loſs of all he had (tho often
craved) denying him the common Rules of Court, a Copy of the Indictment,
and what elſe might enable him to make his proper Defence: Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be Diſtracted, fined <hi>14l. Sterling;</hi> and others for like Crimes, like Caſes.
But whether for theſe, or other good Service to be done here for his Friends
there, the good Judg got his Monies again, while others came off with loſs of
theirs: But what ſays <hi>Pluck?</hi>

            <p>About three or four days after King <hi>James</hi> Arrived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the few Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving this Opportunity of a Friend of both yours
and mine coming to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> I thought fit not to omit
giving you this brief Account of what has happened
here ſince your departure: Which is, that before the Duke of
<hi>Berwick</hi> got to <hi>Colerain,</hi> it was quietly quitted by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;
who no ſooner found themſelves attaqued on all ſides,
but moſt of the Men ſtole away by Night, ſome one way, and
ſome another, and left their Wives, Children, and Effects,
to the diſcretion of our Army; who by the care of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
proved more kind and civil to them than their own
People, who running away, pull'd down the Bridg to hinder
their being purſued: However, that Defect was ſoon repair'd,
and our Forces having nothing more to hinder them, marched
directly for <hi>London-derry,</hi> and upon the King's coming up,
ſate down before it, on the <hi>19th</hi> of the laſt Month; and
thereupon the King ſent <hi>John Burton</hi> (a Proteſtant) one of
the Trumpeters attending the State here, to Summon the
Town to Surrender, with aſſurance of Pardon from the King;
and to let them know he was there in Perſon, to ſign and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
whatever was promiſed them. Whereupon the Town
returned Anſwer, That they had ſworn Allegiance to, and
kept the Town for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98803:19"/>
owned, knew, or would obey any other; and that if
any more ſuch Meſſengers came thither, to frighten and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
their People from their Allegiance, they would hang or
ſhoot them: However the King had ſuch Intereſt within the
place, as to keep out two Regiments ſent thither from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
But ſeeing they refuſed to ſubmit, ordered Batteries to
be raiſed, and his Canon and Bombs to be plaid at the Town;
and though much Miſchief is done by the Bombs, yet the
new preaching Governor (<hi>viz.</hi> the Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
obſtinate, and in two or three brisk Sallies, killed about
4 or 5000 of our Common Souldiers, the French General <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou,</hi>
one Major, five Captains, and ſeveral other Inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and wounded the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> in the Thigh; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Sheldon,</hi> and ſome others, are ſaid to be mortally
wounded, but not without conſiderable loſs on their ſide alſo.
In the mean time another Party of our Men, commanded by
Lieut. Gen. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Kilmore;</hi> which will
ſo cut off all hopes of Succour, that it's hoped <hi>Derry</hi> will
alſo Surrender, and receive Mercy, for otherwiſe it's reſolved
to put all to the Sword. The King finding them obſtinate,
return'd to <hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and this day met the
Parliament, where he made a ſhort, but pithy Speech, ſetting
forth how much they <hi>were obliged, firſt to God, and next to the
King of</hi> France, <hi>for contributing to that their happy Meeting;
and hoped they would not be wanting on their parts, forthwith
to conſider of all convenient Meaſures to unite the Hearts of all
his good Subjects of this Kingdom, reſist the intended Invaſion from</hi>
England, <hi>and recover his Dominions, for the Glory of God, and
Eaſe of his Subjects both in Church and State.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi>
the Attorney General, is choſen Speaker of the Houſe of
Commons, who made a Speech to the Houſe, telling them how
much they were obliged to the French King, and the Duke of
<hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> for that glorious Meeting, and how meet it was to
return both their Thanks. The Speeches will be printed, with
a Liſt of the Parliament, till then I cannot be certain of the
Particulars of either, but believe there are not many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
among them. It's hoped that the King will conſent to
take off <hi>Poynings</hi> Acts, diſſolve the Act of Settlement, and
reſtore the ancient Proprietors to their Eſtates: But others
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98803:19"/>
are of Opinion, an <hi>Iriſh Parliament cannot do it without the Advice
of</hi> England; and that the Seſſions will be ſoon Prorogued to
prevent ſuch Diſputes, till the King hath got into <hi>England,</hi>
which we here ſeem to promiſe our ſelves about the beginning
of <hi>June,</hi> but cannot attempt it before for want of Forrage
and Shipping, which are coming from <hi>France</hi> to waft them
over; in the mean time there is 5000 foot ordered forthwith
for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to keep the Highlanders, and others the King's
Friends there, from fainting, till more can be ſent them. We
conclude, we can ſpare a formidable Army of Horſe and Foot
for <hi>England,</hi> and the like for <hi>Scotland;</hi> who with greater
Supplies we expect at the ſame time to land in <hi>England</hi> from
<hi>France,</hi> and the King's Friends yet in <hi>England,</hi> who want only
our preſence to join with us, will, with the loſs of as little Blood
as he loſt them, recover thoſe his Kingdoms again. We have
(as we hear) ſent you home <hi>Herbert</hi> by weeping Croſs to reſit
his Shipping. We received into this Kingdom, ſince you left it,
5 or 6 Regiments of Engliſh, Scots, and Iriſh Souldiers from
<hi>France; 250000l. Sterling;</hi> Arms for 20000 Men, 300 Barrels
of Powder, ſeveral Mortars, and a great quantity of Ball and
Lead; 36 Sail of Men of War, 8 Fire-Ships, &amp; ſeveral Tenders,
and daily expect as many more, in all a Fleet of near 50 Sail; and
doubt not but before <hi>Herbert</hi> return, to have ſufficient to ſend
him and the Dutch as faſt back as they come to us. There has
none of the Perſons that were Condemned when you went
hence, yet ſuffered; but the King declares, if he have not
ſpeedy Exchanges for them, he will not ſpare one of them, or
any other that ſhall be found guilty of the like Crimes; and
if ſo, moſt of the Proteſtants in the Kingdom will go to pot;
for there are but few, if duly examined, but will be by our
Judges brought under the ſame Preliminaries.</p>
            <p>There are ſome to be tried now at the <hi>King's Bench</hi> this
Term, and it's thought Mr. <hi>Price</hi> the late Treaſurer, and his
ſix Companions, will be of the Number, unleſs ſome Exchanges
come ſuddenly for them. There are Indictments already drawn
up for them, or rather to be preferr'd againſt them. Some few
People have had their Houſes rifled, and among the reſt yours,
but not by Authority, tho the King have declared, That all
ſuch as are not returned, ſhall forthwith have all their Effects
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98803:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeiz'd and converted toward maintaining his Army, and ſuch
as fled hither from <hi>England:</hi> However great care is taken for
civilizing our Army, but cannot make them quite forſake their
old Trade; ſome Injuries are here and there ſtill continued,
but not ſo frequently as formerly, the King having declared
his Reſolution ſeverely to puniſh all Offenders of that kind;
and on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, ſeveral that belonged to the Army were
Indicted for Robberies committed upon Proteſtants, but a good
Jury will eaſily acquit them. I have great hopes to retrieve
ſome of your Loſſes again; and not only ſo, but in caſe you
will return, abſolute Aſſurance of a Pardon, and a Captain's
Commiſſion, and this from no leſs than the Ld <hi>Melfort</hi> and Bp
of <hi>Clagher,</hi> Secretaries of State; and therefore conſidering how
Things ſeem now to us, if worthy, would adviſe you not to
neglect the Opportunity thus offered you; for in our ſenſe
here, we ſeem to promiſe our ſelves all we can deſire, and if it
pleaſe God we ſucceed, it will be too late for either you or
others to comply otherwiſe than to your Ruin. All Friends
here are well, and many preſents their Cordial Reſpects, as
doth he that was, and ever is,</p>
