            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOurs of the 20th. inſtant, I did receive; I am glad to hear of your welfare, and cannot but be moſt ready to gratifie your deſire in any thing within my power; you are pleaſed to require mine opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that part of the late <hi>Act for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> which doth impower Juſtices of the Peace to commit <hi>Preachers</hi> unto Priſon upon the <hi>Certificate of a Biſhop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, my private opinion can be of little weight; yet, your Requeſt is to me a Command, and my Conjectures may point you unto more convincing expoſitions on the Act.</p>
                  <p>This Statute doth aſſign Impriſonment in two Caſes, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlicenſed School-Maſters,</hi> and <hi>unlicenſed Preachers;</hi> the laſt is that concerning which you do enquire, and the branch of the Statute doth run thus:</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That if any perſon by this Act diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>

                  <p>The Subject of this penalty, is not every Unlicenſed Preacher, but only an <hi>unlicenſed,</hi> and therefore <hi>diſabled, Lecturer:</hi> Men might Preach as <hi>Parſons</hi> or <hi>Vicars,</hi> any conſtant or curſory occaſional Sermon, and not be lyable to this Penalty; and if any of the Biſhops ſhall make <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate</hi> againſt any man ſo Preaching, the Juſtices have no Authority to commit them, or him, to Priſon; but if a Juſtice of the Peace, or Maior of any Corporation, ſhall commit any perſon on ſuch <hi>Certificate,</hi> the Priſoner may have his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and remedy againſt the Maior or Juſtices.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48215:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir, That my opinion may not come to you naked, and without proof, be pleaſed to obſerve the reaſon on which I ground mine opinion.</p>
                  <p>The perſon ſhall be committed to priſon <hi>for doing that which he was diſabled to do;</hi> but the perſon is only diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to Preach any Lecture or Sermon, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Lecture-Sermon.</p>
                  <p>Sir, This Law doth reſolve a threefold diſablement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Miniſters.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Lecturers not Licenſed, as is directed, are <hi>diſabled</hi> to Preach any <hi>Lecture or Sermon;</hi> and the doing this after diſablement, is that which is puniſhable with <hi>Three months Impriſonment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, that you may ſee <hi>Lecturers,</hi> Preaching, fixed, ſtated <hi>Lecturers,</hi> are the only perſons diſabled, and to be puniſhed, obſerve.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Miniſters, in all other Capacities, are compelled to Conformity by other <hi>pains;</hi> and their non-preaching is provided for by other Remedies: The law preſcribeth not two puniſhments for one offence; but there being a ſort of Miniſters under the notion of <hi>Lecturers,</hi> not barred by any preſcription to Parſons or Vicars; the Law maketh ſpecial proviſion againſt them, and this penalty compels them to Conformity, or puts them to Silence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The perſons diſabled, and work to which they are diſabled, is beſt diſcovered by that appellation by which they are diſcriminated in the Statute, and that is not the name of <hi>Miniſter, Preacher, Parſon,</hi> or <hi>Vicar,</hi> who were all provided againſt in the foregoing part of the Law; but the name of <hi>Lecturer,</hi> which I obſerve, is affected,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48215:4"/>
and all along this part of the Statute, is uſed to predicate the perſon to be <hi>diſabled,</hi> and on doing what he is diſabled, to be <hi>impriſoned:</hi> It beginneth, <hi>No perſon, ſhall be, or be received as a Lecturer,</hi> or allowed to preach as a <hi>Lecturer;</hi> It proceedeth, <hi>every perſon</hi> licenſed, aſſigned or appointed, or received as a <hi>Lecturer;</hi> Again, ſo long as he continueth <hi>Lecturer;</hi> Again, it ſhall be ſufficient for the ſaid <hi>Lecturer;</hi> Again, the <hi>Lecturer</hi> then to Preach, this name doth note his office and work, to which he is diſabled <hi>(viz.)</hi> not ſimple <hi>Preaching,</hi> but <hi>Lecturing,</hi> or Preaching a Lecture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Qualifications, for defect of which he is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled can ſquare to no kind of Preacher, or Preaching, but to <hi>Lecturers</hi> Preaching <hi>Lectures,</hi> for he muſt</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be approved, and <hi>thereunto</hi> Licenſed; <hi>Thereunto</hi> is a Relative, which hath for its Antecedent, not <hi>Perſon, Vicar,</hi> or <hi>Preacher,</hi> but <hi>Lecturer,</hi> and <hi>Lecture:</hi> this is not only plain by the Gramatical Connexion of the words, but alſo by the expreſs tearms ſubjoyned; <hi>Every perſon licenſed, aſſigned, appointed, or received as a Lecturer, to Preach on any day of the week;</hi> Now, Sir, he is only diſabled to do that whereunto he is not licenſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This perſon is required, the <hi>firſt time he preacheth,</hi> to read Common-Prayer, and to declare his aſſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and upon <hi>every firſt Lecture day of every Month, ſo long as he continueth</hi> Lecturer there, and for not doing the ſame he is diſabled to Preach <hi>the ſaid, or any other Lecture, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> the work to which he is diſabled, is a ſtated Service which hath beginning and continuance in return of time, not a curſory tranſient and occaſional Act.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lecturer then to preach muſt be preſent at the reading Common-Prayer <hi>before he Preach his Sermon or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, if the defect of theſe Qualifications diſable, and ſo diſpoſe under the penalty, he that ſhall be thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed muſt be a perſon capable of theſe Qualifications, and that is none but a ſtated <hi>Lecturer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I do not find the leaſt ground for any Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48215:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my opinion, ſave only in this, that the word <hi>(Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)</hi> is uſed in the Statute: and in this proviſion of the penalty; and unto this, I anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sermon</hi> is never uſed alone, and by it ſelf, but ever conjunct with Lecture, and incloſed in the ſame Comma; but when the Printers miſtake is viſible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sermon is joyned to Lecture with this diſcretive <hi>(or)</hi> not disjunctively, but exegetically, to explain the tearm <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;</hi> and hereof there is good Reaſon; for <hi>Lecture</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifieth a <hi>Reading,</hi> but hath been in Vulgar accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation referred unto, and performed by, Preaching: That therefore the Law might not be evaded by an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tearm, the vulgar appellation <hi>Lecture</hi> is explained by the mode of performance, <hi>Lecture</hi> or <hi>Sermon,</hi> and that Sermon is thus exegetical, is evident by theſe Obſervations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Preacher hereby diſabled is throughout this part of the Law, praedicated a <hi>Lecturer,</hi> and not known by any other appellation whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The qualifications before noted, do ſquare with no kind of Preaching or Preacher, but <hi>Lecturer</hi> Preaching a <hi>Lecture-Sermon.</hi>
