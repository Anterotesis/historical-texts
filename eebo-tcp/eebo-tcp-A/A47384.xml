            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>WHen first I read your pious Sheets, it wrought</l>
            <l>Within my Soul such sympathetick Thought,</l>
            <l>I seem'd your Transcript, joying so to be,</l>
            <l>Or else transported as your <hi>Simile.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus ravish'd with my self, I further tried</l>
            <l>To gain converse with you; that amplify'd,</l>
            <l>I found and more improv'd what I had took,</l>
            <l>Your constant Practice doth expound your Book,</l>
            <l>With this difference only, I might call</l>
            <l>That the Copy, you the Original.</l>
            <l>I am so full of you, whate'er I write</l>
            <l>Flows from your Pen, and you do mine indite.</l>
            <l>Your Dream of Heaven is so drawn and plac'd,</l>
            <l>As if of Heaven it self you had a taste,</l>
            <l>And prepossession, which will ever last:</l>
            <l>And your angelick Thoughts, so scatter'd, where</l>
            <l>If Heaven can be on Earth, sure it is there.</l>
            <l>Your Dream of Hell I cannot barely name,</l>
            <l>Vnless I snatch my Finger from your Flame.</l>
            <l>I feel the sting of your Expressions so,</l>
            <l>As if in pain, and forc'd to undergo.</l>
            <l>Death you've drawn to life so clear, that I</l>
            <l>In love with life, by reading chuse to die;</l>
            <l>Vnless I liv'd like you, exalted quite</l>
            <l>With future Ioys, and holy <hi>Anchorite.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Your Poems run so natural you indite,</l>
            <l>It seems a self-denial not to write.</l>
            <l>'Tis much, that in your Age of Eighty eight,</l>
            <l>Your Mind's so full of vigour and of weight,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:59205:3"/>Truly inspired; and as your Days decline,</l>
            <l>The more you write, still that is more Divine.</l>
            <l>There's nothing languid, all your Lines last long,</l>
            <l>Like Honey in a Lion, sweet and strong.</l>
            <l>Proceed (bless'd Sir) and prove exemplar, even</l>

I have also imparted it to some of my most dear and learned Friends, who stick not to say with me, That they admire such <hi>Heavenly Inspirations,</hi> which cannot be called by any other Name, and with they could write the like; and all agree to pray you, that it may be forthwith printed; for the Devotional Part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of transcending, for some Uses, all the deep Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Learning in the World; one Practical Page thereof being, in my Opinion, more acceptable to GOD, and comfortable to the Reader, than a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of critical Authors: And methinks I can say as our Blessed Saviour in another case: <hi>I thank thee, O heavenly Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes. Even so, Father, for so in seemeth good in thy sight,</hi> Luke 10.23. I shall only add this, That whereas you seem in your Letter to give me leave to put out any of your late Meditations, or to correct or transpose any of them, because of some Repetitions you are told are in them, I must really tell you, I am afraid of doing any such thing, for fear or violating such

sacred Raptures; casting with my self, that though they seem to me Repetitions, yet they are no more to be rejected, than the Repetitions of the Lord's Prayer, which hath been so used and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Saviour's own Lips. Thus concluding, I and my Friends nameless, desire you to have them printed before you die. From</p>

               <p>THE Author is advise, instead of an elaborate Preface from some kind Friend, to publish this little Book of his <hi>Midnight and daily Thoughts,</hi> without being polished by a more learned Pen. Tho' some great Clerks do not allow illiterate Men to write Devotion, this Writer does believe, that all Men ought to do some good in this World, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Talent given them by God; and doth therefore humbly hope, to shew such unlearned People as himself, that the Plowman and the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may find the way to Heaven without <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> by an usual exercise of divine Meditations; and also to shew some plain Products of his own Time so spent, by which his Heart does find much Joy by serving God entirely, by frequent practice thereof, with great comfort of Grace here, and some encouraging assurance of Glory in the next World: Which he hopes also may raise other Men's Thoughts to an higher degree of Pleasure and Piety, than his Talent can reach; though he does endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to think himself into Heaven before he is called thither, really believing that a sincere, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Devotion, is as acceptable to God in plain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

as in Wit and Eloquence, which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind understand not.

               <head>On God's wondrous Works.</head>
               <l>GReat are the works of God, and wonders all;</l>
               <l>The first we hear of we do <hi>Chaos</hi> call;</l>
               <l>But in the Scripture it is no-where said,</l>
               <l>How, or of what, <hi>Chaos</hi> it self was made;</l>
               <l>We only know from that confused Name,</l>
               <l>That lump of something, Nothing, all things came.</l>
               <l>Great and good was the work of the first hour,</l>
               <l>'Cause <hi>Chaos</hi> then had no resisting power;</l>
               <l>All things did naturally then submit</l>
               <l>Without dispute, to what our God thought fit,</l>
               <l>Till man was made, the Prince of all the rest,</l>
               <l>And Free-will given, which taught him to contest</l>
               <l>With his Creator, and resist his hand,</l>
               <l>Whose word alone does Heav'n and Earth command.</l>
               <l>To shew us greater wonders yet behind,</l>
               <l>Miracles of a more transcendent kind,</l>
               <l>Our Saviour's Birth, and Resurrection,</l>
               <l>Pre-design'd by God for man's redemption!</l>
               <l>'Tis strange to think, and wonderful to see,</l>
               <l>That man to God so great concern should be!</l>
               <l>Whose heart is full of high antipathy</l>
               <l>To his Commands; fierce to impiety.</l>
               <l>By nature cross, by industry so fram'd,</l>
               <l>That by it self it never can be tam'd;</l>
               <l>Which most accurs'd, resisting quality,</l>
               <l>Only belongs to its carnality.</l>
               <l>So that God's greatest work, we may conclude,</l>
               <l>Is when man's heart by grace is so subdu'd,</l>
               <l>That all its appetites converted be</l>
               <l>From its own nature, unto purity</l>
               <l>Of life towards God, which justly may be thought</l>
               <l>The highest Miracle that e'er was wrought.</l>

               <l>Alas, poor wretched, miserable thing,</l>
               <l>That must be dust! suppose thou wert sole King</l>
               <l>Of all this Earth, and didst the World controul,</l>
               <l>What would it signifie, if thy own Soul</l>

               <l>When that sad hour shall come, what horrours then</l>
               <l>Possess the hearts of such wise worldly men?</l>
               <l>As present joys do seek, and ne'er pretend</l>
               <l>To Heav'n, until it be too late to mend;</l>
               <l>Till sudden death their joys surprize, and Fear</l>
               <l>In high amazement doth unmask'd appear;</l>
               <l>Then those Repiners will want a pretence</l>
               <l>To Courage, and their frighted Souls fly hence,</l>
               <l>As men were made</l>
               <l>To be afraid.</l>
               <l>Thus the Repiners do create their shame,</l>
               <l>While those inspir'd with a bright Christian flame,</l>
               <l>Humbly submit to all from Heaven sent,</l>
               <l>Are thankful, and most happily content,</l>
               <l>When the Divine Hand does remove those toys,</l>
               <l>Which the Repiner counts his only joys.</l>
               <l>But if the holy Spirit do thy heart</l>

                  <l>TEmptation rightly scann'd and understood,</l>
                  <l>Is certainly ordain'd to do us good;</l>
                  <l>To shew that our frail nature ever needs</l>
                  <l>Our prayers for Grace, to justifie our deeds.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Never to be tempted, leaves no trial</l>
                  <l>To measure Vertue by: Self-denial</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59205:13"/>Is the scale; 'tis no merit to forbear</l>
                  <l>To do the things for which we do not care.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To be tempted is no crime; but to yield</l>
                  <l>Unto temptation, and to quit the field</l>
                  <l>To a known Enemy, is worthy blame,</l>
                  <l>When our resistance would the Tempter shame.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Still to be tempted by some high delight,</l>
                  <l>And piously resist that appetite,</l>
                  <l>Does exercise our Faith; 'tis the only way</l>
                  <l>T'express our Love, and shew that we obey.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To be tempted, Honour is, if we do</l>
                  <l>Forbear to act, and quit the object too:</l>
                  <l>Such skirmishes will much advantage gain,</l>
                  <l>Till we a perfect Victory obtain.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To be tempted is a bliss, if we find</l>
                  <l>Sufficient Grace to satisfie the mind;</l>
                  <l>For when we make our master-sin our slave,</l>
                  <l>We joy in Life, and triumph o'er the Grave.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To be tempted unawares by a thought,</l>
                  <l>Or a wish, it is nature, and no fault:</l>
                  <l>If Grace does nip the bud of our desires,</l>
                  <l>Custom in time will teach to quench those fires.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To master all temptation, is a sign</l>
                  <l>That we have something in us more divine</l>
                  <l>Than Nature can afford; by which we know</l>
                  <l>God's Spirit does such Victories bestow.</l>

                  <l>After a dismal night of rain and winds;</l>

                  <l>Full fraught with terrours, darkness and dismay,</l>
                  <l>While sin doth reign, and satan bears the sway.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To be regenerate, is to put on</l>
                  <l>The bright raiment of the Resurrection.</l>
                  <l>The hardest Lesson that was ever taught,</l>
                  <l>The greatest Miracle that e'er was wrought,</l>
                  <l>Was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conversion, and <hi>Mannasseh</hi>'s Crimes</l>
                  <l>Forgiven (the hope and wonder of all times.)</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To be regenerate, does put our God</l>
                  <l>Unto a double task; his Grace and Rod</l>
                  <l>Are both employ'd; for he must first subdue</l>
                  <l>The old man's crimes, ere he can frame a new.</l>
                  <l>It was Christ's highest business to convert</l>
                  <l>Our stubborn hearts, who labour to pervert</l>

               <l>And win our hearts with glitt'ring vanities.</l>
               <l>But if we love not this Captivity,</l>

               <l>A pious fancy rais'd by faith will reach</l>

               <head>To my Friend, to justifie my Retirement.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Do value your Friendship much, and take your Advice very friendly, To forsake my solitary Life, and to return unto the Conversation of my Friends; and this with very civil (though with very sharp) Reflections on my Retirement, in the Opinion of the World (as you say;) as if some Discontent, or love to a lazie Life (rather than Devotion) had made me bury my self alive (which my Age might very well excuse at 88 Years) if I had no better Arguments to justifie my Repose this way. But now you shall have my Reasons at large, which I did not think fit to declare in that Company, at that time. For,</p>
               <p>When I considered how many Years I had lived in Idleness and Vanity, and such Sins as were in fashion with most Men of great Estates, with as full a swing as my wild Fancy could reach: In which kind of short-liv'd, mistaken Felicities, I found no real Satisfaction; but still roving from worse to worse, it pleased God to induce me to think of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and how to get thither by a timely Repentance, in a Retirement from all worldly Delights, and all publick Concerns; but do not pretend to be an inspir'd Quaker, nor a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd Hermit; though I do believe that both those Callings may have pious Men, that do abhorr Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie in Devotion as much as I do, who think it to be the next greatest Sin to that against the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59205:30"/>Yet I must own, that my solitary Life is become so delightful, that my Bosom-Joys are much above all the Pleasures that I have formerly known, and largely shared in the Courts of Four great Kings; in which there might be many Saints (though I was none.) By which I judge, that those who live (as I then did) in the pomp and splendid Crowds of such great <hi>Assemblies,</hi> can seldom have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to delight in frequent Prayers, nor time to relish the deliciousness of such servent <hi>Addresses</hi> unto <hi>Heaven,</hi> as my solitary hours afford me: So that such busie Men are not often refreshed with those daily Comforts, and secret spiritual Joys, as slow in Souls totally resign'd to God: For when God sees the Integrity of such Men's Hearts, as do value their Hopes of <hi>Heaven</hi> above all earthly Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he gives them a cheerful, hearty Devotion, to be their highest Felicity in this World, with great assurance of Glory in the next.</p>
               <p>And whoever will try to live so much alone with God, will find such enlightning Comforts to his Soul, in frequent, servent Prayers and Meditations, as will encrease his Joys until he go to <hi>Heaven</hi>; and all the way thither, will entertain his Heart with celestial Delights, so much above the Pleasure of this World, that they are inessable to be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by words, or to be conceived, but by chose who feel how much spiritual Joys, in a divine Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, does transcend all carnal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with as much elevated hopes of a prepossessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as Men are capable of in this World.</p>
               <p>Though I have read in a divine <hi>Author,</hi> That the Soul that is upon good grounds fully assured of its future Bliss, is already in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and has begun to take possession of Glory. If this be so (as I hope it is) our eternal Bliss begins and fixes here; which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59205:30"/>
ought to bassle the Joys and Troubles of this World, and the Terrour of Death also, with a constant, present Felicity to be with God the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we expire. For I do believe, that God mocks no Man with a hope of <hi>Heaven</hi> that he shall miss of, if he seek it as he ought. I do not say that I do this, but I do averr, That I will not change the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I have in my Retirement, to be a Prince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. I do own God's Mercies to me in every thing, and do serve him the best I can in all things, and do envy no Man's Talents who can serve him better.</p>
               <p>I write not to instruct wise Men, but to shew some <hi>Ideas</hi> of Devotion, for such weak Brains as mine to work upon.</p>
               <p>If these be not good Arguments for my Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I wish that you may find better in your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conversation.</p>

               <l>SInce Saint-like Innocence from Earth is sled,</l>
               <l>And ancient Vertue in most Nations dead,</l>
               <l>It shows Religion so deformed grown,</l>
               <l>By various Sects, that most Men now have none;</l>
               <l>But such vile Pretences for <hi>Ambition,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That <hi>Anti-Christians</hi> only dare to own;</l>
               <l>Tho' covertly too many do combine</l>
               <l>To propagate so wicked a Design,</l>
               <l>Such as no sad Example can prevent,</l>
               <l>Nor make such bloody Tyrants e'er repent;</l>
               <l>Who think an universal <hi>Monarch</hi> might</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59205:35"/>By daily breach of <hi>God</hi>'s direct Command,</l>
               <l>When Love and Charity for Cyphers stand;</l>
               <l>While Fire and Sword do desolations make</l>
               <l>Throughout the World, that will no warning take,</l>
               <l>But still provoke our much-incensed God,</l>
               <l>To smite us with his most devouring Rod,</l>
               <l>To terrifie such Sinners in our Times,</l>
               <l>As do exceed bold <hi>Korah</hi>'s fatal Crimes;</l>
               <l>With flaming Streams and gaping Earth devour</l>
               <l>Millions of Men, with Cities, in one hour.</l>
               <l>That makes us shake, and in amazement stand,</l>
               <l>To think our Dooms-day may be near at hand;</l>
               <l>When Seas may swallow Islands on command,</l>

               <l>That we are now chastiz'd for that offence,</l>

               <p>IT has been asked, How a Soul may know when her Sins are forgiven? and answered thus: When she finds the same affection to God, with his that said, <hi>I hate iniquity, and all false ways I utterly abhorr.</hi>
Yet <hi>David,</hi> who said so, did die, and so must we. Tho' our Souls may, by the same grace, become of the same temper with his, and our sins be forgiven too; yet we may consider how few Men do slip out of this World into eternity, with a joyful hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty delight to be with God (through divine Love) which is the highest perfection of an holy life; and is our greatest assurance to manifest our sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, when our Souls are by faith so fixed on God, as to know no joy so great as such spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts do raise, when we desire to be in Heaven; which taught <hi>David</hi> to hate iniquity, and to abhorr all false ways; and so reduced him from all his sins, to become a man after God's own Heart.</p>

               <p>I Have read in a divine Author, That if God be with us, he will make us see that he is with us; and will not depart from our sight, until he has brought us never to depart out of his. Which is a Lesson of high concern to Men in his World; for Thus to enjoy God here, is to be in Heaven before we die. When our souls are thus transported with a continual divine Conversation with Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, we may taste and relish his celestial Joys to some degree, so as to envite us to value his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comforts above all carnal Fruitions. So that our great Business is to improve this Blessing to the highest reach of humane Fancy, by a daily practice of holy Meditions, to contemplate and observe how God doth infuse this joyful enjoying of Him into our souls, by the secret working of the Holy Ghost; when we set our selves with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous integrity to find him there, to conserve with us on this great lesson of his immense Mercy, with our humble prayers to be enlightned from above, to participate of such angelical Delights, as far as our frail Nature will admit of; which by frequent use, will bring us to such an habit of holy living, that God <hi>God</hi> will manifest his presence ever with us, by an inward Felicity of Divine Comforts, to such an assurance of our Election unto eternal Bliss, as is ineffable to be described: So that when we raise our Thoughts with a divine Desire, to know as much of <hi>God</hi> as we can know, and of his being with us, he will add of his <hi>Grace</hi> to enlarge our Capacities to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59205:43"/>
such heavenly Trances in Devotion, that we shall be with him, and he with us, as we do with, with such a joy as will dread all diverting Occasions that shall obstruct those Emanations of his holy Spirit working in us.</p>
               <p>And thus if we do entertain our selves by such frequent addresses to find <hi>God,</hi> he will daily meet, and ever dwell with us, if we unseignedly desire to dwell with him; and will give us such a glimpse of his eternal Bliss, as may fix our hearts on Heaven, and make us live every moment in a joyful Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death's quickest Summons thither; and by this frequent entertainment of thy Soul with <hi>God,</hi> Thou, my Friend, wilt find such a communication with <hi>God</hi> on Earth, to be the highest Perfection of Piety, and a felicity much more delightful than all other Diversions, which can never reach such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphick Joys, as I with to thee my Friend.</p>

               <head>On the Fear of Death.</head>
               <p>IF we fully consider our manifold Sins, and the horrid Judgment due unto us for them, it may well be said, Happy is that Man who can obtain such a Reconciliation with God before he die, as daily to delight in the meditation of a sudden death, with inward assurance of his eternal Bliss the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he expires. Because all our <hi>Ideas</hi> of the divine Felicities above, do seldom invite Men to welcome Death with cheerful Hearts: Our fears are so much stronger than our Faith, that too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men do rather think, than find they do believe that Christ's plenteous Redemption will cancel all their Crimes, and bring them into Heaven; and therefore dare not really rejoyce to look on death; but start back from such angelick Happiness, as he brings good Men to participate of, in God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, which natural infirmity of doubting, can only, by an illustrious Faith, be removed; and that Faith, by frequent Prayers, be obtained. Then, thus to live, and so to die, will make us live and die in great tranquility, though not to reach St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Faith, who saw <hi>Heaven</hi> open to him; yet to so great a degree of divine Raptures in Devotion, as to be filled with elevations of an inward assurance of our Election, which must come from God, when the Soul is in such a blessed Trance of celestial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that is inessable to be described. How near such joy is to the joy we read of in Paradise; when servent Zeal is by a lively Faith so raised, and fixed in God by frequent Meditations, it is a wonder that such Men can fear to die, or doubt togo to God with cheerful Hearts, when thus invited, and thus led by his holy Spirit, with such bright illuminations of surprizing joys, while those divine Flames last, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

               <l>'TIs very strange the World should still comply,</l>
               <l>To think that Death is sent to make us dye,</l>
               <l>By leading us to Immortality:</l>
               <l>And the same moment does our souls convoy</l>
               <l>From worldly slavery to eternal joy.</l>
               <l>So that we ought to find some other Name</l>
               <l>For God's great Messenger, that bears our blame</l>
               <l>Alone, tho' Life and Death are both the same</l>
               <l>Moment our eternal Lot, to end this strife,</l>
               <l>We may treat Death as our first step to Life:</l>
               <l>No terror find by our remove from hence,</l>
               <l>When all our Happiness proceeds from thence.</l>

            <p>IF Heaven be what we read, or hear and see, or do believe to be the glorious Habitation of the more glorious <hi>Trinity,</hi> that we pretend to love, to obey, to truth, worship and adore, as one united God, who has created Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and from whom we do expect eternal happiness, when our Souls expire. How can we justifie this Creed, if in our actions we daily do transgress what we so daily do prosess, as if our present mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did afford us more concern, to pamper fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Flesh for being Worms meat in the Grave, above the nourishing of our Souls with heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> to endure unto eternity.</p>
            <p>If this be Gospel-Truth (as I think it is) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but wish and pray, that my Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may produce the like Effects in others, by reading what I write, to obtain the high Felicity I privately enjoy, transcending all the glittring Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I have seen, and too largely sharedin; but now know no Felicity in this World, to be compar'd unto the Joy of living ever ready to go out of it, which is not so easily done, as said, though we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all we can.
<q>
                  <l>Now, Reader, I have nothing else to say;</l>
                  <l>But wish thee Grace to meditate and pray,</l>
                  <l>Which will high joys create, and teach thee why</l>
                  <l>True Piety will never fear to dye,</l>

               <p>MY good Old Friend, why so sad? does thy Age decline so fast? that the <hi>Idea</hi> of thy Grave frights thee with fear to die. Are we not all dying? and none knows who shall go next, nor how soon be gone; if this occasion thy dismay, I will teach thee an Antidote that will dispell the Poyson of that Serpent's bite, and turn that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal carse of Death, into a State of Bliss; if thou can'st raise thy dejected Spirit to a quick sense of sharing the Eternal Joys of Heaven, with those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59205:51"/>
Saints, who by Faith, Prayer, and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, are now exalted thither.</p>
               <p>Let thy melancholy Meditations and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Grave, be changed from a Gaol deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; into a constant, chearful, zealous Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in thy Divine Retirements, with God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; by a total Resignation of thy Soul, and all thy concerns unto them; and think with pleasure how near thou art arrived to thy Journeys end, to be with them in Paradise. Then such Celestial Thoughts will be thy most pleasant entertainment, and surely meet with surprising joy from Faith in Christ's plenteous Redemption; which will beget a hearty, speedy welcome unto Death's arrival, who comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee to Eternal Bliss; and thou wilt also find, that every devout step towards this felicity of thy approaching Salvation; will make thy heart dance with a Saint-like delight, to battle the terrors of the Grave; with a serene prospect of thy Eternal Happiness at hand; and so make thy last hours full of Angelical transporting joy to be with God, the moment thy Soul expires; fix thy heart thus, and all sad Thoughts will vanish, when a sincere Faith becomes predominant.

               <p>MY Friend, thou dost well to celebrate thy Birth-day, as a vow'd Sacrifice to God; because he did reserve the first born to himself of Living Creatures, and thou art one; But let not thy Altar be adorn'd with a superfluous Treat, with too many slagons of rich Wine, and Tables throng'd with Wealthy Guests, as if it were a Bacchanalian Feast: But such a moderate Meal for thy own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, with some Poor Neighbours, that may so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly rejoyce to see a New Year begin, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious prospect of thy insuing happiness; and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59205:53"/>
pray thy Piety and charity may Shine round about thy Habitation here on Earth, until thou art ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to Heaven.</p>

               <head>Death is the Beggars highest Holiday.</head>
               <p>'TIs but a saint Felicity, that any Man can have in all the Honours, Treasures, and Pleasures of this World, without a joyful inward assurance of his Salvation; when the next moment, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Neighbour, or a Tyrant Prince, can end his days: Or Sickness by tormenting pains turn all his joy into sorrow while he lives; with despairing terrors worse than all, at the approach of Death; when a poor pious Beggar, will die transported full of Celestial Joys for his highest Holiday, and be as welcome into Heaven, as the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.

                     <l>And therefore may be well and truly said,</l>
                     <l>Both Souls are of the same sine Substance made.</l>

               <p>WHY now so joyful my good Friend? has thy Princes smiles this Morning added new fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to thy Heart? that makes it fly so high His frowns to morrow may turn those gay feathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Lead; tho' thou deserve not such a change: Consider now such frequent sad Fates, as do besal the craftiest Men, that only truth in mortal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for their support in Princes savours; and raise thy Souls delight in Service of the King of Kings, whose savours will endure unto Eternity,

above the reach of Earthly Storms; and then thy Prince's favours will have a sure foundation to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on, with higher joys than any Sycophants black Arts, by Malice or by Envy can disturb thy Peace or Pleasures; when a good Conscience is so cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and so fix'd on God. For no Man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, the constant felicity, of a strict pious Life, in all conditions; but he that is so reconciled with a lively Faith to God, as chearfully to part with all the glitt'ring Bubbles of this World, to enjoy everlasting Bliss in Heaven, which ought to be the supreme hope of our best endeavours.</p>

               <l>To change the pow'r of that severe Intail;</l>
               <l>Tho' all our Hearts, and Souls do still agree,</l>
               <l>To frame our Minds to God's most bless'd Decree</l>
