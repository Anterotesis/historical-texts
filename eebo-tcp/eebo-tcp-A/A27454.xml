            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have lived to see our profession of Christianity, to have yielded some men arguments for their taking up Armes against their lawful Soveraigns and Goverment, certainly there hath been some violence used by them herein, or else this holy Religion could never afforded them such a Topick. Submission to our lawful Governours, not only <hi>for Wrath,</hi> but also <hi>for Conscience-sake,</hi> is the great duty and glory of our profession, whilest evil Religions prompt men to rapine, blood, and violence, <hi>Religio Christiana nil suadet nisi justum &amp; lene.</hi> The Original and power of Kingly Government hath of late been much disputed, whether it be (as our Saviour spake of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi>) <hi>from God</hi> or <hi>from men</hi>; this Author (I think) hath evinced the former, and if so, subjection is our duty; tis not <hi>male</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration or persecution (as some men call it) can ever warrant the Subjects Arms against his Prince. The Christian Church gives no Example, nor our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion any precept for such undertakings;
<pb facs="tcp:105037:4"/>
If it then be Religion (as some men would have us think) they fought for, why do they use unlawful weapons? must prayers and tears be turned into Pike and Musket because a <hi>Nero</hi> is thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour? The Church of God knows no such usage, the legal dispensation it self, which will be acknowledged some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harsh in respect of the Gospel, will not permit a holy <hi>David,</hi> tho a man after Gods own heart, to build his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for that he was a man of battel and his hands were bloody; peace, meekness, charity, and submission to our lawful Government, are the effects and true signs of real Christanity, the other is but spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Apocryphal. To inform our Reader of the rise of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the design of this pious Author, and to perswade us to subjection to our Civil as well as Ecclesiastick Governors, is the main intention and scope of his undertakings; which I hope (good Reader) by a due perusal of this small Book may be well attained as the thing it self is well made out by the Author, and so I leave thee to the use of the Book.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Who was the first Founder, or the first that instituted the Office of KINGS.</head>
               <p>VVEE, say some People, were the first that desir'd them, and moved for them, and had them, and chose them. <hi>And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul King before the Lord in Gilgal.</hi> 1 Sam. 11.15. 1 Sam. 8.5.</p>
               <p>Soft and fair, good people; do not mistake your selves; you desired, and moved for, and would have, and had a King, but God <hi>gave</hi> him you: <hi>I gave thee a King, O Israel, in mine anger, and I took him away in my wrath,</hi> Hosea 13.10, 11. According to this we read <hi>Acts</hi> 13.21. <hi>They desired a King, and God gave unto them Saul, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105037:5"/>
And for your making of a King at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> your making was but approving, and applauding him, that was made already; for <hi>Saul</hi> was both made a King, and confirmed King, and executed his Office, before the people are said to have mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him King in <hi>Gilgal: He was anointed King over Israel,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.1. <hi>he was confirmed by signs,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>he executed his Office,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.7, 8.</p>
               <p>God first, sent.</p>
               <p>And s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thirdly, chose.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, anointed.</p>
               <p>And fifthly, found them out a King, before ever it is said, they made him.</p>
               <p>First, God sent him; <hi>I will send thee a Man out of the Tribe of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be Captain over my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God shewed him; for neither the people, nor any of the Saints, nor the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> no, nor <hi>Samuel</hi> himself, knew not <hi>where</hi> to find this first of Kings, 'till God said, <hi>This is he, he shall reign over my people,</hi> 1 Sam. 9.17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God chose him himself; and <hi>Samuel</hi> said to all the people, <hi>See him whom the Lord hath chosen,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.24. If the people had made him themselves, or could make him, what needed they to have come unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> to bid him, <hi>make us a King to judge us</hi>? 1 Sam. 8.5. and to say, <hi>give us a King?</hi> Which deprecation was indeed no otherwise, than as if they should have desired <hi>Samuel</hi> to have asked a King for them of the Lord; for so it seems by the sequel,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105037:5"/>
for immediately hereupon <hi>Samuel</hi> went unto the Lord, and declared their importunity, and the Lord said, that <hi>he should hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they said unto him,</hi> verse 7. and this most certain and agreeable unto 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. where <hi>Samuel</hi> tels the people; <hi>Ye have this day rejected your God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have said unto him, set a King over us</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, God anointed him; <hi>Samuel took a violl of Oyl and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, is it not because he hath anointed thee to be Captain over his Inheritance,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God found him out for them, where he was hidden from them; for when all the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> were come together, and the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was taken, and the families of that Tribe drew neer; and the family of <hi>Matri</hi> was taken out of those <hi>families,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> the son of <hi>Kish</hi> from thence: 1 Sam. 10.20, 21. (the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Tribe, the least <hi>family,</hi> the poorest <hi>Benjamite,</hi> as shewing us that Kings were not to have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the mighty people but from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.21.) the people sought him but they could not find him, so that they were fain to enquire of the Lord for him, and <hi>the Lord shewed them where he had hid himself in the stuffe</hi>; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. so that all that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had to doe, either in the Election, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Nomination, Creation, or Invention of their first King, was (when God had done all this) to shout, and say, <hi>God save the King,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.24, and for their making a King, after all this in <hi>Gilgall,</hi>

their approbation of him, who was thus made by God already.</p>
               <p>Neither was God only the founder of the first King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of all the rest also: He was <hi>Davids</hi> founder too, <hi>I have found David my servant, with my holy Oyl have I anointed, him,</hi> Psal. 89.20.

               <p>Now Kings are lively representations, living statues, or pictures, drawn to the life, of the great Deity; these pictures, for their better continuance, are done in Oyl, the colours of the Crown never fade; they are no water colours; as Kings with their own statues will not be angry, though time and age devour them, yet they will not suffer them spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be thrown down, or shot against; so

We must take heed how we put it out. And though it be true, that such a piece of silver, is but a piece of silver, yet as it bears <hi>Cesars</hi> Image and superscription upon it, it is more significant; and if thou either <hi>pare</hi> or <hi>impare</hi> it a jot, if thou art found either clipping, or diminishing of it in the least degree, thou dost it to the prejudice of thine own life; so though a King be but a man as in himself, yet as he bears representation of God, and hath his character stamped upon him, he is some-what more, if you will beleive him that said <hi>Ye are Gods,</hi> Psalm 82.6. and therefore we must take heed how we debase or detract from them who represent so great a <hi>Deity,</hi> who by reason of their proximity and nearnesse unto God in some respects are most commonly of more discerning spirits then ordinary men: for <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> when his servant had so grieviously slandred him to <hi>David,</hi> he makes but a short complaint.

                  <hi>My servant hath slandred me</hi>; but (as if he should say, I need not tell thee much, thou hast wisedom enough to find it out) <hi>My Lord the King is as an Angel of God, doe therefore what is good in thine own eyes:</hi> Therefore because thou art as an Angel of God, and thy selfe art a good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer, as all Angels are, do what is good in thine own eyes; as if he should have said, if thou doest only that which seemeth to be good in other mens eyes, it may be they will perswade thee that the thing was true, wherein my servant slandred thy servant poor <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> and he huffer wrongfully. I am of opinion that God gives to every King to whom he communicates his name and authority, this extraordinary gift of discerning; but because they do not some times make use of it to the end it was bestowed upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> (the better goverment of their severall Dominions) but are contented to see and discerne with other mens eyes; and to have false spectacles put upon their noses, whereby many a good man suffers: God in his justice gives them over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in their own particular, and wherein their own greatest good is chiefly concerned, they shall make least use of their own judgements and advice, and wholly give themselves to be overswayed by the advice of those, whose judgements perhaps is not so good as their own, and whose intentions (it may be) are no better then they should be.</p>

I would take a little advice from that heart, that is so directed by that hand; the Kings head never plotted treason against the Crown, and no man can wish better to his Majesty then the King. I speak not this in derogation either of the Great or Privy Councel <hi>(for it is written, in the multitude of councellors there is safety)</hi> but in defence only of these sons of Oyl, who are Supreme in both. And as it is true that the King is but one man, so it is also true, that one man is worth ten thousand of the people; <hi>Thou art worth ten thousands of us (though all his worthies were in place)</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. And though it be true, that the King hath a soul to be saved as well as others, yet it is also true, that he should have no body to be crucified by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, out of their dis-esteem of his person, the ceremonies of State (as Anointing, sitting in Thrones, holding of Scepters, and coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it self) being to be exploded now a days; and who look'd for it otherwise, when the lawful and decent ceremonies of the Church were called reliques of Popery, and raggs of the whore of <hi>Babilon:</hi> was it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be expected, but that they would call these ceremonies of state, <hi>theatrica pompa:</hi>

               <p>A touch is but of one man, though but with one of his fingers, yet this must not be; <hi>Nolite tangere,</hi> it is not said <hi>ne tangere,</hi> wherein only the act of touching is forbidden, but <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite tangere,</hi> whereby the will is also prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: how wary should we be in touching, when the Lord is so cautious in his prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Now stretching forth the hand may signifie a combination of many into one confederacy, the hand being a part of the body, composed of five members (one and all) but this must not be: a most unhappy instrument is that hand that <hi>turns it self</hi> into the bowels of its own body; if the head break out by chance, the hands must not presently be in the head clawing, with invenomed nails, the corruption there, lest that itching desire, turn into smart in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest when the peaceable day springing from on high, shall happily visit you, <hi>that now sit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and in the shadow of death,</hi> we then see our bloody hands, and this (once happy) kingdom, the only pillow, whereon peace had laid her head, streamed (like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> River) all with blood.

               <p>IF by a <hi>Free-State,</hi> you mean a people who have shook off their Allegiance to their Prince, there are many such <hi>Free-States</hi> to be found, but a beggars-bush, or a company of <hi>Gipsies</hi> (who propound to themselves new Laws) renouncing the old, and yet chuse a King and Queen amongst themselves, pleasing one another with a self-conceited opinion of a thing they call Liberty, which is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then an ignoble bondage of their own choosing, preferring the correction of a bundle of rods (because their own hands have made them) before the sway-meant of a Scepter, which God himself hath put into their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns hand) is as good a Common-wealth, or <hi>Free-State</hi> as the best: but if you mean by a <hi>Free-State,</hi> a freedom from Tyranny, you will be as far to seek for any such thing in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> as for a reason why tyranny may not be in many, as well as in one: But if you mean by freedom an exemption from all such tyrannical oppressions as are expressed in the Petition of Right; I see not why such a Free-State may not be under a Monarchy: certainly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105037:40"/>
I have seen such Petitions, and insistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, during the late Kings Reign, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving relation to Freeborn people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and should think that the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> defended by one, who had power to make it good against the infringement of many breakers, and by a Parliament of many, authorized to the same purpose against the pessundation of it by any one, be it by the highest, may not be as good a way to make, preserve and keep a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion free, as well as the intrusting of a Nations freedom into the hands of a few, whose Independency deny all remedies to be either above them, or below them. It may be it will not be thought tedious, if I entertain your eye and consideration with some Observations of my own, in those Free-States of Christendom (as they call themselves) wherein I have been. I shall begin with the Free-State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> wherein I have been resident some time, and the rather, because whilst <hi>England</hi> was a Kingdom, they could not have the face to stand in any competition with us; but now the Kings arms were cut off as well as his head, how should we do to make a distinction between them and us? for both the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the State of <hi>England</hi> give the very same Coat of Arms, and St. <hi>George</hi> is both our patrons: Certainly <hi>England</hi> must give the Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon as the younger brother; and why
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105037:41"/>
should not the Moon Crescent follow after, now the <hi>Turkish Alcoran</hi> is come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>
               <p>When the overspreading <hi>Roman</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> over-grown and lofty Tree was brought only to a stump chained to the ground, and when the Keys of Heaven and Hell had so well fitted the locks belonging to the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to give way to the enterance of that high Priest into the Imperial seat, then was <hi>Genoa</hi> a lop of that great fall: and soon after it was wrought into a bundle or faggot of a Common-wealth, until such time as <hi>Charles the Great</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all his Right in <hi>Italy,</hi> saving only the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> whose Princely sword could never strike at the already cloven Miters, but at Helmets.</p>
               <p>Amongst other Counties whose subdue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, acknowledged <hi>Charles</hi> to be the <hi>Great, Genoa</hi> was one; which City was no less happy then famous, in affording a man who honoured her Walls, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it known unto the World, that he came out of them under the name of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Dory</hi> a <hi>Genose</hi>; this famous <hi>Andreas Dory</hi> was a zealous Common-wealths-man, and one of the new Gentlemen, as they call'd themselves, (for you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105037:41"/>
that when these States-men had shook off the yoke of Soveraignty, they expelled all their Gentry or Nobility; which no sooner done, but they made a new Gentry or Nobility amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) and being a deserving man, the Emperour <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> will'd this <hi>Andreas Dory</hi> to aske and have what he desired of all that he had Conquered: he asked <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Emperour gave it him, to do with it what he pleased, he gave it the Citizens, together with all their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and former Freedoms upon this conditions, That they should recal the old Gentry in again, and settle them again in all their rights and priviledges, which being assented unto, <hi>Genoa</hi> became a Free-State again; but behold the Freedom, or rather the power and bonds of love and gratitude, neither the old or new Gentry, nor the Common people, would allow of any thing that was said or to be done, but what this <hi>Dory</hi> should command or say: nor was there a more absolute and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monarch upon the earth then he; and whilst he liv'd he did continue so, because the people would obey: who being once dead, the people soon found they did obey, because they must: Yet still it must be a Free-State, because <hi>Libertas</hi> was written over the Senate-House, and City-gates, but neither within their Senate, or their

Walls, was there ever such Tyranny over the common people, or the Citizens, then hath been all along, and is at this day practised by some few, who spit Monarchy in the face, and make no bones to swallow down all its adjuncts? Exercising their several Tyrannies with this justification, that they are the Supreme Authority, whilst they deny Supremacy; gulling the people into a scotish belief, that they are not suppressed by one hand, because it hath many fingers.</p>
               <p>I shall instance unto you one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which was done whilst I was there, whereby you may easily Judge in what Free-state their Commons live: There was a substantial Citizen, between whom, and a Noble <hi>Genoese</hi> there was some grudge, this Senator studies a revenge, and thus he intends it to be put Execution.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:105037:43"/>Such shifts as these, are these Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born people fain to make to appease the wrath and fury of their Lords and Masters: In a word, as their Territories is no otherwise then a continued breach of three hundred miles along the sea-shore, so the Inhabitants live no otherwise then do the fishes in the Sea, the greater fishes devour the less so where there is no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> every man doth that which is good in his own eyes: it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>

I speak in reference to the Country, not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. Neither is there a sort of Christians in the world who are less servants unto <hi>Christ,</hi> if it be enough to make them so, to be the greatest prophaners of his day: for the Sabbath is only distinguished from other daies, by a Sermon in the Church, and the Ale-house being full of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, drinking and carousing from morning until night; the shops are open, and buying and selling all the day long, excepting half the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which is to distinguish the day, but the door is open to let in the buyers, and the other half of the window is open to let in the light: and wonderfully strange it is, and remarkable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how these people, who shook off their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their Prince upon pretences of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, should be so besotted, as to fall into such a strange and unheard of prophaneness of him, and the day whereon <hi>Christ</hi> himself is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as in their Metropolls, or chief City, to have a dog-market kept to the utter scandal of true Religion and Christianity it self, this is no more than what I have seen, and if it were not true, it were easily returned upon my self as the greatest impudence that could be imagined; but O the partiality of the Picture-drawer, when he receives large wages for a similitude! he insults over his own work only because it is like, when the face it self is most abominable.</p>

Taxes and Rates as they have imposed on one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, incredible; even to the full value of the several commodities, which run through their natives hands; but you will ask me, how it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should live then? To which I answer you, by sharking and cosening of strangers: Let any forraigners come there and ask for a dinner, and for such a dinner as they may well afford for eight pence a-piece, they will ask you five shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a man; find but the least fault with them, and they will demand twelve pence a piece more for fouling of linnen; and if you seem angry at that, you shall mend your self with the payment of six pence a-piece over and above for fouling the room: and seek a remedy, and you shall be told, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himself if he were there could not help it: <hi>altom all,</hi> is all the reason they will give you; if in sadness you shall complain of such abuses to indifferent Judges, they will tell you, that the States do lay such heavy Taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inhabitants, that they are fain to flie to such shifts for their subsistance; thus men pleased with the itch of Innovation, are contented to scratch the blood out of their own bodies, till they feel the greatest smart; rather than their Physician should let out a little spare blood, to cure the disease, and preserve them in good health; but you will say, that for all this, they thrive and prosper abudantly, so do the <hi>Argiers men,</hi> but with what credit and reputation in the eye of the World? I believe both alike: It was not their strength or policy, which brought them to this height and flourishing condition: but it

was our policy of State, in emulation to other Princes, which helped these Calves to Lions hearts, teeth, and claws, until the High and Mighty <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-boxes</hi> stood in competition with the Crown: and I am afraid the siding with such Rebels, hath turned Rebellion into our own bosoms, as a just judgment from that God who is a revenger of all such iniquities, they may call it the School of War, whilst wanting a good cause, it could be no otherwise than the Christians shambles: I should be sorry that <hi>Holland</hi> should be the <hi>English-mans</hi> Looking-glass: a spur for his feet, or a copy for his hand, I hope the hand of Providence will cure us, like the Physician, who cur'd his Patient by improving his disease, from a gentle Ague to a high Feaver, that he might the better help him:</p>

               <p>IN this Discourse I shall not trouble my self, nor you with Titles, Names and words of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Evangelists, Arch-bishops, Bishops, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Presbyters, Ministers, Angels of Churches, &amp;c. which were all from the highest to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, but tearms reciprocal; and were often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Church of God, and in the Scripture it self, for one and the same; for if any man, though never so mean, a Minister of the Gospel converted any Nation, the Church ever called him, the Apostle of that Country; as <hi>Austin,</hi> though but a Monk, was every where tearmed the Apostle of <hi>England:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, stiles himself a Minister of the Gospel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy</hi> being a Bishop, to do the work of an Evangelist; and therefore no wonder if Bishops and Presbyters be often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for one and the same: but it is a great wonder that any manner of men, should make this a ground for any argument against Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; these kind of arguments instead of striking fire that should light the candle, they do but pin napkins over our eyes, and turn us round, until we know not where we are; and then we grope for we know not who, and lay hold of we know not what: he that will cut down this over-grown up-start-tree of error, must first clear his way

to the root, and brush away all those brambles, and briers, which grow about it; we must not leave any thing standing, that may lay hold of the hatchet, and deviate the stroke, turning the same edge upon the feller, that was intended for the tree: if we should insist upon names and titles, we should make but a confounded piece of work, and run our selves into a most inextricable laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth and Mazes of error; where we might run and go forwards and backwards, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ne're the near: Christs are Kings, Kings are Gods; God is Christ, and Christ is Bishop of our souls; Bishops are Presbyters, Presbyters are Ministers, a Minister is an Apostle, an Apostle is a Minister: and so if you will quite back again.

from the seventh day to the first of the week, or as well as they chang'd immersion into aspersion of the baptised, and many other things which carried as much <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> with them as Episcopacy, and yet were chang'd. The <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi> that is in Episcopal Government, doth not consist in the Episcopacy, but in the Government, be it Episcopal or what it will; but where the Government is Episcopal, no question but there Episcopal Government is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> because a Government; and if it were otherwise, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into which Episcopacy degenerateth, would be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as well as it, provided that none touch this Ark of the Church but the Priests themselves; for if the hand which belongs to the same body, pull the hat from off the head, the man loses not his right, only he stands in a more humble posture, but he is in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> when they have changed it to what they can imagine, now whether or no it be proper for a Lay-Parliament, or a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Lay-men, by the power of the Sword, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Kings Authority, will and pleasure, who was appointed by God to be a nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Church, to alter Church-Government, so Antient, so begun by Christ himself in his own person over so many Apostles, so practis'd by the Apostles over others, so continued all along, I mean Episcopacy, that is to say, one Minister constituted an Overseer of many, and to lay hold upon tumults and insurrections, to pull down these Overseers, and for men who in such cases should be governed by the Church, to pull down the Church-Government without any the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Church Governours; I leave it for the World to judge; only my one opinion is this, That any Government thus set up, or by such practices as these altered, must needs be so far from being <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that it must needs be <hi>Jure Diabolico.</hi> But it may be objected, that if they should have stayed until the Bishops had altered themselves, they might have styed long
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105037:49"/>
enough; to which it may be answered, that had the Bishops been but as poor as <hi>Job,</hi> there would have been no such hast to change their cloaths. The Ark was a type of the Church, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was literally commanded concerning the type, must be Analogically observed in the thing typified; God sate in the Mercy-Seat that was over the Ark, the Ark contained within it <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> Rod, and a pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> so the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Law and the Gospel, the killing letter and the reviving spirit; others interpret the Rod to signifie the Government and Discipline of the Church, as the <hi>Manna</hi> the Doctrine of Christ, and food that came down from heaven: I take it to signifie both, and both answers my purpose; if both be therein contained, neither must be touch'd but by the Priests themselves; neither must we confine this prohibition to the Priests of the Law only, but we must extend it also to the Ministers of the Gospel, both which were typified by the two Cherubims, or Ministring Angels of the Almighty: these Ministers or Angels, though opposite to one another, yet they both lookt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and neither of them upon one another, but both of them upon the Ark that was between them, there was mutuality in their looks, and their wings touch'd one another; so though the Ministers of the Law and the Gospel seem oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in the Administration of the same grace, yet they must come so near as to touch one another in the manner of the Administration; <hi>exempli gratiâ,</hi> as there was in the old Law High Priests, Priests and Levites, so in the new Law, Bishops, Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105037:50"/>
and Deacons; as none but Priests were to touch the Ark, so none but the Ministers should reform the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus much for Government; Now for Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy; the question then concerning Episcopacy, will be, whether or no, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> one Minister (which answers to all names and sorts of Church-men, and Church-Officers whatsoever) may not exercise jurisdiction and power over many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters within such a place or territory? If this be granted, the Bishops ask no more: if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, how then did Christ Jesus, Bishop of our souls, give orders and directions to his twelve Apostles, and taught them how they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves throughout this Diocese the whole World? How did St. <hi>Paul</hi> exercise jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were both Bishops? and how did these two Bishops exercise jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over all the Ministers of <hi>Creet</hi> and <hi>Ephesus?</hi> was not this by Divine Institution? If I find by Divine Writ, that Christ laid the foundation of his Church in himself alone being over all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and if I find that these Apostles, every Apostle by himself (in imitation of our Saviour) accordingly exercised jurisdiction and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over many Ministers which were under them, and commanded others to do the like, as <hi>Paul, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and if I find the practice of the Church all along through the whole tract of time, to continue the like Discipline; shall not I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Discipline to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> except Christ sends down a new <hi>conje deslier</hi> from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, upon the election of every new Bishop?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105037:50"/>
Christ lays the foundation, we build upon it, he gives us the Model, we follow the Pattern, the Church is built; is not this by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he doth not lay the several stones with his own hands? Christ promised that he would be alwaies with his Church, and that he would send his holy spirit amongst them, which should lead them into all truth, so that the gates of Hell should not prevail against it; but if Episcopacy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My Lord told them how hard a case it would be that a man out of his love and liking to the place and manners, should seek to it as a sanctuary for his conscience, and so soon find it his grave: that he was heartily sorry for what he had done, and would give any satisfaction to his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that the Court should order, or his estate allow; he intended the man no hurt, before such rough hands shook him out of himself, that he knew not what he did, and therefore he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

King <hi>James</hi> having related this passage in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned discourse unto Dr. <hi>Renolds,</hi> and <hi>Knewstubs</hi> and the rest, turns unto the Bishops, and closes his Discourse with this Animadversion; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Lords, I thank you for my Supremacy, for if I were to receive it from these men, I know what would become of my Supremacy. The shining light of the Gospel, and the burning zeal of the Ministers thereof, may fitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fire, which if it be not in every room confin'd to one hearth, and limited to one tunnel, that may convey out of this so comfortable and necessary a blessing, all that may be destructive, and offensive in it, up toward the highest region, but is suffered like wild-fire to run up and down the house, it will soon turn all to flames and high combustions; so the government of the soul seems to be of so transcendent nature to what the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the body and goods is, that if it be not overtopt with superintendency or Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so disimbogued into the Supream autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, this comfortable heat if limited, as it turns to our greatest benefit, so neglected and boundless, soon converts it self into a suddain destruction and ruine.

               <p>One thing I pray you well observe; There was never any Reformed Church in Christendom, but when they shook off their Bishops, they made their Apologies to all the Christian World, how they were necessitated to alter that Ancient and best form of Government of the Church by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, in regard that they could not be drawn off from their obedience and dependance on the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>; and if possible they would retain that laudable Government as most convenient;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105037:57"/>
but never were there any Reformers in the World, but ours, that ever held Episcopacy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and Anti christian before; and will you know the reason? which is only this, the Bishops what they receive they lay down at his Majesties feet, as acknowledging him to be Supreme in all cases, when they would have him to be Supreme in no case, as <hi>Buch. de jure Regni</hi> plainly tells us, that Princes are no more but the Proxies and Attorneys of the people; and yet for all this, the Authority which they hold, to be as Anti-christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the Chair, they practise as most Christian on the Bench, and much improve it. These Monsters that they may the better cry down the Divine Right that is in Episcopacy, and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them from the Apostles; tell us, that the calling of the Apostles was extraordinary, and died with them: to make answer to which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we must consider how many waies a thing may be taken to be extraordinary, and if we find that it may be taken so many waies, if we can prove a thing extraordinary one way, we must not take it to be extraordinary in every respect; <hi>exempli gratiâ; Saul</hi> was extraordinarily called by God, because immediately by him, but this doth not make the calling of Kings to be an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary calling, for that succeeded; so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were extraordinarily called by God, as not being called out of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> nor taken from the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> nor brought up in the schools of the Prophets, yet this doth not follow, that the calling of the Apostles should be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, for they had their successors: It may
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105037:57"/>
be extraordinary <hi>à parte ante</hi>; but not <hi>à parte post,</hi> only in regard of the manner of their election, but not in regard of the nature of their commission, they were called Apostles in regard of their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not in respect of their Commission, which which was no more but what Bishops had, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the word Apostle signifie so great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as doth the word Bishop, the one beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening but a Messenger, the other an Overseer, and therefore there is no extraordinariness hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that they should not be extraordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may be said to be extraordinary, in regard of some extraordinary gifts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God hath given unto a man, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apostles the gift of tongues, of healing, &amp;c. but this doth no way make the calling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, for then it would follow, that if God Almighty should give unto any ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, extraordinary gifts, then his calling should be extraordinary, or that the calling of Kings should be an extraordinary calling, because God bestows on some Kings the extraordinary gift of healing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be further urg'd, the calling of the Apostles was an extraordinary calling, because they were pen-men of the Holy-Ghost, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Holy-Ghost sat upon each of them; no, that doth not make it extraordinary <hi>quoad nos,</hi> that it should not descend, for other Divines and Evangelists, were pen-men of the Holy-Ghost as well as they, therefore what was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to themselves, cannot be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to us.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:105037:58"/>4. For their receiving the Holy-Ghost, it is no otherwise but what all Bishops, Pastors, and Curates do receive, when they receive Orders, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost,</hi> only the difference is this, they received it by the sitting of cloven tongues, and they by imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Briefly I can compare these Presbyters pulling down the Bishops, to no other thing, than to a company of unhappy boys, who being not tall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reach the fruit, and wanting a Ladder, for the fruit sake, lay hold upon the branches, and break down a bow, making it thereby no part of the tree; so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
