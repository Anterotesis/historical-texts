         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with the late Taxes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

in all dutie proſtrate our ſelves, and this our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
againſt the ſaid Taxes, at your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
feete, beſeeching your Majeſty of your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157722:3"/>
Juſtice and clemency, to take the ſame into

from the intolerable burthen and grievance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which we groane and languiſh.</p>
            <p>And here firſt of all, wee moſt humbly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to your moſt excellent Majeſty, that the
Tax of Ship-money, is directly contrary to the
fundamentall Lawes of this your Realme of
<hi>England,</hi> which your Majeſty both in point of
Juſtice and Honour, is obliged inviolably to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
according to the Oath made to God and
your ſubjects at your Coronation, and your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
printed royall Proteſtations ſince both in
your Anſwer to the Petition of Right, in the
third yeare of your Highneſſe Reigne, in your
royall ſpeech in Parliament, printed then with
your Command, and your Declaration to all
your loving Subjects, of the Cauſes which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your Majeſty to diſſolve the laſt Parliament,
made and publiſhed by your ſpeciall Command;
likewiſe by 22. 23. 42. 43. 44. in all which, your
Majeſty to all your ſubjects Comfort, have made
their ſeverall Declarations of your royall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in theſe your moſt royall words: The King
willeth, that Right be done according to the
Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Realme, and that
the Statutes recited in the Petition of Right, be
put in execution; that his ſubjects may have no
cauſe of Complaint, of any wrong or oppreſſion,
contrary to their juſt rights and liberties, to the
preſervation whereof, he holds himſelfe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157722:3"/>
obliged aſwell as of his Prerogative. Let
right be done, as is deſired, and I aſſure you,
that my Maxime is, That the peoples liberties
ſtrengthens the Kings Prerogative, and the Kings
Prerogative is to defend the peoples liberties;
I doe here declare that thoſe things that have
been done, whereby men had ſome cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the libertie of the Subject to be trenched
upon, ſhall not hereafter be drawne into example
for your prejudice; and for the time to come,
in the word of a King, you ſhall not have the like
cauſe to Complaine; We were not unmindfull
of the preſervation of the juſt and ancient liberties
of our Subjects, which we ſecured to them by
our juſt and gracious Anſwer to the Petition in
Parliament, having not ſince done any Act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to infringe them, but our Care is, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall be, to keep them intire, and inviolable,
as we would doe our own Right and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
We alſo declare that we will maintaine the
ancient and juſt Rights and Liberties of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
with ſo much conſtancy and Juſtice, that
they ſhall have cauſe to acknowledge, that under
our government and gracious protection, they
live in a more happy and free eſtate, than any
Subjects in the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>If then we ſhall make it appeare to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
that the Tax is againſt the Lawes of the
Realme, and the juſt and ancient Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of your Subjects; we doubt not but your
Majeſty, out of your Royall Juſtice, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
will be moſt Graciouſly pleaſed to exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157722:4"/>
us thereof, and never to draw it into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
any more.</p>
            <p>That it is againſt the fundamentall Lawes, juſt
Rights, and ancient Liberties of your people,
we ſhall make it appeare by theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we conceive it is againſt ſundry Statutes
of this Realme. Firſt the Statute of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
cap.</hi> 29. 39. ratified in Parliament 5. <hi>E. 3.
cap. 9. 25. E. 3. cap. 18. 42. Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 3. and to
the late Petition of Right in the third yeare of
your Majeſties Reigne, who enacts, that no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or diſſeized
from the Free-hold or libertie, or free Cuſtomes
to them, or to be outlawed, or exiled, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
deſtroyed, or preſſed upon, nor dealt with,
but by the Law of the Land, and by the lawfull
Judgement of the Peeres; but diverſe of your
poore Subjects by vertue and authoritie of Writs
for Ship-money, have been taken, and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by your Officers, their Goods and Chattells
ſeized, diſtreined and ſould, to their great damage
and deſtruction, without any lawfull Judgement
firſt given againſt them, and before the right and
title of the Tax hath been lawfully heard, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
againſt the very tenour of the Statute.</p>
            <p>Secondly, againſt the Stat. of 25. <hi>Ed. 1. de tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagio
non concedendo. 14. Ed. 3. 2. cap. 1. 25. Ed. 3.
Rich. 2. cap. 9. 1. Rich. 3. cap.</hi> 2. and the late Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right, certified by your Majeſty, which
enacts that no Tallage ſhall be laid, or levied by
the King, or his heires, without the good will and
conſent of the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Earles, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157722:4"/>
Knights, Burgeſſes, and other Freemen of
the Comonalty of the Realm. By vertue of which
Statute, your Subjects have Inherited this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that they ſhould not be compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to any Tallage, Tax, Ayd, or other charge,
not ſet by Common conſent in Parliament, as is
recited by the ſame Petition; Therefore not with
this Tax of Ship-money not ſetled, but being
againſt the ſeverall Acts, againſt all the Acts of
Tunnage &amp; Poundage, and other ſubſidies, which
have been from time to time in all your royall
Progenitors Reignes granted them either for
yeares, or for tearme of their naturall lives, as a
certaine Tax and Subſidie for the ſafety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of your Seas, againſt enemies and Pirats,
and as a free voluntary Graunt, becauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by your royall Prerogative, had no power
to impoſe it upon the ſubjects; ſome few of which
Acts, we ſhall here recite, 14. <hi>E. 3. Stat. 1. cap. 20.
&amp; Stat. 2. cap.</hi> 1. The Prelates, Earles, Barons,
and Commons in Parliament, granted the King
the ninth Lambes fleece, fifteenth ſheafe, ninth
part of all Goods and Chattells in Burroughes
for two yeares ſpace then next enſuing, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and levied by full and reaſonable Tax for the
ſame two yeares, in ayd of the good keeping of
the Realme aſwell by Land as by Sea, and of his
warres, aſwell againſt the parts of <hi>Scotland, France,
&amp;c.</hi> and elſewhere, with promiſe that the Graunt
ſo chargeable, ſhall not another time be brought
for an example, nor fall to their prejudice in time
to come. 5. <hi>Rich. 2. per Stat. 2. cap.</hi> 3. a ſubſidie of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157722:5"/>
two ſhillings on every Tun of Wine, and ſix pence
in the pound of every Merchandize els imported
(ſome few excepted) was graunted to the King
by Parliament for two yeares, during which time
the Marriners of the Weſt proffered the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to make an Army on the Sea: Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
that the money thereof comming be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imployed for the keeping of the Sea, and no
part elſwhere; the receivers and keepers whereof
were appointed likewiſe, that the people keeping
of the Sea Armie, ſhall have all the lawfull prizes
ſhared among them,; And that the Admirall and
others of the ſaid Army ſhould giue aſſurance to
ſave the Kings friends and Allies without danger
to be done to them, or any of them by any meanes,
which if they doe, and it be proved, they ſhall
put them in grievous paines to make amends, 4.
<hi>Ed. 4. 12. Ed. 4. cap.</hi> 3. the Commons of the
Realme of <hi>England</hi> granted a Subſidie to the King
called Tunnage during his life, for the defence of
the Realme, and eſpecially for the ſafeguard of
the Sea, they are the words of the ſaid Act repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which Act was continued and revived 40.
<hi>H.</hi> 8. by Act of Parliament 6. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 14.
which grants him Tunnage and Poundage all his
life, 1. <hi>Ed. 6. cap. 1. 3. Mar. cap. 18. 1. Eliz. cap.</hi> 20.
for the granting of Tunnage and Poundage, all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
recited, <hi>H. 8. &amp; H.</hi> 7. have had granted
to them being Princes, and their noble progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Kings of <hi>England</hi> for time being, by common
aſſent of Parliament for defence of the Realme,
and the keeping, and ſafeguard of the Seas, for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:157722:5"/>
the entercourſe of Merchandize, ſafely to come in
and paſſe out of the Realme, certaine ſummes of
money, named Subſidies, of all manner of Goods,
or Merchandize comming into, or growing out of
the Realme. The words of the forenamed Act
are theſe: Firſt, for aſmuch as we the poore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
&amp;c. now we your poore Commons wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſuch furniture of all things may be had
in readines for time to come, when neceſſitie ſhall
require for the ſpeedy and undelayed proviſion,
and helpe of the ſuppreſſing of ſuch inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Invaſions, humbly deſire of your moſt
excellent Majeſtie, lovingly and favourably to
take and accept and receive their poore graunts,
hereafter enſuing, as granted of true hearts and
good wills, which we bore to your Highneſſe,
towards the great coſts, charges, and expences,
which may be laid out by your Majeſtie, for the
cauſes beforeſaid when need ſhall require.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no Diſmes, Quadriſmes, or grand
Cuſtomes, and ſuch like ayd can be impoſed, the
act of Tunnage and Poundage, 1 <hi>Iac. cap.</hi> 33. which
graunts this Subſidie to your Majeſties Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
during his life, makes the ſame recitall word
for word. If then the ſubſidie of Tunnage and
Poundage have been already granted as a Tax up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Subjects for guarding of the Sea, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
enemies and Pirats by Act of Parliament,
and not otherwiſe, and all your Royall Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
have accepted of it in this manner by a grant
in Parliament, and not impoſed any ſuch annuall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157722:6"/>
Tax as now by Writ, for the defence of the Seas
by your Prerogative royall, we humbly conceive,
that your Majeſtie cannot now impoſe it upon
by Law, rather becauſe your Majeſtie ever ſince
your comming to the Crowne, hath taken and
received this Tunnage and Poundage, and ſtill
takes it, and claimes it for a defence onely of the
Seas, profeſſing in your royall Declaration to all
your loving Subjects by your ſpeciall command,
<hi>A. 7. pag.</hi> 44. that you tooke this dutie of Five
in the Hundred for guarding of the Sea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Realme, to which you hold your
ſelfe ſtill charged, as you declared. Now ſince
your Majeſty receives this dutie at your Subjects
hand, to this very end and purpoſe, the moity
of which is abundantly ſufficient to defend the
Seas in theſe dayes of peace with all neighbour
Princes and Nations, and by reaſon whereof you
hold your ſelfe ſtill obliged to it; wee humbly
conceive, you cannot in point of Law and Juſtice,
neither will you in point of honour and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
receive the ſaid Dutie, ſufficient with an
overplus to defend the Seas, and yet impoſe
this heavy Tax and burthen upon your Subjects,
and lay the whole charge of guarding the Seas
in theſe dayes of peace on them, as if no Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
or Poundage were taken for that purpoſe,
which none of your royall Progenitors ever yet
did.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, againſt moſt of the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the ſeverall Subſidies of the Clergie

and Commonaltie, in all your Royall Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
Reignes, and your owne too, who when the
annuall revenues of the Crowne, and your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
and Subſidies granted them for the guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Realme, and Seas, by reaſon of open
warres aforeſaid, and defenſive, or both were not
able to ſupply and defray the extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
never reſorted to ſuch Writts as theſe
for the levying of Ship-money, eſpecially in
times of peace, but ever to the Parliament to
ſupply for the defence of the Seas, and Realme,
by grant of Subſidies, Impoſitions, Diſmes, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driſmes,
rated and taxed by Parliament, and not
by your owne authoritie royall. That is evident
by all the Acts of Subſidies, Taxes, Ayds, and
Cuſtomes, granted by your royall Progenitors,
and eſpecially by the 14. <hi>E. 3. cap. 21. Stat. 2.

therein granted were for the defence of the
Kingdome by Sea and Land, the maintenance of
the Navy, and ſo forth. If now theſe Princes that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:157722:7"/>
would part with no title of their juſt Prerogative,
and your Majeſty your ſelfe have from time to
time reſorted for ſupplyes by Sea and Land to
Parliament, when Tunnage and Poundage and
your owne ordinary revenewes would not ſuffice,
which they would never have done, might they
have ſupplyed themſelves by ſuch Writs of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money
as theſe are, wee humbly conceive it to
be againſt the common Law, and that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ought to run the ſame courſe againe, and
may not by your Prerogative Impoſe this Tax of
Ship-money without common conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
contrary as we beleeve to the Petition of
Right, confirmed by your Majeſty as our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Rights and Liberties, and as the Tax of
Ship-money is againſt the ſeverall recited Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
ſo wee humbly conceive it to be againſt
the very common Law, and Law books.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the Common Law every ſeverall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and ſervice which concernes the ſubjects in
generall or greateſt part of them, that is uncertain
and indefinite, not reduced to any poſitive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
ought to be rated and impoſed by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
onely, not by your Majeſty (as the partie
whom it concerns) as appeareth by two notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
pertinent to the preſent purpoſe, whereof
the firſt is, that of Taxes uncertaine, which though
a dutie to the King, and other Lords heretofore
upon every voyce royall againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it concernes ſo many, it could not be taxed;
but by Parliament, <hi>Litt. 2. 97. 98. 100. 102. F.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:157722:7"/>
N. B. 8. Cooke</hi> on <hi>Litt. ſect.</hi> 97. 101. 102.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in Caſe of Ayd to marry the Kings
or Lords Daughter, and to make his ſonne a
Knight, which though a Dutie, yet taxed and
reduced to a certaintie by a Parliament, not left
arbitrary, 3 <hi>E. 3. cap. 35. 25. E. 3. Stat. 5. cap.
11. F. M. B.</hi> 82. If then theſe uncertaine ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and duties, to avoid oppoſition and Injuſtice,
ought to be taxed in Parliament, much more the
uncertaine and indefinite Tax being no dutie nor
debt at all, and not yet preſcribed or reduced to
any certainty by any Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no Diſmes, Quadriſmes, or grand
Cuſtomes, and ſuch like, can be impoſed by the
very common Law, though uſually ſubſidies and
ſupplyes, but by Act of Parliament, as appeareth
by all them in <hi>Fitz</hi> and <hi>Brookes</hi> Abridgements, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
Quadriſmes, 9. <hi>H. 6. 13. grand. Cuſt. 26. 4.
E. 4. 3. 4. 5. Fitz Bar. 304. 14. E. 3. 21. 26. E. 3.
cap. 11. 45. E. 3. 4. 11. Rich. 2. 9. Dyer.</hi> 45. 6. 165.
therefore much leſſe the unuſuall and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Taxes of Ship-money, amounting the firſt
yeare to ten fifteenes, and this yeare to three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
a man, of which there is not one ſyllable
or tittle in any of our Law Books.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, No Law can be made within the
Realme, to binde the Subjects either to the loſſe
of Libertie, Goods, or member, by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
abſolute power, nor yet by your Majeſtie,
nor the Lords in generall, without the Commons
conſent in full Parliament, as is reſolved in theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:157722:8"/>
common Law Bookes, 11. <hi>H. 6. 17. Ployd. 74. M.
19. E. 3. Fitz Iuriſdict. 28. Annum,</hi> the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why Acts of Parliament binde all, is becauſe
every man is partie and conſenting to them, 3. <hi>E.
4. 2. 2. E.</hi> 4. 45. or 4. <hi>H. 11. 22. H. 1. 5. Ployd.</hi> 59.
and 396. If then no Lawes can be impoſed on the
Subjects, but ſuch as are made and conſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by them in Parliament, becauſe every Law that
is penall deprives them either of their liberties,
perſon by impriſonment, or the propertie of their
Goods by Confiſcation, much leſſe then any Tax,
or the Tax for Ship-money, for the which their
goods ſhall be, and are diſtreined, the perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
in caſe they refuſe to pay it, contrary to
<hi>Magna Charta promiſ. Stat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, every ſubject hath as abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
in his Goods by the common Law, as he
hath in his lands, and therefore as your Majeſtie
cannot lawfully ſeize any of your Subjects lands,
unleſſe by ſome juſt title or forfeit upon a penall
Law or Condition infringed, or by the parties
voluntary conſent, ſo cannot you ſeize upon his
Goods, unleſſe by ſome Grant from the partie
himſelfe, either mediately as in Parliament, or
immediately for ſome debt, or either granted you
in like manner, therefore not for Ship-money, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
granted by common conſent in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it is a Maxime in all Lawes civill and
common, and a principle of reaſon and nature,
<hi>Quod tangit dom. ab omnibus debet approbari, Regis
Iac.</hi> 11. 9. This Rule holds in all naturall and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:157722:8"/>
bodies, nothing is or can be effected by the
head, hand, or foot alone, unleſſe the other parts of
the body, or faculties of the ſoule aſſent. In all ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
popular, where there are diverſe Electors,
there muſt either be a generall conſent of all, or of
the maior part, or otherwiſe the election of the
feweſt, or one onely is a meere nullitie, in all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Colledges, Synods, Cities, Cathedrals,
in Laws, Canons, Ordinances, or by Laws, neither
Levies, nor Taxes can be impoſed, but by all, or
the Maior part. The Biſhop, or the Deane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Clergie, the Major without the reſt of the
Corporation, the Abbot without the Covent,
the Maſter of the Colledge, without the fellowes,
the Maſter or Wardens of Companies, without
the Aſſiſtants, the Lords of the Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Commons, nor the leſſer part, without
the conſent, or againſt the greater part; in all theſe
can doe nothing, either to binde or charge the reſt
by the Common or Civill Law. Your Majeſtie
therefore by the ſame Reaſon, being but a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the body politique of <hi>England,</hi> though the
moſt excellent and ſupreame above all the Reſt,
can impoſe no Lawes, or binding Taxes on your
Subjects, without the common conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
eſpecially now in times of peace, when a
Parliament may be called and ſummoned to helpe
theſe.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, if your Majeſtie ſhall grant a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to impriſon, or to ſeize any of your Subjects
Goods without any Indictment or Proces of Law,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:157722:9"/>
that hath been adjudged voyde and againſt Law.
42. <hi>H. 8. tit. 5. Br. Commiſsion</hi> 15. 16. therefore
your Majeſties Writts to diſtreine mens Goods,
and impriſon their perſons or bodies for Ship-money,
muſt be ſo too. And as your Majeſty by
your Letter cannot alter the Common Law, 6. <hi>H.
4. 5. 10. H.</hi> 4. 23. ſo neither can you doe it by
your Writts, 11. <hi>H. 4. 91. Br. Prerog. 15. 49. aſs.
37. H. 6. 27. 3. H. 9. 15. 18. Ed. 4. 76. 5. H. 4.

            </p>
            <p>Seaventhly, it is a Maxime in Law, that no man
ought to be Judge in his owne Caſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no man can have Cognizance of Pleas where
himſelfe is Judge and partie. And if a Lord of a
Mannor preſcribe in a Cuſtome to diſtreine all
beaſts that come within his Mannor damage fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zant,
and to deteine them untill Fine be made to
him for the damages at his will; this preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is voyde, becauſe it is againſt reaſon, that he
be Judge in his owne Caſe; for by ſuch meanes,
though he had damage but to the value, but of
old, he might aſſeiſe and have a hundred pound,
<hi>Tit. 31. Iac. 2. 11. 212. Cau. ibm. 3. E. 3. 24. 4. E.

Lett. 12. 7. H. 6. 13. 9. H.</hi> 6. 10. the ſame holds
in reaſon concerning Ship-money, if it lay in
your Majeſties power to impoſe, what ſumme
they pleaſed upon your people, you ſhould be
Judge in your own Cauſe, and ſo your Majeſtie
by your Officers miſ-information for their owne
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:157722:9"/>
private lucre might levy farre more than need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
for your ſervice; yea, ſo much, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as would ſoone exhauſt your whole eſtates,
which is againſt both reaſon, and juſtice, and
therefore this concurrent aſſent in Parliament is
requiſite, that no more be demanded then ſhall
appeare to be neceſſary to avoyde oppoſition,
both in frequency of the oppoſition, the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the ſumme collected, and the undue and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
Taxing thereof.</p>
            <p>Eightly, if your Majeſty by your abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
might impoſe ſuch Taxes as there at
your pleaſure might be fulfilled on your ſubjects,
you may doe it as often, and raiſe them as high as
you pleaſe; for what Law is there to hinder you
from it, but that which denies you any power at
all to doe it. Now if you may impoſe theſe
Taxes as often, and raiſe them as high as you
pleaſe, even from a hundred to two hundred
Shippes every yeare, aſwell as fortie or fiftie in
times of peace, and diſtreine upon all your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Goods, and impriſon their bodies for it,
then all their Goods, Lands, and Liberties will
be at your Majeſties abſolute diſpoſition, and
then are we not free-borne Subjects, but villaines,
and raſcalls, and where then are our juſt ancient
Rights, and Liberties, confirmed by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in the Petition of Right, which you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
you are bound in conſcience to performe
and keepe inviolable.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, it hath beene adjudged in auncient
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:157722:10"/>
time, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> cannot by their
prerogative create a new Office by Pattent in
Charge of the people, neither can they graunt
Murage, or any ſuch tallage to, or demand it of
any one by Writ, or Pattent, becauſe that it is in
Charge of his people, <hi>Que ne part eſt ſans parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
13. H. 4. 14. Br. Pat. 12. 37. H. 8. Pat.</hi> 100.
therefore by the ſame reaſon that Tax, that layes
a farre greater Charge upon the Subject, than any
new Office, Murage, Tallage, Travers, or thorow
Toll, cannot be impoſed but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, admit your Majeſty by your abſolute
prerogative might enforce the Subjects to ſet out
Ships to guard the Sea, yet we conceive humbly
as things now ſtand, you cannot doe neither in
Honour, nor Juſtice, nor yet in that way and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as it is now demanded.</p>
            <p>For firſt, we humbly conceive, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
cannot impoſe this annuall charge on your
Subjects, and wholy, becauſe you receive Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Poundage of your Subjects, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to guard the Seas, and eaſe your Subjects
of this burthen, which is ſufficient to diſcharge
the ſervice, with a large ſurpluſage beſides to
your Majeſty, either therefore your Majeſty
muſt now both in Juſtice and Honour releaſe the
Tax of Ship-money, or els your Tunnage and
Poundage, ſince either of them are ſufficient for
the ſervice, and one of them not due, if the other
be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:157722:10"/>
Secondly, we humbly conceive that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
demand it now in a generall peace, when there
is no feare at all of forraigne enemies, or open
warre, proclaimed againſt any neighbour Prince,
or State, there being, as we beleeve, no preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for any ſuch Tax in the time of peace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we conceive that ſince the Writ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
every County to furniſh a Ship of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tunnes, for ſo many moneths;</p>
            <p>Firſt, that no Counties can be forced to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
or hire any Ships, but thoſe that border on
the Seas, and have Shipping in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they cannot be compelled to
furniſh out any other Ships, of any other burden,
than ſuch as they have for the preſent, unleſſe
they have convenient time allowed them to build
others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they cannot be compelled to levie ſo
much money, to returne it to your Exchequer, or
to any of your Officers hands, as now they doe
when they cannot call them to account, to ſee how
the money is imployed, but that they may, and
ought to appoint their owne Officers, Treaſurers,
and Collectors, to make their owne eſtimates,
proportions, and proviſions at the beſt, and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
Rates, as every one doth that is charged and
over-rated in their eſtimates, and put to almoſt
double expence by your Majeſties Officers, who
are not, neither can be compelled to give your
Subjects any accompts, as thoſe Officers may be
that collected the Subſidies of Tunnage and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:157722:11"/>
Poundage anciently were to doe, 5. <hi>R. 2. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that they cannot be compelled to
hire your Majeſties Ships at ſuch rates and with
ſuch furniture and proviſions, as your Officers
ſhall ſeeme meet to have and appoint for them;
for by the ſame reaſon, your Majeſty may enforce
thoſe Gentlemen and grand Souldiers, who are
bound to keepe Launces, and light Horſes, or to
provide Armes in every Countie, though they
have Armes and Horſes of their owne, which are
ſerviceable, to buy or hire your Majeſties Horſes
and Armes every yeare at ſuch Rates as your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
pleaſe, and lay by their owne at your owne
Officers rates, and your Merchants that traffique,
onely in your Majeſties Ships, not in their owne
at your owne Officers rates, there being the ſame
reaſon in both. But your Majeſty, as we ſuppoſe,
cannot enforce your Subjects to the one, to hire
your Horſes, Armes, or Ships, to trayne or trade
with, therefore not to the other.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that they cannot be compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
money to ſet out forty ſeven Ships, as they
did the laſt yeare, and yet but twenty ſeven, and
ſome of them of leſſe burden then limited in the
Writts to be ſet out by your Officers, and ſo
ſcarce halfe the pretended number imployed, and
not that money collected, disburſed in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſervice.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that they cannot be enforced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
forty, forty five, fifty ſhot round of Powder
and Bullets for every Piece in the Ship; now
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:157722:11"/>
there is a generall peace, and no likelihood of
Sea-fights, when fifteene, twenty, or twenty five
at moſt round is ſufficient, and no more was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in eighty eight, when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet came
againſt us, and was of purpoſe, as may ſeeme, to
put them to double charge.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, that they cannot be enforced to
pay for new Rigging, Cables, Anchors, Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Powder and Shot, Matches, Pikes, Muskets,
&amp; that every yeare, when little or nothing at all of
that proviſion provided and payd for by them the
firſt and laſt yeare both, is ſpent but onely victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
and wages, and all the other proviſion at the
end of the ſervice taken into your Majeſties ſtore-houſe,
and ſo to buy their owne Powder, when
the twenty ſeaven Ships were ſet out, and thereby
at the firſt gained foure pence in every pound of
Powder, when they were ſo ſet out, all which
were taken into your Majeſties ſtore-houſes at
their returne, but what was vainely ſhot and ſpent
away the laſt yeare, and bought againe afreſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to ſixteene pence cleere gaine in every
pound, and if this third yeare were brought over
againe, as it is likely according to a new eſtimate,
will be two ſhillings foure pence cleere gaine in
every pound, the like doubled and trebled againe
will be now and every ſubſequent yeare, if this
Tax proceed upon Powder, Shot, and Match,
Carriages, and ſo forth, and all ſuch victualls the
onely proviſion that is ſpent, the moſt part of the
reſt returning, which if your Subjects found and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:157722:12"/>
provided at the beſt rate, and tooke againe into
your owne ſtores upon the Ships returne one
quarter of that that they are now rated at, at the
beſt rate, by reaſon that the remaining proviſion
would diſcharge the intended ſervice.</p>
            <p>Eightly, that they cannot be enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
ſeaven thouſand pounds to the furniſhing
out of a Ship of ſeaven thouſand Tunne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your Majeſties Officers eſtimation, when
as they themſelves would every way furniſh one
at the firſt for five thouſand pound and leſſe, and
the next yeare for leſſe than halfe the money, by
reaſon of the remaining ſtore.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, that they cannot be enforced to give
your Majeſty after the rate of ſixteene ſhillings or
eighteene ſhillings the Tunne, by the moneth, for
the hire of your Ships, when as they can hire
other Ships for foure or five ſhillings the Tunne
a moneth, or under, and your Majeſty allowed
them no more for their Ships than foure ſhillings
a Tunne, when they were imployed at <hi>Callis</hi> or
<hi>Rochell</hi> voyage, ſome of which money is yet
unſatisfied, through the Officers default, to their
impoveriſhing, whereas your Majeſty receives all,
or the moſt part of the money before hand, ere the
Ships doe ſet out to Sea.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, they ought not to be charged with
any ſuch Tax, unleſſe thoſe Officers and others
whom your Majeſty imployes to guard the Sea,
put in good ſecuritie, and preſerve your Subjects,
friends, and Allies, from Pirats and others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:157722:12"/>
damage and loſſe to any of them. And if any
ſuſtaine any damage or loſſe as none ever did more
in our memory, than the laſt yeare in the weſt
Coaſts by the Turkes, to give them full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and damage, as thoſe that undertooke to
guard the Seas at the Subjects charge were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to doe, 5. <hi>Rich. 2. Stat. 2. cap.</hi> 3. the which
is but juſt and equall.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, they conceive, that every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that is not a Sea-man, is bound by the Law
to provide Horſe and other Armes for Land ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
at their owne proper Coſts, according to
their eſtates and abilities, and therefore ought
not by Law to be double charged with Sea and
Land ſervice too. But that Marriners and Sea-men
that are freed from Land ſervice, Muſter and
Armes, ought onely to be charged with the Sea-ſervice,
either out of their owne proper Coſts,
if diſcharged of Tunnage and Poundage, or elſe
upon your Majeſties, as they were in <hi>Mathew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
Anno 1213. cap. 224. Mathew Weſtminſter, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1613. pa.</hi> 91. and ſince in Eighty eight, when
Land-men were diſcharged from Sea-ſervice, and
Sea-men from Land-ſervice, the one ſerving with
their Horſes and Armes onely on Land, the other
with Ships on the Sea onely: when <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> intended to have invaded the Land, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
King <hi>Iohn</hi> of his Crowne, whom the Pope
had injuriouſly depoſed. Upon thoſe grounds wee
humbly repreſent this to your Majeſties juſt and
royall conſideration. And we moſt humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:157722:13"/>
the Tax of Ship-money is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
and unequall, eſpecially as it is now orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and therefore humbly pray to be freed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
            <p>Secondly, admit your Majeſty by your abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power prerogative, might impoſe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Tax as it is now levied and ordered, yet it is a
great grievance, not onely in regard of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
particulars, ſpecified in the preceding
Reaſons, but of theſe alſo enſuing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of the greatneſſe and exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of theſe Charges and Taxes; the firſt to the
Port Townes only for twenty ſeaven <hi>Anno</hi> 1634.
came in moſt Townes to fifteene Subſidies a man,
and that the laſt yeare for forty ſeaven Ships to
all Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> amounting
to three or foure Subſidies in every Countie or
more, this preſent yeare for forty ſeaven Ships to
as much, all theſe payable at once, the higheſt
Tax that ever was impoſed on Subjects in this
Realme, for ought wee reade in our Stories, and
that in times of generall peace, when the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Tunnage and Poundage, of purpoſe to
guard the Sea, by treble, if not ſix times greater
than in Queene <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> or any other Princes
dayes before hers; and halfe of the Tax or leſſe,
as we ſhall be able to prove and make good, will
furniſh out the Ships ſet forth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the annuall viciſſitude of it for three
yeares together, in the time of peace, not to be
paraleld in any Age, which is like to make a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:157722:13"/>
preſident for us and our poſteritie after
us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the inequalitie of taxing of it, in the
firſt Tax ordinary Merchants charged, to pay,
ten, twelve, fifteene, yea, twenty five pound, or
more; when as diverſe of your great Officers,
Earles, and Lords, who had fortie times greater
Eſtates and Annuall revenewes, payd but two,
three, foure, or five pound at the moſt. The laſt
yeares Tax was rated accordingly in Cities and
Corporations, where the middle and poore ſort
of people, payd more than the richeſt; and in the
Countrey, where men are now rated by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre;
ſome Farmers pay more than the richeſt
Knights or Gentlemen, and many poore men
who have ſcarce bread to put in their mouthes,
are faine to ſell their pewter, bedding, ſheepe, and
ſtocke to pay it; the like inequalitie is in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
yeare, and how the poore who made ſuch
hard ſhift the laſt yeare, can be able to diſcharge
this, wee are not able to conceive, eſpecially in
<hi>London</hi> and other Cities, who are and have been
viſited with the plague, where thouſands that
lived well before the ſickneſſe, now live upon
almes, and they that have meanes and wealth
now by the meanes of want of trading, the
charge of their families, and their ſeaſements to
relieve the poore, are become poore themſelves,
ſitter to have reliefe, than to pay ſo heavy a
Tax as this.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the abuſe of ſome Sheriffes and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:157722:14"/>
in levying farre more than is preſcribed in
the Writts, as in Lincolneſhire the laſt yeare,
and other places before.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the diſtreining of ſuch Goods, Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,
and other Commodities, for Ship-money,
as are imported, not exported, whereas no
goods, but of ſuch as had Lands onely, have been
anciently charged with any Tax towards the
guarding of the Seas, as appeareth in the ſeverall
Acts of Tunnage and Poundage.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the ill guarding of the Seas againſt
Turkes and Pirats, notwithſtanding the great
Tax, more miſchiefe being done by them both
by Sea and Land, more of our Ships taken and
pillaged by Sea, and ſome perſons carried away
Captive from the Land, in the Weſt parts theſe
laſt yeares, notwithſtanding the Navie, than in
many yeares before, and no ſatisfaction given
to the Subjects for their irreparable loſſes, which
they ought in Juſtice to receive. If a Carrier, or
Skipper undertake to carry any Goods, and they
miſcarry through his default and negligence, an
Action of the Caſe lyeth againſt him, and he ſhall
render all damage to the partie. Your Majeſties
Officers imployed by you, undertooke to ſecure
the Sea this laſt yeare, yet when they knew the
Turkes were pillaging in the Weſtern parts, they
negligently or wilfully left theſe Coaſts unguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to goe Southwards, to picke a quarrell with
the Hollanders Fiſhermen, or to draw them to a
Compoſition, not having a Ship thereabouts to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:157722:14"/>
ſecure thoſe Coaſts, but two onely in the Iriſh
Seas, in the view of which ſome of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Ships were taken, and yet not one Pirate
taken, or brought in by them, though they did
ſo much miſchiefe, and tooke ſo many of your
Subjects priſoners, to their undoing.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, the generall feare and jealouſie
which your poore Subjects have of an intention
of your great Officers to the Crowne, and the
ayding of the Seas, a meere pretence to levie
and collect it, which jealouſie is grounded on
theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the continuance of the annuall Tax for
three yeares together now in times of peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſending out of twenty ſeaven
Ships the laſt yeare by your Officers, when
money was levied for forty ſeaven, and the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
of money for forty ſeaven Ships this yeare
againe, when not above twenty ſeaven are to be
ſet out: this yeare againe for ought we heare of
ſo many, if any be collected; for theſe twentie
Ships more than are ſet out in the beginning of
this project, they feare worſe conſequence in
the ſequell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, your Officers miſ-informing your
Subjects to buy their owne Powder, Match,
and Shot, Cording Stores, and other proviſions
afreſh, the laſt yeare and this, with your full
pay the firſt yeare, and then taken into your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
ſtore at the firſt and laſt returne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
the eſtimate as high the laſt yeare, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:157722:15"/>
that as at firſt, when as any third part of the firſt
eſtimate of the old ſtore, and other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
would defray the Charge.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, your Officers having turned Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Poundage, which is onely abundantly
ſufficient to defend the Seas withall, into a
meere Annuall revenue, and laying the whole
charge of guarding the Seas upon your Subjects
notwithſtanding. Now if the Tunnage and
Poundage to guard the Seas withall, be already
turned by them into a meere annuall revenue,
they feare theſe alſo will be ſo; the moity of
the money collected, being not disburſed for
the defence of the Sea, for which it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the ſpeeches and mutterings of ſome
of your Officers, who ſtile it a duty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
thereby to improve your Majeſties reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and for the greateſt part of the moneys
they make it ſo.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the ſtopping of ſome legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
by Replevies or Habeas corpus, to bring
the rightfulneſſe or lawfulneſſe of the Tax, to
a faire, juſt, and ſpeedy tryall and deciſion.
It ever being formerly adjudged contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Magna Charta, 129. 2. E. 3. cap. 8. 18.
E. 3. Stat. 3. 20. Eliz. cap.</hi> 9. and the Judges
Oath.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, the levying this as a preſent
ſupply by ſome of your great Officers, under
colour for guarding the Seas, of purpoſe to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:157722:15"/>
keepe off a Parliament, wherein our particulars
may be heard and redreſſed, and theſe Officers
who have abuſed your Majeſties truſt repoſed
in them, oppreſſed your people, and violated
the juſt rights and liberties condignly queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Eightly, the diverſe Corporations of <hi>Le. F.
P.</hi> together with the Clergie men, Exchequer
men, Church lands, auncient Demeaſnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from Dangilt, and all Taxes and Tallages
by preſcription or penall Charters, confirmed
by Parliament; and many that have been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
from paying of Subſidies, now bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
with this Tax, contrary to theſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of exemption; which ſeverall grievances
we moſt humbly ſubmit to your Majeſties moſt
wiſe and gracious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Admit your Majeſtie might by your
royall Prerogative, Impoſe the Tax, yet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
inconveniences enſuing thereupon, both
for the preſent and future, which we ſhall here
likewiſe in all humilitie repreſent to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
royall wiſdome, may juſtly induce your
Highnes to free us from this miſchievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p>For firſt it cauſeth a generall decay of trading,
both by impairing moſt of the currant money
of <hi>England,</hi> the meanes of trading, or by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and undoing, or caſting many poore tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and thoſe ſo far behind hand in the world,
that they cannot recover themſelves againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:157722:16"/>
Secondly, it cauſeth many Farmers in the
Countrey to breake, or hide their heads, or to
give over their Farmes, and makes every where
ſuch a multitude of poore, that in a ſhort
time, the rich will not bee able to relieve
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it procureth a great decreaſe and
abatement in the Rent and prices of Land, and
enhaunceth all other kinde of common duties,
and proviſions, to ſuch an extraordinary rate,
as the poore will not be able to live, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
nor the rich to keepe hoſpitalitie, and
traine up their children to learning and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Armes, to ſecure your Majeſtie, and
Countrey, if this Tax ſhould continue.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it ſtops the current of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law of the Realme, by diſabling men to
proſecute their juſt ſuits, and to recover their
rights, for want of meanes, which will breed
much oppoſition and confuſion, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it much diſcontents the minds, and
dejects the ſpirits, and ſlackens the induſtry of
moſt of your Subjects, and cauſeth many to
leave the Kingdome, and to give over tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it ſo exhauſts your Subjects purſes
now in the time of peace, that they will not be
able, though willing, to ſupply your Majeſty
in time of warre, and upon other needfull, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
and neceſſary occaſions; things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:157722:16"/>
leſt that which the Hiſtory of Great
<hi>Britaine, H. 7. 44. ſect.</hi> 197. as <hi>Speed</hi> writes of
Dangilt, prove true of this Tax. Likewiſe
that it empties the Land of all Coine, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of all their Ships, Nobles of all their
Carriage, the Commons of their Goods, and
the Soveraigne of his wonted reſpect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and obſervance.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, it makes our neighbour Princes
jealous of us, moveth them to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
extraordinarily at Sea, more then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they would have done, and to call in the
Turkes to annoy and infeſt us.</p>
            <p>Eightly, it much hinders traffique of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
and our Fiſhing, by imploying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of our ableſt Ships, Maſters, Pilots, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
and Fiſhermen for this ſervice, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
ſhould and would have been imployed
in Merchants voyages and fiſhings.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, it is like to bring in great inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
burthens, and an annuall and conſtant pay
of above three if not foure Subſidies a yeare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Subjects, and ſo breed a dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
for poſterity, if not now releaſed, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
For though commonly one ſwallow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not a ſummer, yet as <hi>Mat. Paris Hiſt. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl.
822. &amp; 625. Si nunc itcrum fieret, timeri poſſet
non immerito, ne ad conſequentiam traheretur; Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
enim actus inducit conſuerudinem. Eo ipſo reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendum
eſt, quod Franci contribuerunt. Binus enim
actus inducit conſuetudinem.</hi> A double and treble
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:157722:17"/>
payment without oppoſition, will introduce a
Cuſtome and preſcription, be the Taxes never
ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable; as the Prelates and
Clergie themſelves could joyntly conclude in
<hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, in the Caſe of Taxes.</p>
            <p>Theſe moſt Gracious Soveraigne, are the
grounds and reaſons wee humbly repreſent to
your ſacred Majeſty, againſt the Tax of Ship-money,
ſet on foote, as we have juſt Cauſe to
ſuſpect, by ſuch who ayme more at their private
lucre, and ſiniſter ends, then at your Majeſties
Honour and ſervice, or your kindreds welfare;
upon which we moſt humbly ſupplicate your
Majeſtie to be exonerated of it, ſince for the
premiſed reaſons, we neither can nor dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any more to it. Now becauſe theſe men
who have put your Majeſty upon theſe projects,
pretend ſome auncient preſident for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this Tax for the Ship-money, thereby
to induce your Majeſty, whoſe Juſtice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
they know is ſuch, as will never conſent
to any the leaſt taxations, unjuſtly to oppreſſe
your Subjects withall, contrary to the juſt
rights and liberties confirmed by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and your owne Lawes, to impoſe it, and
exact it as a juſt dutie, and lawfull tallage, wee
ſhall here for the opening of the unlawfulneſſe
of it, give a briefe Anſwer to the chiefeſt of
theſe preſidents, which they produce and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
to your Majeſty, to manifeſt the illegali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it. In generall, we give this Anſwer to all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:157722:17"/>
the preſidents they produce to juſtifie this
Tax.</p>
            <p>That there is no direct preſident in point of
Law, to compell the Subjects to finde Ships to
guard the Seas, or if there be any one ſuch
preſident, yet that never ruled, neither was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
lawfull upon ſolemne debate, either in
Parliament, or any other Court of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the preſidents produced that have
any colour at all to prove the Tax juſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
were before <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
afore-cited, Taxes and Tallages without
conſent of Parliament, or at leaſt before Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Poundage were granted for guarding
of the Seas, and not ſince.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they were onely in times of
warre, and open hoſtilitie, not of peace, as now,
this will ſufficiently anſwer all preſidents that
can be produced.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that they were onely either in
times of warres, and open hoſtilitie, or that
they were by aſſent in Parliament, or els with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and complained of, as grievous if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that they were onely for ſuppreſſing
and taking off Ships upon the Kings hire, and
wages, not for ſetting out of Ships on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
proper Coſts, or els for ſtay of Ships for a
time, and ſo impertinent to the Caſe in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:157722:18"/>
Sixtly, that theſe preſidents were not annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or for ſundry yeares together, but rare, once
perchance in an age, and that on ſpeciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
in time of eminent danger, and will not
prove pertinent, if duly examined.</p>
            <p>Theſe generall Anſwers now premiſed, wee
ſhall deſcend to the moſt materiall particular
preſidents, the anſwering which alone will
cleere all the reſt.</p>
            <p>A maine preſident they inſiſt on, is that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Tax of Dangilt, they ſay the ſame was
lawfully impoſed by his Majeſties royall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
on his Subjects by meere royall
authoritie without act of Parliament, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Seas and Realme againſt the Danes.
Therefore his Majeſty may now impoſe on his
Subjects the like Tax by his royall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>To this objected preſident we anſwer, that
there was a double kinde of tribute, called Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilt,
memorized in our Chronicles, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

paid to the Danes themſelves, as to conquering
enemies, by way of Compoſition tribute, to
the which the King himſelfe did contribute as
well as the Subjects. This Compoſition was
firſt begun by <hi>Puſillamenus,</hi> King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> by
ill advice, <hi>Cretineus</hi> Archbiſhop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and other Nobles, <hi>Anno</hi> 991. This tribute
came to ten thouſand pound, <hi>Anno</hi> 983. to as

pound, <hi>Anno</hi> 1014. ſo <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
and others write, that <hi>Ethelbert</hi> at five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times paid the Danes 113000. pounds,
and there was granted to him an annuall tribute
of 48000. pounds, to be exacted of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which properly was called Dangilt; which
tribute was exacted and collected by <hi>Hardica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,</hi>
whoſe Officers were ſlaine at <hi>Worceſter</hi> in
gathering up this exonerable tribute and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
as <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Malmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
terme it, <hi>De hoſtibus regni Angl. lib. 1.
cap. 12. pag.</hi> 76. 77. And when King <hi>Swanus</hi> the
Dane exacted this tribute from Saint <hi>Edmondſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
out of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Lands, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
exemption from it, he was ſtabbed to
death with King <hi>Edwards</hi> ſword in the middeſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:157722:19"/>
of his Nobles, as our Hiſtoriographers report.
Nay, the Dangilt, which may be ſo termed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it did gelt much and pare mens eſtates,
and emaſculated their ſpirits, hath no Analogie
with this Tax of Ship-money.</p>
            <p>For firſt it was not payd to a King, but to a
conquering Enemy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was payd by the King himſelfe,
as well as by his Subjects, and that not as a
debt or dutie, but a compoſition or tribute,
moſt unjuſtly impoſed and exacted by an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and greedy Enemy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was exacted by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
not by Law or Right.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it was payd by the joynt compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,

not by the Kings abſolute power; that is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

evident, that this tribute was not impoſed by
the Kings abſolute power, and will, but by the
common conſent of all the Peeres in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it was payd to ſave and ranſome their
lives and liberties from a conquering Enemy,
not to a Gracious Prince, to ſecure them from
an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it was then thought and called by all
our Hiſtorians an Intolerable grievance and
oppreſſion; which as <hi>Speed</hi> ſaith in his Hiſtory
of Great <hi>Britaine, lib. 7. cap. 44. ſect.</hi> 147. and
others, emptied all our Land of all our Coine
in the Kingdome. Therefore in all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
no warrant at all of the lawfulneſſe of
this Tax, but a ſtrong Argument againſt it,
to prove it both an Intolerable grievance, and
an unjuſt vexation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Tax, called Dangilt, intended
in the Objection, is thus defined in <hi>Edward</hi> the

graund Inqueſt of twelve of the principall men
out of every Countie of <hi>England,</hi> appointed
by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour in the fourth yeare
of his Reigne, as <hi>Hoveden, pag.</hi> 602. 603.
Dangilt was enacted to be payd by reaſon of
Pirats infeſting the Countrey, who ceaſed not
to waſte it all they could. To repreſſe this their
Inſolency, it was enacted that Dangilt ſhould
be yearely rendred, to wit, one ſhilling out of
every Plough land throughout <hi>England,</hi> to
hire thoſe that might reſiſt or prevent the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
or eruption of Pirats. The black Booke
of the Exchequer, <hi>Lib. 1. cap.</hi> 11. thus defines
it, to repulſe the Danes; It was enacted by
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, that out
of every hide of Land by a certaine perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Rent, two ſhillings ſhould be payd to the
uſe of Valiant men, who had diligently and
continually ſhould guard the Sea Coaſts, ſhould
repreſſe the force, and the aſſaults of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
becauſe therefore two ſhillings rent was
principally inſtituted for the Danes, it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Danes gelt. But that preſident of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſort of Dangilt, moſt inſiſted upon, is ſo
farre from warranting of the lawfulneſſe of this
preſent Tax, that in truth it is an unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
argument againſt it, if well conſidered;
For the firſt, it was not impoſed upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by the Kings abſolute Prerogative, as this
is; but granted and impoſed by Parliament,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:157722:20"/>
with the peoples conſent, as Tunnage and
Poundage hath been ſince.</p>
            <p>This is evident by the Lawes of the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
<hi>Et ad eam inſolentiam reprimendam, ſtatutum

Danes and Pirates, that then this was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
granted and enacted by Parliament, ſince the
King alone by his abſolute power, much leſſe
to ſuch a Writ as now iſſueth, could make no
ſuch Act or annuall Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this the blacke Booke of the
Exchequer, <hi>H. 1. cap. 11. Ad injurias igitur
arcendas à Regibus Angliae,</hi> to wit, in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are ſaid
onely to enact Lawes, and the Lawes then
enacted are ſaid to be the Kings Lawes and

            </p>
            <p>If then this were enacted by a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
Law, and payd by an annuall Law, as
by this Exchequer Record appeares, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
by an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by an addition to the Lawes of

               <hi>Hoveden</hi> likewiſe, <hi>Annalium poſteriorum pag.</hi> 603.
which ſaith that every Church whereſoever
ſituated is exempted from this Tax, untill the
dayes of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> becauſe they put more
confidence in the prayers of the Church, than

foure ſhillings on a hide land by Law, as Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilt

of the Church, as well as others, it ſeemes
moſt apparent, that Dangilt and this Tax ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in lieu of it, and then taken by graunt,
was firſt granted by Parliament, and that then
no ſuch Tax could be impoſed by Kings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in times of warre and neceſſitie, to regaine
and preſerve their proper Inheritance, but by
Parliament.</p>

lay the brand of Perjurie on him. <hi>Hac

antiquated and ſo often ſo anciently releaſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
or any of the like nature ought not nor
cannot either in point of Honour, Law, or Juſtice
be revived, or impoſed on Us by your Majeſty
now, and that this Taxe is ſucceſſefully releaſed
as a Grievance though at firſt granted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
can be no preſident to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this preſent Tax, but a moſt pregnant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
againſt it, having no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at all from any Parliament as <hi>Dangelt</hi> had.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, admit that the tax of <hi>Dangelt</hi> were
not impoſed by Parliament but onely for Regall
power, and that lawfull in theſe antient times, as
is pretended, all which we have manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
voyd; yet it is no Argument at all to prove
the lawfulneſſe of this preſent taxe of <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money</hi>
and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that <hi>Dangelt</hi> was firſt impoſed in time
of Warre and deſtruction before the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdome was ſetled by good lawes;
therefore no preſident for this in time of Peace,
nor in this ſetled eſtate of the Realme, ſo long
continued in wholſome Lawes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was before any extant Statutes
made againſt the impoſing of any Taxe, tallage,
aide, or benevolence, without common conſent
of the Lords ſpirituall and temporall, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in Parliament, this and divers fore-recited
Acts of this nature againſt it, are ratified by your

            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:157722:25"/>
Thirdly, it was before any ſubſidie of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and poundage granted to guard the Seas and
Sea Coſts to exempt the ſubject from theſe, and
all other taxes for that purpoſe, and in truth it
was the Tonnage, and poundage of thoſe times
that after Tonnage and Poundage granted to
guard the Seas, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it was certaine firſt 1s. afterwards,
2s. every hide land, and that certainly limited,
this arbitrary and incertainly now, rated by any
Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that was onely charged vpon lands, not
goods, this on goods, and thoſe that have no
lands.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it was not alwaies annually paid, but in
times of warres, as <hi>Spil. Gloſſary, pa.</hi> 200 and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
others fore-recited authors have it thus:</p>
            <p>Now for 3. yeares together in time of peace,
in theſe reſpects therefore we humbly declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Majeſty that this principall preſident of
<hi>Dangelt</hi> is no warrant of all for lawfulneſſe of
this taxe of Shipmoney, but a cleere and vndeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
authority againſt it, in anſwering whereof
we have deſeated and cleered, and ſo anſwered
moſt other preſidents.</p>
            <p>The next Preſidents that are objected, are
thoſe out of ancient ſtories,<hi> Mat. Weſtm. Anno

and ſhip-money on the ſubjects, therefore your
Majeſty may doe the like.</p>
            <p>To theſe preſidenrs we anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that they are onely in time of open
<hi>Warre,</hi> and invaſion by enemies for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
neceſſary defence, not in times of peace.</p>
            <p>Againe the three firſt of them are onely
that the King provided a Navie, commanded
ſhips to be builded through the Kingdome, to
guard the Seas, and encounter the enemy as well
by Sea as by Land, but ſpeakes not that this was
done at the ſubjects owne charge, nor that any
tax was laid upon them for it, or that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his was obeyed, or that he might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:157722:26"/>
impoſe a charge on his ſubjects without their
common conſent.</p>
            <p>The fourth of them <hi>Anno</hi> 1008. ſaith of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert,</hi>
that he commands one ſhip to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, out of every two hundred and tenne
Acres; but ſaith not, that this command was not
by the King abſolute power onely, for it might
be by common conſent in <hi>Parliament</hi> agreed
upon, for ought appeares, or that this command
was juſt, and lawfull; neither doth he informe us
that they were built: <hi>Wigornienſis, Anno</hi> 1008.
addes that they were accordingly prepared, and
that the King put theſe ſouldiers into them with
Victuals, that they might defend the Coaſts of
the Kingdome from the incurſion of <hi>Forreyners,</hi>
ſo that the ſubjects were not onely at the charge
of the building of the ſhips, the King for the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictuals, Marriners, ſouldiers, and wages, and in
truth when all was done, they had but bad ſucceſſe,</hi>
for the ſame <hi>Hiſtorian ſaith,</hi> that a great ſtorme
aroſe, which tore and bruiſed the ſhips, and drove
them a ſhore, where <hi>Holuo</hi> thus burnt them, <hi>ſic
totius populi maximus labor periit,</hi> yet this preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
though neareſt of all, comes not home to
the preſent cauſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe it was onely to build ſhips in the
caſe of neceſſity for defence of the Realme, where
there wanted ſhips to guard it, but now (thankes
be to God) we have ſhips enough already built
to guard the Sea againſt all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:157722:26"/>
Secondly, every 100 and ten Acres to build a
ſhip of 3 Oares, <hi>unam triremem, Wigorne</hi> writes,
but not taxed to pay ſo much to build one as
now.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſhips built, were ſet out not at the
ſubjects, but at the Kings charge and coſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no preſident for this Taxe to ſet out ſhips
built at ours.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the charge was certaine, and equall
every hide land, being equally charged; this alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
uncertaine and unequall.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, this was after the time of <hi>Dangelt</hi>
was ſet on foot, therefore not done by the Kings
abſolute power, but by common conſent in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
as we have proved <hi>Dangelt</hi> to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, this preſident proves onely that ſuch
a thing, was there commanded to be done by the
King, not that the King might or did lawfully
command, or enforce the ſubjects to doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the common conſent.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that was no annuall charge put on
the ſubjects, as that now, but extraordinary, not
drawne into practice ſince, for ought that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
therefore differeth from this Tax of
Ship-money.</p>
            <p>Eightly, no corporation, or goods, were then
charged but onely lands, and all were ruled by the
land they held, therfore this exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not to juſtifie
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:157722:27"/>
the tax of ſhip-money, which is laid upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
Goods, and ſuch as have no Land at
all.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, no man was enjoyned this under pain
of Impriſonment, nor his goods diſtrained, or
ſold if he refuſed it, for of this there is not a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
therefore no preſident to warrant the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
impriſonment, and deſtreining of theſe mens
goods, who now refuſe to pay the tax, for that of
<hi>Hardicanutus</hi> not to be juſt, and lawfull, but an
illegall, and tyrannicall Act, which ſaith <hi>Mat.
Weſtm. Anno</hi> 1040. made him odious and hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to thoſe that deſired him for their King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Florentinus Wigornienſis, Anno</hi> 1040. adds
that it was ſuch a tribute, that ſcarce any man
could pay it, <hi>quapropter ab iis qui prius adventum
ejus deſider abant magnopere factus eſt exoſus ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere
memorabile, &amp; importabile quod cum ciuibus
extincti ſunt,</hi> and ſuch a grievous inſupportable
Tax, as that was then reported, impoſed by noe
hereditary Prince, but a forraine Daniſh Tyrant
who dyed in drinke amidſt his cups very ſhortly
after, as all our <hi>Hiſtorians Record,</hi> be made or dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a juſt and lawfull preſident for your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
row to follow (God forbid.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee anſwer that all theſe preſidents
were before the government of the Kingdome
was ſetled, before any <hi>Charter,</hi> or other Statutes
againſt Taxes, and tallages, loanes, aydes, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volences,
without common conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
enacted before Tonnage and poundage
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:157722:27"/>
granted, therefore inſufficient to this preſent
cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, neither of the preſidents was ever
adjudged lawfull againſt the ſubjects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not binding poore pr. 3. 93. <hi>Slades caſe, Cook</hi>
6. 75. and they are very ancient.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, all theſe were during the time of
<hi>Dangelt,</hi> and involved in it, what there we anſwer
to that of <hi>Dangelt,</hi> is applyable to all, and each
of theſe, and that making cleere nothing for this
taxe, as we have manifeſted, theſe preſidents muſt
doe the like.</p>
            <p>The chiefe and moſt pertinent of all other
ſince that of <hi>Dangelt, is that of King Iohn, 1213.
who being injuriouſly deprived of his crowne and
Kingdome at Rome by the Pope:</hi> at the earneſt
ſolicitation of that arch Traytor <hi>Stephen Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury, William</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>London,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> theſe Prelates
departing from <hi>Rome,</hi> went into <hi>France,</hi> and there
conſpired with the Biſhops, and King <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> againſt their owne Soveraigne; they then
ſolemnly publiſhed the depoſition and ſentence
of the Pope given againſt him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then
in the behalfe of the Pope, they enjoyned aſwell
the King of <hi>France,</hi> as all other men, as would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
remiſsion of ſinnes: that uniting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together, they would all goe into <hi>England,</hi>
in an hoſtile manner, and depoſe King <hi>John</hi> of his
Crowne and Kingdome, and ſubſtitute another
worthy man in his ſtead by the papiſticall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:157722:28"/>
when as the Apoſtles never depoſed any
Princes of their Crowne and Kingdome, but
commanded all to feare, and ſubmit to them,
<hi>Rom. 13. 12. 1 Tim. 13. 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King of <hi>France</hi> prepared a very ſtrong,
and great Army and Navie to invade <hi>England</hi>
both by Sea and Land, to depoſe King <hi>John,</hi> and
to get the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> to himſelfe. King
<hi>John</hi> having perfect intelligence of all theſe
things, in the moneth of <hi>March</hi> commanded
ſhips excellently furniſhed, to come together out
of all the parts of <hi>England,</hi> that ſo he might with
ſtrong hand reſiſt boldly thoſe that intended to
invade <hi>England,</hi> he likewiſe raiſed, &amp; gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a very great Army, out of all <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the places adjoyning, that <hi>Mat.
Weſtm. 1213. pa.</hi> 90. relates the ſtory, <hi>Mat. Paris</hi>
addes this unto, that the King in the Moneth of
<hi>March,</hi> cauſed all the ſhips out of the Ports of
<hi>England</hi> to be in readineſſe, by his Writ which
he directed to all the Bayliffes of the Ports in
theſe words.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Theſe two Writs therefore being divulged
throughout England, there came together to the Sea
coaſts in divers places where the King moſt ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
to wit, at Dover, Feveriſham, and Ipſwich
men of different condition, and age fearing nothing
more then that report of Culvertage,</hi> but when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a few dayes there wanted victuals for ſo great
a multitude, the chiefe Commanders of the
<hi>Warres</hi> ſent home a great company of the unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vulgar, retaining onely the Knights, their
ſervants, and free-men, with the ſlingers, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
neere the Sea Coaſt; moreover <hi>John</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> with 500
ſouldiers, and many horſemen to the King, and
were joyfully received of him. All therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſembled to the battle, and muſtered at <hi>Bark
Downes,</hi> there were amongſt ſelected ſouldiers,
and ſervants ſtrong, and well armed 60000. va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men, who if they all had one heart, and one
mind towards the King of <hi>England,</hi> and defence
of their Country: there had not bin a Prince
under heaven, againſt whom the King of <hi>England</hi>
might not have defended himſelfe ſafe: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if the King of <hi>England</hi> reſolved
to joyne in battell at Sea with the Adverſaries,
that they might drowne them in the Sea before
they could land; for he had a greater Navie then,
then the King of <hi>France,</hi> whence hee conceived
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:157722:29"/>
greateſt ſecurity of reſiſting the Enemies thus,
<hi>Mat. Weſtm. Paris Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>England, Anno</hi>
12, 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 224. 225. whoſe words we have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at large, to cleere and take off the edge of this
Prime preſident, in anſwering which, ſince all
things will be cleered from theſe Writs, to
preſſe and provide ſhips; your <hi>Majeſties</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
would inferre the lawfulneſſe of theſe
Writs, for ſhips &amp; ſhip-money now.</p>
            <p>But under correction, we humbly conceive,
that this preſident makes much againſt, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all for theſe Writs, and taxes which now
iſſue forth: for</p>
            <p>Firſt, it was before <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the taxes
and Tallages, the Petition of Right, or any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie,
Tonnage or poundage to guard the Sea, the
ſtatutes are againſt them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was onely directly in <hi>Port-townes,</hi>
that had ſhips, not to Countries and places that
had no ſhips, as the Writs are now.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was to the Maſters, and Owners of
ſhips, not to any other perſons, who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from all Land-ſervice, were to ſerve the
King and Kingdome at this pinch and extreamity
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:157722:30"/>
at Sea, but theſe Writs reach to all, aſwell thoſe
that have no ſhips as others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it was onely to furniſh out their
owne ſhips, not to contribute money to hire the
Kings ſhips or others, or to build new of other,
or greater Burthens the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe that had bin. Theſe
Writs now are contrary to this in all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
at leaſt in the intention and execution.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, here was no leavying of money to be
paid to King <hi>John,</hi> his Executors, or Officers
hands to provide, or hire ſhips as now, but every
man was left to furniſh his owne ſhips at his beſt
rates, with his owne proviſion and <hi>Marriners,</hi>
this quite otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, though the <hi>Marriners</hi> and <hi>Owners</hi> of
the ſhips were by this Writ to furniſh ſhips at
their owne proper coſts, yet when they were thus
furniſhed, the King was to pay them both wages,
hire, and freight, as his ſucceſſors ever had done,
ſince when they preſſed any of your ſubjects
ſhips, or <hi>Carts for Warre,</hi> or <hi>Carriage,</hi> theſe were
the words, <hi>Iterum in ſervitium noſtrum ad libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
noſtras, which imply a Conſtancie as in all
like Caſes,</hi> yea of your Majeſty who now pay
wages, and freight for all the <hi>Mariners and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:157722:30"/>
ſhips, your preſſe reſolves as much, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this makes nothing at all, for this enforceing
the ſubjects to ſet out ſhips to guard the Seas, to
ſerve your <hi>Majeſty</hi> at your owne proper coſts
and charges, but point blanke againſt it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, this preſident makes it evident that
thoſe who are bound by their<hi> Teunres, Lands and
Lawes of the Kingdome to ſerve the King, </hi>and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Kingdome by Land,<hi> as all the horſes,
foote, Train'd Bands, and Companies throughout
England, neither have bin ought to be charged with
any Sea-ſervices, for heere all the Land men are
charged to ſerve the King, and defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by Land, and theſe Sea-men onely by Sea, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them enforced to ſerve or contribute to any
ſervice or defence both by Sea and Land, for that
had bin double and unreaſonable charge, therefore
now who are charged with Land-ſervice by theſe
very preſidents related, ought not to be taxed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſetting out of ſhips, but Sea-men onely are
to gùard the ſeas with ſuch ſhips as they have, and
no other, vpon your Majeſties pay, therefore theſe
Writs which charge Land-men to contribute to the
ſetting out of ſhips, are directly againſt theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,
and the Lawes, and practice of theſe Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, Theſe Land men that
were not bound by their <hi>Tenures,</hi> and Lands
to fine, and yet were able to beare Armes, were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:157722:31"/>
to receive the Kings pay, and not to ſerve <hi>gratis</hi>
even in this neceſſary defence of the Kingdome,
as theſe words <hi>ad capiendum ſolidos noſtros,</hi>
reſolve, therefore certainly <hi>Mariners</hi> in thoſe
ſhips received the Kings pay too, and the owners
freight as now they doe from your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and
ſo the King, not the Subjects bare the charge
of the ſhipping then, and if ſo in that time, and
age before Tonnage and poundage, then your
<hi>Majeſty</hi> ought much more now to doe it, ſince
Tonnage and poundage is taken for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, this Writ was in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cauſe upon an extraordinary Exigent, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
The King was heere deprived of his
Crowne and Kingdome, moſt unjuſtly by the
Pope, and the inſtigation of theſe treacherous
<hi>Prelates,</hi> and both of them given to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
of France,</hi> a ſtrong Army both by Sea
and Land, was ready to invade this Land, yea, to
take poſſeſſion of his Crowne, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
this extraordinary ſuddaine Exigent
put the Kingdome to theſe two extremities of
thoſe Writs, there being therefore (bleſſed
be GOD) no ſuch extraordinary occaſion as
then, this Preſident being extraordinary, is
nothing pertinent to the Writs now in queſtion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:157722:31"/>
nor any proofe at all of the lawfulneſſe of this
Taxe.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, it was in a time of open, and
eminent <hi>Warre,</hi> and danger, onely upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
ready to be made upon the Realme by
a forraine Prince, and Enemy both by Sea,
and Land, therefore no proofe of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the preſent Writs and Taxes in time
of peace. For inſtance,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Marſhall Law may be executed and
exerciſed by your <hi>Majeſties</hi> Commiſſion and
Prerogative in time of <hi>Warre,</hi> but not in peace,
as was lately reſolved by your <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the
whole <hi>Parliament</hi> in the Petition of <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in times of
open <hi>Warre,</hi> might compell trained ſouldiers
and others out of their owne Counties to the
Sea coaſt, or other parts, for the neceſſary
defence of the Realme, but this they cannot doe
in time of Peace. 1. <hi>E. 3. 4. 5. Parliament.
M. Ca.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in time of
forraine <hi>Warres,</hi> might by their Prerogative
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:157722:32"/>
Royall, ſeize the Land of all <hi>Priors, Aliens,</hi> when
they were extant in <hi>England,</hi> but that they could
not doe in times of Peace, 27. <hi>Aſſs. 48. 38.

3. 43. 21. H. 4. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> when
they had defenſive <hi>Warres</hi> with <hi>Scotland,</hi> they
might lawfully demand, receive, and take Eſcuage
of their ſubjects, and ſo did other Lords of their
<hi>Tenants,</hi> but in times of peace, they neither
did, nor could doe otherwiſe. <hi>Lit. Sect.</hi> 199. 95.
98. 100. 101. 102.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the <hi>Dangelt</hi> there granted at firſt, by
common conſent of the people in PARLIAMENT,
was due onely in the time of <hi>Warre,</hi> and not of
peace; as appeares by the Premiſſes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, ſubſidies and aides in former times
were not demanded by KINGS, nor granted in
<hi>Parliament</hi> by the ſubjects, but in time of <hi>Warre,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:157722:32"/>
or to defray the debts of the Prince, contracted
by the <hi>Warres, 14 E. 3. Ca, 21. 15. E. 3. Ca. 12.

            <p>Seventhly, the Goods of their Enemies may
