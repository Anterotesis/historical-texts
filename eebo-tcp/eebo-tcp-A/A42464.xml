            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Intend not to be over-long with you. My purpoſe is not to enter into diſpute, about what you now profeſſe to hold, or not hold; or to examine how far forth your at preſent profeſſed tenents are agreeable to truth: (I have work of more weight to take up my time, that, in regard of my preſent infirmity, hangeth heavy on my hand) but to cleare my ſelfe only, from ſuch imputations as you have been pleaſed, in your late <hi>Appendix,</hi> to caſt upon me; as having raiſed <note n="1" place="margin">pag. 1.</note> 
               <hi>a miſt, and cloud of ſlanders,</hi> committed <note n="2" place="margin">pag. 60.</note> 
               <hi>great and horrid ſin,</hi> and uſed <note n="3" place="margin">pag. 62.</note> 
               <hi>reproachfull, and railing ſpeeches, againſt you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer whereunto, when I ſhall have but ſimply and plainly related what concerning you, I have delivered, and on what ground; I ſuppoſe the hainouſneſſe, and horridneſſe of this hideous charge, will with any indifferent Reader be much allayed; yea, I hope, your charge it ſelfe, will appeare to be groundleſſe, and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall rank the heads of it, in that order, wherein your ſelfe have laid them down.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>error,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that is charged upon you, is,</hi> that <hi>the morall Law is of no uſe at all to a beleever; no rule for him to walk, nor to examine his life, by; and that Chriſtians are free from the mandatory power of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this I ſay only, that <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to Gods ey on his Iſrael. p. 17.18.</note> 
               <hi>it was at a publike hearing before a Committee of the houſe of Commons, in the Star-chamber, by ſufficient witneſſes, proved to have been delivered by ſome of the three,</hi> that <hi>were there convented,</hi> and in particular, by Mr. <hi>Randall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simſon.</hi> nor did I publiſh this, untill I had procured a view of the Papers of the worthy Chaire-man of that Honourable Committee, out of which, word for word, I tranſcribed the ſame. And if it be a wrong to divulge, what, in open Court, in a judiciary hearing, hath publikely paſt, I muſt then confeſſe that herein I have wronged Mr. <hi>S.</hi> otherwiſe not: for that is all, that herein I report Nor doth Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himſelfe deny what I herein aſſert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57885:3"/>Only two evaſions he hath, not to refell my report; but to wipe that of from himſelfe, which he is, it may well be, now in part aſhamed of.</p>
            <p>The former is, that <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 1.</note> ſome did <hi>either through ignorance, miſapprehend, or through malice miſreport,</hi> what he had delivered; and that to clear himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt branch of it, <hi>he had in a Sermon at Algate, taught the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the other three, he can either affirme, or deny them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it hath been wel-obſerved formerly concerning divers, who have taught about this City, wherein people, Athenian-like, too much affect novelties, that endeavouring to draw Diſciples after them, by broaching of new-fangled fancies, they have been wont to deliver their tenents in ſuch am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous termes, that albeit their followers acquainted with their canting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, underſtood what they intended in them; yet they might, by ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable gloſſes, and nice diſtinctions newly-minted, make them ſeem to be no other, then what the ſound, and Orthodox held.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> have in part ſince preached the contrary, to what hee was then charged with; and that the reſt of it, he can either ſay, or unſay, as he pleaſeth; yet what is all this to that, which was then charged upon him, or by witneſſe proved againſt him? which is all that I relate: and if it be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may come neerer home to what he now ſaith then himſelf taketh notice of. howſoever, it is no other to a tittle, then mine originall exhibiteth.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can, as he ſaith he can, averre the three latter; I ſee not, why he ſhould ſtick much at the firſt: ſince that it can hardly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, what ſpeciall uſe, the Law morall ſhould have in regard of a beleever, that may not be referred unto, and compriſed under, one of thoſe three.</p>
            <p>But this latter evaſion it may be, will ſtand him in better ſtead: and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of larger extent then the former, either charge or defence: for therein, he chargeth not me alone now, but the Honourable Committee, who had the whole managing of the buſineſſe, and his brethren, (as he is pleaſed yet to terme them) that by Order attended the Committee there. For he telleth his Reader,<note place="margin">p. 52.</note> that <hi>if this liberty had beene granted unto him, that his tenants might have beene received from himſelfe, before he were cenſured for them, it might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many reproaches, which he hath laine under, and many ſins in thoſe, who have raſhly cenſured him</hi>· But withall inſinuates that he was there, and then dealt with, as was <hi>John Huſſe, at the Councell of Conſtance, by the outragiouſneſſe of that Councell;</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>ſo many interrupting him at every word, and ſome mocking, and making mouthes at him, that it was impoſſible for him, to make a perfect anſwer to any thing</hi>: and in like manner, <hi>that when he endeavoured to acquaint the Committee fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his mind, he was ſo interrupted,</hi> (and why added he not <hi>mocked, and mouthed,</hi> to?) <hi>that it was impoſſible for any man to know his mind, and judgement: and that it was frequently added by the brethren,</hi> (as if they had the managing of the buſineſſe, and not the Committee) <hi>that, that day was a day, wherein he was to heare the charge againſt him, and that there would be a day appointed, wherein he ſhould have liberty to bring in his anſwer to the Committee</hi>; but that <hi>ſuch a day is not yet to be found,</hi> nor, as he further intimates, is like to be, untill <hi>Aſtraea</hi> (an heathen Goddeſſe) <hi>come down from heaven</hi> (where, but by poeticall fiction, ſhe ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er was) <hi>to doe juſtice to the oppreſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57885:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Concerning which, I ſhall take a little more pains, then I deſired to doe, for the clearing of the Committee, as well, as my ſelf. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> therefore here ſo telleth his own tale, that thoſe, who were not acquainted with the proceedings of the Committee, might conceive the carriage of the buſineſſe to have beene ſuch, as that he, and his complices there, had but one day of appearance, and on that day, they had their charge only given them, unto which, they were not ſuffered to return anſwer, to any purpoſe: for that if they ſpake ought to that purpoſe, they were interrupted, if not farre worſe dealt with; and told that they ſhould have another day for anſwer. Whereas indeed it is well known, that they had not, one, or two alone; but many dayes of hearing. Yea, that at their firſt appearing, before any charge formally entred, or proceeding to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of witneſſes, they were by the Committee entreated to deliver their minds in writing, for the better clearing of themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch points, as were ſuggeſted, to have been either taught or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome of them, or to go for currant among their followers; that ſo the buſineſſe might be, in a fair, and friendly way (if it were poſſible) compoſed, without proceeding in any ſuch judiciary courſe. But this they utterly at firſt, refuſed to doe; nor without much urging, and preſſing by the Committee, could be induced, at length, to condeſcend unto. And when they had, by ſuch importunity, been drawn to undertake it; and a day aſſigned them, to bring in their anſwer; how willing, or deſirous they were, to clear what they had taught, or to make manifeſt, what their mind, and judgement was, may appear, by their anſwers returned to ſome of the Queſtions, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered unto them; which out of the Copies remaining in the worthy Chairmans hands, I ſhall here word for word, inſert.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. 1. <hi>Whether the morall Law did oblige a beleeving Iew to obedience?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Whether a beleever be bound to conform his life to the morall Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God in that Law requires it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of the Law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh; but after the ſpirit.</hi> Rom. 8.4. <hi>I through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I may live unto God.</hi> Gal. 2.19.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>The Law abſtracted from Chriſt, is no Rule, for unbeleevers to walk by, for life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>Whether a beleever may make threatnings a motive to deterre him from ſin; and the promiſes a motive to encourage him to duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57885:4"/>Anſ. <hi>That to ſerve God for the hope of a legall reward, and for fear of legall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is no Chriſtian ſervice: or, in Mr.</hi> Tindalls <hi>words, That to ſerve God, for fear of hell; or the joyes of heaven, are but ſhadows of good works.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>Whether a beleever in ſinning, breaks any morall Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>Sinne is the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>Whether when</hi> Peter <hi>wept bitterly for denying Chriſt, he did it out of weakneſſe of faith, or duty to God</hi>?</p>
            <p>Anſw. Peters <hi>weeping might be from weak faith, and ſo from fear; or, from ſtrong faith, and ſo from love: but whether, we know not, only we hope it was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall duty</hi>·</p>

            <p>Queſt. 11. <hi>Whether a beleever in the act of adultery, or murder, may ſee the diſcharge of that ſin in Chriſt, and his part in Chriſt, before his repentance, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for it, as well as after all the humiliation in the world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>They are framed in very odious, and ambiguous terms.</hi> 2. <hi>That a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever ſeldome, or never falls into ſuch wilfull, ſcandalous wickedneſſe; becauſe the love of Chriſt conſtrains him far above all legall motives.</hi> 3. <hi>That if perhaps a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever ſhould fall ſo; yet ought he not to adde infidelity to this other ſinne.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. 12. <hi>Whether a beleever in the act of adultery, or murder, may enjoy as ſweet communion with God, as in the performance of any holy duty?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>That the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, that is, Chriſt; and that by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Eſay. 53.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 14. <hi>Whether a beleever falling into ſinne, ought not to pray for the actuall pardon of it, in the ſight of God, or only for the manifeſtation of it, to his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the continuation of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>That when it ſhall be explained to us out of the Scripture, what is meant by actuall pardon; and what by the ſight of God, then ſhall we be better able to anſwer to this propoſition.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. 15. <hi>Whether there ought to be dayes of faſting and humiliation appointed under the Goſpell?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 16. <hi>Whether a Chriſtian ought to afflict his ſoul, with ſorrow for ſin, in a day of humiliation, and whether it be ſin to ſorrow for ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>That all humiliation, and ſorrow for ſin, which is not of faith, is ſin.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. 17. <hi>Whether a beleever humbling himſelf for ſin, in theſe ſad dayes, ſeeking Gods face, and returning unto him, may not expect a bleſſing from God, and the Nation for Chriſts ſake in ſo doing, and whether the doing of theſe duties for this end, be the cauſe why our faſting, and Prayer prevailes no more with God, for the healing of the land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>That although a man pretend to humble himſelf; yet if he make his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

repentance, and reformation, a fortreſſe, and tower of defence, the munition, armour, and wall of braſſe, to defend the Kingdome, and Nation; if he makes his repentance of ſuch omnipotent efficacy, that there is no thunder-bolt ſo great; no wrath ſo furious in God; but it will aboliſh it, without ſo much, as mentioning the Lord Ieſus, who only delivereth us, from the wrath to come, who if he had not delivered us from the deſert of the ſinfulneſſe of our humiliation, repentance, and reformation, the juſt wages thereof would have been everlaſting fire: we beleeve ſuch humiliation, is neerer the pride of Lucifer, then true Chriſtian humiliation.</hi> 2. <hi>That among the great ſinnes of the Kingdome, we beleeve, that the great eſteem, dignifying, and exalting of our own works, doings, and duties, to make our peace with God, is a dethroning our great, and only peace-maker, and thereby a moſt dangerous enemy to the peace of this Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, beſides that from ſome of theſe Queſtions, it may be obſerved, what wholeſome and ſavoury documents their followers (at leaſt) deduce from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents by theſe men maintained; to let (I ſay) that paſſe; let any intelligent, and indifferent reader judge by moſt of their Anſwers, whether theſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have <hi>men know their mind and judgement</hi>; as this man pretendeth, that his deſire, and endeavour was to have done, but that he was ſo <hi>interrupted, that it was not poſſible for him ſo to do.</hi> Sure in writing there was no body to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him, or them: and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himſelf, being the principall ſpokeſman among them, was by ſome of the brethren in an orderly manner diſputed with, without any ſuch interruption, as he here complaineth of; and was often alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heard at large. Nor was there proceeding to any hearing of witneſſes, untill they had refuſed to give more clear, and ſatisfactory anſwer, unto theſe, and ſome other of the Queſtions, delivered unto them: for unto many of them, they returned no anſwer at all. And if this mans mind therefore were not then fully made known (as he pretends) concerning thoſe points: himſelf was in fault; in whoſe power, and at whoſe choiſe it was, to have fully in writing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the ſame, had he been minded ſo to doe: mean while, that he had ſo taught, as in the charge is related, was then, and there averred; nor any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions taken unto thoſe, that witneſſed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Theſe things then, ſo tranſacted at a publike hearing, and ſuch points charged upon, and teſtified againſt, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to have been delivered by him, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot gain-ſay: I ſuppoſe it to have been no <note n="“" place="margin">p. 17.</note> breach of <hi>charity</hi> (as hee chargeth it) to deem, that <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to Gods ey, &amp;c. p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>from thence, thoſe exclamations of his might well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; away with the Law, away with the Law</hi>: as alſo that <hi>horrid ſpeech,</hi> (ſo I term it again, and ſtill ſhall do, whatſoever colours Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſhall pleaſe to var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it over with, thereby to ſmooth, or ſmoother the horridneſſe of it) <hi>The Law cutteth of a mans leggs, and then biddeth him walk:</hi> which whether it be fitly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled <note n="“" place="margin">p. 28.30.</note> with thoſe paſſages of the Apoſtle; <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7.5.</note>

And as for ſome <note n="“" place="margin">p. 18.</note> harſh expreſſions of <hi>Luther</hi> concerning the Law; as the like alſo concerning Chriſt; which in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much heat of paſſion, ſeem to have fallen from him; and I would rather men ſhould read in the writings of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and others of his way and ſtrain, then hear

from me; I ſuppoſe men moderately minded will hardly juſtifie them; much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe take liberty to themſelves therein to imitate him, and yet further much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to forge others thereby far harſher then thoſe of his.</p>
            <p>The next matte of charge againſt Mr. <hi>S.</hi> was, that he ſhould teach, <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to Gods ey, &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That God doth not chaſtiſe any of his children for ſinne, nor is it for the ſins of Gods people that the Land is puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereunto might further have been added, that preſumptuous ſpeech of his in open Court, then confidently uttred; whereof my ſelf was an ear-witneſſe. That <hi>he did not beleeve, that any ſinne of his own, or of any beleever, had any hand in the procuring of the judgements of God, then upon the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As alſo what in a paper was given in by him, under his own hand, contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heads of a Sermon Preached at Algate, at the giving, and taking of the Covenant (occaſioned it ſeems by that <hi>Queſtion</hi> among others propounded; <hi>whether a beleever may lawfully take the Covenant, as it reqireth his confeſſing his ſins, deſerving the calamities, and judgements, that now ly upon the Nation?</hi>) in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I did profeſſe, that J thought what I had taught was a truth, That nationall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments do not come upon a Land, or Nation, for thoſe ſins, for which Gods juſtice is ſatisfied in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning this, which he cannot deny, and yet would fain ſalv; he maketh anſwer, that <note n="“" place="margin">p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>ſome few weeks, for want of experimentall knowledge, he was a little clouded in his ſpirit, concerning the doctrine of affliction</hi>; but that <hi>his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake was never charged upon him, by his accuſers</hi>: (which riddle of his, what it means, I cannot arread) and that <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>yet in his darkeſt, and moſt cloudy diſcourſes, he held forth enough to charitable and loving hearers, to free him from this charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He might better have ſaid, that by theſe, and the like aſſertions, he ſtaved people of, and kept them aloof, ſuch eſpecially as were forward to rank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, among the number of beleevers, from deeming their ſins to have any hand in the procurement of Gods judgements upon the ſtate, and from being humbled in that regard, in the ſight of God for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Sure when he appeared in the Star-chamber, he was far enough from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that, that might free him, from the charge: belike his appearance there, was within the compaſſe of thoſe <hi>few weeks,</hi> during which his ſpirit was under the <hi>cloud,</hi> he ſpeaks of. And yet by <note n="*" place="margin">From p. 36. to p. 43.</note> a long lacinious diſcourſe, to ſhew either the ſubtilty, or ſublimity of his wit, in being able to argu either way, he would make men beleev, that he taught nothing then, but what he holds now, though he profeſſeth now to have attained <note n="“" place="margin">p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>a more cleer and truly ſpirituall knowledge of the point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein he ſeems to reſemble <note n="*" place="margin">H. Cl.</note> one, that living ſometime in the City, did preach publikely, that <hi>the plague was not infectious</hi>; who being convented before autority, and qeſtioned for ſuch his doctrine, his anſwer was, that he denied not, but that <hi>the plague-ſores, or blains might be infectious</hi>; but his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that <hi>the ſtroke of Gods Angel was not infectious.</hi> But as his doctrin, ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, whatſoever his reſerved meaning was, did encourage people to repair over-boldly to thoſe that were viſited, and that, as was then deemed, to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57885:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
damage, yea, and death, of not a few: So it may juſtly be feared, that theſe cloudy, or rather peremptory aſſertions of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> have endamaged, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered ſoules, not a few, in with-holding them from ſerious humiliation for their ſins, under the hand of God, as wel upon themſelvs in particular, as upon the land in generall; notwithſtanding theſe his diſtinctions, which he cometh out with now; but not heard of then, when this charge, was given in againſt him: at which time, it ſeemed to be grounded upon <hi>Gods not ſight of ſin in any Beleever,</hi> the principall ſubject of Mr <hi>Eatons</hi> book, then juſtified among them; elſe what reaſon ſhould there be of Gods not inflicting evills <hi>nationall,</hi> more then <hi>perſonall</hi> upon any, in regard of <hi>ſins ſatisfied for by Chriſt,</hi> in both which <note n="†" place="margin">p. 42.</note> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf makes the caſe to be all one.</p>
            <p>Mean while, what hath bin affirmed, is not here removed, that this poſition, in both branches of it, was by witneſſes produced, proved to have bin delivered by Mr <hi>S.</hi> which is as much as I avert.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57885:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
minde, that I have any where written of you; what <hi>railings</hi> appear there, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of it? or who is able to ſay, that I ever railed upon you, either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, or in private? Sir, it is none of my uſage: what yours is, I wot not. This charge of yours therefore, I am well aſſured, you are leſſe able to make good, then I am all, that hath bin by me charged upon you.</p>
            <p>For ſuch erroneous points, as have bin broached by you, and others, if I have maintained the truth of God againſt you, or them, and diſcovered the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill conſequents of them, I have therein done no more, then what my duty to God, and his people, hath in my place required of me: and that the rather, for that I perceived divers of my people to be too much taken with them. For your ſelf, the time was, when having heard you, once, or twice in my place, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invitation of you home, had ſome conference with you; I tooke ſo good liking of you, that not long after motion being made for a weekely lecture in my congregation, I recommended you, to ſome of my people, that were moſt active in the buſineſſe, who upon enquiry enformed me, that y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u were like to ſettle, either at Dunſtans, or Butolphs, whether of the two, I now remember not: and ſo that buſineſſe was at an end. Some good ſpace of time after, I heard, by reports of many, ſome of mine own people, among others, who uſed to hear you; that you were fallen into divers ſtrange points, tending to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm; and that ſome of my Congregation, women eſpecially, were, by hearing of you, therewith infected: that which afterward appeared to be no falſe report, or groundleſſe ſurmiſe, but a truth. For there repared to me one day, two women of your Auditors, living under my charge, who were earneſt with me, to have uſe of my Church, for a day of ſolemn humiliation; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that they would bring none, but Miniſters to perform the duties of the day. Demand being made, who the Miniſters were; the anſwer was, <hi>Mr: Simſon,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Randal. why thoſe? becauſe I had received ſome aſperſions againſt Mr. Simſon,</hi> (I give you their words,) <hi>which he would take off. What aſperſions? I had confuted ſome of his points, what points, or point? I had taught that ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was an evidence of juſtification. and did he hold, and teach the contrary? yea, and that which he had taught therein, was the truth, to wit, that ſanctification was no ſure evidence of juſtification</hi>; that which according to their weak ability, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured ſtifly to maintain. In concluſion, I anſwered them, that if it were ſo, you ſhould not, with my conſent, come into my Pulpit, by the leavening of my people, to make me work, for the unleavening of them againe. They told me plainely, <hi>if they could not have you in publike, they would have you in private</hi>; and ſo I was after told they had. Now true it is, that I had handled that point a little before purpoſely, upon occaſion of another, that had neerer at hand, fallen upon that argument, and uſed ſome reproachfull terms, concerning that evidence, nothing minding Mr S. But Sir hence it appeares, what by your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers acknowledgement, you then taught; and that by your ſuch teaching, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you now hold, or pretend to hold, people were then tainted, and ſome of mine own, among others; (for I preſume they were not here in alone,) who continue ſtill ſtif both in this erroneous conceit, and in that other, which you now ſo deepely brand, concerning <hi>Gods not ſeeing ſin at all in his Saints,</hi> which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57885:8"/>
is not unlikely they ſucked then together with the former, from Mr <hi>Randall,</hi> and your ſelf, whom they conſtantly followed.</p>
            <p>But Sir, if I had ſo exceedingly wronged you, as you here pretend; and uſed ſuch reproachfull, and railing language, as you here intimate, againſt you; I marvel much, what the reaſon ſhould be, that I never heard ought of it, all this while before, from you: which had bin no difficult matter, for you, to have done, either by word of mouth, or by a few lines in writing; you being not ignorant of the place of my conſtant abode, whereunto by a continued ſtate of infirmity, I have bin confined, now almoſt theſe three years. That which yet I ſhould not have mentioned, ſave in regard of ſome reports that have bin caſt abroad, whether coming from your ſelf, or no, I know not. It is not long ſince, I ſuppoſe, about a twelv-moneth paſt, that one of my people repairing to me, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from your ſelf, acquainted me with your willingnes, to beſtow your paines, ſome Lords day, with me, if I would give way to it. I told him, I thought it, not ſo ſafe for me ſo to doe; in regard of thoſe erroneous opinions that you had bin charged with, and had not cleared your ſelfe of. He replyed, that <hi>you now acknowledged your judgement in thoſe points to be altered.</hi> I told him again, that if your judgement were altered, from what formerly you had hold; you might do well to make it publikely known, thereby to undeceiv thoſe, who had formerly bin miſled by you: but that you ſhould ſo prefeſſe, did to me ſeem very ſtrange: for that within ſome few daies before, I had bin infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Gentlewoman of good credit, that it was reported by a Miniſter, then about the City, (one in whoſe Lecture, at great All-halows, if I miſtake not, you ſucceeded,) as from your ſelf, <hi>that you had bin with me, and made it appeare unto me, that I had wronged you, in charging you with what you had not held.</hi> Now Sir, whether both theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or either of them, came from yourſelf, or no, (the latter whereof, for the ſubject matter of it, I am ſure, is untru) your ſelf beſt know. I relate them both as they came to me; wiſhing that the former of them, may be tru, and that God will be pleaſed to give you a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all things.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have done with you, and your charge againſt me, not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to waſte further time about this buſines, which (in regard of other more important employment, formerly hinted) both is, and will be very precious with me: but to leav and referre what I have here ſaid, to the conſideration, and conſtruction of others, thereof to deem, and upon adviſed peruſall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether I have attracted ſuch hainous, and horrid guilt, or no, as you herein charge upon me, by ought that concerning you, and your teaching, I have any where publiſhed.</p>
            <p>And if it be demanded, why this Apology came no ſooner abroad, ſince, that being ſo ſhort, it might ſuddenly have bin diſpatched; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by occaſion of mine other hard task, (the one half whereof, I had not as yet overcome, by reaſon of a long continued, and late renewed infirmity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein much retarded, and was loth therefore to filch time from for any other, not very neceſſary, by-buſines, before I ſaw ſo much at leaſt of it accompliſhed) I had not leaſure, ſo much, as to ſurvey your charge againſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57885:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me; nor was afterward able to returne ſo full anſwer thereunto, untill I had a view of ſome papers, concerning that buſines of publike hearing; whereof, by reaſon of diſability to ſtir far abroad, I could not procure either fight, or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, but by others.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, Sir, I ſhall beſeech you, in the fear of God, adviſedly to conſider with your ſelf, what multitudes of people, have of late bin drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſide, into groſſ, and pernicious errors, by thoſe, whom you have ſometime conſorted, and complyed with; and by your ſelf, in likelyhood, not a few (as ſome of them profeſſ it) among the reſt: that you may be ſeriouſly humbled in the ſight of God, for what of this kind, you have formerly failed, and faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in; ſincerely to his glory acknowledge your former overſights therein; diſcreetly, and prudently, for time to come, forbear ſuch expreſſions, as may in ordinary apprehenſion, tend to the fomenting of liberty to ſin, and looſnes of life; and piouſly proſecute the preſſing upon all ſorts, the practice of repentance, which God by his judgements preſent upon us, doth ſo inceſtantly, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly call upon us for; and that duty, which God in his Law reqireth of them, and whereunto in regard of Creation, as wel, as of redemption, they ought to hold themſelvs ſtil obliged: that ſo you may, if it be poſſible, (which with ſome peradventure yet, is never like to be;) but that you may at leaſt, do what in you lieth, to reduce thoſe, whom you have formerly turned out of the way, and cauſed to ſtumble at Gods Law. By ſo doing, you will gain more ſound peace, and ſolid comfort in the end, then by complying with the humors of people, unſtable, and unſetled, (of whoſe mutability, and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy I doubt not, but that you have had, or ſeen ſome experience your ſelf) you ſhall be ever able to attain. The Lord be with you, and vouchſafe unto you, and us all, ſpirituall wiſdome to carry our ſelvs aright, and uprightly in all things, to the honour of his grace in us, and truth profeſſed by us; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and building up of his people, in either; the faithfull diſcharge of our duty here, and eternall welfare, for, and with our bleſſed Saviour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Amen.</hi>
