            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the writing and publishing
of bookes for the good of the
whole Church, so the intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or dedicating of them (Right
worshipfull Lady) to some notable
personage in particular, is grounded
vpon many iust causes, and great
commodities which it bringeth: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
vnto vs by the continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Church from time to time:
and warranted by pregnant examples
in the word of God. For by this meanes
it commeth to passe, that both the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb facs="tcp:7415:4"/>
of men (whereby the building of
Gods Church is greatly furthered) is
procured for the maintenance of the
trueth and the proffessours of it, and
also their graces, vertues, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
liues, not onely crowned with
due and deserued praise (a thing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and acceptable in the sight of
God, yea a notable encouragement,
and spurre to good workes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
carefully perfourmed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 16. and in many
other places) but also propounded for
imitation to the whole Church, as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
set on the tops of hils, and as a
candle not couered with a bushell, but
set in a candlesticke, in the light wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
men may see, enter, and follow on
the way leading to eternall life.</p>
            <p>Thus the Euangelist <hi>Luke</hi> writeth
<pb facs="tcp:7415:4"/>
the story of the life &amp; death of Christ,
to one <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> that
diuine Apostle, inscribeth one of his
Epistles to a certaine faithfull and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Lady: and thus as infinite others
haue written publike argumentes to
priuate men, so we doe now presume to
prefixe your Ladiships name to this
simple treatise, written of a matter
worthy to be handled after a better
manner, to wit, of the spirituall state
of man, or of the holinesse and sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the puritie and corruption of
the soule.</p>
            <p>It is not needfull, vnlesse perhaps
in regard of them who are vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the state of that country, to
rehearse the reasons mouing me so to
doe. To let passe the earnest desire of
them who might commaund me in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:7415:5"/>
lawful matter, but especially in this
it is well knowen, that in the towne &amp;
country where you dwell, as in worldly
dignity God hath giuen vnto you an
high place and calling, so you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
thankefulnesse to him, and
beene in the profession of the Gospell of
Christ, not the last, or lowest, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and zealous and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in seruing God your selfe, but also
in procuring the saluation of others,
by setting vp and maintaining the
ministery of the word, and fauouring
the sincere preachers and professors of
it. As I my selfe, (who being in some
sort astraunger in those partes know
not much of the affaires of them) know
in diuerse of my friendes, for whose
good I haue good cause to reioyce, and
to giue your Ladiship hearty thankes
<pb facs="tcp:7415:5"/>
for great fauour shewed vnto them.
Yea I am perswaded, that many in that
country (the good whereof especially we
intend in this action) will, to let other
reasons passe, euen for that loue which
they beare vnto you, more hartely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and more willingly take the
paines to peruse this treatise.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I doubt, but that God
will accomplish that notable worke,
which he hath begunne in you, and by
your meanes: &amp; so inlarge that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of spiritual grace which he hath
put into your heart, that the streames
thereof shall ouerflow that dry and
barren contry, and water that tender
plante of the true knowledge of Christ,
so lately set, and so seldome to be seene
in it, yea refresh the bowels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
the hearts of all that feare God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7415:6"/>
Considering that for the effecting
hereof, God hath giuen vnto you
manie singular meanes, which he hath
denied vnto others of his seruants:
as namelie, worldly honour and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the which meeting with the vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
loue of God, and of his glory, doth
as a mightie gale of winde set forward
the gospell of Christ in a speedie and
happie course: purchasing vnto it
friendlie entertainemet and fauour
at the handes of many, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would perhaps not greatly regard
it. For then the state of the Church is
most flourishing, when as Kinges and
Queenes, Lordes and Ladies, and all
degrees of honourable men &amp; women
are nourse-fathers, and nourse-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
vnto her.</p>
            <p>But then especially this commeth,
<pb facs="tcp:7415:6"/>
to passe, whenas wisedome sitteth at
the helme, guiding worldly power &amp;
spirituall zeale in the right course. As
touching the which vertue, if I should
heere mention that which is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reported of you, I should seem to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
euen to all that know you not, to
doe that which I would be loath to do,
euen to flatter: &amp; that not onely your
selfe but also your sexe: the which, if
that be true, which is generally thoght
and spoken, may by your example wipe
away that blot of sillie simplicity and
want of deepe reach in matters of
importance, wherewith it is vsually
stained and debased.</p>
            <p>But I must be sparing in this behalf
least that I seeme to mind and admire
your wisedome so much, that in the
meane time I forget and offend your
<pb facs="tcp:7415:7"/>
modesty, the most proper and pretious
iewell of your sexe. Onely I desire
God to encrease this and all other his
good graces in you, and so to guide you
by them in the whole course of your
life, that they who haue occasion to
trie, may haue good cause to say, as the
prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doth of and to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
1. Sam.</hi> 26. 33. Blessed be thy
wisedome: you know the storie. Thus
being loth to be tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
vnto you, I commend this sillie
present to your gentle acceptation, &amp;
your Ladiship to the gracious prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God. </p>

consideration and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
entertainment (gentle
reader) a rude description
of the spirituall state of man.
The which if perhaps thou desire to haue
for shortnesse, plainnesse, memory, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
sake comprised in some one memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
worde, may not vnfitly be tearmed
<hi>Adam</hi> in whome onely all these three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
did concurre and may be seene, or an
anatomie of the soule. A matter of all other
most needefull to be knowen and learned:
yea most worthy to be handled, explaned,
dilated, and illustrated with all care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
it being that wherein the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of man doth wholly consist. For
this is eternall saluation to knowe God, to
wit, the father creating vs according to
his owne image in perfect puritie: the sonne
redeeming vs by his pretious bloud from
sinne and miserie: the holy spirite sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and renewing vs by his grace to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory. In the which respect we haue
<pb facs="tcp:7415:8"/>
thought that our time and laboure, the
which it hath pleased God in mercy to ty to
the study of his holy word, coulde not be
better bestowed then in commending this
sauing knowledge vnto others: and that by
this meanes which nowe we vse, being
thereunto moued by some vrgent reasons,
wherewith it is not needefull that either
we shoulde trouble you, or you your selfe.
Our purpose, or rather our desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
is, to make an anatomie of the soule
of man, to lay open before thy eyes the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
partes and faculties of it, together with
the naturall and supernaturall holinesse and
sinfulnesse of them.</p>
            <p>Wherein we haue endeuored to vse as
great breuitie and plainnesse as we coulde,
and as the greate varietie and difficultie of
the matter, which often is verie intricate,
woulde permit: auoyding both loathsome
tediousnesse and vnprofitable obscuritie, as
thinkeing it much better not to speake
then not to be vnderstoode, and to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
darke matter in rude and homelie
tearmes, then with enigmaticall parables
to amaze and mocke the reader. We haue
rather applied our stile to the capacitie of
the simple, and the good of all, by insisting
most in those thinges whereby we may be
<pb facs="tcp:7415:8"/>
edified in the knowledge and obedience of
Christ, then affected the curious scanning
of subtile questions, seruing rather for
the whetting of the witt, then the sauing
of the soule. And yet as they haue their vse,
which is not to be neglected, so we do
breifely touch them as occasion is offered.
Desiring the readers, especially those who
doe not professe learning, to picke out of
this treatise some matter of edification ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then of contention, and with me to
leaue needlesse controuersies to scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
exercises, and men of nimble wites.</p>
            <p>But what needeth all this, will some man
say: this laboure might verie well haue bene
spared, and much better bestowed: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the abundance of knowledge, the
daily and continual preaching, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie
of bookes written of all argumentes
both diuine and prophane, in such swarmes
and huge multitudes, that men haue no
leasure to looke on the faire inscriptions,
much lesse to peruse the tedious and irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
bodyes of them. Yea men are so cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and deceaued with vaine repetition of
olde matter glosed ouer with new wordes,
and so amazed with straunge doctrines late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deuised, that they haue in a manner
giuen ouer the buying and reading of
<pb facs="tcp:7415:9"/>
bookes, esteeming it a fruitelesse and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
mispending of mony and time, both
which ought to be reserued for necessary
vses, and a needlesse disquieting of their
mindes being already sufficiently groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and settled in the trueth. Howe iust and
true this complainte is in some respect we
are not nowe to discusse: but for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereof we speake, it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if so it pleased God, that it were true
indeede, and that we had as great plenty
of the true knowledge of God and of
sounde teachers of the trueth, as of the
stones in the streetes, and in one worde,
that all the people of God did prophecy.</p>
            <p>But is it so indeed? doth knowledge,
religion, godlinesse, and all the meanes
thereof, or not rather palpable ignoraunce,
atheisme, and superstition abounde in most
places? Yea surely, the complainte of the
Prophet <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 1. is more true, There is no
knowledge or feare of God in the land.</p>
            <p>But what of this? is this to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the want of bookes and other
meanes of knowledge? Surely there is
no cause why either some places shoulde
complaine of want, or any loath their
plenty in this behalfe. We haue moe
bookes learnedly and godlely written, then
<pb facs="tcp:7415:9"/>
we doe vse well, and yet we might vse
moe well then we haue. There is and
will be as long as the church remaineth here
on earth a needfull vse of newe tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
comments, sermons, catechismes,
and determinations, as newe reasons, illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and methodes are inuented: as
newe doubtes, controuersies, errours, and
hereses doe arise: as this or that vice doth
raigne: and as men giue themselues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
to the studying of particular heades
of doctrine, and partes of the worde of
God. All is not to be expected at any
one hand: where one sleepeth, another
waketh: one is concise and darke, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
large and plaine: one drie and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
an other full and pithy. Yea in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
writers thou shalt see the admirable
variety of spirituall giftes, and so be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp to praise the greate bounty of God
towardes his church, The doctrine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to godlinesse (as th' apostle defineth
diuinitie) is a large feilde, wherein ten
thousand may laboure continually, and all
haue elbow roome: yea each one differ
from the rest, not onely in manner but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in matter and argument, howsoeuer all
doe handle the same doctrine in generall.
As for diuersitie of opinions in some cases,
<pb facs="tcp:7415:10"/>
it ought not any way to trouble or offend
any man, seing that it is the will of God,
that while we remaine here on earth, we
shoulde both knowe and prophecie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by speaking or by writing, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
but onely in part. A fewe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
doe not, as it may seeme, either
impaire the credit of the teachers, or shake
the faith of the hearers of Gods worde,
but rather strengthen and vpholde both.
For hereby it appeareth, that men doe not
(as the prophete compalineth. <hi>Iere.</hi> 23.
30.) steale the worde of God one from
an other, deliuering for sounde doctrine,
whatsoeuer the most doe holde and
teach, rather then what they themselues
doe thinke: and so conspiring together in
a compact forme of doctrine, are not many
but onely one witnesse: but are in their
consciences before God perswaded of the
trueth of the gospell of Christ, which they
professe and teach. It is but folly to looke
for in mortall and earthly men, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
and angelicall harmonie void of all
iarring. It is rather our partes to labour in
repressing that pride and selfel-oue of our
corrupt natures, whereby men carnally
minded and affected, are made to swell in
anger and hatred against those who doe
<pb facs="tcp:7415:10"/>
not in euerie respect daunce after their pipe:
being more alienated from their brethren
for some fewe contradictions, then ioyned
together in Christian loue, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente
in all the points of religion beside.
Milde and modest dissenting worketh out
the trueth, as the striking of flintes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth sparkes of fier: and that often
commeth to passe <hi>errando via reperta:</hi> Try
all and keepe the best.</p>
            <p>But we trust that no man will make
these obiections which we imagine, or
thinke, much lesse speake euil of that which
is intended for his good. That which one
misliketh, another perhaps will approue:
and if studentes waste their inke and we are
their pens, and printers venture their paines
and paper, they for their owne exercise,
or in any other good intente, these in hope
of some honest aduantage, and both of
them in a Christian desire of profiting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
let not that trouble thee. The losse
is their owne, and it is lawfull for them to
doe with their owne what they list (we
speake of priuat censures not of publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint)
vse mennes writings and giftes, if
thou thinke them for thy purpose: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
take their good meaning (and ours
among the rest, not the worst of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:7415:11"/>
in good part, and so leaue them to
their likers or to their losse.</p>
            <p>Lastly we desire the friendly reader to
put to his helping hand to this worke which
we haue taken in hande to amend what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

            <head>The argument of the treatise
following.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE last and chiefe end why God in
the beginning made the world with
all thinges therein contained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the
setting foorth of his glory: the which before
the creation did shine in and to himselfe onely:
whereas now all the creatures doe praise his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
name. For the effecting whereof, it was
needfull that the creature should be endued with
a kinde of excellencie so great, as that it might
manifest the glory of the power, wisedome, and
goodnesse of God, and yet so meane, that it
should not in any respect be comparable to the
excellency of the creator. Hence it is, that
the state of all thinges in the worlde,
euen of the most excellent creatures, is
kept downe and debased from the state of God,
as in many other respectes, so especially in this,
that the one is momentanie, variable and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse,
the other being eternall, constant, and
the same for euer. So we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14.
whenas God would euen paint out the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his owne nature, and distinguish himselfe
from all other thinges whatsoeuer doe any way
exist, he saith that his name is, <hi>I will be who
I wil be</hi> or <hi>who I am,</hi> that is, I am not a chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
creature, but the Almighty <hi>Iehoua,</hi> in
whome there is no shadowe of chaunge. But it
<pb facs="tcp:7415:13"/>
is farre otherwise with the creature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is no permanent state to be found. And
to let passe the baser sort of them, which are
made for corruption, and to be consumed in the
vse, let vs consider the state of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
creatures, euen those which being endued
with reason, were made according to the image
of God, to wit, Angels and men: of whose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
the scripture witnesseth, that it is not
onely chaungeable, but also straungely chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
For it being in the first creation most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
glorious, and holy, became afterward most
impure, wretched, and vile. Neither doth it
stay here, but by the mercy of God man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his first excellency. So we read, <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.
18. 19. behold in his seruantes he will not trust,
no not in his Angels wil he put any confidence
how much lesse in men dwelling in howses of clay
whose foundation is in the dust &amp;c? Neither
can it be otherwise, for God hath his being from
himselfe, but the creature dependeth on God,
by whome it was made, and therefore can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exist nor continue in any estate longer then
the good pleasure of God doth permit. This
mutability of the creature appeareth chiefly in
man, whose diuerse states being three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
we doe indeuour to lay open in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
The first is the state of the first creation, of
holinesse, of life, and all happinesse. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:7415:14"/>
is the estate of the fall, of sinne, of
death, and of all miserie. The third is the state
of regeneration, of righteousnesse, of saluation,
and of eternall glory. These three estates, we
desire to declare out of the word of God, which
entreateth plentifully of the two latter, but
more sparingly of the first, for that it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a verie short time. Yet we may learne the
doctrine of it also out of the scripture, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by these meanes: first out of the example of
<hi>Adam, Eua,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> the which three one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all mankinde liued in this estate. Secondly
out of the state of the Angels which agreeth
with the state of man in many respectes, and
therefore we doe often in the two first estates
speake of the Angels, not of set purpose, but
as by the way and for the further illustration of
the state of man, who in his creation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with all the Angels, and in his fall with
the reprobate sort of them. Thirdly we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the innocency of man in those thinges
which the scripture speaketh of God, to whom
it often giueth the person of man not pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with sinne but remaining in his first purity:
and lastly we may gather what was the state of
the first creation by the state of regeneration,
the which being nothing else but the renewing
of the first estate, will giue vs great light for
the vnderstanding of it. Further, this is to be
<pb facs="tcp:7415:14"/>
marked that by the state of innocency we do not
meane those fewe daies onely wherein <hi>Adam</hi>
did continue innocent, but also the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
and course of this state, as it would haue
beene if man had not fallen at all, the which
supposed continuance of the state of innocencie
differeth much from that actuall estate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall: for he was not at
the first endued with any such actuall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of holinesse and happinesse, but that he was
daily to encrease in both these respectes, as God
should reueale himselfe more &amp; more vnto him.

some should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For euen as the strength, wisedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and beauty of a man cannot purchase vnto

some others besides himselfe doe marke,
knowe and acknowledge those excellent

the heauens,<note place="margin">Of the state of innocency and life.</note> the ayre, the water, and the
earth, although they be decked and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with starres, birds, fishes, beasts, and
many other admirable creatures, and doe
containe in them infinite matter of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
yet they could not any iot encrease that
glory which God had before the creation,
vnlesse there were some other creatures able
to obserue, conceiue, declare, admire, and
extoll the power, wisedome, and goodnesse
of God shining in these thinges. For this
cause, God after that he had made the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and the lower world, the one consisting
of the heauens, the other of the elements,
he sawe it needfull for the illustration of his
glory, to create Angels and men to be the
inhabitants, and as his tenaunts of these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
palaces, yea to behold and confesse
the excellency of his workemanshippe in
themselues, and in the rest of the creatures.
For the which purpose he gaue vnto them,
faculties of vnderstanding, and speaking,
with many other, which he denied to the
rest.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the excellent state of Angels
and men, beeing made to be witnesses,
and preachers of the glorie of God, and so
being admitted into the presence of God,
are there to beholde his glorie: yet with this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7415:18"/>
differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the Angels doe behold it more
clearely in heauen, and man more obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in earth. Heerein consisteth the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of these creatures in that they are thus
made partakers, of the glorious presence of
God, and so ioyned to God. For heereof
it commeth that they are both happy and
holy, it being impossible that any thing
which is ioyned to God, who is happinesse
and holinesse it selfe, shoulde eyther lacke
any good and pleasant thing, or be any way
polluted, so that this coniunction of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature with God, wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of this first estate consisteth, is of
two sortes: the first may be called exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
personall or locall, whereby Angels
and men enioying the presence of God,
are in place and after an outwarde man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ioyned to God: this kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
is perfect happinesse, the other
kinde is inwarde and spirituall, when
as the inwarde faculties of the creature,
as his minde and will, doe wholly cleaue to
God alone. This kinde of coniunction is
perfect holinesse, and it is the meanes or the
condition of the former coniunction: for
as soone as the creature ceaseth to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
in the same moment it ceaseth to be
happy, and is straight way cast out of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7415:19"/>
presence of God. So that the goodnesse of
this first state consisteth in two things, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
and holinesse, from both which it
hath the denomination: from the first, it is
called the state of life, for the scripture spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to man speaketh after the manner of
men, vnto whome nothing is so acceptable
as life, because in it all pleasures are enioyned.
From the second it is called the state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,
because in it man stoode righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and free from all guilt of sinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</p>

consider the seconde state of

from innocencie, darkenesse
from light, wretchednesse from happinesse,
vsually and fitly called the fall of mankinde.
Forvnto the absolute perfection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
felicity, this onely was wanting, that it
was mutable: First of the causes, authors,
and workers of this lamentable ruine, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
of the manner of it. The actors in
this tragedie, are three, God, Sathan, and
Man, all which haue a stroke in this action,
yet after a farre diuerse manner, euen as their
natures are diuerse. For the first, as the holy,
glorious, and happy state of man; so this
sinful, vile and miserable condition commeth
from God: yet not after the same sort; for
the good estate is properly, directly, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and wholly wrought by God, but he
doth onely suffer the euill state to be brought
to passe by euill instruments: yet this his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is not idle, but effectuall and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
for God is not an idle looker on, as if
he had cast off the care of the world and of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7415:20"/>
his creatures,<note place="margin">Of the state of sinne and death.</note> and left all at sixe and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
(as we vse to speake) but hee hath a
parte in this worke in that he did in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
counsell make an immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of this fal of man, and the meanes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and that for the setting forth of his
glorie, which is the ende of all his decrees
and actions whatsoeuer. For howsoeuer it
may seeme to derogate from the glorie of
God, that the reasonable creature, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fairest floure in his garden, and
the most excellent parte of his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe,
shoulde so soone be troden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote and brought to nought; yet in
trueth GOD is greatly glorified by this
meanes, for hereby it appeareth, first,
that God onely is constant, eternall, and
the same for euer in that his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
creatures are so variable: <hi>Rom. 3. 4. Let
God be true, and euerie man a lyar, as it is
written,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that thou mightest bee iustified in
thy sayings, and ouercome when thou art
iudged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the which purpose the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the shortnesse of the first state ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
very much, for although it cannot be
certainly defined howe long it continued,
yet this is agreed vpon by all, that neither
the Angels themselues, nor yet man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7415:20"/>
many daies in their innocency, but fell
away from God soone after that they were
created. Secondly the fall of these creatures
doth shewe that God is iust in punishing
sinne. Thirdly it maketh a way for the state
of saluation, and so doth illustrate the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, whereby he is most of all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
yea the power, wisedome, trueth,
patience, and in briefe the whole glory of
God is by this meanes set forth and enlarged.
Thus much of the first actor. The other two
are the instruments whereby God bringeth
his eternall counsell to passe, and yet to all
reason of man considering the whole storie
of mans fall and the particulars thereof, they
are the onely agents, the first authors, and
chiefe workers of this woefull state, God
hauing no hande or dealing in this matter,
but onely barely permitting them to doe
what they list. For the further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof it is needfull that wee make
a narration of the particulars of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that by supposing GOD to
speake to his reasonable creatures, to
witte, Angelles and men, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>You see howe that I haue made you
the most excellent of all my creatures,
indueing you onely, with a reasonable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7415:21"/>
mind and will, whereby you may knowe,
loue, obey, and honour me, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
enioy my presence wherein happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
doth consist. As long as you continue
holy by obeying my worde, so long
shall you continue happie by enioying my
presence. But if at any time you doe by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
my commaundement loose this
your holinesse, you can no longer haue anie
place in my presence, or any fellowship with
mee, no more then darknesse and light can
be together, but shall incontinently be cast
out of my sight, and so become most wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and miserable. And therefore looke
vnto your selues and to your owne estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
these my promises and threatnings to
be true, content your selues with that state
and degree wherein I haue placed you, obey
all my commaundements, for the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
whereof, you are endued with all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and faculties needfull, so shal you be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie:
otherwise you shall die for euer. In this
most louing and fatherly counsell, which
God in the beginning gaue to his children,
being created after his owne similitude, the
reasonable creature resteth for some shorte
time, but afterward maketh this reply, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not in word yet in minde and heart,
yea in deed and in outward action; Wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

considered your wordes, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

is wholly true, nor the other so happy as you
doe make it: we confesse that we are in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
state then other creatures, yet we cannot
heerein rest: for we see a higher degree of
honour, glory, pleasure and happinesse, yea
a greater measure of knowledge, whereof
we knowe that our nature is capable, and
whereunto we willby all meanes aspire, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
your commaundement to the
contrary: not doubting but that by our own
strength, wit, endeauours and inuentions, we
shall become farre more happy then we are
by this your creation. Vpon this resolution
the creature disobeyeth the expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of God, and so falleth from
God into extreame misery.</p>
                  <p>Now whether the blame of this fall be to
be imputed to God, or to the creature it self,
let any reasonable creature iudge: for God
did neither commaund nor counsell it, but
did carefully forewarne them of it: yea he
did neither put any euill motion into their
mindes, nor yet withdrawe from them any
naturall grace, whereby they shoulde
haue beene vpholden: but left it to their
free choise whither they would be cleane and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7415:22"/>
obey him or else rebell against his worde. If
it be obiected that the necessitie of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
did compell the creature to fall, wee
answere affirming that to be vtterly vntrue.
For God did decre that the fal of man should
com to passe by his free will, and therefore
his decree did not take away, but establishe
mans free will.</p>
                  <p>If it bee thought impossible that the
same action shoulde bee both necessary
and contingent as wee make this action to
be: we answere, that to man it is impossible,
but not to God. For man cannot bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing certainly to passe by vncertaine and
contingent meanes: but God can worke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
by those meanes which to mans
reason fall out by chaunce and at hap haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.
For there is no thing contingent or vncer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
to God, whodoth foresee al the euents
of thinges, and so doth build his immutable
decree vppon the euentes themselues which
are necessary, not vppon the contingencie
of the causes. As in this instance; how easy
a thing was it for God foreseing that man
being indued with free will (whereby he
might doe either good or euill) woulde
choose the euill part, to decree the fall of
man by his freewill, and yet to leaue
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7415:22"/>
man in the very action, free either to stand
or to fall? Againe if it be obiected that
God might haue vpholden man by some
extraordinary grace: we confesse that to be
true, but yet it doth not thereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that God was the cause of this fall:
for the naturall grace wherewith man was
endued, and which was inherent in
himselfe was sufficient, if he woulde
haue vsed it aright: and for superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
grace, God was neither bounde to
giue any, neither did he thinke the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
worthy of anie newe supplie of
grace, which did so vnthankefully abuse
his former bountie, or that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of this pure estate woulde illustrate
his glory so much as woulde the fall of
man.</p>
                  <p>Lastly it may be thought that God
might and ought to haue made these
his exellent creatures in a firme and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
estate, and that by takeing
from them all possibilitie of falling, and
all freedome of will in respect of euill, as
he doth to the elect Angels and men, and
as his owne nature is vncapable of euill.
Wherevnto we answer, that this which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7415:23"/>
is a thing altogether impossible, for
the fredome of will doth not derogate anie
thing from the perfection of the creature
the which could not haue bene made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
without it. For where no will is, there is
no vnderstanding: As for the elect, both men
and Angels they are vpholden by the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
grace of God, not by any such natural
strength &amp; disposition of wil as cannot chuse
euil: the which if they had, they were not
reasonable creatures but either as brute
beasts and senslesse trees, or els as God him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe,
who onely cannot be tempted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
euil. So then the cause why the wicked an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and man kind fell from their first state,
was their owne free will, choosing sinne, and
refusing life offerd by God: but God is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wayes the cause of this fal, then he is the
cause of all actions in the worlde both good
and euil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely in that he is the cause of the
cause. For in that he made the freewil of man,
he did in some sort make the fal which came
of it, &amp; secondly in that he gaue an effectual
occasion of it. But that is not the question,
for we enquire the true and proper cause of
this fall.</p>
                  <p>The whol matter may not vnfitly be declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by this similitude: A wise father purposing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7415:23"/>
to let his sonne see his owne wilfulnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perancie,
together with his loue &amp; fatherly
affection toward him, resolueth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to make him fall into some mortal sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
out of the which he knoweth himselfe
to be able to recouer him. This he wil effect
not by giuing him poyson to drinke, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he should be the cause, and beare the blame
of that euil, but by laying it in his way, as it
were a baite in some sweete meate which he
knoweth that his sonne loueth, and will
eate as soone as he seeth it. And least that
he shoulde plead ignorance, and so auoide
the blame of wilfulnesse, he forewarneth
him of that kind of meate, charging him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
instantly to abstaine from it, as being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holsome,
and hurtfull vnto him: yet he doth
not tell him, what he intendeth. This young
man coming where this pleasant meat is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth
his fathers counsell, &amp; commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet is by the entisement of euil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and his owne appetite moued to
eate of it, perswading himselfe that there is
no such daunger in it as his father woulde
make him beleeue: aud therfore no cause,
he shoulde obey him in that matter. So hee
eateth of it, and poysoneth himselfe: now
no man can denie, but that both the father
and the sonne haue a hand and play their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7415:24"/>
in this tragedy; yet not the father who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the occasion only, but the young man
himselfe who doth willingly, or rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
take that hurtfull meat, is to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
&amp; counted the cause of this euill.</p>
                  <p>In like manner God dealeth with man, he
decreeth his fall, yet doth not throwe him
downe but only layeth a stumbling blocke
in his way. He doth not infect man with
the poyson of sin but putteth it into a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apple, which he knoweth that man will
deuoure greedely whensoeuer occasion is
offred: this he did by forbidding man to
eat of that fruite: by the which meanes he
made the eating of it to be sinne, that is,
deadely poyson, which otherwise was
good and pleasant. So then God is the cause
of mans fall, so as he who layeth a baite for
fish is the cause of their death: he vsing no
violence towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but only suffring them
to followe their naturall appetite: But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
who is the second actor playeth a farre
diuers part, labouring by promises, pretences,
entisements, perswasions, and by all meanes
possible to bring man into the state of sinne
and death: God sitteth still on the banke
holding an angle rod in his hand with baite
&amp; hooke hanging at it, waiting til man come
of his owne accord and bite. But Sathan pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7415:24"/>
man vp and downe with a nette to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
him: man flyeth from sathans
nett as from a most hurtfull thing in that
he resisteth his temptations for a while.
But he commeth willingly to Gods baite
yea not only vncalled, but also flatly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
&amp; eateth of it greedely: for he being
once caught and entangled, changeth his
minde and will, thinkeing that to be good
and holsome, which before he knewe to
be hurtfull &amp; by al meanes to be auoided.</p>
                  <p>So that the fall of man came as hath been
declared of the freedome, or rather of the
preuersnesse of his owne will, according to
the eternall decree &amp; purpose of God, by the
malitious instigation of sathan: who hauing
before fallen himselfe, did vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the fall of man, &amp; that for these reasons;
First for that he had now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; desperate hatred of God, hauing iustly for
his sin cast him out of his presence, the which
before his fall he enioyed in heauen. And for so
much, as he did easely see that his malice
could not reach to God himselfe, therfore he
thought that the next way was to despite &amp;
dishonor him in his creatures, by defacing
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who only of al the creaturs in this world,
was made according to Gods owne image,
yea further, to depriue god of al that glory &amp;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7415:25"/>
ship that man should performe vnto him.
Secondly, Sathan desired to effect the fall of
man, that so he might haue the more compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both in his sinne and in his punishment.
He being thus affected towards Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and mans saluation, ceased not till
that by his faire promises and plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses
he brought man out of the true para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
into a fooles paradise, making him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ransgression of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
was the onely way for him to
become a God, and so he perswaded <hi>Eua</hi>
in the forme of a serpent, and <hi>Adam</hi> in the
forme of <hi>Eua,</hi> to eate of the forbidden
fruite.</p>
                  <p>It is doubted how <hi>Adam,</hi> being in the
state of innocency and knowledge, could be
so palpably deceiued, as to beleeue such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
lie, especially seeing the Apostle
saith, <hi>that Adam was not deceiued but Eua.</hi>
But he meaneth that <hi>Eua</hi> was first, yea more
easely and grosly deceiued, for as her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was lesse, so we must thinke that her
infidelitie was greater then was <hi>Adams,</hi>
who, although he was made to distrust (in
part) the word of God, yet he was not, nor
could be so blinded by <hi>Eua</hi> as she was by the
delusion of the diuell: and therefore he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
more of wilfulnesse, then of blindnesse,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7415:25"/>
choosing rather to disobey God, then to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
<hi>Eua,</hi> by reiecting her importunate
request, and refusing to take such part as she
tooke, who being his wife, yea his onely
companion, was no doubt a great pleasure,
ioy, and delight vnto him. Thus much of the
fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is the fall of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
For <hi>Adam</hi> being the father of al men,
did sustaine the publike person of mankind,
both in his innocencie and also in his fall, in
his happinesse and in his misery. If it be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
why all mankind fell, seeing not all but
some of the Angels did fal: wee answere
that all men were in the very moment of the
fall, in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, and therefore did both
stande and fall with him: but the Angels
doe not be get one another, being all created
immediately by God himselfe, and therefore
the sin of one Angell doth not take holde of
another, vnlesse that one by consenting to the
sinne deuised by another, doe make himselfe
sinful: as it was in the fal of the Angels, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one or some few were the chief &amp; authors
of this conspiracy, the rest approued it &amp; took
part with them, as may be gathered by that
distinction which is made of them one being
made chiefe,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 41.</note> or head, the rest his inferiours.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE third state followeth,
which is the recouering of
the first state of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
man was created in the
beginning. For God in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
man to fall, did not
purpose the finall ouerthrow and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so excellent a creature, but rather the
illustration of his owne vnspeakable mercy
and goodnesse towards man, in pardoning
his sinne, and in restoring him to life. This
state we call the state of saluation, for that
man in it, is not onely indued with life, as
he was before, but also saued and deliuered
from eternall death, whereunto he fell by
his sinne. Yet not all mankind is restored to
life, but onely a fewe, that it might appeare
both how vnapt man is to do any good, how
vncapable of saluation he is made by sinne,
in that he cannot attaine vnto it, no not now,
when as God hath appointed the meanes
and the way of it, and as it were setting hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
gates wide open doth offer saluation to
all men: and lastly that the iustice of God
might be declared in punishing the reprobate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7415:26"/>
for their sinne.<note place="margin">Of the state of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet the state of mankind is happy in
respect of the Angels which fell; for none of
them are, or shal euer be restored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
state, and that for these causes. First and
chiefly because their fall was so great, as that
it is impossible that they shoulde recouer
their first estate: the greatnesse of their
fall commeth of that greate measure of
knowledge, light and grace wherewith
they were endued: and the which they did
tread vnder their feete and despise: for if
they had fallen onely from some small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of grace, a greater measure would haue
recouered them: but they hauing alreadie
reiected, and made of no force so much grace
as any meere creature is capable of, haue no
remedy left for their saluation. And as they
fell from the highest degree of grace, so they
fell into the lowest sinke of sinne, euen to
the highest degree of sinne that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
which is a most desperate, deadly,
cruell, fierce, contumelious, shamelesse,
open, professed, wilfull and spitefull hatred
against God and all goodnesse, yea against
all his creatures both good and euill. This
came of the exceeding great strength of
their nature, which being once let loose
to sinne, coulde not stay or rest but in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7415:27"/>
the highest degre of it. Like vnto this remedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse
fall of the wicked Angels, is that sinne
which is in the scripture called the sin against
the holy Ghost, when as one being endued
with a great measure of grace, doth fall into
this fearefull and desperate hatred of God,
and of all goodnesse, for as hee who fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
from a steepe and high rocke into a
deepe pit or gulfe, can not possibly es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
death, whereas one whose fall is
lesse, may haue hope of life: so it is with
these wicked Angels whose sinne we may
truely call that vnpardonable sinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against the holy Ghost. Further, the sin
of the Angels deserued more seuere punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in that they were better able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
it, seeing the glory of God in heauen,
&amp; therefore hauing greater means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
beleeuing and obeying God then man
had on earth: yea their sinne came from
themselues by the suggestion of their owne
mindes, and the inclination of their wils, but
man sinned by their prouocation, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and delusion; who as if they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a small offence in sinning themselues,
did adde to their owne sinne the sinne of
mankind. Moreouer, it was not needfull
that God should restore these rebels to their
former state, for the illustration of his loue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7415:27"/>
towardes this creature: forsomuch, as there
are yet in heauen in the state of happinesse,
many thousands of holy Angels which are
so many witnesses and preachers, of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
loue of God towards them. Againe it
was needfull for the working of the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the elect, that there shoulde be some
aduersarye power opposing it selfe and
labouring by all meanes to hinder it, that
so both the graces bestowed on men might
be stirred vp and exercised, and the power
of God preseruing them from so great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
made manifest. Lastly by this vncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
state of these Angels it appeareth, that
there neither is, nor yet can be in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
any such absolute perfection, as that it
might be able of it selfe by any proper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
and naturall vertue and strength,
(beeing not supported by the grace of God)
eyther to keep for euer, or to recouer any
good &amp; happy estate. If it be obiected that
the Angels may repente and so obtaine
saluation: wee answere, first that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
by reason of the nature of their
sinne, beeing the sinne against the holie
Ghost, that they shoulde euer truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
and secondly that if they coulde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some sorte repente, yet they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vncapable of saluation, because God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7415:28"/>
hath not taken vnto himselfe the nature of
Angels, as he hath done the nature of man,
and so by ioyning it to himselfe, who is life
it selfe, made it a liuing and holy nature:
the which is needfull for saluation, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
more at large in the treatise of iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith, <hi>Chap. 4. Sect.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue these foule spirits in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
pit of hell, let vs returne to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this third state of man, the
which although in substance it be nothing
but the first estate restored, yet it is to be
preferred before it in these respectes. First
because it is certaine, immutable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
it being impossible that any who is once
brought from death to this state of saluation,
should returne backe againe: but the first
state of man was not onely variable, but
very short and momentanie, as hath beene
declared. This ariseth not of any naturall and
inherent strength of man, but of the meere
grace and loue of God supporting all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
seruants in this state, and watching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them least at any time they should fall
away. Secondly both the partes of the
goodnesse of this estate, which are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward coniunction of man with
God, or more plainely, his happinesse and
holinesse, are greater then they were before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:7415:28"/>
The increase of happinesse the next section
doth declare, and for the other we cannot
doubt but that the loue of man, yea all the
other partes of his holinesse are increased
and doubled towardes God, who nowe
is not onely his Lorde and creator, but
also his sauiour and redeemer. As he must
needes loue more to whome manie sinnes
are forgiuen, then he who is saued by his
owne holinesse: for life is not of it selfe
so acceptable at any time as it is after
death. Whereof more at large in the

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and by sin death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we shoulde examine this doctrine by
naturall reason, it woulde be found very
doubtfull: for it may seeme that the body
of man, being made of earth, shoulde of
necessitie at length be resolued into earth
againe, as well as the bodies of all other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
yea that it consisting of contraries
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7415:30"/>
continually fighting, and consuming one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
coulde not possibly but be at length
destroyed. For nothing that is deuided in
it selfe can continue for euer. Yea besides
this naturall death, mans body may seeme
to haue bene subiect to outward violence:
as if it shoulde haue bene pierced with a
sword, or throwen downe from a high rocke,
no reason can shewe howe the immortality
of it shoulde be preserued. Whereunto we
answere, first that we are not to doubt of the
word of God, howsoeuer our shallow heads
are not able to sound the depth of it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we may as wel suppose man to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
as to liue almost a thousand yeares,
as we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 27. that Methusela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did: for
we may well thinke that those long liues of
the fathers before the flood,<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 27.</note> were euen the
reliques of that immortalitie wherewith A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
was endued at the first: neither are we to
think it impossible to God, to endue mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with such an exact &amp; equall temperature,
as should continue for euer. As for violent
deaths, although we cannot deny but man
was subiect to them, if violence had bene of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,
yet there could none happen in this pure
state. For then there were no wilde beasts to
deuoure &amp; teare in peeces, no euill constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the aier to distemper or infect, no inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7415:30"/>
affections in a mans minde, whereby he
himselfe might be the cause of sickenes, hurt
or death to himselfe, but all the creatures
were so disposed as that they should euery
way further, and by no meanes impaire the
good estate of man. Lastly if it be granted
that Adams body had no such strange tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature,
which coulde continue for euer,
no one qualitie getting the vpper hand ouer-any
other, neither any such immunity against
violent deaths, but that he might by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
forgetfulnesse or some humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
be ouertaken with hurt, sicknesse, age
and death, the which opinion is rather to be
receaued; yet he had this supernaturall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
of immortalitie granted vnto him
by the worde of God, and confirmed by the
tree of life, the fruite whereof being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and eaten had this vertue in it (not by
nature, but by the miraculous and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
worke of God) to make man liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
by freeing him from all daungers,
hurts, woundes, sicknesse and age.</p>
                  <p>Likewise this happines was in regard of the
soule of Adam exceeding greate, he hauing
not onely a mind illuminated with the true
knowledge of God, &amp; of all other thinges
which did any way belong vnto him, but also
his wil &amp; affections free from al immoderate
desires, or greiuous passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which might any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7415:31"/>
way molest or trouble him. The which state
of the soule as it is a part of mans holines in
that it is agreeable to the will, worde and
image of God, so in regarde of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
pleasure and ioy, arising of the
true contemplation of God, of a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and orderly affections, it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in it a great parte of mans felicity. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the whole person of man was adorned
with this crowne of glory, that he was a
monarch here on earth, hauing the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
and dominion of these inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs
giuen vnto him. So that to conclude this
point, the happinesse of man was very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
in that he enioyed all good things
whatsoeuer, euen God himselfe with all
the creatures</p>
                  <p>This was the happinesse of mans first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
whereof this question may be asked,
whether it was appointed by God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for euer, or else to be but an entrance
to a greater happinesse in heauen: whither
some doe thinke that man should at length
haue bene translated, although without
death, yet not without some change of his
earthly body. But hereof we cannot say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, haueing learned nothing in the
worde of any other happinesse of this first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
then this which hath in some sort bene
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7415:31"/>
described, and which although it may seeme
to come much short of true happinesse, and
to be rather a terrestrial then a celestial, yet in
trueth it was perfect happines (although not
absolute: because it was mutable;) for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
God vouchsafeth to the creature the
fruition of his presence, there is full &amp; perfect
happinesse; whether it be in heauen or on
the earth.</p>

is subiect to as many daungers as there are
thinges in the worlde, there being almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which may not become mortall vnto

yet al his life is nothing but misery, yea euen
death it selfe, it being the beginning of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

most miserable: his vnderstanding, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was as cleare as is the sun at noone day, is
now ouershadowed and filled with palpable
darkenesse, grosse errours, blockishe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,

is become peruerse, abhorring whatsoeuer is
good, &amp; cleauing to that which is euill. His
affections are raging &amp; in ordinate lusts: and
in briefe there is nothing in the whole nature
of man, but horrible confusion. For the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
dignity of his person, he is now cast out
from the company of God &amp; of his holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
who before were his familiar friends, but

perpetual slauery for a little gold, siluer, brasse

mind, &amp; bestoweth al his labour vpon them:
he prostrateth himselfe before the wedge of
gold, as before his God, he loueth it as his life,

Besides many miseries do happen in this life,
which might becounted a kind of happines, if

himselfe to the will of God in all
thinges: in the performance whereof, if hee
did faile at any time, he was forthwith to be

will ioyne together in this treatise, for the
greater euidence of the doctrine. This
holinesse, although it might be handled
according to the order of the seuerall
partes and faculties of mans soule, yet we
will rather distinguish it into these two parts;
Subiection to God, and Conformity to God:
whereof, the first containeth all those parts of
mans holines which he oweth to God as to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7415:37"/>
his superiour, and which haue no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

God is in no respect subiect to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
those wherein man is like to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
some part of Gods nature, so as
that he may be said to haue those faculties in
common with God: although after a farre
diuerse manner: for man is then truely holy,
when as he is subiect to God in conformitie,
and like to God in due subiection. For so it
pleased God to put in man his owne image,
or the similitude and resemblance of his own
nature, yet not making him his mate or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
but euery way subiect and inferiour
to him.<note place="margin">Mich. 6. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Mich. 6. 8. O man, God sheweth thee

doth consist, namely in this, <hi>that thou hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thy selfe to walke with thy God.</hi> For the
first, the subiection which man oweth to God
is not of one kind, but generall containing in
it all kindes of subiection whatsoeuer: to wit
that which the loyall subiect oweth to his
prince, the sonne to his father, the seruant to
his master, the scholer to his teacher, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature

other question is much harder, for it is not
so easy to shew, howe that one sinne did
cleane take away the holynesse which was
inherent, infixed and euen ingrauen by the
finger of God in the nature of man, as we
know that the transgression of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depriued
both him and his posterity, of that light
of the minde, of the actuall in clmation of
his will to good onely, and of whatsoeuer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7415:38"/>
else was good in him.<note place="margin">Of the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of man.</note> For as the Poets doe
fable of certaine men who by drinking a
charmed potion, were made of reasonable
men, brute and sauage beasts, so we know
that the eating of the forbidden fruite, did
make as great a metamorphosis or change
in Adam: who by this meanes was stript
naked of all and euery parte of that
holynesse wherewith he was before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
                  <p>But whence came this wonderfull alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether from God, spoling man of
all those holy garmentes wherewith he
had decked him before, or from man
himselfe, makeing a totall apostasie from
God? Not from God, whose giftes are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, and whose nature is farre
from any such inconstancie, but from
man. Yet not from any wilfull desire or
purpose of renouncing God and all holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but by the craft of sathan, and the
nature of sinne which as leauen once
getting place, neuer resteth till that it soure
the wholle lumpe be it neuer so great:
So man after that he had once incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his will to disobey God, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnbeleefe into his minde, coulde not
keepe his affections and actions from
the contagion of sinne. Adam perhaps
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7415:38"/>
thought that to eate the forbidden fruite,
was but a single and small offence, but
sathan knewe very well, that it
was a grieuous and an vniuersall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
from God, as it prooued in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents.</p>
                  <p>For whilest the sweetnesse of the fruite
was yet in the mouth of Adam, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
and poyson of it did pierce into the
most secret partes of his soule, leauing
no part vncorrupted or free from the
filthynesse of sinne. For when as once the
light of his minde was darkned by the
delusion of the diuell, in somuch that
he thought euill to be good, and the
way leading to extreame miserie to be
the onelie meanes of the greatest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
it coulde not be but that his
will, affections, actions, and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
both of body and soule should be
corrupted, for that one of them doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the disposition of an other, so that a
corrupt minde bringeth a peruerse will,
and a sinnefull will maketh inordinate
affections, both which encrease the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the minde, and also defile all the
outward actions. Thus Adam lost the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7415:39"/>
puritie of his nature by continuing in his sin
whereinto he had fallen, &amp; adding one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of sinfulnesse to an other, till at length he
came to a constant habit &amp; naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of sinfullnesse. And as he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
sinfull, so he left his sinfulnesse to his
posteritie, the which in respect of him is
called originall corruption. <hi>Ps. 51. 7. I was

the fashioner of this newe creature.
Secondly the minde and will of man are
the matter whereof this newe creature

espceially to that state which is repugnant,
and cleane contrary to his naturall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as regeneration is to the nature of a
carnall man, for it is not so in this spirituall
work as it is in the carnal generation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one thing begetteth another like to it selfe
by a naturall vertue and power which God
hath put into each liuing creature, without
any extraordinary worke or blessing from
God. And therefore it is able (being in the
naturall disposition) whensoeuer it listeth,
to bring forth the effect without failing. But
no minister of the word, although endew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with most excellent giftes, can beget
this new man by the sole vertue of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misterie;
for then regeneration, woulde be
a common and an ordinarie thing, as is the
preaching of the worde. But we knowe
it to be farre otherwise, and that vsually of a
hundred hearers, there is scarce one truely
conuerted. So that in the begetting of this
new man, the ministery of the word is but the
instrument, whereby the spirit of God
worketh, without the which it is no more able
to forme this newe creature, then the tooles
belonging to any worke, are able to bring
the same to passe without the hand of the
artificer: And therefore as the first creation,
so also the regeneration of mans holinesse
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7415:42"/>
ought to be acknowledged, to be the hand,
and worke of God, yea in trueth an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
supernaturall and miraculous worke:
we say immeditate, not that he vseth no
meanes in regenerating the faithfull, but for
that the force, vertue, and abilitie of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
is not any iot in the meanes, but
wholly and onely in GOD. Againe it
is a supernaturall worke, for euen as sinne,
yea the retayning, exercising, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it, is naturall to man, so the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting,
renouncing and forsaking of it,
and especially the seeking, attaining, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
exercising and encreasing of the
contrarie holinesse, is no lesse contrarie
to the nature of man, then it is for him to
flie vp to heauen. Hence it followeth that
this regeneration is a miraculous worke:
for whatsoeuer is so contrary to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
disposition and ordinarie course of
thinges, as that the reason of man can
not finde out and comprehende the cause
of it, that driueth men to admiration
and astonishment, and so becommeth a
miracle vnto them. If it be heere obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that regeneration is an ordinarie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which commeth to passe daily and
vsually in the Church, and hath done
in all ages, and therefore is no miracle:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7415:43"/>
we answere confessing that it is not so much
wondred at as it ought to bee. For carnall
men doe not beleeue that there is any such
matter, as we may see in the example of
<hi>Nicodemus,</hi>

doe not wonder but rather laugh at it:
and they who by experience know it, are not
for the most part so affected with the serious
cogitation of it as they should be. Yet this
doth not chaunge the nature of it, for if
God should often raise vppe men from the
dead, men would at length cease from won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at it. But notwithstanding the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men, it is a great miracle, yea in truth
greater then is the raising of the deade to
life: for God hath often giuen to mortall &amp;
sinfull men the glorie of restoring the dead
to life, but he neuer gaue to any of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
or Apostles, the power of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
men. So that to conclude this first
point, as the first, so the second creation of
mans holinesse, ought to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the proper worke and action of God, as
the scripture doth plainely teach vs in many
places,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>Nowe we are to consider other pointes
in this wonderfull worke of God, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7415:43"/>
these. First the meanes which God vseth.
Secondly the manner of working. Thirdly
the time. Fourthly the differences of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
Lastly the signes of it. The meanes
is eyther ordinary or extraordinary: the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
meanes, is as hath beene touched; the
ministery of the word of God, appointed
by God for this end and purpose, the which
he doth accompany with the secrete opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his spirite, in the hearts of all those,
whome he hath ordained to saluation. And
therefore whosoeuer desireth to be made
partaker of this regeneration, he must with
all care and diligence giue himselfe to the
continuall hearing of the worde of God
preached in the assemblie of the Church:
and withall he is to vse all priuate meanes
whereby hee may bee prepared for the
publicke ministerie, so as it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
vnto him; as namely the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
companie and conference of those
who haue alreadie attained to that which
he desireth, and who hauing trauailed
in the waye of Godlinesse, may the
more easely direct him in the same. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie
hee muste giue himselfe to the
reading, studying and meditating of the
worde of GOD, and to the carefull
vse of all those meanes whereby hee may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7415:44"/>
be made to vnderstand, know, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it. But especially he is to desire this
by earnest prayer at the handes of God, who
onely is able to graunt his desire, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whose working, the most painefull vse of
all meanes, is altogether in vaine: but hee
that carefully vseth these aforesaid meanes
(yet not trusting in them, but relying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
on the mercifull promise of God, who
hath promised to be readie at hande to all
those that seeke him) shall finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that no man doth in vain seeke for help
at the handes of God.</p>
                  <p>As touching the manner how regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is wrought,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 8</note> Christ teacheth vs <hi>Iohn. 3. 8,
That no man knoweth it: for euen as,</hi> saith he,
<hi>thou hearest the noise of the wind when it blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
but yet thou canst not see it, or discerne
whence it commeth, or whither it goeth;</hi> so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we heare the word of God sounding
in our eares, and knowe that God doth by
that sound beget men, yet no man knoweth
how this is: that is, regeneration is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outward,
visible, and sensible, but an inward
and secret worke. For euen as a man being
suddenly taken with the plague, or anie
infectious sicknesse, saieth, he knoweth
not how it happened, onely he seeth the
effectes of it: euen so the action of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7415:44"/>
in it selfe is secret and vnknowen, but
manifest in the effectes which followe of it.
We may (not vnfitly) compare it to that
suddaine and straunge change which befell
<hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> whereof we read, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 9. For
when as God was about to aduance <hi>Saule</hi>
from his priuate and base estate, to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Israell, he sawe that it was neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to make him a newe man endued with
a newe minde, will, and affections: to take
from him his rude and base conditions, and
to endue him, with an heroicall spirite of
wisedome, courage, and of all giftes need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for so high a calling. And therefore,
euen as he turned his backe to goe awaie
from <hi>Samuell,</hi> God chaunged him, and
gaue him an other hearte, and made him
another man. Euen so doth God, by
changing the mindes and willes of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
so secretlie, as that they themselues
knowe not which way it is done, make
them newe men, and prepare them for
his euerlasting kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The time of regeneration, are the
yeares of descretion, for this worke hath
no place in infantes, beeing not as yet
endued with the actuall faculties of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
minde and will. The which must
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7415:45"/>
first existe, before they can be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and be actually defiled with sinne,
before they can be clensed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in the yeares of discretion,
there is no set and appointed time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:
for as we are taught, <hi>Math.</hi>
20. in the parable of the worke men,
<hi>some are called at the first houre of the
day, some in the middest of it, some in
the laste houre:</hi> Some in their younge
yeares, some in their middle age, and
some in olde age. Yet no man ought
in this respect to deferre the seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regeneration, for so he will be more
and more vnfitte and vnwilling to take
anie paines in this behalfe, and be at
length so hardned and benummed with
a longe custome of sinne, and of deepe
hypocrisie, that there wilbe farre lesse
hope of winning him to the true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christe then there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Thirdly, regeneration, although
it doe continually encrease, as long as
a man liueth, yet it is wrought and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
in one houre, in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time; euen as there is but one

                  <p>If it bee asked, whether that euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

howre of his calling: wee answere,
that regeneration, beeing an vniuersall
chaunge of all the faculties of a mans

                     </gap>y him, in whome

                  <p>For if, as it is vsually thought, the day
of a mans naturall byrth which in it selfe
is the beginning, although of temporall
life, yet of eternall death and miserie, be

be seene, and in deede the beginning of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7415:46"/>
eternall happinesse. And yet oftentimes
this particular time, is neyther marked
when it is present, nor remembred when
it is past, namely by them, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
is not so straunge and violent, but
light and easie, the which difference
wee are nowe in the fourth place to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde.</p>
                  <p>The diuersitie of regeneration is verie
great, for that we may vse our accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
similitude, as man in his naturall
birth is brought into the worlde, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with greate facilitie, and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
at other times in so greate paine,
anguish and daunger, that he may seeme
to enter into life, through death: euen
so this newe man is sometimes borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any trouble, sorrowe, or delay: but
often, with such horrour of conscience
such fearefull panges of desperation, such
extreame sorrowe, feare, and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he may truely be saide to passe
to heauen, through the middest of hell.
Againe some of these new men are borne
in so greate strength and perfection, as
if they were not babes, but growen
men in Christe. As was the Apostle
<hi>Paule</hi> who came into this spirituall world,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7415:46"/>
not onely a perfect man, but also a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
giant, euen an notable apostle: whereas
others in the beginning of their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
are so weake in the performance
of the actions of spirituall life, that it may
be greatly doubted, whether they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
life or no.</p>
                  <p>Lastly the signes of regeneration, are
as many, as are the seuerall partes and heads
of sanctification, and therefore whosoeuer
desireth to knowe, whether that this new
man be begotten in himselfe, or no, let
him consider diligently, that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in all the third sections of this treatise, &amp;
applying it to himselfe, see whether that
he finde this straunge change in his own soul
or no: whether that he be fully perswaded of
the trueth of Gods worde, which saieth
that the dead shall one day be raised vp to
life, and that all those who did beleeue in
Christ shall enioy eternall happinesse in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
or doe secretly in his mind doubt of
the trueth of these thinges: whether that
for his good estate in this world, he depend
on GOD, or vpon his owne wisdome,
strength, riches and friends: whether that he
feare God or man more: whether that his
chiefe delight be in seruing God, in praising
God, in hearing, reading, &amp; meditating, on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7415:47"/>
the worde of God or in worldly pleasures,
in eating, drinking, sleeping, in pastime, in the
pompe and outwarde shewe of the worlde:
whether that he haue the grace to pray
dayly to God, for all spirituall graces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
and seuerally one by one: or that he
prayeth seldome, lightly and but for fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sake: whether that he loue those who
feare God, as he doth his owne brethren
or children, or else is effected to them no
otherwise then to other men: by these
signes and many other, which are hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be declared at large, this regeneration
may easely and certainly be knowen. And
therefore it standeth euery man in hand, who
desireth to escape the second death, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
himselfe whether that he haue anie
parte in this first resurrection: as the Apostle
doth exhort.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 5.</note> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. saying, <hi>Trie your
selues, whether ye be in the faith or no:
knowe ye not that Christ is in you except ye
be reprobats?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly as the happinesse, so also the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this third estate excelleth the first
holynesse of man, in that it is perpetuall
and cannot by any meanes be lost: for
whereas this seed of regeneration is once
sowen by the hand of God, there it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
for euer, and bringeth foorth fruite
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7415:47"/>
to life euerlasting. 1. <hi>Ioh. 3. 10. Euery one
that is borne of God doth not sinne, neither

                     <hi>because the seed of God is in him.</hi>
Where by sin he meaneth a totall apostasie
from God, not a particular sinne, the which
the faithfull do often commit without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungering
their saluation. Which doth
not depend on their owne righteousnesse
as <hi>Adams</hi> did, but vpon the righteousnesse
of Christ. This certainty of perseuerance in
the faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of any strength of man,
but of the goodnesse of God who confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vnto the end all those whom he doth
once effectually call.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first kind of subiection which
man oweth to God, is that, which
the subiect or tennant oweth to his
king or liegelord, of whom he holdeth his
houses, lands &amp; possessions, by whose fauour,
procured by dutifull obedience, he liueth in a
good and happy state, &amp; whose anger would
be to him extreame miserie and euen death
it selfe, and may be called affiance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaunce.
Thus was man in his first
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7415:48"/>
creation,<note place="margin">Of faith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and of legall faith.</note> affected to God, on whom onely he
did depende, and relie himselfe for a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
estate. This subiection is in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
called faith, because the obiect of it,
is the faithfulnesse of God, and the trueth
of his worde, and promises. For as in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
phrase, <hi>habere fidem</hi> is to giue credence
to another, so in diuinitie, to haue faith is to
attribute faithfulnesse to God, or to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him to be faithfull in all his promises,
both by beleeuing them as also by depending
on them. Thus <hi>Sara</hi> is saide <hi>Hebr. 11. 11, To
haue had faith in that she iudged God to be
faithfull in his promises.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 11</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This faith is of two kindes, the faith
wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was endued in his first
creation, and the faith which God giueth
in regeneration: the first is called vsually
legall, the other Euangelicall. The which
two kindes, although they doe differ the one
from the other, yet they agree in substance,
being of the same nature in generall,
and therefore we wil first declare the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
doctrine which is common to both
the kindes of faith, and then see what is
proper to each kind, and wherein the one dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from the other. Fayth in generall
is thus defined: Affiance in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mises
propounding eternall happinesse, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7415:48"/>
the perfect holinesse of the reasonable
creature, or to man being perfectly holy.
Or thus; Faith is the trust and confidence of
a mans heart, relying himselfe wholly on
God for eternall happinesse to be had by
perfect holynesse. Or thus; Faith is the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of the hearte, arising of an effectuall
perswasion of the trueth of Gods worde,
which promiseth happinesse to man being
perfectly holy,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 19.</note> and threatneth eternall misery
to him being polluted with sinne. <hi>Iames. 1.
19. The diuels beleeue and tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These definitions being in substance all
one, offer diuerse poyntes to be considered:
and first what part or facultie of mans soule
is the Subiect and Seate of faith, whether
the minde, the will, or the affections, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one, some, or all of them. For answere
hereof, in that we say that faith is affiance,
trust, or confidence, we doe plainly put it
among the affections. For so it seemeth to
be of the same kinde with hope, loue, feare,
and the rest of the spirituall graces: al which,
and especiallie faith, although they spring
from a former knowledge, and are alwaies
ioyned with it, yet they are in nature to
be distinguished from it. As in this instance,
faith hath the originall and beginning in the
minde, for a man can neuer relie himselfe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7415:49"/>
wholly on God for happinesse, vnlesse
he be perswaded, that God both can and
will make him happie. Yet not the bare
contemplation and perswasion of the mind,
but the affiance and affection of the heart
is faith; and yet, for somuch as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that a man shoulde be fullie
perswaded in his minde, of the trueth of
Gods promises, and not together set his
whole affiaunce and fayth on him, or that
he shoulde be by faith rightly affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
GOD, vnlesse first he haue the
knowledge of GOD and of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
hence it is, that fayth is often
placed in the minde, knowledge being
put for affiaunce, as the cause is often
put for the effect.<note place="margin">Coll. 2. 2.</note> Thus <hi>Coll. 2. 2. Faith
is called</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
and certaine preswasion of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
and so throughout the wholle
scripture, faith is made nothing else
but beleefe, and to haue faith, nothing
but to beleeue that the worde, promises
and threatnings of GOD are true. But
in trueth to make vp the full nature of
fayth, there must be added to this action
of the minde, an action of the heart and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7415:49"/>
will, to wit, affiaunce. We confesse that
there is a kinde of faith which is a meere
perswasion of the minde, as namelie
that which is called the fayth of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whereby a man being perswaded
of the power and will of GOD, for
the effecting of strange thinges, doth
by vertue of that knowledge, worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles:
but this fayth doth not concerne
the saluation of man, and therefore doth
not belong to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>In the second place the definition
giueth vs to vnderstand, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
or thing whereat fayth aimeth, and
where about it is conuersant, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
particular blessing or good whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
but full and perfect happinesse,
which containeth in it all graces, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
pleasures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ioyes whatsoeuer
doe anie waie make for the good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
estate of man.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the promises of GOD, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
faith relieth, are those which are
made concerning happinesse. Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it pleaseth GOD, to make some
one particular and temporarie blessing a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7415:50"/>
signe and pledge of eternall and vniuersall
happinesse; and then the faith of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
relieth it selfe first and immediatly vppon
the saide particular promise, and on the
blessing therein contained, but it doth not
rest there, but through that particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
doth see and take holde of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.
Thus GOD promised to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
being nowe stricken in yeares a sonne:
this promise <hi>Abraham</hi> did fully apprehende
by faith, and by this meanes became hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
and was accounted iust before GOD.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham beleeued God</hi> promising
a sonne vnto him, &amp; this his particular <hi>faith,
was accounted to him for righteousnesse:</hi> for
that, in that one blessing, he saw the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
treasures of Gods mercy, loue, and
bountie propounded vnto him. Although
we might answere another way, saying,
that the obiect of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, was
not onely <hi>Isaac,</hi> but also Christ the sauiour
of the worlde, who was to come of <hi>Isaac</hi>
and to make all the nations of the earth,
happie.<note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> Likewise <hi>Math.</hi> 9. The man sicke
of a palsey, vnder his bodily and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
health, looked for eternall saluation, as
Christ the searcher of the harte, doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
saying to him, thy fayth hath saued and
purchased to thee thy former health, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7415:50"/>
pardon of sinnes, vvhich is euerlasting
happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Heereof ariseth a third point to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to vvit, that this faith doth after a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
manner, both tie man to God, and so
bring forth all the rest of the partes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for as this is ingrafted into the nature of
all liuing creatures to preserue themselues in
a good estate so especially those vvhich are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
vvith reason, namely Angels and men
as soone as the exist, they do in the first place
bend all the force of their mindes, to seeke
out some meanes of continuing and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their ovvne happinesse. The meanes
vvhich doe in this consideration offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
are of tvvo sorts, the first is, the onely
true meanes, euen God the fountaine of all
happines, on whose word &amp; promises made
touching their happy estate, they by faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
and rely themselues, and so they are
ioyned to God for euer. The other means
is the creature it selfe, trusting not in
God, but in it selfe, vvhereof hereafter. Thus
faith in that it ioyneth vs to God, it conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from God to vs, as all happinesse, so
also all spirituall graces, and holinesse the
meanes of happinesse, in the vvhich respect
it may be called the fountaine of all the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
follovving: euen as vvhen vvater is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7415:51"/>
brought from a fountaine or spring, to any
place somewhat distant by pipes of wood,
lead, or clay, the first pipe which ioyneth all
the rest to the fountaine, may be said to giue
the water to the rest, so doth faith conuey the
graces following to vs, and that both by the
immediate &amp; extraordinary blessing of God,
who multiplieth his graces vpon the creature
cleauing vnto him in ful affiance, as men vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
giue howses, land, and all thinges need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to those that rely themselues vpon them,
as also by meanes inherent in the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creature: the which loueth, honoureth,
and serueth God, not for nought, but as the
giuer of all happinesse, and so doe all the
rest of the affections, and faculties of mans
soule follow both that light of the minde
which faith bringeth with it, or rather which
bringeth forth faith, commonly called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
and also faith it selfe. The last words of
the definition which mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of man, giue vs to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the only
means of being happy, is to be first perfectly
holy, as hath been heretofore often declared.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the generall doctrine of
faith,<note place="margin">Of legall faith.</note> now we come to the kinds of faith, the
which are two in number, the first is, the faith
of the first estate, to wit, that wherewith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was indued in his creation, the second is
the faith of the third estate, to wit, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7415:51"/>
all the regenerate are made partakers, so
that the first is a created, the second a recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
faith. The which two kindes as they do
agree in all those pointes which haue beene
declared in the former section, so they differ
in that which followeth. The difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
of the diuers kinds of that perfect holines
which is mentioned in the generall definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith. For the faith of the first estate,
looketh for happinesse by righteousnes inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the person of the beleeuer, and by his
own natural holines, but the faith of the third
estate maketh men happy by imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
&amp; supernatural holines. The cause of
this difference is this God created man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
holy, &amp; therefore he might wel looke
that he should retaine that holines which was
bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but man by his fal lost his
holines, &amp; therefore being now sinful &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
must in this third state cloth him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self
with the righteousnes of some other. So
that in both states, perfit holines is the means
of attaining happines, but in the first state this
holines is inherent in <hi>Adams</hi> person, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
it is had from another. And therefore the
first kind of faith is to be defined, affiance in
Gods promises propounding happines to the
natural, proper, or inherent holines of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature whether man or Angell.</p>
                  <p>This faith is vsually called legall faith,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7415:52"/>
although not properly, seing that this name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
also to the euangelical faith, the which
doth require perfect obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; the absolute
fulfilling of the morall lawe: for whosoeuer
beleeueth in Christ, fulfilleth the lawe, and
hath legall iustice, by the death of Christ,
and legall holinesse; although not perfect in
this life by his spirit. Yet because the morall
law was giuen for this end, to shew man his
vnrighteousnesse, by commaunding inherent
righteousnesse, hence it is that by legall
righteousnesse is vsually meant proper or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
righteousnesse, and so by legall faith,
is meant that faith which looketh for hapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by inherent righteousnesse, the which
may more fitlie be called naturall faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was ingrauen in the nature of man,
as the other kinde is supernaturall; yet
we call it legall faith, because perfect inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
righteousnesse, is nothing but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
keeping of the lawes and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of God, as sinne is defined. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.

Thus did <hi>Adam</hi> sinne, and fall away from
God by eating the fruite of a certaine tree,
which he was forbidden to touch.</p>
                  <p>So that by this legall faith, none can trust in
God for eternall happines, but onely he who
in his owne person fulfilleth the whole law of
God, and that in deed, in word, in thought,
in will, and in affection, yea in the vniuersall
puritie of this nature, being free from all
curruption of sin. The which thing forsomuch
as it cannot possibly be performed by any of
the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> all being stained with that
originall impurity, which cannot by any
meanes in the world be shaken off. Hence it
followeth that this naturall faith cannot haue
place in any of them, onely the holy Angels
which continue in their naturall purity &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
are endued with it, for they trust for
happinesse, by the meanes of their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

come to the first kinde of
rebellion, wherby man falleth
away from God, called infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
for that it is both in
name and nature cleane contrarie to faith.
For by it, man ceaseth to trust and depend
vppon GOD, renouncing his patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and protection, as being altogether
vnable to bestow any good thing, much lesse
perfect happinesse vpon his clients: and
therefore he seeketh for another Lorde and
king in whom to trust. So that as faith is affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on Gods promises, so this kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
may not vnfitlie be called &amp; defined
defiance, or distrust in Gods promises pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
happinesse to the holinesse of the

The first example of infidelitie,<note place="margin">Of infidel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

the diuell with his wicked Angels, who,
not acknowledging God to be the giuer of
happinesse, did beginne to seeke for it else
where: in the which consultation, he saw
that as there was no creature more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
then himselfe, so there was no meanes
of attaining happinesse so like, as for to
relie himselfe vpon himselfe, vpon his owne
strength, power, wit, policies, and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
by the which he did perswade himselfe,
that he should become far more happy, then
he could be by continuing in that obedience
and alleagance, which he did owe to God.
The second example of infidelitie was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

of minde, the companion and cause
of infidelitie commeth by our naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> for wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7415:54"/>
once the light of his minde was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the delusion of the Diuell, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he thought euill to be good,
and the way leading to extreame misery,
to be the onely meanes of the greatest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
it could not be, but that his will, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
actions, and all the faculties
both of bodie and soule, shoulde be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
for that one of them doth followe
the disposition of an other, so that a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
mind bringeth a peruerse will, and a
sinfull will and inordinate affections doe
darken the minde as hath bene alreadie
shewed.</p>
                  <p>Hereof it followeth that infidelitie doth
both separate a man form God, and also
depriue him of all the partes of holynesse,
yea insteed thereof filleth all the parts and
faculties of a mans soule and body, with
the corruption of sinne. For man renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
God, is wholly separated frome him,
neither can any longer receiue any bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from him: for euen as a subiect or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
discliaming his king and Lorde, and
relying himselfe, vpon a newe master, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
one who is a deadlie and professed
enimy to his first maister, doth inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
depriue himselfe of all those farmes,
landes, houses, prefermentes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7415:55"/>
whatsoeuer, the which he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
whilst he liued in alleagance to his
lorde; so the case standeth with man, when
as by infidelitie he falleth from God. For
then he looseth all manner of blessings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
either to his happinesse, or to his
holynesse, yea it is impossible, that a man
shoulde either loue, feare, honor, or obey
God, from whome he looketh for neither
good nor euil, and therefore infidelitie is
to be accounted the roote of all euill.<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.

depart away from the liuing God.</hi> Thus
much in generall of infidelity, the which
(as hath bene said of faith) is of two sorts:
Legall, and Euangelicall; legall infidelitie, is
to distrust Gods promises, propounding hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
to the inherent holinesse of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
as did the wicked Angels who were
perswaded that they coulde not become
happy by continuing in holynesse: Likewise
Euangelicall infidelitie is to distrust Gods
promises, propounding happinesse to man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
himselfe on the mercie of God in
Christ, as most of all the men in the worlde
haue alwaies done, do at this day, and will
do as long as the world endureth.</p>

thing in the world? All which doe only in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7415:56"/>
qualitie fight one against another,<note place="margin">Of iustifying faith.</note> but sinne
is contrary to the very nature and essence
of God, and therefore although that affiance
in God which was in <hi>Adam,</hi> were renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in vs, yet it woulde not serue to ioyne vs
to God, because we want that perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse,
without the which, no faith can
ioyne any creature to him. So that before
that faith can either ioyne vs to God, or be
any thing auailable for our saluation, it is
needefull that we shoulde haue perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse:
the which whosoeuer goeth about
to effect in himselfe, will finde it a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impossible, and that in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
First, because man in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sinning doth make himselfe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of eternall death, and so he being once
deade, cannot raise himselfe vp againe, or
make himselfe capable of holynesse, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
worke it, fully and perfectly in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Secondly, if that this be attributed,
to the patience, and longe suffering of God,
that man is not straight way, as soone as he
sinneth, vtterly destroyed, and so consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to nought, by the anger of God, but
that he doth still exist in nature, and so
consequently is not altogether vncapable o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
holynesse. Yet it is impossible for him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to shake off that originall sinne, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7415:56"/>
cleaueth inseperably to his nature, or yet
to fulfill the lawe of God, by actuall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
both which are needfull for perfect
holynesse. Lastly if man coulde not onely
doe away his sinne already committed, but
also restore himselfe to his first integritie, yet
this woulde not serue for his eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because he were as like to fall away
againe, from GOD, as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>So that before man can be ioyned againe
to God in hapinesse, he must do foure things,
whereof euery one is altogether impossible
to be performed, either by man himselfe,
or by any other creature. First he must by
sustayning eternall death, satisfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God for his sinne already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the which if he doe (as he must doe
if God be iust, that is, if he be God) howe
can he euer liue, who must dy for euer? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
he must wholly change his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
create in himselfe a newe minde, harte,
will, and euen a new man, the which thing
belongeth to God onely. Thirdly he must
performe, absolute and perfect obedience,
to the lawe of God. And lastly he must
continew in the saide obedience for euer.
Howe then? is there no meanes of saluation
left for man? can there no way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7415:57"/>
these impossibilities be inuented?
Let all the men in the worlde lay their
heades together, and consult of this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
matter: let them haue the wisdome of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> the counsell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the
naturall wit of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the learning of
the greatest Philosophers, the diuining spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the southsayres: what can they all say
to the first question? howe will they make
man to liue, who must dy for euer? they will
confesse that death and life cannot be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and therefore they must come to
this last refuge, that man shall not die in
his owne person, but get some other to dy
for him, and so satisfie Gods iustice. Well?
this is good paiment, if he who dyeth for
man be in nature and dignitie equiualent
to him: but where shall this mediatour be
founde? As touching man, euerie one
desireth to liue, and abhorreth death, yea no
man will dy for a iust man, much lesse for a
sinner. But yet perhaps some one wil find such
a friend, as will not refuse to dy eternally for
him. Will this serue the turne? no truely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he haue moe liues then one, because he
must first dy for his owne sinne, and what
then is left to discharge other mens debts?</p>
                  <p>But we may fly to some saint or holyman,
to <hi>S. Peter, S. Paule, S. Mary:</hi> whose righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is so great, as that it wilbe a ransom both
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7415:57"/>
to doe a way their owne sinne, and the sinne
of others also. But there is no merite or righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousnesse,
which can proceede from any of the
sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> no more then sweet water can
flowe from a corrupt fountaine, yea no
righteousnesse of any saint whosoeuer, will
serue for himselfe, or satisfie Gods iustice
for his owne sinne, but when he hath done
all that he can, he is an vnprofitable seruant,
and (for any helpe he can haue by his own
holynesse) in the same state of eternall death,
wherein others are: his greatest righteousnes,
comming in the name of merite, being in
the sight of God no better then a filthy
and defiled clout. So then there is no
meanes of mans saluation in man. Neither
can the oblation of brute beastes serue the
turn, or stand in the place of a reasonable cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
for sinne <hi>is not purged by the bloud of
bulles and gotes. Heb.</hi> 10. 4.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 4</note> 
                     <hi>neither will
God accept a thousand rams as a sufficient ran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>some
for the sinne of mans soule.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mich. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 7. so
that we finding no succor in this worlde, are
constrained to fly to the holy Angels, and to
craue their helpe in this behalfe. But what
can be hoped for at their hands, whose righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
be it neuer so greate, is no more,
then they doe owe to God for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
being bounde to serue him with
their whole mind, hearte and the whole
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7415:58"/>
strength and power of their nature. If it be
imagined that their death might deliuer vs
from death; we answere, first, that no man
can finde such fauour, in their sight, as that
they will suffer themselues to be accursed
for him, from the happy and glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, which they haue enioyed in
heauen, euer since the first creation thereof.
Secondly if that we shoulde suppose such
an impossible and inordinate loue in them,
yet the death of many angels, coulde
not satisfie Gods iustice for the sinne of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
but onely for the sins of some num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
much lesse performe all those things
which are needfull for the effecting of our
saluation and therefore euery one may say
of him selfe, O miserable man that I am,
whom no creature either in heauen or earth
can deliuer from sinne, and from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of eternall death due vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Seing therfore that no creature can satisfie
Gods iustice for the sin of man, it remaineth
that God shoulde either saue man without
takeing any satisfaction for his sinne, or else
himselfe be this mediator (for it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
bene declared, that God hath certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decreed the saluation of man) but both
these are impossible: for God can no more
saue man, without satisfaction made to his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7415:58"/>
iustice, then he can cease to be iust, or to be
God. Againe it is no lesse impossible for God
himselfe to make this satisfaction: for first,
sinne cannot be imputed to the godhead,
but onely to some nature which is capable of
sinne; but the diuine nature cannot any way
be made, or imagined the subiect of sin, no
more then the fire can be made the subiect
of extreame cold: secondly if this impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
were supposed, that God could some way
take the sinne of man vpon himselfe, yet he
could suffer no punishment for it; for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is such that it can no way suffer, much
lesse sustain the punishment of eternall death
due vnto our sinne. What then can all the wit,
wisedome, pollicie, and inuention of man
say to this case, but onely acknowledge that
mankind is in a most wretched &amp; miserable
case, <hi>quem ipsa salus seruare non potest:</hi> whom
God himselfe cannot saue?</p>
                  <p>But when man is brought to a bay and
euen at his wits ende, there the wisedome of
God doth most appeare, and that which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
impossible to man, is possible with
God, who as he hath decreed mans saluation,
so he is able to bring it to passe, and that, not
by taking away his owne iustice and essence,
but by satisfying and establishing it: not by
polluting the Godhead with the sin of man,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7415:59"/>
but by purging man from sin, by the infinite
power of the Godhead, not by translating
sinne from man to God, but by making the
nature of man able to beare the own burden
by ioyning it to the nature of God: not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
his owne iustice, but punishing the
sinne of man more then it deserued, and yet
not consuming man in his wrath, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the endlesse riches of his mercy in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him from death: that so all the praise,
glorie and thankesgiuing of our saluation
might redound to God, who is the beginner,
worker, and finis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r, yea the very meanes of
it, and who as he did in the beginning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the helpe or meanes of any creature, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
man in perfect holinesse and happinesse;
so againe he himselfe, and that by himselfe,
doth restore him to perfect righteousnesse,
holinesse and eternall glory.</p>
                  <p>But it is needfull that we make a more
plaine declaration of this mysticall and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
doctrine, especially it being the most
happy and ioyfull doctrine, which euer soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the eares, or was at any time vttered
by the tongue of man, the summe of it is this.
The onely meanes whereby God coulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
man to his first estate, was, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
should take vnto his diuine nature the
nature of man, so that he might in that nature
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7415:59"/>
take vpon him both the guilt, &amp; also the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of our sin. For this cause, the sonne of
God, euen God himself, did take vpon him
our nature, consisting of a body &amp; a soule, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with al the naturall powers &amp; faculties,
which are in man, yea subiect to all humane
infirmities, yet without sinne. This humane
nature, was begotten not by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by God,
it being formed &amp; fashioned, not by the seed
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by the power of the godhead, in the
wombe of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (who was of the
linage of <hi>Dauid</hi>) of part of her substance, it
being first sanctified by the holy Ghost, from
the inherent corruption of sinne, &amp; so this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being from the first moment of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
vnited to the godhead, in one person
called Iesus the Sauiour of the worlde, the
promised Messias, or the annointed, or holy
one of God, and consisting of the diuine,
and a humane nature, was brought foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, in Bethlem in the land of Iury,
according as the prophets had foretold, in
the raigne of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and so liued
about 33. yeares, till that in the daies of
<hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> it suffered a shamefull and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
death; the which death of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, was more then a sufficient ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
for the sinnes of the whole worlde,
because it was the death of God (tho not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7415:60"/>
of the Godhead) and therefore it was of
infinite merite and dignity; yea it was more
then the eternall death of all the men in the
world, although it had lasted but one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time, as it continued but three
daies. For it is, and that in the iudgement of
any reasonable man; a farre lesse matter,
that all the creatures in the world should die
for euer, then that God himselfe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all things, the Lord of glory and giuer
of life, yea who is glory and life it selfe, should
suffer death one minute of an houer. So that
the humanity of Christ, gaue the possibility of
suffering death, as the diuinitie gaue the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
excellency, &amp; merite of this ransome
or paiment made to God, for the debt of man.</p>
                  <p>This incomprehensible mysterie of Gods
wisedome, and eternall counsell, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
after this manner. Suppose that there
is in this, or that countrey, an absolute, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesticall
and glorious monarch or king,
against whome many thousands of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
rebell, refusing to performe loyall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his lawes. The King seeing this
rebellion, purposeth so to deale in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging
it, as that not onely his iustice, but
also, and especially his mercy and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his naturall subiectes, may appeare:
and therefore he meaneth to punishe their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7415:60"/>
offence in himselfe, by putting to death his
owne onely sonne, who is of his owne
nature and essence, euen bone of his bone,
flesh of his flesh, and bloud of his bloud,
who is a liuely picture, yea a liuing image of
his owne person, representing after a most
plaine manner his stature, forme, beauty,
strength, complexion, behauiour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
yea who doth raigne ioyntly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with him, being partaker of his riches
treasures, glory, maiesty, power, office and
authority. This death of this prince being
decreed by the king his father, it is needfull,
that for the suffering of the course of the law,
together with the sentence and punishment
of death, he should debase him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a subiect, yet retaining the aforesaid
prerogatiues. So that there is in one person
the condition, and as it were the nature both
of a king &amp; of a subiect, the one maketh that
he may be put to death, the other maketh,
that this death (tho it be the death, but of
one person) is more then a sufficient ransom,
for the offence of ten thousand of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
as the people of Israell doe confesse,
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 17.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner there was no way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God the glorious monarch of heauen
and earth, could preserue both his owne
iustice and man, but that he should giue his
owne onely naturall and eternall sonne, the
brightnesse of his glory, the expresse forme
and charecter of his Godhead, beeing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of his owne essence, glory, maiestie,
power, authority, wisedome, iustice, mercy,
and in breife of his whole diuine nature, to
be a ransome for the sinne of man. For the
which purpose it was needful, that he should
to his kingly and diuine estate, take vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the base condition of a subiect, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in that condition submit himselfe
to the law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the sentence of
death pronounced by God the father, as by
a most iust, seuere and righteous iudge. By
faith in this death of the sonne of God, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is brought to mankind. For it freeth
the beleeuer from all manner of guilt of sin,
whether original or actual, whether past, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or to come. And further as this media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
doth redeeme vs from death, and indue
vs with perfect righteousnesse by his death,
so by the vertue of the holy spirit, proceeding
from his diuine nature; the beleeuer is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(although not at the first) with perfect
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7415:61"/>
holinesse and preserued for euer from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from this estate. Thus wee haue
summarily declared the doctrine of fayth,
as it hath beene published to the worlde,
by the ministery of the Apostles, whose
doctrine we doe hartely embrace, and
openly confesse, professing that there is
no other name, meanes, nor mediatour in
heauen or earth, which can giue saluation,
then Iesus the sonne of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that we see what is the obiect of this
iustifying fayth, we are in the next place to
gather out of this doctrine the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
legall and euangelicall fayth, betwixt
that fayth wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was indued,
in the state of innocencie, &amp; that which hath
place in this state of regeneration. Both
kindes are affiance in god for happinesse to
be had by the meanes of perfect holynesse,
but the first kynde looketh directly on the
godheade, without any mediation; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
beholdeth the godheade, through the
humanitie of Christ, as through a vaile or
couering: for man being now polluted with
sinne, dare not looke on god without a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
as he did before the fall. Secondly
euangelicall fayth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth in it forgiuenes
of sin, which was not in the first estate. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the righteousnesse whereby legall fayth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7415:62"/>
trusteth for happinesse is naturall to man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the person of man, and his owne;
but the righteousnesse of the other kynde is
borrowed from an other. The first kinde
maketh man trust in himselfe, but the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
maketh him to renounce him selfe and to fly
to Christ for righteousnesse. The first kinde
relyeth it selfe on the equity and iustice of
god, the which rewardeth the righteousnesse
of the creature with life. But the other fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his loue and mercy in Christ, the which
pardoneth and saueth a sinner.<note place="margin">

fayth cannot of it selfe iustify a man, it
being but one part of mans holynesse, called
by the diuines <hi>Sanctitas Fiduciae,</hi> that is, the
holynesse of the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of trust, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
or a holy confidence, besides the which
there is required for perfect holynesse, the
holynesse of hope, of loue, of feare, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
and of all the affections, yea the
holynesse of the will, and of the mynde, and
to be shorte, the holynesse of the wholle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of all the actions of man: so that if
we should suppose, that <hi>Adam</hi> did euen
in the very moment of sinning, and also after
he had transgressed gods commaundement
still retaine this part of his holinesse, to wit,
affiance in god, yet we coulde not thinke
that he did continue in the state of life, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7415:62"/>
is lost by one sinne; but not kept by one part
of holynesse. But it is farre otherwise with
this euangelical fayth, the which, although in
the owne nature it be but the holynesse of
one affection, namelie of confidence or
affiance, as legall fayth is, yet it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with it perfect righteousnesse or iustice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7415:63"/>
for our iustification, as if it were none
at all. For imperfect holines doth no more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify,
then no holinesse doth, neither is there
any other account made of it before the
iudgment seat of God, in the matter of our
iustification, howsoeuer there be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vse of sanctification for saluation, as we
are hereafter to consider. And yet although
this one part of mans holynesse doe serue
for our iustification, we are not thereof to gather
that we are saued by it, as a parte of
inherent holynesse, for faith doth not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
vs, as it is a parte of holynesse, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this affection hath (by the goodnesse
of God, decreeing mans saluation by this
meanes) this naturall propertie or qualitie,
to appropriate to a man Christ with his
righteousnesse. Lastly the first kind is easie
to be had, and attained vnto by suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of perfect inherent holynesse, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

some reliques of it in the gentils themselues

                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:7415:63"/>
This wholle doctrine may be gathered
into one summe or definition in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Euangelicall fayth is affiaunce in Gods
promises propounding eternall saluation
to all those who rely themselues wholly on
the mercy of God in Christ. Or more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus; It is affiaunce in Christ for happines.
Or thus; It is trust or confidence in Christ,
whereby his death and the righteousnesse
arising thereof are appropriated to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer.
Nowe we are out of the seuerall
parts of these definitions to search out more
particularly the true nature of faith, to what
kynd or head it is to be referred, whether it
be a part of regeneration and sanctification,
or something diuerse from both these. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie
what is the place and subiect of it,
whether the minde, the wil, or the affections.
Thirdly by what meanes it may be wrought
and attained. Fourthly by what signes and
markes it may be knowen. Fiftly whether
it may be lost or no. Lastly howe it hath this
force, that it is of it selfe able to iustifie
and to saue a man.</p>
                  <p>For the first; Regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
or the newe creature or recreated
holynesse: or thus; The newe man and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
signifie all one thing, to wit, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7415:64"/>
sanctitie, or in plaine English, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
holynesse, so that faith, if it be a part of
the newe man, it is a part of regeneration, and
of holynesse; and contrariwise, if it be a part
of mans holinesse, it is a part of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of the newe man and of the newe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.
That it is a part of mans holynesse we
cannot doubt, seeing it is a holy affection,
euen the affiaunce and confidence of the
heart, relying it selfe on God: the which
affection was also in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore
it is a part of regeneration, and of the newe
man. For although there be great difference
betwixt legal and euangelical faith as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the meanes of saluation, the which is in
the one the iustice of God, in the other his
mercy, yet both of them are to be referred
to the same heade of mans holynesse. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
faith being a part of the created holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of man, as Euangelicall faith is a part
of his regenerated, or recreated holynesse.
The truth hereof may easely be gathered,
out of the section written of faith in generall:
for Legall and Euangelicall faith agree in a
common definition, and in all those points
which are there mentioned. The which
doth also shew vs what to thinke of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of faith, to wit, that it is in the will of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
being nothing but a holy affection of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7415:64"/>
trust or affiaunce.</p>
                  <p>If it be obiected that faith is vsually in the
scripture called beleefe, as infidelity is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleife,
the which is an action not of the will
but of the minde, giuing assent or dissent
to the worde of God: we answere, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife
is put for faith or affiaunce, because it
doth alwayes not onely accompany it, but
also after a sorte beget it, and is the cause
of it. For when as a man doth without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beleeue Gods promises being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the trueth of them, he cannot
choose, but rely himselfe vpon them; so that
beleife although it cannot be separated from
faith, yet it may and ought to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from it. If it be obiected that Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
fayth, cannot be made a parte of
mans holynesse, seeing it is not commaunded
in the morall law; we answere that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
in the morall law, as the other kind
is, in that it is all one in substance with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
faith, both kindes being affiaunce in
God for happinesse to be attained by the
meanes of perfect holynesse: and therefore
both kindes are commanded in the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
<hi>Iehoua,</hi> shall be thy God: the
which law doth enioyne, that all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of man, to wit, his loue, feare, hope, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and with the rest, his whole affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7415:65"/>
or confidence be set whollie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
God, as well after his fall to be saued by the
mercy of God in Christ, as in the state of
innocencie to be saued by his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.
Yea this first precept commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
al men to beleeue God in his word, as wel
in his Gospell as in his lawe: and therefore
whosoeuer doth not knowe, beleeue and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Gospell, he doth transgresse this
first commandement.</p>
                  <p>In the third place we are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that the
meanes of attaining faith, is to get the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the worde of God, first of the lawe,
which shewing sinne, death and damnation,
doth bruse and wound the harte: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
of the gospell, which teaching faith,
righteousnesse &amp; saluation, healeth the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
woundes, and comforteth the sinner,
with pardon of his sinne, and hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life. This knowledge must of necessitie
goe before faith: for the minde of a man
must be inlightned to see the trueth, before
the hart and affections can loue and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. The meanes which God doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie
vse in bringing men to knowe his
wil, is the publick ministery of the word, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by men indued with spirituall gifts
fit for this purpose, yet as hath bene said of
regeneration, so we are to thinke of faith, &amp;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7415:65"/>
all other spirituall graces, that they come
not by vertue of the meanes, but by the
power and worke of Gods spirit, without
the which it is impossible that any man
shoulde vnderstand, beleeue and imbrace
the doctrine of the Gospell. But howe
commeth it to passe that man being a
reasonable creature, indued with an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
soule, whereby he is able not onely
to conceiue any thing that is taught, but also
him selfe to inuent new things not heard of
before, shoulde be so brutishe and blockish

The cause of this defect of fayth, is first
the aboundance of sinne before mentioned,
in that the sinnes of all ages, doe euen flow
together into the last, as into a common
sinke. Secondly the state of the Church,
vnto the which God doth not reueale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so manifestly and sensibly as he did in
the first ages of the world, in apparitions of
Angels in visions and dreames, invisible
formes, and sensible voyces, speaking fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
with his seruants as one man doth with
another, in holy oracles giuing answere to
euery question propounded, in temporall
blessings bestowed on the faithfull, and in
corporall punishments laid on the wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the extraordinary giftes of prophecy, and
immediate reuelation, of speaking straunge
languages, and working miraculous things.
By these and diuerse other meanes, God did
so plainely reueale himselfe to the old world,
that they who did not beleeue his word, may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7415:67"/>
be said to haue bene such, as would giue no
credence to their own senses. But in these last
ages, God hauing once reuealed himselfe in
his sonne &amp; in the gospell, sufficiently for the
saluation of the elect, (yea in trueth farre
more clearely then euer he did before) doth
not any longer reueale himself by any of the
aforesaid meanes, but as it were hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in secrete, insomuch that he seemeth to
most men, eyther not to exist at all, or
else to haue wholly cast off the care and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of the world: and therefore men
cast off all faith, beleife and feare of God.</p>
                  <p>In regard of the which difficulties, it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
euery one in hand who tendereth his
owne saluation, to be both watchfull in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
faith, and also diligent and carefull
in seeking for it. For howsoeuer no careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
can without the blessing of God, work
faith in the hartes of men, yet it is in the
power of man to vse the outward meanes of
attaining it; the which whosoeuer doth as
he ought to doe, he neede not doubt of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
for so much as God is neere at hand
to al those who seeke him. Yea further, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we suppose, that we are indued with a
true sauing faith, we are to take heede least
we be deceaued with that common errour
of men, who when they are ignorant of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7415:67"/>
God, and of his word, and haue in their harts
scarse any shadowe of true faith, yet they are
not ashamed to professe that they doe, and
alwaies did trust in Christ, whereof if anie
man doe doubt, and beginne to examine
their faith whether it be true or counterfait,
then they are grieuously offended, &amp; thinke
they haue great iniury offred. But we are to
thinke farre otherwise, and knowing that true
faith is a very rare thing, not easelie to flatter
our selues in a false opinion of it, but rather
to take a straite examination of our faith, the
which that we may the better doe, we will
now come to the fourth point, namely to
the signes whereby true faith may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>The signes are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, euen so many as
there are in a regenerate man spiritual graces
and seuerall partes of holinesse, all which
come from faith as from a fountaine or roote,
and therefore will certainely declare the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of it, as good fruite and sweete wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shewe the goodnesse of the tree and
fountaine: and therefore he that would know
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow vnfained his faith is, must looke at the
sincerity of his knowledge, loue, feare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erence,
and obedience which he oweth to
God: if these graces be plentifull in his life,
his heart is truely replenished with faith, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7415:68"/>
if this fruit doe not appeare, his faith is not a
liuing tree planted by the riuers of Gods
blessings, but a dead stocke hauing nothing
but the outward forme of a tree But we shall
haue better occasion to entreate of the
signes of true faith, when we compare it,
with that temporary faith, which often hath
place in the reprobate.</p>
                  <p>The fift question, is, whether this faith
may be lost, or no; whereunto we answere,
as hath beene said before of regeneration in
generall, that where it is once truely imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the heart, by the finger of God, there
it remaineth for euer: and although it be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to many alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in regard of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or meannesse of it, yea although it
seem somtimes to be cleane dead at the root,
bringing foorth little or no fruit, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
life hidden in the heart, as there doth
life and sap in trees in the middest of winter,
when they seeme to be dead and withered.
For the conuersion of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from infidelity to
faith, worketh such a total &amp; strange change
in him, that it is impossible, that one should
become of a faithfull man an vnbeleeuer.</p>
                  <p>The last question is, how it commeth to
passe, that of all the spirituall graces, which
are in the mind, will, and affections of man
and of all the partes of mans holinesse, this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7415:68"/>
onely should haue in it this wonderful vertue
and force to apprehend Christ, and to make a
man perfectly iust before the iudgement seat
of Christ: and why not the true knowledge
of God, vnfained loue, the feare of God, or
a generall holinesse of life and conuersation,
should not as well iustify a man, as this one
affection of confidence or affiance? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we answere, that this meanes of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
men by faith onely, doth most of all
make for the glory of God (the which is the
last end of al the decrees &amp; actions of God)
for if man were accounted righteous for
his holinesse or loue, he might impute his
saluation to his owne desert: for perfect
loue deserueth loue, and holinesse will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
life, as of due debt. But affiance impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a humble, loyall, and duetifull subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
acknowledging the vnworthines, base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
insufficiency, and weakenesse of man,
and together the mercy, goodnesse, loue, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
bounty, trueth, and power of God.
This reason is vsed for this purpose,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Ro.</hi> 3. 27.
what law, or meanes of saluation doth take
away all boasting from man, and so giueth
all the glory of our saluation to God? not
the law of workes, or inherent holinesse, but
the law of faith: yea of all the graces which
are in man, faith onely hath in it this naturall
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7415:69"/>
property to make a man partaker of Christes
death and righteousnes, and so of saluation.
For euen as a tennant inioyeth his house and
landes, not for that he loueth or feareth his
lord, or for any vertue wherwith he is indued,
but only because he doth depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on his Lord,
and so doth purchase vnto him worship and
honour by relying himselfe wholly vpon his
loue, fauor, liberality, constancy, ability, &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
so standeth the case with man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his saluation. For no grace saue
onely this affiance on God, and on his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Christ, can conuey vnto vs remission
of sinnes and eternall life. In the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it is commonly said in holy scripture
that faith doth iustifie, not as it is a parte of
mans holinesse, whereof no one part, no not
all the partes of it if any one be wanting, will
serue to make a man righteous before God,
but as it hath in it this proper vertue, to make
the death of Christ, the death of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
&amp; so the righteousnes arising of the said
death the righteousnes of the beleuer:<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>For he
that hath suffered death is iustisied from sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much of the obiect, nature, &amp; attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of euangelical faith. It remaineth that
before we proceed to the rest of the partes
of mans holines, we should declare the relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which is betwixt faith &amp; them. It hath bene
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7415:69"/>
said of faith in general, that it is as it were the
root fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which other graces do spring, in
that it tieth vs to God the fountain of al gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as to the only giuer of all happines: the
which thing is true of this euangelicall faith
after a special manner. For in that it ioineth vs
to Christ, it maketh vs partakers of the spirit
of Christ: or rather causeth an increase of all
spirituall graces. For regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, although
not in time, yet in nature before faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this faith is made the subiect of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

of the holy spirite, and a parte of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
holynesse of man, but because it is
the first worke of Gods spirite, and the
foundation of mans holinesse and saluation,
who must be by fayth freed from sinne and
death, before he can be endued with posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
holynesse and life. Thus the Apostle
doth often exhorte vs to fanctification and
holynesse of life, by an argument drawen
from iustification which is the proper effect
of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> as we may see. <hi>Ro. 6. 14. sinne

                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be asked, how iustification
doth bring foorth sanctification, especially
seing that to mans reason, it is rather a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to a wicked and dissolute life, that by
the multitude and hainousnesse of our sinnes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7415:70"/>
the mercy of God, whereby they are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
might the more appeare.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 7. and 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 7.
and 6. 1. We answere that iustification doth
of necessitie bring foorth sanctification, and
that diuers wayes. For first, the sense of
the vnspeakeable loue of God, whereby
we are deliuered from eternall damnation,
doth inflame the hart of the beleeuers with
a greate loue of God: the which cannot be
shewed any other way, then by keepeing
his commaundementes, and by laboring to
glorifie his holy name, by a holy life. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
God doth saue the faythfull, not as
stockes or stones, without requiring anie
worke, action, or duety at their handes,
but so as that he maketh them to be his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
workers: not that man can do any thing
of him selfe without the grace of God,
but that man being endued and renewed
by grace, doth after a sort worke his owne
saluation, not by any naturall vertue, but
by the power of Gods spirite: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as Christ taketh away the guilte of
sinne being committed, so the faythful ought
to endeuor that sin be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if they shoulde still of set purpose
committe sin they should crosse Christ in the
worke of their owne redemption, defiling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues with sin, whom he hath clensed with his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7415:71"/>
bloud, yea they should crucifie him againe,
&amp; treade vnder foote his bloude as a vile
thing. Thirdly the faithfull doe labour for
sanctification, as for the onely testimony of
the soundnesse of their fayth, and of the
truthe of their iustification. For fayth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other partes of holynesse, is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deade
and vnprofitable fayth. Lastly the
faythfull man knoweth that fayth is not of
it selfe without the rest of sanctification,
sufficient for the attaining of saluation.
For although it alone dothfully iustify, that
is, bring perfect remission of all manner
of sinne whatsoeuer; yet before that a man
can enter into the kingdome of heauen.
he must be endued with perfect positiue
holinesse, the which cannot be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the worlde to come, vnlesse it be
begun and carefullie sought after in this
lyfe.</p>

taken away and ouerthrowen: for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that a man shoulde hope for that,
as being to come hereafter which he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enioyeth. Whereby it appeareth that man
in his first estate of happinesse, had either
none or little vse of this grace, because his
happinesse was present. For howsoeuer the
happinesse of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, were
not so great and excellent, as that whereof
the faithfull shalbe made partakers in the
world to come, yet he then enioyed both
perfect and present happinesse. Neither doth
it appeare in the scripture that God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

that which he presently enioyed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

it had not bene holynesse, but presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption

fell from hope to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
(for so we call that want
of the hope of saluation which
is in all carnall men) neither
could he otherwise doe. For as he who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

away the tree and the house, yea all that
groweth on the one, and is built on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
So when fayth falleth, the whole
holynesse of man falleth to the ground; but
especially hope, the which hath a nearer
coniunction with faith, then other graces,

                     <hi>Faith is the
groundeworke, or foundation and subsistence of
things hoped for.</hi> For happinesse must first
be beleeued in the minde, and apprehended
by the will, before it can be hoped for. So
that seeing man since the fall, doth not by
faith depend on God, he can not hope to
receiue any good thing at his handes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he once thinke of any other happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
then is the enioying of the carnall &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
pleasures of this present worlde. The
which being ended by death, all the ioy,
pleasure, and happynesse of one vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
seemeth to him to be at an end, as it is
indeed. For either he thinketh (as most
carnall men do) that he shall die like a beast,
and that neither he himselfe nor any other,
shalbe raised vp againe to life, to receaue
either good or euill, or if he haue some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and beliefe of the word of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he thinketh that there shalbe another
worlde, wherein some shall haue happines,
others miserie and sorrow, yet he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of fayth, whereby his sinnes shoulde
be remitted, and his person indued with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
holynesse and righteousnesse, can looke
for nothing, but the eternall anger of God.
Thus the Apostle describeth an infidell, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7415:73"/>
he is one without hope. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 12. 1.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The signes whereby this desperation may
be knowen, are these. First the generall
signe of the want of any one grace, to wit,
the want of other graces, which are in a
man truly regenerate. For such is the nature
of this renewed holynesse, that where one
parte is present, there is no parte wholly
wanting: &amp; therfore we may know ourselues
to be without hope, if that we feele that we
are destitute of the true knowledge of God,
of a liuely faith which is the mother of hope.
Secondly a proper signe of this desperation
is, when as a man is not affected with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
ioy in regard of the life to come
but heareth it mentioned as an ordinarie,
common, and light matter: whereas if he
had any true hope of eternall glorie, he
would be replenished and euen rauished
with ioy; and that in the middest of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and miseries by the consideration of it.
But because a man may more surely iudge,
by that which he feeleth to be in himselfe,
then by that which is wanting, therefore
men are to gather this desperation by these
notes, to wit: By an immoderate care for
the preseruing, and prolonging of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life, together with an excessiue feare
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7415:73"/>
of death in our selues, or sorrow for the
death of others, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 13.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I would not

which haue no hope.</hi> And such other notes
plentifully mentioned in the scripture.</p>

be very grieuous vnto them: <hi>for as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

and ought to be very grieuous vnto them.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7415:74"/>
For as he who is poore,<note place="margin">Of renewed hope.</note> sicke, weake, in
prison, exile, and in all kindes of miserie hath
good cause to desire riches, honour, health,
strength, liberty, &amp; to see his own natiue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
his parentes, kinred, and friends, and
in breife to be happie: no lesse cause haue
the faithfull to desire to be dissolued, and
to be with Christ. But God hauing regard,
rather to their good then to their desire,
hath in wisdome appointed that it should be
otherwise, &amp; that their happinesse shoulde be
hoped for, for some space of time, before it
be enioyned. Yea this delay is needful for the
good of the faithfull for that otherwise they
could not be prepared and made fit for the en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioying
of eternall glory. And that in these
respects.</p>
                  <p>First in that the faithfull are left for a
while in crosses, troubles, sorrow, sinne, and
all manner of misery, they haue time giuen
vnto them to consider, both their owne
naturall estate howe wretched they are of
themselues; and also the excellencie of that
glory, which is prepared for them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and so see and acknowledge the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
goodnesse of God, who hath
freed them from the one, and will at the
appointed time, bring them to the other.
The which thing cannot be so duelie waied
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7415:74"/>
and considered by man, when he is in the
state eyther of extreeme misery, or of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
glory, as it is by the faithfull in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life, the which is a mixt state consisting
partly of sinne and misery, and partly of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and happinesse, partly of life, and
partly of death: so that as a man cannot at
any time so well di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cerne a thing to be black
or crooked, as when he layeth it beside that
which is white or straight; so the faithfull
doe more easely and truely conceiue their
owne misery and Gods mercy in this life,
wherein they doe sensibly feele them both,
then eyther they did before regeneration, in
which time they knew neither themselues
nor God, or then they shall doe in the world
to come, wherein their naturall misery is
not felt in their owne bodies and soules, as it
is in this life, but onely remembred and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in the reprobate. Wherein God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with sinfull man, as earthly kings deale
sometimes with rebels &amp; malefactors, whom
although they purpose not onely to pardon
their offence, but also to receiue into fauour
and loue, and so doe restore them from death
to life, from shame to honour, yet they doe
not at the first admit them into the highest
degree of their fauour, to their secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
or to their personall presence. Thus
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7415:75"/>
did King <hi>Dauid</hi> deale with <hi>Absolon, 2. Sam.</hi>
14. 22.<note place="margin">

                        </gap> Sam. 14. 22.</note> who after that he was pardoned, and
receiued into fauour, was two yeares in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
before that he saw the kings face. And
thus doe the faithfull, after that they are fully
iustifyed from the guilt of their sinne, they
doe not forthwith rush into heauen, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
heere on earth, in the outward court
of Gods palace, waiting till they may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the glorious presence of God in
heauen. For we are not to thinke, that there
ought to be the same manner of the first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of man, &amp; of his regeneration: &amp; that as
in the first, so also in the second birth man
ought incontinently as soone as he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iste,
to be made perfectly happy, as if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were a small and light matter, which
might be lost in one moment of an houre,
&amp; recouered in another. And therefore we
are to put a difference betwixt the first and
the second happinesse of man: the first
beeing giuen immediately by God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other is gotten, although not by the
helpe, yet by the meanes of man; who
is in some sort to worke his owne saluation,
and must be endued in this life with some
measure of grace, whereby hee may
be prepared for the fulnesse of it in the
worlde to come: the which thing cannot
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7415:75"/>
be done, vnlesse his saluation be deferred:
for otherwise there woulde be no triall of
his faith and loue, yea no vse of hope, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
praier and such other spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for the working whereof God doth
defer the happinesse of his elect. This the
Apostle doth plainely teach vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24.
25. 26.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24. 25 26.</note> saying, <hi>If the thing hoped for be seene,
hope is no hope, for how can a man hope for that
he seeth? but if we hope for that we see
not, then we doe with patience abide for it.
Likewise</hi> (our hope being thus deferred) <hi>the
spirit helpeth our infirmities in praying for vs,
with sighes which cannot be expressed.</hi> Thus we
see how it commeth to passe, that hope
hath so necessary and great vse in this third
estate.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to declare the nature of it
more particularly, by shewing first what
it is: secondly what relation it hath to faith:
thirdly what are the vses and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which it bringeth: lastly what are the
signes, by the which it may be knowen. For
the first: Renewed hope is an expectation
of celestiall glory or of eternall glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
This definition giueth vs to vnderstand
that the obiect whereat this holy affection
aimeth and looketh, is not present but to
come, and yet not any future thing, but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7415:76"/>
that which is good, for not onely hope, but
all other affections, and the whole will of
man, yea euen when they are sanctified,
and in their purest and holiest estate, doe
abhorre and eschew all euill, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or future, and doe cleaue onely to that
which is good for man. And yet not any
future good is the obiect of this hope, but
the chiefest good, which indeed is all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of good, and euen happinesse it selfe.
For so we are to thinke that as faith tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in God for happinesse, so hope wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
for it. And although both faith and hope
sometimes take hold of a particular good,
as <hi>Abraham</hi> both trusted and hoped in God
for <hi>Isaac:</hi> and as the man sicke of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey
did for bodily health, yet neyther faith
nor hope rest in a particular good, but onely
through it looke at the generall good, vsing
it as a meanes, way, token or pledge of
the generall good and happinesse. Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there is this difference, that faith and
hope doe for the most part apprehende a
particular good, whether it be a temporall
blessing, or a spirituall grace doubtingly,
vnlesse there be a special promise of it, as was
that which God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> of <hi>Isaac,</hi>
as not being absolutely needfull for their
happinesse, and therefore not needfull to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7415:76"/>
be graunted by God: but they lay holde
on happinesse, which is the vniuersall good
without doubting or any exception whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.
So that by hope we meane hope of
eternall glory; in the which sense this word
is vsed throughout the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
Lastly, the obiect of hope is not any
terrestriall good or happinesse, as was that
wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created, but a celestiall
happinesse, as it hath beene in parte descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
heretofore.</p>
                  <p>In the second place we are to declare the
nature of hope, by comparing it with faith,
with the which it agreeth in these respectes:
First faith is the cause, and as it were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of hope, for a man cannot hope to come
to heauen, vnlesse he be first taught by faith
the right way, and true meanes of saluation.
Yea he is more then madde who thinketh
once to enter into the glorious presence
of God in heauen, being not first clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by faith from the filthinesse of his sinne,
but whome faith iustifyeth, him hope glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth.
Againe as faith bringeth foorth
hope, so hope like a louing and gracious
childe cherisheth and vpholdeth faith: for
how coulde any man rely himselfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on God for happinesse, if, as there is
nothing but misery to be seene in this world,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7415:77"/>
so there were no good to be hoped for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Where this question may be mooued,
whether that faith cannot possibly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope, as if a man should trust in God
without regarde had to any rewarde, yea
tho he knewe neyther of heauen or hell. To
this we answere, that seeing God hath so
plainely reuealed his will as touching eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory prepared for the faithfull, we are
not to thinke that he hath faith who is desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of hope,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 1. 2.</note> as appeareth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1. 2.
yet if we doe generally consider the nature
of these graces, we shall finde that if God
had reuealed nothing of the life to come, a
man might haue beleeued not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope, but euen against hope, seeing no
likelihood of obtayning any good, &amp; as it is
saide of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom. 4. 18. Against
all hope to beleeue in hope.</hi> In the which
wordes we see that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued
with hope, and against hope: That is, that
he had a generall and confused hope,
whereby he certainely looked for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishmente
of Gods promise, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he sawe no particular meanes or
manner howe it should be accomplished.
In like manner faith beeing affiance in
GOD for happinesse, doth necessarilie
imply happinesse eyther present or to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7415:77"/>
come,<note place="margin">Of renued hope.</note> and therefore when it seeth no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
happinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it incontinently bringeth
foorth hope to waite for it in time to come:
yet it is not needefull that this happinesse
should be particularly determined and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
what, when, where, and how it is
to be hoped for. For if it had pleased God to
haue appointed it so, it had bene sufficient
for man liuing in this miserable state, to
hope that God woulde make him happie,
although no particular circumstances of his
happines had bene set downe. But now our
hope is not confused, for we know when,
where, and in what manner we shall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as hath bene heretofore declared. So that
here we see, how fayth and hope doe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
fayth looking at happinesse in generall,
without minding the particulars of it. But
our hope teacheth vs to looke for one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
happinesse, which is the inioying of
the glorious presence of God, of Christ,
and of the holy Angels in heauen, where,
before many ages passe ouer, all the electe
shall meete.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the commodities,
which the faythfull reape by hope, and
that especially in these respectes. First it
strengtheneth them against all crosses, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and euils whatsoeuer may befall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7415:78"/>
them in this life,<note place="margin">Of renewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ope.</note> whereby their fayth
might be shaken, and they ouercome, and
euen swallowed vp of griefe, sorrow, shame,
impatiencie and distrust: against all which
they are comforted and vpheld by calling
to minde that vnspeakable happinesse
which abydeth them in heauen: euen as
the Husbandman indureth all manner of
toile in hope of haruest, and as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner
is not dismayed with any tempest,
when he seeth his harbour and hauen to
be neare at hand. In regard whereof the
Apostle calleth hope the helmet of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
whereby his heade, euen his fayth
is armed against all assaultes. Secondlie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hope serueth to preserue and increase in
vs all the other partes of sanctification,
it maketh the faithfull man contemne all the
vaine delightes and pleasures of this world,
all which are not a shadow of that ioy,
whereof he shall be made partaker. It
maketh him clense himselfe from all sin,
that he may enter into Gods presence, &amp;
sit at the heauenly banket in his wedding
garment. Thus we reade, <hi>Ioh. 3. 2. 3. When
Christ appeareth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 2. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>we know that we shalbe
made like to him in glorie: and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one who hath this hope purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that he maie be holy, euen as he is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7415:78"/>
holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly these vses of hope may be vnto
vs true and infallible signes, whereby
we may try and examine our selues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this grace be effectually wrought in
our hartes or no. For if we be (as most men
are) dismaied vtterlie, and euen cleane out
of hart when as any worldly euill, as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
contempt, shame, slander, reproch,
sicknesse, losse of goodes, of friendes, or
any other such crosse doth befall vs, it
is euident that we haue not this helmet of
hope, by vertue whereof the godlie doe
not onely not despaire, but so much the
more reioyce in their greatest miseries;
whereas the vnbeleeuers are stricken dead
with the least crosse that doth befall them.
Againe, if we finde in due examination
that our minde, affections and desires,
are set wholly or chiefly vpon the pleasures
and profites, the riches and dignities of this
world, and that we haue small careof our
estate in the worlde to come, little or no
delighte in spirituall exercises, in reading,
meditating and heareing Gods word, in
praying to God, and in performing the
actions which tend to godlynesse, let vs
not deceaue our selues, for we are as yet
without hope of eternall saluation: yea who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

he be that being thus affected, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with himselfe or to others, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
to be saued as well as others, the
which is the common opinion and saying of
carnall men, his hope is nothing but a vaine
presumption, the which will not be anie
way profitable vnto him.</p>

man in the state of innocencie. This the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
oratour witnesseth, saying, All they
who are in the handes and iurisdiction of any

of their loue and mercy, yea of
their owne innocency, yet they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not onely what they will doe, but also
what they may doe.</p>
                  <p>The second cause of this feare, was the
surpassing and incomprehensible glorie
and maiestie of God, the which being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reuealed hath force, not onely to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
and amase, but also to confound and
consume any creature whatsoeuer, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the saide creature be not stained
with sinne, and so not subiect to the anger
of God. For euen as a brittle glasse being

what soeuer to melte away before his face.
And thus did man feare God in the state of
innocencie, for although he had daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
with God, yet he knewe that as
a vessel of glasse, clay, or any brittle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
often meeting with vessels of brasse or
yron, may easely get a knock, and so be
broken to shiuers; so might he be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the glory of God, if God did at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time reueale the same fully vnto him.
Thirdly man being in his first state had iust
cause to feare God, in regard of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and mutability of his owne nature, which
might easely be ouercome with some
temptation, and that in regard of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of his will, which might easely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
God and imbrace euill: by the which
meanes, he should not onely be subiect to
the anger of God, and to eternall death,
but also displease and dishonor God, who
had shewed him selfe so louing and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a father and creator vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the causes of this feare, nowe
we are to consider the vses of it. First it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7415:81"/>
as a bridle to restraine man from falling
from God by disobedience. For although
man in this holy estate did obey God more
for loue, then for feare of punishment, yet
it pleased God to vse all meanes possible to
keepe him from sinne, and therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
not onely the rewarde of life to his
obedience, but also the punishment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death to his disobedience whensoeuer
it should happen, as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.<note place="margin">

of God. For we know, as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saide, Familiar conuersation will ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

this feare put in minde, and made to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

mutability of his owne nature; so also the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

then it did in the state of innocency, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the faithfull can not loose that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and happy state wherein they are placed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7415:82"/>
and therefore need not feare any euill,<note place="margin">Of renewed feare.</note> being
not only happy, but also sure to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue so for
euer. To this we answere, that although the
feare of eternall death and misery cannot
stand with perfect faith and hope, whereby
life and happinesse is certainely expected,
yea although the faithfull neede not feare the
mutability and freedome of will, beeing
certaine of their finall perseuerance in faith,
yet there are many causes by the which they
ought to be moued to feare God. Hither
we are to referre the causes of feare in the
state of innocency: whereof the most ought
to be of more force to moue the faithfull to
feare God, then they were to man in his
pure estate. For shall man being in happy
innocency, the holy Angels being in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
glory, yea the brute and senselesse crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
feare in regard of the glorious maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of God, and shall the faithfull, being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and miserable, not be affected therewith?
But we know that the seruants of God haue
alwaies feared his glorious presence. Thus
the people of Israell make it an impossible
thing, that a man shoulde see the glorie of
God and liue. And <hi>Manach Sampsons</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
saith, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13. 22.<note place="margin">Iudg. 13. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>We shall die because
we haue seene God.</hi> Further the faithfull are
not freed from the feare which the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7415:83"/>
of sinne bringeth with it, for although
they know that no sin, tho neuer so hainous
can depriue them of the eternal loue of God
in Christ, or of eternall saluation, yet they
ought so much the more to feare to displease
or dishonour God, then <hi>Adam</hi> did in his
innocency, because God hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
more louing, gratious and bountifull
to them in their regeneration, then he did
to <hi>Adam</hi> in his first creation, for God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his loue farre more in bringing some
fewe from the common death of mankind
to eternall saluation, then he did in creating
all in a common state of life. Neyther are
we to thinke that the faithfull liuing in this
worlde, are so exempted from sustaining the
punishment of sinne, as that they doe not
in this regard also feare God: for although
(if we speake properly) it cannot stand with
the iustice and equity of God to punish the
faithfull for their sinnes, the which he hath
already punished to the full in the death of
Christ, yet the fatherly chastisements which
he layeth vpon them for their great &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
sinnes, to keepe them and others
from committing the like, are often so sharpe
as that they doe not without cause seeme
to be grieuous and fearefull punishmentes.
Hence it is, that this sentence is annexed to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7415:83"/>
those grieuous iudgementes which befell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

not needfull to repeate. Yet there is one

he spareth those beastes which yeelding

themselues to his power, doe by feare and
trembling aske mercy at his handes, so when
as God is so prouoked to anger by the sinnes
of his seruantes, that no praiers or vowes can
pacify him, yet this submisse feare of his wrath
doth quench the burning heat of it: by the
which meanes it commeth to passe, that this

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus we see the first part
of mans subiection with
the particular dueties
thereof; the second kind
of subiection, is that which
the sonne oweth to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for God was to man in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
not onely a liege Lord and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
King, but also a gracious and louing
father: and that by vertue of the first creation
the which is a kinde of generation. For the
creator giueth being and existence to the
creature, as the father doth to the sonne. Yet
not all the creatures are in this respect to be
accounted or called the sonnes of God: no
more then men doe account those senselesse
things which they fashion and make of clay,
woode, or any such matter, to be their
children although they be their worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
and therefore there is somewhat
else in man which maketh him the sonne of
God, to wit, the likenesse or similitude of
man to God: for man doth resemble God,
so as we see the sonne doth his father, not in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7415:85"/>
the outward shape of his body,<note place="margin">Of filiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> for God
hath no shape, neyther can be resembled
to any thing that either is, or can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
but in the inward holines of his soule,
the which is called in scripture, The image of
God, whereof more hereafter. Yet this is
here to be noted, that although man be
by his originall and naturall state, the sonne
of God, yet he is not so his sonne, as is the
second person of the Godhead: who parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the very essence of the father, whereas
man hath not in him any part of gods essence,
but onely a shadow, or light resemblance of
it. So that the second person is the sonne of
God, as is the natural sonne begotten by any
man; and therefore is of the substance of his
father not differing from him in any respect,
saue only that the one is the father, the other
the sonne: but man is the sonne of God, so as
he who is a son by some accidentall meanes;
as by law, by adoption by tuition, by suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or by any other way beside natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.
For these sonnes do not participate
the nature &amp; essence of their fathers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do resemble them perhaps in countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
conditions, name, or in some such outward
respect; whereas in nature, kinde, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
they are far differing from them. But
to proceed: Man being not a senselesse, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7415:85"/>
brutish, but a reasonable creature, is the son
of God, &amp; not he onely, but also all the holy
Angels, who being likewise indued with the
image of God, are called the sonnes of God,

                  <p>And therefore looke what dueties anie

the same ought man to performe much

                     <hi>The sonne doth vse to honour his

is my honour?</hi> Yea in truth we may well
thinke, that this affection of reuerence is too
meane to be giuen to God, whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer man is so greate, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
rather a iust feare, then this modest
awe, as his incomparable excellencie doth
deserue rather glorie then honour. The
second duty due to God in regarde of this
fatherhoode, is Imitation, the which fathers
doe, and that iustly require of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whome they doe not suffer to vse the
fashions and behauiour of straungers, but
rather do conforme them to their owne
conditions, manners, and gestures. Yea
children for the most part doe performe
this duty of their owne accord: for they
being of the same constitution of bodie and
disposition of minde, whereof their fathers
are, and hauing beene continually brought
vp in beholding their manner of life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

dutie to God, which the sonne oweth to

which we make the third filial duty,
man is so wholly alienated from God, that
what necessitie soeuer do pinche him, he

griefe or want, doth straight way run
to his father for reliefe; so doe the faithfull
in the manifolde miseries and crosses of this
present life seeke for helpe at the handes
of their heauenly father. For the which
purpose they are indued with a notable gift
of God, called the spirit of prayer, that is, the
grace, ability or faculty of praying wrought
in them by the holy spirite. This grace of
God is diligently to be declared and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for that of all the partes of mans holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
none is a more vnfallible signe of true
regeneration, then is this gift of prayer,
whereby a man is made able, willing and
ready, to pray aright vnto God as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion doth require. For this gifte
consisteth of many particular graces of
Gods spirit, the which are needfull for the
right performance of this duety, and cannot
be founde in any carnall man. First there is
required the true knowledge of those things
which belong vnto the good &amp; happy state
of man, which is not attained but by the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7415:91"/>
worke of the holy spirite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>We
know not for what to pray, as we ought, but
the spirit helpeth our infirmity.</hi> For all men
generally and naturally feele their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
wants, as pouerty, sicknesse, shame, and
whatsoeuer belongeth to the maintenance
of this present life: but as for spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as the knowledge and feare of God,
faith, loue, patience, and the rest which
concerne their eternall saluation, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
trouble themselues in seeking them, or
are greeued for the want of them, nay (for the
most part) they neuer thinke of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or knowe what these thinges meane.</p>
                  <p>Besides, none can pray aright, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be enlightned with some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the spirituall state of man, and haue
a glimmering of the thinges belonging vnto
it (as a carnal man may haue) vnlesse he haue
true faith, wherby he may be assured that god
both loueth him, and wil graunt his requests,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> The Apostle maketh it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him who doth not beleeue in
God to call vpon him. But the beleeuer hath
receiued not the spirit of bondage to feare,
to dread and fly from God, as from a iust
iudge, as the carnall man doth, but of
adoption, whereby he crieth <hi>Abba</hi> Father.
These and many other graces are neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7415:91"/>
for the performance of this duety of
prayer. Whereof it followeth, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
hath receiued this spirite of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
is vndoubtedly one renewed by the
spirite of GOD, and that where this
grace is wanting, there is no regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or sanctification. And least that any
man deceiue himselfe by thinking that
he hath this grace of praying to GOD,
when he hath it not, wee will heere set
downe a fewe notes or markes wherein
the praying of a faithfull man differeth
from that kinde of praying which a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man may vse.</p>
                  <p>First therefore a faithfull man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his prayer himselfe, in his owne
minde, hauing considered what thinges
are most needfull to be prayed for at
that time, and in that company, if he
be with others, and so he doth, as it were
poure out his prayer from the bottome
of his heart: Whereas the carnall man,
although he be in worldly matters a iolly
wise man, yea and can tell his tale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whome soeuer, as readely as the best,
yet he hath neither the witte to conceiue,
nor the tongue to vtter two sentences of
prayer before God, or if he must needes
haue prayers eyther by himselfe for a shew of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7415:92"/>
religion, or in some blinde deuotion, or
in his family, least he shoulde seeme
wanting in his duety, then he is forced
to get some prayer booke into his hand,
and so reading so many as he thinketh
good, therein resteth. The which thing
although it may be done at some times,
and is to be commended in respect of their
atheisme, who neuer pray eyther for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
or any other, yet it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
because the prayers of particular
men ought to be framed according to their
owne particular state, and the present
state of those in whose behalfe they
pray.</p>
                  <p>The second difference is this, if a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man pray without booke, it is but in
two or three wordes, as, Lorde haue
mercy vpon vs: God fende vs the light
of heauen, God send vs this or that thing:
the which are not to be called prayers,
but wishes: whereas the prayer which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from a faithfull heart, is vttered in
a competent number of wordes, as it is
meete and needfull. We doe not denie
but that one may offende in vsing too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
wordes, the which fault Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth
vs of, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 7. 8.<note place="margin">Math. 6. 7. 8.</note> and it is
at this day to be seene in those dotrels who
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7415:92"/>
thinke that they serue God in mumbling
ouer so many doozen of Creeds, Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Aue Maries: yea further we
confesse, that the force of prayer is not
in the wordes of the mouth, but in the
faith of the heart, the which alone will
make the prayer to be heard, although
wordes be altogether wanting, as we
reade, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 13.</note> of <hi>Hanna Samuels</hi>
mother, who prayed so effectually that her
request was graunted, and yet she vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no wordes, but onely moued her lippes
and prayed in her heart. And yet for all
this, faithfull prayers are and ought to
be, if there be no hinderance, plentifull
in wordes: for although thou pray alone to
God, who vnderstandeth thy thoughtes as
well as thy wordes, yet God must be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not onely inwardly in thy minde, but
also with the members of thy body, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with the tongue which is giuen to thee
for this ende. Yea the wordes of thy
mouth doe stirre vp thy affections, and
make thee more feruent in prayer. But if
thou pray in the company of others, it is
needefull for their edification that thou vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wordes, not onely in a generall and
confused manner, but so as that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
petitions conceiued in thy minde
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7415:93"/>
may be plainly declared, and distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
one from another. For sinnes
must be confessed, graces wanting desired,
plagues and iudgementes remooued,
benefits remembred, the brethren com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to God, not in grosse (vnlesse it
cannot well otherwise be) but in particular,
that so the hearers may be the more edified.</p>
                  <p>If it be heere obiected, that this dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and facultie of vttering prayers in the
aforesaid manner, is not to be looked for
at the handes of ignorant and vnlearned
men, who cannot so much as helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by reading the holy scriptures, and
the writinges of godly men: Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere;
That as Sathan hath in former
ages defaced the true worshippe of God,
and aduaunced superstition by no meanes
more, then by bringing into the Church
a generall barbarisme and decay of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
so ought Christians in this time of
grace, to furnish themselues with all things,
which may further their edification; and
although all cannot attaine to learning
for diuers hinderances, yet all may and
ought to be able to reade: by the which
meanes, being diligently vsed, they may
soone come to haue their senses exercised
in spirituall matters, and acquainted with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7415:93"/>
the language and words belonging therevnto,
farre aboue their owne hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yea euen those who being of ripe years,
cannot reade, ought to be ashamed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this barbarous and brutish rudenesse,
then of learning that which will make
greatly for their profite, comfort and eternall
saluation. Againe, he who is endued
with inward graces needfull for prayer will
finde words whereby to vtter his minde be
he neuer so vnlearned: for the spirite of
God giueth vtterance, openeth the lippes, &amp;
vntieth the strings of the tongue to all those
whome he sanctifieth. Neither neede this
seeme strange, for as one saith, all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
enough in that which they know and
like. Put case the vnlearned man, who thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
his Atheisme and want of religion (for
where there is no prayer, there is no iot of true
religion) by his rudenesse, were put in minde
by some friend that such a nobleman
had a rich farme in his handes, the which
he might easely obtaine, if so be he could
tell his tale well before the said noble man.
I warrant you he would not loose it for
asking, neither woulde he come bluntly to
him and say, Sir I pray you giue me this
farme, but he would and that without any
teacher finde store both of reasons, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7415:94"/>
of wordes fit for his purpose. He would say,
may it please your Lordship, to be my
good Lord and maister: I am a poore wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, hauing sustained so many losses, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so many maimes, wounds, &amp; infirmities;
hauing a greate charge of children, of whom
so many are not able to put on their owne
clothes: and therefore I am bold to trouble
your Lordship in such a matter; the which
if I may obtaine, I shall pray for you as
long as I liue, and will by Gods grace be
as faithful and dutifull a seruant, as euer
your Lordship had. I haue no friendes to
helpe forward my sute, but doe wholly rely
my selfe on your goodnesse, and pittifull
disposition. These and many moe like, and
more effectuall perswasions and fit phrases,
prouerbes, tearmes and sayings the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest
man in the world could vse for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
commoditie: how much more able
would he be to call vpon God by prayer,
wherein there is farre more matter offred,
whether we regard the wretchednesse of
the suter, or the mercie and goodnesse of
God?</p>
                  <p>But to returne to the matter in hande,
the third difference is, that the carnall man
prayeth very seldom, yea for the most neuer
but vpon some vrgent cause, as when he is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7415:94"/>
pinched with some grieuous crosse, as sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or pouertie, or when he is in some great
danger as being in battaile on Land, or in
a tempeston the sea;<note place="margin">Ionas 1. 5.</note> as we reade, <hi>Ionas.</hi> 1. 5.
The Infidels in extream danger fell to praier.
These extremities will wring out of the
most irreligious atheist some kinde of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but not till he see that all other meanes
do faile: For till then he neuer thinketh
on God. But it is farre otherwise with the
faithfull man: for he praieth daylie &amp; hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Lord he neuer wanteth matter of
praying, but taketh euerie occasion to pray,
if not openly and in wordes, yet secretlie
in his heart. Yea the faithfull in all their
dangers, troubles, miseries, and affaires
whatsoeuer, do not put the means in the first
and cheife place, reposing their confidence
therein; but first they seeke for helpe at the
handes of God, and then trusting that he
will giue a happie successe, vse the meanes
with all care and diligence. Fourthly the
carnall man doth not in praying vse either
perseuerance in continuing his sute till
it please God to heare him, or yet patience
in suffering with a quiet minde the delay
of that which he desireth: But if he be
not heard at the first, he straightway giueth
ouer: yea most commonly he waxeth so
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7415:95"/>
prophane and godlesse that he will neuer
afterward pray to God, tho he haue neuer
so greate need: and not resting herein
he murmureth against God, and in greate
rage curseth all things that come in his
sight or minde: but the godly man is neuer
wearied with calling vpon God, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to tary the Lords leasure, considering
that God knoweth what is good for him
better then he himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the carnall man prayeth onely for
temporall blessings, as health, peace, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
honour, and such other. And if so be
that he haue some knowledge of the life
to come, he will indeed desire that he
may after this life be in heauen; but you
shall neuer heare him desiring to go in
that way in this life which leadeth to
heauen. He desireth to be happy in the
worlde to come, but not to be holy and
righteous in this worlde. He would gladly
be partaker of the ioyes of heauen, but yet
not with the condition of forsaking his
earthly pleasures. He thinketh it no wisdom
to forgoe a certaine and present happinesse,
for that which will perhaps come, but he
knoweth not when, neither can any man
make him, as he thinketh, any good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it: but the faithfull man counteth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7415:95"/>
all worldly pleasures to be, as they are in
deed, but as drosse and dung in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of spirituall graces: and therefore
his prayers are cheifly of those things which
concerne his eternal saluation. Sixtly the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man prayeth onely for him selfe, for
his children and friendes, by whom he
may haue some temporall comfort or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit:
neuer remembring the affliction of <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
that is, hauing no fellowe-feeling of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of the church of God, and of the
particular members thereof: whereas the
faithfull desire the good of their brethren,
yea euen with their owne hurt, if so it stand
with the good pleasure of God. Lastly
(which is the maine difference of all) the
carnall man prayeth without faith, and
therefore he cannot pray aright, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
14.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14</note> doubting (as he hath good cause)
whether God will heare him or no: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the faithfull man is vndoubtedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that God will graunt his desire,
if it be needfull for his saluation: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if it be some temporall blessing, or
some particular grace without the which
he may be saued, he knoweth that God will
either graunt his request, or make him
plainely see and confesse that it is more
for his good, that his minde be not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7415:96"/>
in that behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Nowe for a conclusion, we see howe
greatly it behoueth euery one, who would
be accounted in the sight of God and man
a true Christian, to giue himselfe carefully
to the attaining of this gift of prayer, and
to the performing of this dutie both by
himselfe alone, and also with his family,
especially if we do duely consider the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde
commodities both temporall and
spirituall, which may be reaped by this
meanes. For as touching this present life,
hearty and feruent prayer comming from a
faithfull man, is health in sickenesse, riches
in pouertie, safetie in daunger, comforte in
all aduersity, yea it is all in all. But farre more
notable are the vses of it in regard of the
spirituall life of our soules: for prayer is
the exercise of a mans soule, as the worde
of God is the foode and nourishment of
it. So that as a man cannot keepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
body for any long time in health &amp; strength,
vnlesse he vse some exercise, yea although
he doe fil it with meate, and feede it most
carefully: euen so although a man doe heare
the worde of God euery day preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, yet vnlesse he do by this spirituall
exercise of prayer, drawe the sayd heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foode into the seuerall partes of his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7415:96"/>
soule, he shall sensibly feele his faith,
loue, patience, and all other partes of
holinesse to decrease by little and little
vntill at length they come to nothing; yea
as the exercising of the body doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preserue it in the naturall vigour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
encreaseth the strength of it, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it from sicknesse; so by the dayly vse
of prayer, we shall finde that the Lord will
encrease in vs all spirituall graces, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
our owne expectation, or the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of any other. And therefore let vs
giue eare to the Apostles exhortation,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18.<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Take to you the helmet of your

in regard of those manifold and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

trie, and nurture his children. For as
the goldsmith intending to make pretious
and excellent vessels fit for the vse of great
kinges, doth cast his gold into the fyre,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7415:97"/>
that so it may be come pure from all drosse,
so before that the faithfull can be vessels
of honour, fitte for the seruice of God in
the kingdome of heauen, they must be
cast into the furnace of affliction, and there
be weaned from the vaine delightes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of sinne, yea tried to be sound in
the profession of the faith, and corrected
for their former misdemeanour. Nowe
these afflictions are of their owne nature as
bitter as galle vnto vs, and therefore it
is impossible that flesh and bloude, being
not strengthened with some speciall grace
of God shoulde receaue this loathsome
potion, without repining, murmuring,
distruste, despaire and many such inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.
For the auoiding whereof it hath
pleased God to giue vnto his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
this gift of patience whereby they
do quietly, constantly, yea chearefully
and ioyfully suffer any affliction, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from God, who is not to them a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell

children; My sonne despise not the correction of
the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked
of him. For whome the Lorde loueth, him
he chasteneth, and scourgeth euerie sonne whom
he receaueth. If you endure chastening, God
offereth himselfe to you, or declareth himselfe
to be your father: for what sonne is there
whom his father doth not correct? But if ye
be without this chastening, then truly ye are
not right sonnes but bastards. Moreouer, we
haue had our carnall fathers our correctours,
and haue stoode in awe of them: shall we not
then much more obey our spirituall father and
so liue? for they chastised vs for a few daies
according to their pleasure, but God chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs for our profit, that so we might be
made partakers of his holynesse. Nowe all
chastisement bringeth with it for the present
time sorrowe, not ioy; but afterwarde it
giueth the fruite of peace and righteousnesse,
to those who are exercised with it. And
therefore let vs lift vp our faint handes and

                  <p>Lastly as touching this dutie of filiall
subiection, it had not so greate vse in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7415:98"/>
state of innocencie, in the which man was
not subiect to crosses, afflictions, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
so as the faithfull are in the state of
regeneration. Yet man in his innocencie was
not altogether destitute of this grace, or
without some vse of it: For it was his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to take in good parte whatsoeuer it
pleased God to do vnto him, if not in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any euil vpon him, whereof his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

blessing whereof he had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and which woulde be very pleasant
vnto him.</p>

man oweth to God
all such duties as the seruant is
bound to performe to his lord

minister vnto him, and lastly to profit him;
for man according to his first creation is
Gods seruant: the which is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a base condition, derogating from
the dignitie of this his glorious estate, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7415:98"/>
that the holy Angels,<note place="margin">Of seruile subiection.</note> which doe farre
excell man in glory, are not ashamed to
weare Gods liuery, and to be called his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes.</p>
                  <p>The first duety is obedience, the which
is to be performed of all inferiours, to those
who haue any authority ouer them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

affected to God in his innocent state as doth
euidently appeare in that his innocencie is
nothing else but perfect obedience to God,

Whereof it followeth that he did performe
vnto God the second duety, to wit, faithfull
seruice, in performing with all care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
whatsoeuer worke it pleased God to
imploy him in. Thus did <hi>Adam</hi> before his

as touching the last duety, how man should

that it is encreased and enlarged, the more

see in the parable of the talents,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.

giueth his graces to men to this ende, that
they should vse and encrease them for his
aduantage. Yea God there compareth
himselfe to a couetous vsurer that is so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

no more his owne man (as we say) then
were the aforesaid brute beastes, but was
compelled to fulfill his masters will in all

with man, who of the seruant of God, is
become a most vile slaue of Sathan, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
attending his will and pleasure, and
performing the same with all his might and
strength, yea with all the faculties of his

not grudgingly and vnwillingly as vsually
bondslaues do, but most readely, greedely, &amp;
ioyfully, delighting in nothing but in that
which they know pleaseth the humour of
their master. So that all men naturally are
in a greater bondage vnder sinne, then any
of them is vnder their temporall maisters
or owners. For there is no slaue of so base
a minde (the which cannot be found among
the brute beastes) but that tho his body be
oppressed, and kept vnder chaines, yet he
desireth freedome, and so he being detained
against his will, keepeth a free minde

immediately &amp; directly about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

serue God in publicke functions, and do in
greater measure glorifie him, then others
do. In this order are to be accounted the
faithfull patriarches, preistes, prophets, Kings,
magistrates, Apostles and ministers: whose
seruice commeth neare to God, and doth
directly and properly enlarge his glory: and
therefore in lue of their long and faithfull

Yea he addeth; <hi>and what soeuer ye do, do it not

godly and vpright life in what kinde soeuer
it be,<note place="margin">Rom. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> is the true seruice of God. <hi>Rom. 6. 17.
Thankes be vnto God, that although ye were
once the seruants of sinne, yet now ye are made
the seruants of righteousnesse,</hi> and therefore
as you did before present your bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vncleannesse and all manner of sin rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to commit sin: so now present your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
before righteousnesse, as being readie to
all holynesse of life.</p>
                  <p>This exhortation is carefully to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all that desire to be accounted the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God, that as whilst they were in
the seruice of sinne, they did no manner of
seruice to God; so now being the seruants
of God, they labour to shake cleane from
their neckes the yoke of sinne. For as Christ
saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 24.<note place="margin">Math. 6. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>We cannot serue two mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
both God and Mammon, but must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
cleaue to the one and forsake the other.</hi>
The which we cannot but do, if that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that this new seruice is not like to the
old, It is not a painfull, dolefull and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, but an easie, pleasant &amp; glorious
state. For the yoke of Christ is easie, and
the burdens which he laieth on the shoulders
of his seruants, are light, at the least no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7415:103"/>
then they are able by his grace to beare.
Yea this is such a seruice as that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
may more truely and fitly be called
Christes friendes, then seruants.</p>
                  <p>So then to conclude this chapter, we may,
and that not vnfitly compare the spirituall
state of all the faithfull, to the outward state
of one of them named <hi>Onesimus,</hi> of whome
we reade in the epistle written to <hi>Philemon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philem. 1.</note>
who hauing fled from his maister, was by
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> conuerted to the faith, and
afterward reconciled to his maister, as all
the beleeuers are to God the father, by
the intercession not of anie Saint or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell;
but of Iesus Christ the sonne of God
who speaketh to his father in this manner:
I beseech thee for thy elect children who
are begotten to the faith by the ministery of
my gospel, and who in time past were vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
but now are profitable both to thee &amp;
to their brethren, although (such is their desire
to aduance thy glorie) when they haue done
all that they can, they thinke it nothing, and
count themselues vnprofitable seruants.
They departed from thee for a season, that
thou mightest receaue them for euer,
into an immutable state of grace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
from the which it is impossible
that they shoulde fall. Receaue them
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7415:103"/>
therefore not as seruantes, but aboue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes,
euen as friendes, and as my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
brethren. For maisters doe not
vse to make their seruants of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
but I haue reuealed thy wholle will
vnto them. If they doe owe thee anie
thing, as they haue sinned griuously against
thee, that put on my accountes: score it vpon
my crosse, I will pay it: nay I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paide it to the full. Thus we haue
for the greater euidence of this matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorized
the Apostles wordes, although
contrarie to our vse, yet not without the
warrant of the practise of the Apostle in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

which man being in the state of

the subiection of the scholler, or disciple

therein as in a most cleare cristall glasse
see all thinges which were needfull to be
knowen. So that as in the fourth estate of
man, which is the second state of glorie,

and haue an end,<note place="margin">

so in this perfect and happy state, which
was the first state of glorie, they had not
as yet any beginning.</p>
                  <p>For we are not to thinke that in the
state of innocencie of men some were
wise, learned, and endued with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and others foolish, rude &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
as they are nowe in the world: seing
that the naturall knowledge of all men was
perfect, although it might haue bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
either by the holy Angels, who
excell man in all giftes and therefore in
knowledge, or by the immediate reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of God himselfe. Yet the Angels
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7415:104"/>
were not the teachers of man (vnlesse
that it pleased God to vse their ministery at
some times) for they had not any such
function commited vnto them, neither did
they knowe all thinges which concerne
mans estate: for the reuealed will of God
was knowen to man (so farre foorth as
it did concerne him) as well as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.
And as for that which was not as
yet reuealed, it was vnknowen to the Angels,
as well as to man. Yet we doe not meane,
that man in his innocency, had no need of
teachers in the time of his childhood, or
that being nowe come to ripe age, he
might not receaue encrease of knowledge
by the meanes of some other man, as we are
to declare in the third part of this treatise: but
that he being of perfect age, was able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
without the teaching of any other, to
attaine to the true and perfect knowledge
of God. But here it may be asked, what
this is that man being endued with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge, coulde learne of God. We
answere, that although man wanted no know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
which was any way needfull for his
present state, or which might be required
in perfect happinesse, yet it was ordained by
God that his knowledge shoulde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
encrease, as God shoulde from time
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7415:105"/>
to time reueale himselfe more and more
vnto him. For the euent of thinges in the
continuall administration of the worlde,
woulde haue laide open many of Gods
counsells, decrees, and actions which
coulde not be foreseene by man in the
beginning, neither were reuealed to him
by God.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the subiection it selfe:
the duties belonging vnto it, are these
two; The first, that man be ready to
learne of God, whatsoeuer it pleaseth
him to teach. The second followeth or
rather goeth before the first, to wit, that
he beleeue whatsoeuer God sayeth vnto
him. For <hi>discentem oportet credere,</hi> nothing
can be learned vnlesse the teacher be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.
These duties are such, as that
man might easely performe them vnto
God. For howe is it possible, that he
shoulde not learne, hauing such a teacher,
as is able to put knowledge and wisdome
euen into stockes and stones? And howe
shall he not be beleeued, who is truth
it selfe? For euerie thinge that is true, is
therefore true because it commeth from
God. He is the fountaine of trueth: for
there is no trueth in the creature, but that
which it receaued from God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7415:105"/>
as a man may boldly drinke of the
fountaine it selfe, because the water of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
as yet be corrupted, but if he let the said
water runne some distaunce of place from
the fountaine, so that he be constrained
to take it at the second hand, it hauing
runne by many weedes, ditches, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thing it might meete withall, he
may easely be deceaued, and drinke fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and noysome water, for that which is
pure and holsome: so if man learne of God,
he neede not feare any false or corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
with the which he may perhappes
meete, if he be instructed by any creature,

then they were: they did before feare
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7415:107"/>
to be taught by God himselfe, now they
disdaine to be taught by men, whome they
thinke no better then themselues: if
God were their teacher, they could take no
exception against him, but onely of their
owne sinne. But now they finde a hundred
faultes with their teachers, sometimes they
say that they haue no learning, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the artes, or in the tongues, they
are not cunning in the antient fathers, they
want eloquence, vtterance, fit wordes to
expresse their meaning: sometimes they
finde faultes in their liues: for if they see
them eate and drinke, mary wiues, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for their children, build houses, or
purchase liuing, and keepe company,
they call them epicures, drunkardes and
worldlings, if they abstain from these things,
they say they haue no good nature, &amp; want
manners.</p>
                  <p>This naturall state of man we haue most
liuelely pictured out vnto vs in the people of
the Iewes, who hauing God not onely for
their king, father and master, but also for their
doctor or teacher, did desire that God would
not speake immediately to them, appearing
in his glory and maiesty, as he had done:
because that it was impossible for any man
to heare the voyce of God and liue, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

who (to make them inexcusable) vsed their

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7415:108"/>
disposed. For howsoeuer for a shew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to auoyde the reproach of men,
and the punishment of lawes, they doe
goe to the Church to heare sermons: yet
they take no delight in hearing (vnlesse it be
in the eloquence of the preacher) and tho
their bodies be present, yet their mindes
are about some worldly pleasure or profit.
Yea it goeth in at one eare and out at
another. For when they come home they
neuer take account of themselues, their
wiues, children or seruantes, what they
haue learned, but falling to their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

some buisinesse, which they haue in

of God, but forget it for euer, as if they

are alwaies in learning, and yet they doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

that all the hardnesse is in beginning to

to rest contented in his will. For the first
as the chiefe and last ende of the creation
of the world, and of al things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
is the glorie of God; so it is meete
and needefull, that all creatures iointly &amp;

him. Yea there is no creature either so base,
or so excellent that it should be exempted

the worship of God. For although al the
actions of man in his pure estate, euen the
common actions of life, as eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did make for the glory of God: yet
these do not make the worship of God,
because they do not directly tend to his
glory. But the worshippe of God in this
state of innocencie consisteth especially in
cenfession, which is an open acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
and declaring of Gods glory in
regard of his infinite and vnspeakable

God, into the similitude of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of corruptible thinges, and as of beasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
birds; yea of creeping things, the basest of all
other. And so doth dishonour God, more
then can be spoken. Thus do all carnall
men worshippe God, for although they
be not all so mad as to cast them selues
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7415:113"/>
downe before stocks and stones, yet they
are all Idolatours making either their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
their belly, their honour, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worldly thing their God, whom
onely they serue in deed, and heart.</p>
                  <p>Likewise as touching the other duety,
whereas they shoulde be wholly moued and
ordered by God as by the fountaine and
beginning of all thinges, and directed by
his spirite in euerie thing, that they do,
they are moued by the spirite of Sathan, by
his suggestions, and by the corrupt lustes
and desires of their owne flesh to all euill.
Likewise for the last dutie, namely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
men are contente that God should
do good to them, but they take it in snuffe,
that he shoulde dispose of them otherwise,
then they thinke is for their good: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to let other instances passe, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that the doctrine of Gods eternall
reprobation is so curiously scanned, so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receaued; yea oppugned and reiected by

                  <hi>A great mysterie,</hi> and therefore it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to be explained after this manner. The
riches of the loue and mercy of God, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
man from sinne and death, is so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great, as that he thinking it a small
matter to restore him to that perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
estate from the which he fell, doth
aduance him to a higher degree both of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
&amp; of happines. Hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that
man is more nearely ioyned to God, then he
was before, both in subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But what bond of subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can ioine man
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7415:116"/>
more neerely vnto God then the sonne is to
his father? after the which manner, man
was before ioyned to God, as hath beene
declared. We answere that although this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
which is betwixt the sonne and the
father be verie great: yet the worde of God
teacheth vs that a greater may be giuen, to
wit, that which is betwixt the wife and the
husband: for this coniunction maketh two
distinct persons to become one person, and
one flesh,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 5, but that other coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hath no such strange effect. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it hath pleased god in mercy to tie &amp; knit
man to himselfe, not only with those bonds
of subiection, wherewith he was tied to him
in the state of innocency, but also with this

schollers, as orderly creatures, and lastly as
naturall sonnes, but also as a most deare and
beloued wife ioyned to himselfe with such
an indissoluble bond of loue on his part, and
such loyall affection on their partes, as shall
neuer be broken, euen as the husband taketh
to himselfe his beloued spouse, on whom he

                  </gap> thy time was come, yea,
euen the time to wooe thee: then spred I my
clothes ouer thee to couer thy dishonesty, yea,
I made an oth vnto thee, &amp; contracted my self
with thee (<hi>saith the Lorde God</hi>) and so thou
becamest mine owne. Then washed I thee with
water, and purged thy bloud from thee, and
I annointed thee with oyle, I clothed thee with
broidred worke, and shodde thee with badgers
skinne, and I girded thee about with fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
and couered thee with silke. I decked thee
with costly apparrell, I put braselets vpon thy

frontlet vpon thy face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and earings vpon thine

Thus wast thou decked with gold and siluer, and
thy raimente was of fine linnen and of silke,
and of broidred worke: thou diddest eate fine

and thou diddest luckilie prosper into a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and thy name was spread among the
heathen forthy beautie. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the further declaration hereof, if we
do consider the notable resemblance which
is betwixt mariage and this new coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7415:117"/>
of man to God, we shall haue greate
cause to admire the wisdome of the holy
ghost, who in enditing the scriptures doth
paint out such darke mysteries with so liuely
colours, and doth so fit earthly types to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
thinges. The grounde of this newe
coniunction whereby man is more nearely,
firmely, and surely tied to God then he was
before, is the incarnation of Christ, wherein
our nature was inseparably vnited to the
godheade in one person, euen as the wife
(which before was of a diuers kinde, bloude
and name) being now espoused to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
becommeth one flesh, bloude and
bone with him, yea one person called by
one and the same name; so that as the
wife being thus, as it were incorporated to
her husband, is more nearely ioyned to him
then anie other whosoeuer, whether sonne,
kinsman, orfriende, and may more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
looke to be enriched and protected
by him: so the faithfull being now in the
humaine nature of Christ thus espowsed &amp;
made one person with GOD, are more
nearely ioyned to him then man was in
the state of innocencie, wherein God did
not take vnto him selfe the nature of man,
and therefore did not acknowledge man to
be as his beloued spouse, and a part of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7415:118"/>
his owne person, but only as his subiect,
seruant, scholler, creature and sonne. All
which are distinct persons from the King,
maister, teacher, creator, and father: and
so may more certainly and vndoubtedly
looke to be not only protected and saued
from death, by the strength of God their
new husband, but also to be enriched by
him with all spirituall and heauenly blessings
belonging to a holy and happie estate.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the manner of this new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
the duties belonging to it are all
those, which a dutifull wife oweth to her
husband: as namely, that she please him,
and cleaue inseparably to him. For the first
as the Apostle writeth, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 34. As she
that is maried careth for worldly things how
she may please her husband;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Cor. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34.</note> so ought the
faithfull endeauour by all meanes to please
their heauenly husband, by being pure both
in bodie and soule, doing all those things,
which they know are acceptable in his sight:
especially by performing the second duty,
to wit, that they renounce all other things
in the world, and cleaue fast to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
separation: euen as the wife forsaketh
father, mother, sisters, brethren, kinred &amp;
acquaintance, and betaketh her selfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to her husband. This dutie of the church
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7415:118"/>
to Christ is notably described, <hi>Psal 45.
11. 12. Heare</hi> ô <hi>daughter, encline thine
care, forgette thy people and thy fathers house:
so shall the King haue pleasure in thy beautie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 11. 12:</note>
                  <hi>for he is thy Lord, and worshipp thou him.</hi> Yea
there can no wife haue so good cause to
performe all loyall dutie to her husband, as
the faithfull haue in respect of God. For
if it should please some greate prince to
aduance some base, poore and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
woman to the dignitie of being his
wife, all men would say, that she could
not by any duties of subiection, shew her
selfe sufficiently thankfull, how then shall
sinfull man, who of himselfe is the most
wretched creature in the world, but is now
espowsed to God the King of Kings, behaue
himselfe in any measure so dutifully as he

as there is a likenesse and similitude betwixt

                     </gap>n image, and that whereof it is the image,
so there is in respect of this parte of mans
holinesse a likenesse betwixt God and
man.</p>
                  <p>For the better vnderstanding of this
matter, and the easier resoluing of those
manifolde doubtes, which are moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, it is needfull that we declare what
God is, to whom we make man to be like.
The essence of God is so infinite, secrete,
and hidden that it cannot be conceaued in
our mindes, much lesse expressed in words
to the capacitie of others. For whereas it
is saide,<note place="margin">Ioh 4. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn. 4. 24. That God is a spirite,</hi> the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7415:120"/>
meaning is, that the nature of God is not
visible and sensible, but mysticall and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
as are spirites. For otherwise the name
of spirite as it is giuen to Angels, is too grosse
to expresse the essence of God. Yet it
hath pleased God in mercie to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
knowen vnto vs by his properties, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
called by the diuines, the attributes
of God, as his knowledge, wisdome, iustice,
mercy, loue, power, eternitie, and such
other. For as we in common speache go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about to describe any man, doe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his vertues, qualities and conditions, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he is honest, gentle, faithfull, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
iust, and learned: so we haue reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto vs in scripture no other essence or
nature of God, but the aforesaide attributes,
and therefore if we woulde describe God,
we must say that he is a certaine essence,
most simple without any manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
existing of it selfe, and from whom
all creatures and actions doe exist, being
eternall without beginning or ending, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
in knowledge, wisdome, iustice,
mercie, loue, strength, power, and in all
goodnesse, holinesse, and puritie.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see in part what God is: now
the image of God in the creature is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is like to God in some of the aforesaid

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f the attributes of God, which are his

                     </gap>t shoulde be partaker of gods nature, and
so be a God. We answere, that the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God may be in the creature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not so as they are in God: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
God hath strength and the creature
hath strength, euery one more or lesse. Yet
there is this difference, that the strength
of God is essentiall vnto him, and a part
of his nature: but the strength of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
is a qualitie or accidental thing, which
may be spared: as when we see two sunnes,
the one is a true substance, but the other
is onely the reflexion of the beames of the
true sunne. In God it is primarelie as in the
fountaine, but the creature hath his strength
from God: in God it is infinite, in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
it is finite; God hath all strength, the
creature hath but some, yea the strength
of the mightiest creature, is great weakenesse
in comparison of the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, some man may obiect, if all
thinges be infinite in God, and finite in
the creature, there can be no proportion

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
like to the great Ocean: both being of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
same matter, and of the same forme, both
being water and rounde. Againe, to take
our first similitude, the body of the sunne
may be said to be of an infinite greatnesse
(although no creature be simplie infinite)
for philosophers doe teach that it is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the whole earth, and yet a man
may see the likenesse &amp; image of it in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
dishfull of water: Lastlie not all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, but onely some of them
can be giuen to the creature, for no creature
is eternall, infinite, or existing of it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In the which respect, we call this resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
which the creature hath to God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a likenesse, then an image; for we know
that an image is like to the thing it selfe in
euery respect, as the image of a man seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be a man, the image of the sunne or
moone in the water, seemeth to be the
sunne or moone it selfe. But no creature
seemeth to be God, because it is vnlike to
God in moe respects, then it is like, for a
beast may be like a man in many respects,
as is an Ape: yet we doe not say that it is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7415:121"/>
the image of man, because the vnlikenesse
and difference is greater then the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>But to applie these thinges to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand. It will be here said, why then
doth the scripture say, that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the image of God? we
answere, that the holy Ghost in enditing
the scripture, hath more regard to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,
then to the exact proprietie of
speache and therefore calleth the likenesse
of man to God, by the name of Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
that he might distinguish it, (as
being farre greater) from the likenesse,
which other creatures haue to God. For
as a man speaking of beastes, may say that
a horse or any other beast is like to a man,
because it hath a heade, eyes, mouth,
breast and bellie as a man hath: but when
he commeth to the Ape, or to the Satyre,
there he findeth so great likenesse, that he
sticketh not to call it, though vnproperly,
the verie image and picture of a man. So
the scripture sayeth that euerie thinge hath
some likenesse to God. For the starres are
glorious, the heauens are simple, the fire
is pure, the ayer is subtill, the thunder is
fearefull, the winde is mighty, the raine
is good, the rockes and many other things
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7415:122"/>
in a manner eternall, the birdes of the aire
and the beastes of the field are carefull to
preserue those which they bring into the
worlde, and are louing and pittifull towards
them, as God is affected towardes all his
creatures; and therefore euerie creature
hath alikenes to God. Whereof it commeth
that God doth often in the scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himselfe, euen to his senslesse and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
creatures,<note place="margin">Esa. 5. 29.</note> as may be seene <hi>Esa. 5. 29.
Hosea.</hi> 5. 14.<note place="margin">Hosea. 5. 14.</note> yea we read, <hi>Gen. 1. 31. That
God looking on his creatures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>saide, That
they were all good.</hi> Whereof it followeth
that they are all like to God, who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe, and is saide to be onely good,
<hi>Math.</hi> 19. 17.<note place="margin">Math. 19. 17.</note> But when as the holie
ghost in the scripture commeth to speake
of a man being endued with reason, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
knowledge, wisdome, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
with iustice, equitie, courage, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
chastity, loue, pitty and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of holynesse, with a beautifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of body and excellent giftes of
the minde, yea with lordshippe and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer all these earthly creatures, he
sayeth of him, that he is the very image of
God, as if he were a finite and a created
God. And yet he doth not meane that man
is either a God, or the image of God: for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7415:122"/>
there can be no image of God, eyther
found in any creature, or imagined by the
minde of any man or Angell; onely Christ
the eternall and essentiall sonne of God is the
expresse character and engrauen forme
of the father, being so much more his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
then any man or Angell is: as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sonne begotten of the body of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being of the same substance, flesh,
bloud, bone, stature, colour and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with his father, is more his image, then
is an ape, horse, or any other beast.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see that the image of God in
man, is, that greate similitude, which he
hath to God, whome he doth resemble not
onely in one, or in a fewe respectes as other
creatures doe, but in many, yet not in all.
In this sense God after that he had made all
other creatures,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> saith, <hi>Gen. 1. 26. Let vs
make man in our owne image, according to
our owne similitude.</hi> Where we see that the
image and similitude of God are all one,
both signifying the difference of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
which is betwixt man and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
there named. In like manner, if we
compare man with the Angels, we shall
finde that as he doth farre exceede the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures; so the Angels doe farre
exceede him, in bearing the image of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7415:123"/>
God.<note place="margin">Of the image of God in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his pure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</note> For they are indued with a greater
measure of vnderstanding, knowledge,
wisedome, strength, purity, holinesse, and
of all goodnesse, then any man is capable
of, and so they approach nearer to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, and are liker to God then man
is. Againe, of men, they who haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure of the aforesaid attributes, haue
more of the image of God; as the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
who hath greater power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
then priuate men, &amp; therefore are in the
scripture called Gods: the man who hath
greater strength then the woman, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is said to be the image of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the woman is made the image of the
man,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 7.</note> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. and so the rich, noble,
learned, wise, aged man, in respect of him
who hath a smaller measure of these giftes,
may be called the image of God. So that
if we goe from the basest worme creeping
on the earth, to the most glorious Angell
in heauen, as each one is more excellent
then other, so it is liker to God: yet the
scripture vouchsafeth this title of Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
to none saue onely to man and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
This is the generall acception, and in
this sense the image of God is also vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken by diuines writing of mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:7415:123"/>
Thirdly it may be vsed yet more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
to signifie not all the holinesse of man,
but onely that part of it, whereby he resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
God more notably then in the other:
for as touching all those partes of mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
which haue beene declared in the
first part of this treatise, they cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
said to be any part of the image of
God, because there is no such thing in
God, he being ouer all and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kngwledging
no manner of subiection to
any, neither any duety of subiection, as
affiance, hope, feare, reuerence, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
inuocation, seruice, worship, thankes,
or any other of that kinde. But if we speake
of mans vnderstanding, knowledge, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
loue, hatred, or any other of the
faculties of his minde or will, we may call
these very fitly the image of God, because
man doth in these pointes resemble God, in
whome the like thinges are founde. Yet the
scripture, &amp; those learned men which follow
the phrase of the scripture, doe not speake
improperly in calling the whole holinesse of
man by this name: seeing that holinesse in
generall is gods image, who is perfectly
holy; and therefore he that looseth the first
part of his holinesse, namely the due subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of man to God, or is wanting in the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7415:124"/>
performance of any duety belonging vnto
it, as the wicked Angels rebelling against
God, and yet keeping a great part of their
conformitie to God in knowledge and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
strength, and many other respectes
haue done, he is vnlike to God, who is not
perfectly holy, &amp; hath lost the image of god.
So that to conclude, we are in this seconde
parte to entreate of the image of God in
this third sense, it signifying the second part
of mans holinesse, wherein he doth more
specially resemble God, and which for the
excellency of it hath the name of the whole
giuen vnto it. But because the image of God
is vsually taken more generally, therefore we
will call this second part of mans holinesse
the likenesse, similitude, or conformitie of
man to God, the which is the right and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
disposition of those faculties of mans
soule, wherein he doth resemble God,
to wit, of his minde and will: whereof
hereafter in particular.</p>

image of God, is not so cleane abolished, but
that there are some reliques of it to be seene
in man: for looke in how many respectes
eyther of happinesse or holinesse, man since
his fall doth excell the rest of the creatures;
so much of the image of God doth remaine
in him. As for example, one part of mans
happinesse was the outward dignity of his
bodie, the vse of Gods creatures, in the
which respectes man hath, euen in this his
corrupt estate, euident reliques of Gods
image. Likewise for the other part of Gods
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7415:125"/>
image,<note place="margin">Of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or vnlikenesse to God.</note> there remaineth in the minde of man,
some small knowledge of God, of good &amp;

the holinesse of the minde.</p>
                  <p>Yet these reliques doe not make, that
any one part of Gods image doth remaine:
the which is wholly defaced, although not

from other: or (as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
to the ruines of some stately pallace: or
lastly, to a dead childe, wherein although
we may discerne the likenesse and image of
the Father, yet it is but a vile, lothsom &amp; rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

make man to be eyther happie or holy in
part: only they serue for these vses: First to be

meanes whereby God might worke the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

work their own eternal damnation. Thus we

But to leaue the dignitie of the minde to
them who take in hand the naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of man:<note place="margin">Of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holinesse of the minde.</note> we are here to consider
the spirituall state of it in respect of God,
to wit, the holinesse of it. That the minde
was created holy, no man can denie, but
he who sticketh not to reproch his maker,
as hauing erred in the most excellent part
of his worke: and therefore it is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that we declare the particulars of this
holinesse. First, what it is, or wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,
secondly the seuerall partes of it: for
the first.</p>
                  <p>The holinesse of the minde consisteth in
the perfect knowledge of God, and so it
may be briefely defined. Where we saye
perfect, we meane that perfection &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of knowledge, whereof the nature of
man is capable, for there is a more perfect
and excellent knowledge in the Angels, then
can be in any man. Againe there is more
perfect knowledge of God in God then in
any Angell. For God is knowen perfectly
and essentially to himselfe only. These tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
kindes of knowledge, which are
without the compasse of humaine nature, are
not required at the handes of man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he wanteth them without sinne. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
we doe not meane by perfection
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7415:127"/>
the highest degree, or the greatest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of knowledge which may be attained
vnto by man: for in this innocent estate,
one man may want that great measure of
knowledge which an other man hath, and
yet want no part or iot of the holinesse of
his minde; onely by perfection we meane
that knowledge wherein there is no parte
wanting, which is any way needfull for the
holy and happie estate of man: that is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a man knoweth all those duties which he
oweth to God, and whatsoeuer thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
necessarilie to his owne good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
                  <p>The second worde of the definition is
knowledge, whereby we meane both actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and potentiall knowledge; Actuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is that which is already really in the
minde: Potentiall knowledge is that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or facultie which conceaueth thinges
offered to the minde by any meanes. The
first is to haue knowledge, or the habite
of knowledge: the second is to be able to
gette that knowledge which as yet is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
of these two heereafter in particular.
Lastly by the knowledge of God, we
meane all manner of knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
although there be diuerse kindes, (as
there are many thinges in the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7415:128"/>
God to be knowen) yet the holines
of the minde consisteth in this, that it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all thinges in God, and nothing any
otherwise then as it commeth from God, and
hath relation to him. For God is all things
in all, and all thinges do exist in God: and
therefore euerie thing may be knowen in
God, and God knowen, yea seene and
felte in euerie thing, euen in the least and
basest creature. The wicked Angels are
in this their corrupt estate endued with
a great measure of knowledge, but this
their knowledge is voide of all holynesse,
because it hath no relation to God and
his glory: for this onely is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the holinesse of the minde: not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to knowe the natures, properties and
differences of thinges, but to see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the wisdome, power good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and glorie of God in them. For ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
hath relation to God onely, it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God through the meanest thinges, and
doth not rest in any thing, till it come to
God.</p>
                  <p>Yet we are not to thinke that the minde of
man is in this his innocencie a confused cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,
or heape of knowledge: for God the
maker of man is not the author of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And therefore we are to distinguish
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7415:128"/>
this knowledge into the seuerall kindes
and partes of it, whereof the first and cheife
is the knowledge of God, that is, of the
proper nature, attributes and actions of God:
the second is, the knowledge of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The first kind may be called diuine,
be cause it tendeth directly and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to God himselfe. Where we doe not
meane that man could possiblie compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
within the narrow compasse of his
shallow braine, the infinite and vnsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
essence of God, the which thing the
Angels cannot doe. Yet we are not to doubt,
but that he did thinke aright without any
errour of the nature of God. And no maruaill
seing he did see God face to face as the
scripture speaketh, that is, was daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
in the presence and company of
God, as the Angels in heauen are, although
not in the same measure: from this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as from a fountaine, springeth the
knowledge of the creatures (commonlie
called humaine knowledge) because all the
creatures belonging to man, and seruing
for his vse, are knowen for his good onely.
For as a man may easely see all thinges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there where the sunne shineth clearely;
so man liuing in Gods presence, coulde not
haue the nature of any creature hid from
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7415:129"/>
his sight. From both these kindes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
came the knowledge of euill: for, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
est index sui et obliqui,</hi> a streight rule
or line sheweth the crokednesse of any
thing; and so all trueth, good and right shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in God and in his creatures, did shewe
to man what was false, wrong, hurtfull, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
or any way euill: for although Sathan
did promise to man a greater measure of
the knowledge of good and euill then he
had,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. as if his knowledge had bene
imperfect in that behalfe; yet he knewe
what was euill, better before his fall then
afterwarde, although by his fall he gott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the sense and experience of euill which he
wanted before.</p>
                  <p>Thus much in general of mans knowledge,
the which is nowe to be considered more
particularlie in the two kindes of it, Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
and Actuall. Potentiall knowledge
is the aptnesse and abilitie of the minde, to
conceaue and comprehende whatsoeuer
it shoulde please God to reueale. Here i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
may be asked, by what meanes man in his
innocent estate did attaine to knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We answere, that <hi>Adam</hi> the first man was
created in perfection as of body and soule
so also of actuall knowledge, not gotten
by sense, experience, obseruation, and by
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7415:129"/>
his owne industrie, (and yet it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to be encreased by these meanes) but
engrauen in his minde by the finger of God,
and inspired by God together with his mind.
But his children were not to come so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to knowledge, to whom he could not
propagate his actuall knowledge, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his potentiall: for they were to be borne
as in weakenesse of bodie; so with mindes
voide of all actuall knowledge, not hauing
the formes, similitudes and vniuersall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of thinges (called <hi>Ideae</hi> or <hi>species</hi>)
engrauen in them by nature, but being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God to seeke for knowledge
by some outward meanes, and so to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
these emptie roomes with all varietie of
knowledge. The which thing was done in
this state farre more easely, certainlie, and
sooner then any man can get knowledge in
the sinfull state of man.</p>
                  <p>First for humaine knowledge, it was to
be gotten by the aforesaide meanes of sense,
experience, obseruation, and collection.
For the which purpose man had great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie,
and quicknesse of outwarde senses,
arising of the exact temperament of his
bodie, and being able to receaue aright
without errour the impression of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
And accordingly were the faculties
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7415:130"/>
of the minde disposed, the which as it is
commonly saide, followe the temperature
of the body, and by the which man was
able with great quicknesse, facilitie, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
and trueth to conceaue and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
to imagine and inuent, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde
and deuide, to collect and inferre,
to reason and discourse, to iudge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
and in summe to performe all the
duties, actions, and motions in any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and finite obiect without failing or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in his worke. Thus we see that man
was to come to the knowledge of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures,
called humain knowledge, not by
immediate inspiration, or any supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reuelation from God, but by the
meanes of the naturall faculties of his body
and minde: for as it is in the corrupt estate;
so in the state of innocencie, the outward
senses of the body did let knowledge into
the minde, as light commeth into a house
by the windowes of it. Yet man did not
gette knowledge onely by opening his
eyes, but by diligent vsing and imploying
all the faculties of his minde in this worke.</p>
                  <p>Hereof we may inferre these things; First
that man knewe not any thing which might
not be knowen by the aforesaid meanes of
his naturall faculties. As for example, he
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7415:130"/>
could not giue any certaine iudgement of
the effect, where the causes were contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
as in his owne actions, he coulde not
foresee his owne fall, whether he shoulde
resist or giue place to temptation, because
the trueth hereof did depend on the extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
motion of his freewill, which might
encline it selfe to eyther part: Secondly that
he knew not any particular thing, which had
not at any time beene apprehended by his
outward senses, and therefore he could not
know the secret thoughtes of another man,
nor define the number of thinges infinite, as
to tell how many stones, or fishes were in
the sea: these thinges he did not know, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it needfull for him to know them.
Againe, hereof it followeth, that man in
his innocency had not any perfection of
knowledge till he were come to ripenesse
of age: for that during the time of his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and childehood, the faculties of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and minde were weake, and therefore
not able to performe their seuerall functions
in any perfect manner: Yea further that in
his youth he was to be trained vp in learning
and in vsing all the meanes of attaining
knowledge. Wherein we are not to thinke
that he was so slow, dull, and vntoward as
are the wittiest and most forward ones in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7415:131"/>
this corrupt estate, but that he did profite
in knowledge farre more easely then any
can doe in this sinfull time. Lastly in that
man was to get knowledge by the aforesaid
meanes, it appeareth that all men were not
endued with the like measure of actual know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge;
for howsoeuer the naturall faculties of
the minde, seruing for the getting of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
were much alike in all without any
great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, (for it could not be but that
there should be some difference as in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of the bodies, so also in the minds
or greater, their actual knowledge was lesse
of men,) yet as men did giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues more
or lesse to the vse of the meanes, and to the
searching out of the trueth of thinges.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see what was the meanes of mans
humane knowledge: but how shal we think
that he came to the knowledge of god, who
is not subiect to sense, &amp; therfore to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by some other meanes? For the answere
hereof, we are to distinguish the knowledge
of God in to two parts: The one is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of gods nature; the other is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his actions, counsels, decrees,
and will: this latter part was altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
to man, but so farre foorth, as it
was extraordinarily reuealed to him by
God, otherwise, no man, yea no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7415:131"/>
in heauen knoweth the minde of God,
or is admitted into his secrete counsell,
as no Angell knoweth when the worlde
shall haue an end, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 36.<note place="margin">Math. 24. 36.</note> Thus man
in his innocency was ignorant of his owne
fall, and of the whole worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Christ: for these thinges
were not reuealed vnto him, neither had
he any neede of this knowledge. Yet God
did from time to time reueale his counsels
vnto man so (farre foorth as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
and that by visions, apparitions,
dreames, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ectasies, inspirations, &amp; by the
ministerie of Angels, but most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a created voyce, as he spake to <hi>Adam</hi>
in the garden. This parte of diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
being reuealed by God, might
easely be attained to by man, who was
able to conceiue, vnderstand and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that God had decreed and would doe
this or that thing. But for the knowledge of
Gods essence and nature, which is euery way
infinite, howe shall we thinke it possible to
be comprehended by man, although the
same were reuealed by God: seeing that it is
impossible for God himself to make a finite
thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend that which is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Againe whatsoeuer man knoweth or
conceaueth in his minde, he conceiueth
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7415:132"/>
it by a similitude, or image of the saide
thing abstracted from it by his outwarde
sense: but whereunto shall man resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or compare God, who is not like to
any thing eyther truely existing or which
can be imagined? We answere confessing
all this to be true, and agreeable to the
worde of God, for it is impossible for a
man to knowe GOD fully, as a man
may knowe the whole nature, forme,
force, matter, vertue and abilitie of a tree,
beast, or any other creature. But howe
much soeuer we doe giue to God in our
mindes, yet there is more due vnto him.
And yet man may in some sort compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the nature of God, euen by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be incomprehensible, and get a
likenesse or forme of it, by knowing it to
be incomparable to any thing, and vnlike
to all thinges. Whereof ariseth this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in the minde of man, God
is a certaine thing or nature incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and incomparable.</p>
                  <p>But this is nothing to the purpose: for it
is not sufficient for man in regarde eyther
of his happinesse, or of his holinesse to
haue a generall and confused knowledge
of God, that he is a certaine thing or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there being innumerable natures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7415:132"/>
his in the worlde: or to haue a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue
knowledge that God cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
of any creature, or resembled
to any thing, for this knowledge, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a confession of ignorance: and
therefore it is needfull to search out not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what God is not, but also what he is: but
this cannot be done by any creature, and
therefore let vs aske counsell of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and learne the nature God, of God
himselfe to whome onely it is fully knowen.
This may be done, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 24.<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 24.</note> where it is
said, <hi>That God is a spirite.</hi> But so are the
Angels also, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 7.</note> howe then? shall
we thinke, that God and the Angels, which
are creatures, are of the same nature? God
forbid: for that thought were no holy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
but a blasphemous errour; yea the
scripture meaneth no such thing, as that
God is a spirite, but onely that he is of an
inuisible, subtile, and pure nature, as are
the Angels, and as is the winde and ayre
(from the which the name of spirits is
taken) or as is the flame of fire,
which is made the synonymum, that is, of
the same signification with the name
of spirite: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>He maketh his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:7415:133"/>
If this be true, as it is most true, then
we are but where we were, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we learne onely that GOD is not
a visible or sensible thing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must haue recourse againe to the
mouth of GOD, and with <hi>Moses</hi> aske
boldlie what he is,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his true name and nature reuealed vnto
vs. The answere which GOD giueth
is this, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> or <hi>I will be that
I will be,</hi> that is, I am no chaungling but
the same for euer. But neyther these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
nor any other in the scripture, doe
flatly define what the essence of GOD
is, what then is to be done in this
case? shall wee thinke that GOD, who
made man so happy, and was so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
vnto him, did enuie to him
the knowledge of his owne nature? that
cannot bee: Wee are rather to gather
by the silence of GOD in this behalfe,
that this is too high a pointe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for man to reach vnto; yea such
an one whereof the minde of man is not
capable: And therefore man in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
was not to busie his heade in soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the bottomelesse depth of Gods
essence, or to thinke that the tongues of
all the Angels in heauen were able to vtter
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7415:133"/>
so significant a word as shoulde containe
in it the forme and substance of Gods
nature.</p>
                  <p>How then may man knowe God, or at
the least come neare to some manner of
knowledge of him? We answere that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God nor anie other thing can possiblie
be conceiued by man, but by some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
or Image, and therefore the only way
to attaine to this light and imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is to imagine of God, by that which
is of al other things most excellent in nature,
and so approacheth nearest to the nature of
God, and which all men know to be the
most excellent of all others. In this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
the nature of the reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doth first offer it selfe, as farre excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all other natures, and therefore man
must be faine to gather out of himselfe, or
else from the Angels, if they were so well
knowen vnto him, an Idea, Image or noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, not by thinking him like to anie
creature (for that were idolatry) but by appyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best, highest, greatest &amp; most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things which he findeth in himself to the
nature of God. This meanes of attaining to
the knowledge of God, is so naturall to
man, that it remaineth euen in his corrupt
estate, wherein nothing is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon then
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7415:134"/>
to thinke and speake of God as of a man for
ignorant men knowing nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then themselues, doe thinke
their owne nature to be likest to the nature
of God.</p>
                  <p>Well, then let vs vse this meanes seeing we
haue no other, and see if we can conceiue of
the greate ocean by a droppe of water. What
then is counted most excellent in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man? what but his vnderstanding,
knowledge, wisdome, counsell, his reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
wit and orderlie affections, his loue,
fauour, mercy, pittie, his iustice, purity, &amp; such
other vertues, his strength and power, his
Lordshippe ouer the creatures, and his,
glorie arising thereof? In these things doth
the excellencie of man consist, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
man, as it were, putting his owne coate
on God, is to conceiue of him in his minde
as of a nature surpassing, yea infinite in
knowledge, wisdome, counsell, in will, loue,
hatred, fauour, and reuenge, in mercie and
compassion, in puritie and iustice, in might,
power, dominion and glorie, and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
that man doth thus conceiue of God,
seeing GOD in regarde of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mans capacitie, hath reuealed him
selfe to man in this, and in no other
manner, euen in the person, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7415:134"/>
and nature of man, and yet this is the
onelie nature of GOD which is reuealed.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the meanes whereby
man in this his innocencie attaineth to the
knowledge of this nature of God (which
being after a sort his owne nature, is familiar
vnto him and may easilie be conceaued)
they are two. The first are the naturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his soule and bodie, to wit, his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
outward and inward, by the which he
did plainly and certainly gather out of
the creatures, the actuall knowledge of gods
attributes, wherein as hath bene saide, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being otherwise incomprehensible is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed,
as namely, of his infinitenes, eternity,
wisdome, iustice, power, &amp; loue, all which do
shine so clearelie in the creatures, that man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
since his fall doth by this meanes attaine
to some knowledge of God: as we read. <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 20.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>The inuisible things of God, to wit, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
power &amp; godheade are plainele seene since
the creation of the world, being considered</hi> or
vnderstoode <hi>in the creatures.</hi> If by man being
sinfull, how much more by him being in
his pure estate? For what maruaile is it that
one who hath both his eyes, and is cleare
sighted, doth see the light of the sunne shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in his eies, which is so cleare of it
selfe, that a blinde man maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7415:135"/>
it?</p>
                  <p>The second way or meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
was immediate reuelation: for as it
shalbe in the seconde, so in the first state of
innocencie, GOD did reueale himselfe
and the glorie of his power, wisdome, loue,
and of the rest of his attributes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie
by himselfe, and that diuers wayes
as it seemed best vnto him, vouchsafing to
haue familiar conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his reasonable
creatures, and to speake with them face to
face as one friende vseth to doe with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This second meanes did make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the actuall knowledge gotten by man
himselfe out of the creatures, encreasing
it to a farre greater measure then can be
attained in the state of regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the meanes whereby the
potentiall knowledge of man is made actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
whereby it appeareth that there was no
ordinarie ministerie appointed by GOD
in the handes either of Angell or of man
as it is in the state of regeneration as hath
bene declared in the first part <hi>Chap. 8. Sect.</hi>
1. For if we shoulde suppose that some one
man in this state of innocency did liue soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarelie
by himselfe, not hauing the companie
or helpe of any other; yet we are not to thinke
that he woulde haue bene ignorant of God,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7415:135"/>
but rather to be perswaded that howsoeuer
he might want the knowledge of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
(the which doth not make an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge) &amp; also be inferiour to others
in measure of knowledge, yet he shoulde
haue bene endued with the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God. For as hath bene said, this
state of happinesse is of the same kinde with
the happinesse of the Angels in heauen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in degree of knowledge and all other
graces it be farre inferiour to it. For this
is a certaine and generall rule, that in all
states of innocency, whether they be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
or on earth, whether in this world or in
the worlde to come, God doth reueale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to his reasonable creatures face to face,
that is, immediatlie without the mediation
of any creature, as God saieth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 8.<note place="margin">Numb. 12. 8.</note>
                     <hi>That he spake to Moses face to face, mouth
to mouth.</hi> But he spake to the people by
the mediation of <hi>Moses.</hi> Thus, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.
12.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12</note> 
                     <hi>To see God face to face,</hi> (as the Godly
shall in the worlde to come) is opposed to
the knowing of God by the ministerie of
man, as the faithfull doe in this life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God doth reueale himselfe to them by
his ministers, as one man speaketh to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by an interpreter or messenger, not in
personall presence. Yet this immediate
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7415:136"/>
teaching doth not hinder, but that in this
state of innocencie one man might haue his
knowledge encreased by an other, as God
did reueale some particulars to one more
then to another, or that the weakenesse
of mans infancie and childehood shoulde
not be supported by teachers, as hath bene
declared.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the potentiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
called by philosophers, the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnderstanding, or facultie of the minde
the which in conceauing any thing doth
suffer the impression of knowledge, as waxe
doth suffer when as any forme is imprinted
in it. Nowe we come to actuall knowledge,
called the agent facultie, because knowledge
being once gotten is not idle, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the minde, and doth not onely moue
it selfe, but also is the beginning of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all the other faculties of the bodie
and soule.</p>
                  <p>As touching the measure of mans actuall
knowledge in his innocencie (the which
poynt onely resteth to be considered) it is
to be defined by his happinesse, and by
comparison made with the knowledge of
the faithfull in their regeneration. For first
man knewe whatsoeuer might any way
make for his good and happie estate, as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7415:136"/>
namely, he had the perfect knowledge of
God (which is a great parte of happinesse)
beholding him daily and continually, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not in his essentiall forme, which
is incomprehensible, yet in the cleare eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his glory. Besides he had the
knowledge of all the creatures, whose
formes, kindes, natures, properties, vertues,
qualities and commodities, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
comprehend: as appeareth in that
<hi>Adam</hi> gaue to euery beast a name agreeable
to his nature. He knew howe to gouerne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and common-wealthes, with meete
orders and lawes, and in generall, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
thing did any way belong to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
vse, pleasure or commoditie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly we may gather the measure
of the created knowledge by comparing it
with renewed knowledge. For if we should
put together in one man, the knowledge of
the best &amp; most learned diuines, politicians,
physitions, logicians, mathematicians, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
and of all that are most excellent
in any kinde, yet it is not so great, sound,
pure, subtil &amp; perfect as the knowledge of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the state of innocencie. And no maruel se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had far more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
whether we regard his own nature, &amp;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7415:137"/>
therein the puritie and integritie of all his
senses and faculties, both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
or yet his scholemaister and teacher
who was Godhimselfe.</p>

who are come to yeares of discretion, and

knowledge which they haue of themselues.
Both which accidentes may happen to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men, as we are to declare in the third
part of this treatise. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>In this sorte of men we are to account
all ignorant people, who hauing beene
brought vp in rudenesse and ignorance, not
vsing the meanes of getting knowledge,
as the heareing, reading and learning of
the worde of God, haue no other opinion
of God and of religion, then those rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
and beginnings, which they brought
from their mothers wombes, and which
they haue gotten (or rather which haue
crept into their mindes by little and little
they not seeking or looking after any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
not out of the bookes of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but out of the creatures: The which
being dayly, beheld, felt and enioyed, can
not but leaue some impression of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in the mindes of those who
haue any sparke of reason remaining in
them. Hence it is, that man euen in this
his corrupt estate, thinketh that there is a
God, that this God is of great power and
therefore to be feared: that he is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7415:138"/>
of all good thinges: and therefore to
be worshipped &amp; honored in way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
that he is iust, and there fore will
punishe sinners, and rewarde good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
men. Likewise he hath some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the second table, yea more then
of the first, whereby he can decerne right
from wrong, honest thinges from vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
so that he condemneth theft, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
incest, adulterie, murther and such
like grosse sinnes. For although many doe
diminishe this light of nature and become
such detestable atheistes, as to fay in their
heartes, that there is no God, yet man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
thinketh otherwise, as appeareth
plainely both by the word of God, and by
common experience.</p>
                  <p>For the first we haue this doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
19. 20.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19. 20.</note> that which is knowen of God (that
is so much as God hath made knowen to
all men generally not onely to his Church,
but also to the heathen and infidels) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
euen to the gentils. For God hath
made it knowen vnto them: for the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
things of God, as namelie, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
power and Godheade, are seene since
the creation of the worlde, being by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or the vnderstanding gathered out of
the creatures. This appeareth also in al ages
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7415:138"/>
and nations which haue beene since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world: for although fewe of
them haue had the knowledge of the true
god, and of his true worship, yet all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
haue had and worshipped some God:
yea almost euery particular country, citie,
towne, village, and familie hath had their
proper gods, whereby it is plaine, that
there was in their mindes the aforesaid know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge,
to wit that there is a God.</p>
                  <p>Neyther could it be otherwise, for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
man seeth the creatures, to wit, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the earth, the sea, he must needes
thinke with himselfe, that these dead and
senselesse creatures coulde not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
yea that no man, nor any other
creature coulde make eyther them or
yet it selfe: for how shoulde any thing worke
or doe any thing before it doe exist it selfe.
Thus we see what is the naturall knowledge
of naturall men: but what is this incompari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that knowledge which man had in
the state of innocency, but mere &amp; grosse ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance?
For man in his pure estate had more
perfect knowledge of God (although not
the same particular knowledge) then all the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earned diuines in the world haue had, haue,
or shall haue heereafter. But since the fall he
hath not by nature the knowledge of the true
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7415:139"/>
God: for we cannot say that he that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his idoll to be a God, knoweth the true
God. Besides, this naturall knowledge, of
God is not a setled and grounded perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but a light and wauering opinion, a
meane betwixt knowledge and ignorance,
and therefore little regarded or followed in
life, and easely lost out of the minde: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it commeth that those reliques of the
knowledge of God, are so soone lost, and
by the least perswasion or occasion turned
into senselesse idolatrie, wherein GOD
is thought to be like to man and other baser
creatures.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, although the actuall ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the naturall man be so palpable,
as that it cannot be denied, yet he will not
yeeld to potentiall ignorance, that is, he will
not confesse himselfe to be so blockish, dull,
&amp; vncapable of the true knowledge of God,
but that he might easely attaine vnto it by his
owne strength, and by the naturall faculties
of his body and minde, if so be he listed to go
about it. For the proofe wherof, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the examples of many natural and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
men, who although they neuer
knewe indeed what spirituall regeneration<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
but did alwaies laugh at it, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
scorne the professours of it, being in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7415:139"/>
their whole liues carnall, worldly and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute:
yet for knowledge in all pointes of
diuinity they were counted the most profound
men of all others. To this we answere, as
we are taught by the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 14.
That the naturall man doth not conceiue</hi> or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<hi>the thinges of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>for they are
foolishnes vnto him, neyther can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned,</hi> that is,
the carnall man is not onely actually igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of God, but also vnable to conceiue
and vnderstand heauenly things. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he labour most earnestly in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
opinion of his owne wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to know God, yet it is a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impossible for him to attaine to the true
knowledge of him. To this agreeth dailie
experience, for who seeth not that the word
of God is preached diligently, plainely, and
painefully in many places, in the which most
of the hearers remain as ignorant of religion,
as if they had neuer heard tell of such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
whereas if a man did tell them a tale of
any worldly matter, belonging to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
or pleasure, they would vnderstand it at
the first, and cary it away so well, that they
would be able to instruct others very reade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in it.</p>
                  <p>As touching the great measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7415:140"/>
which may be seene in diuerse vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
men; We answere, First, that God
doth bestow his spirituall giftes not onely on
the elect, but also on the reprobate (as we
are to declare at large in the next part)
and therefore they are not meere carnall
men, because they haue a shadowe of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
Secondly, the knowledge of these
men, howsoeuer it cary a glorious shew, yet
in strait examination will be found to be
nothing but ignorance. For it beeing not
wrought effectually in their mindes and
heartes by the spirite of God, but onely bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
out of the bookes and sermons of
other men, hath no steedfast ground in them,
but in mingled with much doubting, vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef,
error &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For who knoweth not,
that it is an easie &amp; common matter for men
to talke, and reason at large of matters which
they doe not vnderstand? 1. <hi>Tim. 1. 7. They
would be doctors of the lawe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; yet they know not
what they speake, nor whereof they affirme.</hi> So
many did prophecy in the name of christ, who
neither knew Christ nor shalbe acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of him:<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 10.</note> so we read, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 10. of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
who although he were a teacher in Israel,
yet he was ignorant of the doctrine of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that is, of al religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So many preach
of God, Christ, faith, the resurrection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7415:140"/>
dead, and dispute very cunningly and subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of these things: who thinke in their hearts
that they are but vaine &amp; false doctrines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
perhaps for a good end, to make men
liue an honest and orderly life, but such as
haue no trueth in them, neither shall euer be
seene to come to passe.</p>
                  <p>If any do maruel how men of singular wits,
of great capacity, learning, reading, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and wisedome should be so dull, or
rather dead and senselesse, as not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the doctrine of God, of his nature and
actions, which is so plainely taught, and so
often iterated in the scripture, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
heereof is giuen in the place before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
1. <hi>Cor. 3. 14. Because the thinges of
God are spiritually to be discerned.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 14.</note> That is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is a repugnancy and contrariety
betwixt the reason of a naturall man, and the
thinges of God. For the naturall man trieth
the trueth of all things by his owne senses, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
that impossible and false, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be effected by ordinary and natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
but the word of God, especially the
doctrine of the gospel, hath in it many things
which are impossible in nature, &amp; therefore
incredible in all reason: as namely, the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of God, the miraculous conception
of Christ, the spirituall regeneration of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7415:141"/>
faithfull, the resurrection of the body, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory, and many other: the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and vndoubted perswasion whereof, is
farre more hardly attained by those who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

and vnlearned.<note place="margin">

see your calling that not many wise men are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen:</hi>
the reason heereof is euident: for it is
needful that he who would beleeue the word
of God, should renounce his own knowledge
so farre as it is contrary to the other. But the
more wit and learning a man hath, the more
he attributeth to it, to himselfe &amp; to his own
strength. Whereas they who haue a small
measure of these giftes, doe not trust so much
vnto them: as the wise man witnesseth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That there is more hope to win a foole to
wisedome, then one who thinketh or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himselfe to be wise, and so is wise in his
owne eyes.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the great ignorance of God,
which is in all vnregenerate men: nowe for
the knowledge which man hath of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures,

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7415:141"/>
so void of all manner of knowledge, as
that he seemeth not to differ from a bruite
beast, but onely in the outward proportion
of his body, and the faculty of speaking. Nay
he is more ignorant then are the brute
beasts, whereof there are almost none,
which knoweth not and that without any
teacher, euen by the secrete instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
what is good and euill for it selfe,
yea the secret vertue of some hearbes or of
other things which may stande them in stede:
but man being anie way distressed, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how to goe either to God or anie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
thing for helpe: being so farre from
knowing other things that he knoweth not
the partes, temperamentes, frame, dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
infirmities and diseases of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
or anie thing belonging to it, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
or healing of it, saue only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
members and fashion of it. Neither is
there any cause why man should bragge of
that greate knowledge, which he is able to
attaine vnto, whenas he giueth himselfe to
search it out. We do not denie but that God
graunteth thus much to the labour of indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
men, that they attaine to knowledge,
some more, others lesse: but the learnedest
philosopher in the world cannot denie, but
that he is not only actually ignorant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7415:142"/>
things, but also naturally vnable to pearce
into the depth of the wisdome of God in the
creatures, &amp; that by reason of the dulnesse &amp;
shallownesse of his wit, which cannot finde
out the true causes, formes, reasons and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of naturall things: as why the load-stone
draweth iron to it, of the which kinde infinite
instances might be brought. And if they
chance to finde out the vertue and qualitie
of anie thing, it is done not by considering
the causes, but by marking the effectes; and
so not by knowledge or anie good cunning,
as we say, but by chance and by experience
the schoole-maister of fooles.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eside the generall knowledge
(whereof we haue spoken in the
former chapter) there is in the
mind of man a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the which for the great vse which it
hath in the spirituall state of man, hath a
proper name giuen vnto it (being called
Conscience) as if it were a distinct facultie
of the soule, whereas if we speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
it is nothing els but an action of the
minde, and the knowledge of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
thing, to witte, of mans estate before
God, whether he be righteous or sinfull,
and so consequently whether he be in the
state of life or of death, as the worde doth
plainly signifie. For conscience is <hi>sui
scientia,</hi> or <hi>scientia cum vel coram deo;</hi>
that is conscience is a mans knowledge of
himselfe; or a knowledg with God, before
God, or in the presence of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may define it thus: Conscience is
the opinion or perswasion of a mans minde
concerning his estate before God. Or thus:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7415:144"/>
It is the testimony or iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the mind
giueth of innocency or guiltines,<note place="margin">Of the consc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>cence of man in his pure estate.</note> of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
or sinfulnes of life or death. So it is de,
fined <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>To be the accusing or excusing
of a mans thoughts</hi> or of his minde. So that
we may call the conscience the witnesse,
which before the tribunall seate of God,
being in the iudgment hall of a mans minde,
doth either excuse and iustifie his seuerall
actions, and whole life and person and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the sentence of life vnto him; or else
doth accuse &amp; condemne him in regard of sin
committed, and so adiudge him to eternall
death.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of conscience ingenerall: now
as touching the conscience of man in his
pure estate, we cannot doubt but that it
did wholly iustifie him, being as then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any spot of sinne: from this true excusing
conscience, commeth confidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
man is imboldened to conuerse in the
presence of God, to heare him speake, to
see his glory, and so to haue a kinde of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
with him, as man had in his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
where as an accusing conscience bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
feare &amp; shame, as we see plainlie in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
who so soone as he had sinned, was
compelled by this accusing witnesse (for
there was no other to accuse him) to runne
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7415:145"/>
into a hole and hide himselfe among the
trees, when he perceaued God to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
but hereof more in the next section.
Lastly if it be asked, how conscience can
be made a part of mans conformitie to God,
seing as it may seeme there is no such thing
in God; we anwere, that conscience, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this clearing conscience hath place in God,
who in him selfe and before himselfe doth
see and knowe himselfe to be puritie, and
holinesse it selfe and so free from all shadow

therfore seing the whole knowledge of mans

blinded, but that there remaine in it some
reliques of knowledge, trueth and light:
So the conscience hath his part as well of this
light, as of the aforesaide darknesse, and by
vertue thereof, doth sometimes speake
the trueth, euen as the greatest liers vse
to doe.</p>
                  <p>First of the false witnesse of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
because this is more common, then
of the true testimony of it. The false testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the minde or conscience is of two
kindes; the first and most vsual kinde, is when
as it doth falsly excuse: the second is, when
it doth falsly accuse. The first hath place in
all those who thinke that to be no sinne
which is a sinne in the sight of God. And it
is of two kindes, for either it doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
a man where it shoulde accuse him, or
else it doth iustifie and absolute him for that
for the which it shoulde condemne him.
The first may be seene in all those in whose
opinon and iudgment that is no sinne which
is accounted sinne in the sight of God: as
namely in them, who being therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
libertines (but as it is saide of them, are
too shamefully licentious) thinke that there
is no sinne, and that they may doe what they
list. And so are not checked by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7415:146"/>
no not when they commit most
hainous sinnes. This kinde of a false excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
conscience is in those also who thinke
originall sinne to be no sinne, or not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
eternal death: or who doe any way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
the hainousnesse of sinne, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some sins to be veniall in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And also in them who thinke wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoughtes, or vaine wordes to be no
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Lastly this conscience is in a manner in
all vnregenerate men, especially in those
who liuing a ciuill and honest life, free
from grosse sinnes, as adulterie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
theft, periurie and such other, thinke
themselues iust before the iudgment seate
of god. This presumptuous opinion was in
the pharisies, who had a great conceite, and
made no smal bragges of their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
as we may see, <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. 20.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 20.<note place="margin">Marc. 10. 20.</note> in one of their schollers,
who was not ashamed to affirme, and that
before the face and visible presence of God,
that he had kept all the commaundements
of the morall lawe, and that not onely in
some part of his life, but continually euen
from his youth vp. Yea this is the fond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of most men, who thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be no sinners, because they are
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7415:146"/>
not notorious malefactors: to fulfill the law
of God, because they doe keepe the lawes
of men: to be innocent and iust before God,
because they liue irreproouably (as very fewe
doe) in the eyes of men. But this is a very
fearefull and dangerous estate, and that
which is the cause of most mens destruction:
for they neuer seeke to know the gospel, and
to haue remission of their sinnes in Christ,
because this their flattering and lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
doth beare them in hande that they
are righteous enough of themselues, and
therefore neede not to be clothed with the
righteousnesse of Christ, as we read, <hi>Reuel.</hi>
3. 17.<note place="margin">Reuel. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>They say</hi> with themselues euery one

where as indeed, they are wretched, poore, blind,

                  <p>The second kinde of a false excusing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
is that, which doth not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
but also iustifie a man, for that for
the which it should condemne him, such is
the senselesse blockishnesse of a corrupt
minde. This conscience is in those who
serue God after a false &amp; deuised manner,
and so thinke that their will-worship doth
make them acceptable to God, which in

                     </gap>rueth is most abhominable in his sight.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7415:147"/>
They thinke that they aduance his glorie,
when as they set vp idolatrie, and that when
they persecute the true ministers, Apostles,
and seruantes of God, <hi>They doe God good
seruice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 2.</note> as we read, <hi>Iohn. 16. 2. They thinke

                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 7. for saying ouer and

lastly that they shall be saued for those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the which howsoeuer they cary a shew
of religion and deuotion, yet they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
sinnes before God, and those for the
which the doers should be condemned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had not sinned in any other
kinde.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of a false excusing conscience.
Now followeth a false accusing minde and
conscience. This is contrary to the former
kinde, for it accuseth where it shoulde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
and iudgeth that to be vnlawfull which
is lawfull. This false testimony of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
commeth of the ignorance of
christian liberty, accounting things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
indifferent, as altogether vnlawfull,
whereof it commeth that men thinke it a
sinne to eate this or that meate, on this or
that day, to mary, to be in this or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to weare this or that apparrell, to vse
this or that kinde of recreation and so of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7415:147"/>
many other thinges, which are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
nor forbidden in the word, but left
indifferent, and in the which a brother or
sister is not in bondage, but God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them in peace: the which although it be
not so euill and dangerous as is the other
kinde, for that it is safer and better for a
man to feare in doing that which he might
boldly doe, then to be bolde in doing that
which he ought not doe, yet it is an euil and
sinfull conscience, displeasing in the eyes
of God, who as he hath in great mercy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs great liberty in Christ, so it is his will
that we should, although be sparing in the
vse of it, whenas it doth not further our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
and saluation, yet not babes in
knowledge and vnthankfully ignorant of the
great benefits bestowed on vs.</p>
                  <p>If it be heere obiected, that this false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
conscience cannot be truly said to be
in the vnregenerate man, because whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is done by him, being destitute of faith,
it is a sinne, although it be in the vse of things
indifferent, and might be lawfully done by
a faithfull man: We answere, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cience
of an vnregenerate man shoulde
not accuse, because he doth vse any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
thing, as because he eateth or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
(as it vseth to doe, and therefore it
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7415:148"/>
is a false accuser) but because he doth it
without faith, whereby both his person, and
all his actions should be made acceptable
to God: Thus we see what is the false or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conscience.</p>
                  <p>Nowe let vs see how it is a true witnesse, for
according as the light or knowledge of the
mind is more or lesse, so is this true testimony
of the conscience,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 15.</note> sometimes excusing truly,
and sometime accusing truely. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 15.
For although it be impossible, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of an vnregenerate man should tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleare him of sinne, and the punishment
thereof, because his whole life, yea euery
particular action of his life, and euery part
of his body, and faculty of his soule is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with sinne, yet as a carnall man may
be free from some particular sinne; so his
conscience may truely excuse him in that
behalfe. But the chiefe vse of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is to accuse truely for sinne committed,
in the doing whereof it is very forcible,
and as it is commonly said, in steede of a
thousand witnesses: therefore hath God
in greate wisedome left some light in the
minde of sinfull man, that he might be
conuicted by himselfe, and so left inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable:
Yea sometimes it commeth to
passe, that this conscience is not onely
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7415:148"/>
the witnesse, but also the executioner,
stirring vp such fearefull stormes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
feare, sorrowe, shame, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
as are most intollerable, and
may be truely said to be the very flames
of hell fire. This is verified by the tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ende of the traitour <hi>Iudas,</hi> at whose
horrible treacherie, whenas all men held
their peace, this witnesse, euen his owne
conscience stept foorth, and did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuse and conuince him by his owne
mouth, which saide vnto him, thou hast
sinned in betraying innocent bloode, but
also did execute him with his owne hands,
which brought him to a fearefull and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ende.</p>
                  <p>Yet this witnesse is not alway thus dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in doing his duety, but onely eyther
after some hainous sinne be committed, as
in the aforesaid example, and chiefly when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is stirred vp &amp; awaked by some iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
powred out vpon the sinner. Thus
did the conscience of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren sleepe
till their trouble and danger which befell
them in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 21.</note> did awake it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21.
or at the least, til the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be denounced
against him,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> thus we read, <hi>Act. 2. 37. That
many of the Iewes were pricked in their harts,</hi>
that is, were troubled in their consciences
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7415:149"/>
and mindes, by hearing of their horrible sin
committed in crucifying Christ. Otherwise
the conscience is idle for the most part, and
lulleth men a sleepe in sinne, deferring the
doing of his duety til the day of iudgement,
wherein the volumes of all mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shall be laid open: this is called a seared,
benummed or senselesse conscience: and
surely it is the most fearefull estate that any
man can be in, and yet it is a common thing,
for who seeth not how most men goe on
from day to day, euery man in his owne
sinfull waies, hauing no remorse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but put farre from themselues the euill
day, as if there were neither heauen nor
hell, and that God would neither doe good
nor euill? Lastly it may heere be asked,
whether this true testimony of an accusing
conscience, be a sinfull, or a lawfull action of
the minde. Whereunto we answere, that
whatsoeuer thing is holy, that is lawfull; for
this light of nature which is in the mind and
conscience, is a relique of the image of God
and of the same nature with it: and that the
sinne which the conscience doth truely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
doth no more make it impure, then
the guiltinesse of a fellon or traitour doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way touch him who giueth true testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of it.</p>

and motion of the minde,
which we call conscience,
hath place and force in the
faithfull, both in accusing
and also in excusing. For the
first, we know that the faithfull haue both
the true knowledge of sin, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
renouation of their mindes, and also
sin it selfe by the infirmitie of the flesh. And
therefore they haue an accusing conscience,
which is nothing else but the sight or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of sinne in themselues. Hereof follow
diuers effectes in them, as namely feare in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of those temporall punishments, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they by their sins haue layde themselues
open. Secondly an encrease of humiliation
in regard thereof. And lastly this accusing
conscience is as a bit to restraine the faithful
from sinne, checking them as it were in the
teeth with the iudgments of God, which
they doe by committing sin pull vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Thus we see what is the accusing
conscience of the faithfull: which then wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
when they fall by force of temptation
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7415:150"/>
into some greate sinne:<note place="margin">Of a renewed conscience.</note> otherwise it doth
not greatly vex and trouble them. Yet as
sinne is neuer wanting, so it is neuer alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
idle.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs consider the contrarie worke
of the conscience, excusing the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: the which it doth first in regard
both of their owne inherent righteousnesse,
and also of the imputed righteousnesse of
Christ. In the first respect their conscience
excuseth them, not as being perfectly iust,
but as those who are Gods faithfull seruants,
performing vnto him, tho imperfect, yet true,
vnfained and heartie obedience. Thus doth
the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> often in the psalmes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his innocencie and integritie to the triall
of God.</p>
                  <p>This excusing conscience dare not shewe
his face before the iudgment seate of God,
where it would be found as a filthie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
clout: but it commeth into the court of
Gods mercie and loue, who rewardeth the
Godlinesse of his seruants with temporall
blessinges, and security from temporall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But the true excusing conscience
loketh on the perfect righteousnes of Christ,
by vertue whereof it doth iustifie, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
the faithfull, as being fully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iust, and free from all guilt of sinne. This
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7415:150"/>
excuser is he who only can abide the triall of

Sathan, hell, death and damnation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenisheth
their heartes with such a perfect
peace, whereby they feele the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
euen whilst they liue vpon earth, wherof
whosoeuer hath once tasted, may counte
himselfe thrise happie. This kinde of excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
conscience commeth of a true faith, as
doth the former kinde of the other partes
of sanctification and of holinesse of life: the
one freeth the faithfull from the feare of
temporarie euils, as the other doth from the
feare of eternall death.</p>
                  <p>Of both of them ariseth the assurance of
saluation, which is the vndoubted perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and certaine knowledge of a faithfull man,
that he is one of those who shalbe made
partakers of eternall glorie. But against this
doctrine many do obiect &amp; say, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man to attaine to any such
knowledge, seing that the eternall counsels
and decrees of God are so secret, that no
man hath at any time knowen the minde of
God, or beene of his counsell in that behalf.
Againe that this knowledge is to be gotten,
if by any meanes, then either by immediate
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7415:151"/>
reuelation or by arguments drawen from
a mans owne estate, as from some fayth
or holinesse which he fyndeth in himselfe.
The first meanes is generallie reiected. The

Lastly that by this meanes there would
a dore be set open to all licentiousnesse &amp;
Godlesse securitie. For what neede he who
knoweth certainly that he shal be saued, take

and also that this knowledge is not gotten
by any immediate reuelation, yet affirming
that euery faithfull man may be, and ought
to be assured of his owne saluation and that
by that wounderfull worke of regeneration
wrought in him by the holy spirite: the
which doth euen leade the faithfull man
as it were by the hande into the secrete
counsell of GODS eternall election, and
doth there let him see (not the state of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men) but his owne name written in

                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 8.</note> Yea this is done not without good
cause. For the regeneration of this life and
the eternall glorie of the life to come, are
not two diuerse states or conditions, but
onely diuerse degrees of the same condition:
eternall saluation being nothing else, but
the perfection of holinesse and happinesse,
whereof the faithfull haue in this life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
some parte, as a pledge and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest-pennie
of the whole. So that they
hauing alreadie as we say, one foote in
heauen, and gotten possession of it, neede
not doubt of their saluation: but may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
say as it is, 1. <hi>Ioh. 3. 14. We knowe,</hi>
(not we hope or gresse) <hi>that we are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated</hi>
already (not that we shalbe hereafter)
<hi>from death to life</hi> (not by any immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation)
but <hi>because we loue the brethren:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 14</note>
that is, because we feele our selues endued
with renewed holinesse, whereof the loue
of the Godly is a notable part. And with
the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom. 8. 38. I am perswaded
that neither death nor life, neither Angels
nor principalities, neither thinges present nor
thinges to come can separate me from the loue
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7415:152"/>
of God in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be further obiected, that
although true regeneration be a certaine
signe and forerunner of saluation, yet it is
hard for a man to knowe whether his rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
be true, or onely a shadow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
which is often in the reprobate;
and although he haue true faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at one time, yet he may loose and
lack them at an other, and so dispossesse
himselfe of that estate of saluation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was. In both which respectes, <hi>He that
thinketh that he standeth, ought to feare least
he fall,</hi> rather then to boast of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his saluation. We answere that true
regeneration is not so small a matter, neither
maketh so light a chaunge in a man, but
that it may be plainely discerned where it
is present. Neither is it any vncertaine thing
which may be lost, but wheresoeuer it is,
there it doth euidently appeare at one time
or at an other: and where it once appeareth
there it alwaies abideth. For regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being a totall and a supernaturall change
of the minde, will, affections, thoughtes,
wordes and dedes of a man, cannot be hid
or doubtfull for any long time, but will
shewe it selfe both to the eyes of other men,
and much more to the conscience of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7415:152"/>
himselfe.<note place="margin">Of a renewed conscience &amp; of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of saluation.</note> For all though it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
often to passe, that the infirmities and
sinnes appeareing in the life of a faithfull
man, make the sinceritie of his religion
doubtfull to others; yet he himselfe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the inwarde worke and motions of
Gods spirite, is vndoubtedly perswaded
that he is the childe of God. We confesse
that a man truly regenerate may haue his
faith sore shaken, and the holinesse of his
life greatly blemished by the force of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
and so may for a time want in part or
wholly this assurance of saluation. Yet this
doth not hinder him from hauing it at an
other time, yea all the daies of his life, as
may be seene in most of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Lastly we are not to thinke that this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of saluation is, or can be to a faithfull
man a motiue to sinne, and dissolutenesse
of life, with the which it cannot stand. For
as it is gotten by holynesse, whereby a man
seeth that he is endued with the spirite
of God, and effectuallie called to beleeue
the Gospell, so it is lost by a sinfull and
wicked life, the which sheweth plainlie
that a man is destitute of true faith and of
Gods spirite, for by the fruite the tree is
knowen: nay there is nothing of greater
froce in restraining the faithfull from sinne
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7415:153"/>
then this that they knowe that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of any one wilfull sinne doth
wound their owne consciences, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
this notable treasure of assurance of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
For as he that taketh one or a fewestones
out of a wall, although he doe not
ouerthrow the building, yet he maketh it
the weaker; so a fewe sinfull actions in the
life of a faithfull man, although they can
not depriue him of this assuraunce, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bene gathered, and as it were builded
vp with the holinesse of many yeares, yet
they doe diminishe it, and can not but
trouble his conscience.</p>

giue the saide knowledge backe againe to

so that the memory is the storehouse of the

are carefully laide vp, and faithfullie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
and as it were, the register of the

commeth into it. This facultie as all the

so perfect and of such strength, as
that by it man might at any time call to
minde, not euerie trifling thing which he
had heard and seene a thousand yeares past,
(for so his memorie shoulde haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded

vnto him by God, or was conceaued
by his naturall faculties, if so be it were a
matter of any importance, the knowing

some notable vse and profite vnto him. As
for other common matters of life, which
it was more gaine to loose then to keepe,
in these, humaine infirmitie preuailed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>For we are not to thinke, that man was
in this respect or any other as God is, whose
nature being euerie way infinite, doth in
one moment, and with one motion of mind,

doth thinke of all thinges together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Christian to keepe carefully in his memory
whatsoeuer thing he hath seene, hearde or
red, which is of any moment for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

                  <p>As first and chiefly the whole scripture:
not the wordes or syllables of it, (as do the
Iewes, who greatly brag of their cunning
in this behalfe, as knowing how oft euerie
worde is in the olde testament) for that is
and endlesse labour and impossible, but the
chiefe precepts and examples contained in
it, the which may easely be brought to passe
by the daily reading, hearing, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
of some part of it. Secondly he ought
to keepe in memory all the actions of God
which he himselfe or any other hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

iudgements vpon sinners, his prouidence

ought to vse all those helpes, which are of
force for the deep imprinting of these things
in his mind: as namely the daily remembring
of them, the applying of them to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

for so they will be made familiar vnto him,

there is an other kinde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called practicall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are exercised in action, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are in contemplation. This latter kinde
is necessarilie in regard of the perfection
of mans soule added to the former, that as
by the one he seeth &amp; knoweth what ought
to be done, so by the other he might moue
himselfe to the doing &amp; performing of it. For
howsoeuer they be ioyned to the other, not
as superiours in authoritie, for they are blinde
of themselues, and therefore must not leade
the way, or sit at the helme: nor as equals,
for so there might discorde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
be raised in the soule of man; but
as inferiours to be guided and gouerned by
the light of the minde: yet if we speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
we must confesse that all the outward
actions come directly from them, and not
from the other. Whereby it may be easelie
gathered that these practicall faculties, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7415:158"/>
the greatest stroke in our actions,<note place="margin">Of the created holinesse of the will.</note> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
in them a greate part of mans holinesse,
and that whereon all the rest doth depend.
For the will, which is the chiefe of these
practicall faculties, compelleth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the bodie to any action, but cannot
be compelled by the minde. For a man doth
this or that thing, not because he thinketh
that it ought to be done, but because he will
do it; so that the will is the absolute monarch
in aman, and the minde is his wise counseller,
to whome, although this monarch ought
to yeelde, and in some fort to obey, yet he
neede not except he list; For he hauing the
whole authoritie in his owne handes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be compelled by any.</p>
                  <p>The holinesse of these practicall faculties,
which is vsuallie in the scripture called loue,
is their due subiection to the faculties of the
mind, whereby they are moued to the doinge
of those things only, which the minde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
or rather counselleth. For although
in the corrupt state of man, the holinesse of
these faculties cannot be defined by their
conformitie to the minde, which being it
selfe sinfull and out of order, cannot be a
rule of holinesse to any other part, yet in
this state of innocenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, the minde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
nothing as good to these facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7415:158"/>
but that which is indeede good, and
to be imbraced by them.</p>
                  <p>These practicall faculties are of two sorts,
to wit, the will and the affections. First
of the will, then of the affection. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this facultie of mans soule called the
will, although it be proper to reasonable
things (for a reasonable will cannot be seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from a reasonable minde) yet there is a
resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it in all those creatures, which
being indued with sense, haue by it a naturall
appetite choosing one thing and refusing an
other, the which may fitly be called a brutish
will. And therefore that we may the more
plainlie see what force this facultie hath in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
we will consider &amp; define it in generall, as it
agreeth both to reasonable and to vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
things, &amp; that in this manner: Will is the
free inclination of any thing (which hath in
it selfe the whole fountaine of naturall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to that which is apparently good &amp; agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the owne nature. Frst we say that will
is an inclination: for the proper action of it, is
to bende the thing wherein it is to that thing
which it liketh: wherein is contained or rather
insinuated vnto vs, the contrarie action of the
will, which is to withdraw the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is, from that thing which it dislik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Secondly this inclination is free, that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7415:159"/>
is, it commeth of the thing it selfe, and is
not extorted by any outward force: for
although the will be stirred vp, and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by motiues both inward and outward:
yet it cannot be compelled, compulsion
and willingnesse being contrarie each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If any man do here obiect, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
are constrained by force to doe that which
is sore against their willes: We answere, that
the outward action may be constraned, but
not the will: for violence may make one
do that which he is vnwilling to doe, but
it cannot make him willing to do that which
he is vnwilling to do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly we are to consider what thinges
maybe said to haue wil, not stocks or stones,
but onely those which haue in them life
and motion: neither all such thinges, but
onely those which hauing in themselues
the wholle fountaine of motion doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
liue and moue. For trees haue life
and motion, but not will; because their life
&amp; motion is imperfect not comming whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of any facultie and vertue inherent in
themselues, but depending of some other
outward force: Whereof it commeth that
their motion is not free but forced: for the
motion or action of a tree in bringing
forth fruite, commeth not wholly from it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7415:159"/>
selfe, but chiefely from the Sunne, the heat
whereof forceth the tree to turne the
moisture of the earth into leaues, flowers,
and fruite. But it is farre otherwise with
beastes, birdes, and all thinges which haue
sense in them. For these haue perfect life,
and motion, hauing within themselues
the whole fountaine, beginning, abilitie
and facultie of motion, not depending on
any other outwarde thinge, but being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in themselues, do moue and performe
all naturall actions of themselues. And
therefore being free from all outward force,
may either doe or not doe, moue or rest,
go or stand, eate or drinke, goe hither or
thither when themselues list. As when
a birde flyeth toward the east, rather then
towarde the west, it is not blowen that
way by force of the winde, but caried by
the proper and free inclination of it selfe.
But when it being taken is caried vp and
downe in a mans hand, this motion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not from it selfe, but from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not of inherent will, but of outward
violence and compulsion. Againe man
hath will, because he is of perfect life and
motion, hauing in himselfe the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of action and power of mouing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
without the helpe of any other thing,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7415:160"/>
and therefore he also can sitte downe or
rise vp, speake, laugh, go about this or
that businesse or worke, thinke of this or
that thing, as he himselfe listeth and is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
Thirdly the Angels both good and
euill haue will, for they are natures of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
life and motion, in that they haue in
themselues the wholle fountaine of motion
and therefore they are free in all their natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
actions.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see what creatures haue free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will:
where we are to thinke that this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of will, is as great in the least and
weakest of these creatures, as in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test;
in a sely flie, as in a man or Angel. If
any man do heare obiect that all creatures
moue in God, and without him are not
able to doe any thing: We answere that
God hath put into euerie creature a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertue and power of doing all thinges
belonging to it selfe, by the which, being
not withdrawen or hindered by God, the
creature: is able to performe all naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
without any extraordinarie helpe
from God: as when any creature doth this
or that thing, the action commeth of it
selfe, in that the facultie of performing
it is inherent in it selfe, and yet the same
action commeth from God. But ro retourne
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7415:160"/>
to the matter. Lastly, God hath will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is such a nature, as hath in it selfe
the whole fountaine of perfect motion, yea
that which is the fountaine of all fountains,
and therefore he doth al things of his
own free will, the which differeth from the
will of the creatures, as in other respectes,
so also in that it cannot be hindred by any
force, but can hinder the will of any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
as we knowe that God brideleth the
will, euen of the deuill and his Angels, the
which otherwise are mightie creatures.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the subiect of will: now
we come to the obiect of it, or that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the will of any thinge inclineth. First
therefore the will of any thing inclineth
it selfe to that which is good, and in any
respect conuenient, pleasant, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as we knowe that euerie thinge doth
abhor and decline from that which is any
way euill, hurtfull, daungerous, grieuous,
inconuenient, and vnprofitable. Yet the
will doth not incline it selfe to any good,
but onelie to that which is apparantly good:
for although the will of God inclineth
alwaies to that onely, which is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and in trueth, because he cannot be
deceaued in any thing, yet the creature
doth often thinke euill to be good, and good
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7415:161"/>
euill, and so abhorreth that which is good,
and inclineth to that which is in trueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
yet good in shewe and appearance.
Lastly not any apparant good is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of the will, but that which euery thing
thinketh to be good for it selfe: for a man
doth not incline himselfe to that, which he
thinketh to be good for a beast, vnlesse he
thinke it good for himselfe also. Yea eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing followeth the naturall disposition
of it selfe, desiring those thinges onely
which are agreeable to the owne nature.</p>
                  <p>Thus much ingenerall of will: the which
is of two kindes, brutishe, and reasonable,
the which hath place in all those natures,
which are inducd with reason, as namely
in God, in Angels, and in man. But to
let passe the will of God, and of Angels,
as being no part of the matter in hand, we
are to consider the created holinesse of mans
will, which is the inclination of man onely
to that which is truely good: Or thus, The
due subiection or obedience of the will to
a holy and cleare minde, shewing without
any errour good and euill: or more breifly,
The conformitie of mans inclination to his
knowledge, or of mans will to Gods will.
For then this facultie is perfectly holy, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it chooseth for action those thinges
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7415:161"/>
which the minde iudgeth good, right,
lawfull, and agreeable to the will of God:
and contrarily reiecteth and refuseth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it saieth to be euill, vnlawfull and
forbidden: and lastly when as touching those
thinges, which are not as yet fully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the minde, to be either good or
bad, conuenient or inconuenient, to be
done or to be left vndone, it staieth it selfe
in the middest, not inclining to the one or
to the other.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see what was the actuall will
of man, euen his full inclination to good.
But there was another will in him, which
we may call potentiall, as hath beene said
that man hath both an actuall and a potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
vnderstanding: this potentiall will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Freewill, is the power which
man had of inclining his will, eyther to
good or to euill: Or more briefly, The pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of willing eyther of good or euill. It
may be made plaine in this manner. Suppose
a man to beare good will to his friend, and
a loyall and duetifull affection to his prince,
as many do, this is his actual wil: But againe,
that man may change his will, and become
altogether disloyall to his prince, and a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his friend: this is his possible and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall
will. So man inclineth really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7415:162"/>
onely to good, but in possibility eyther
to good or euill. Yet not equally, but more
to good then to euill, as he that nowe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his friend, although heereafter he
may loue or hate him, yet it is liker that he
will loue then hate him. That this potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
will was in man, we neede not prooue
by argumentes, being sufficiently prooued
alreadie by the euent it selfe, and the woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
experience of man-kind, the which by
the meanes of his potential wil, hath lost that
holy, and happie estate, wherein it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For man being enabled by God to will
either good or euil, &amp; being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by
God to wil good only, did chose rather to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his own peruerse &amp; sinfull desire in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
euil, then to obey the will of God in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
good. If any man doe aske why God did
put into man this potential, doubtful and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
will, seing that if he had bene crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without it, he had beene sure from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
being actually and immutably disposed
to good. To this we answere, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we ought
to rest contented in the will of God, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well of all his doings, although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see, or giue any reason of the same. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that man could not haue beene cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
without his potentiall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will? for so his
nature should haue beene vncapable of sin.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7415:162"/>
For if his will had beene inclined to good
actually and immutably, it coulde neuer
haue bene inclined to euil, &amp; so he could not
possibly haue committed sin, because of the
want of the free and potentiall will. But he
by whome this doubt was propounded, will
maruaile to heare that brought against his
opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he did alledge as the onely
reason and strength of it: and that any man
should thinke freewill to haue beene need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the state of innocency, because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it man could not haue sinned, when as
he thinketh that it might very well haue
beene spared for that cause: seeing that as
sinne it selfe, whereby Gods glory is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured,
and mans happinesse vtterly lost,
so all the meanes, occasions, and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of it ought by al meanes to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
To this reply we make this answere,
that Gods glory is impaired much by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of sinne, but much more by this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
impossibility of committing sinne:
for immutability, and vncapablenesse of
sinne, are a great part of his glory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
attributes of his diuine essence, and
therefore they cannot without the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
of God be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as touching man himselfe,
(whose patrone although he yeeld to this,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7415:163"/>
yet he thinketh it impossible to be proued,
that this impossibility of sinning is not good
and profitable for man) what reason is it,
that his good shoulde not giue place to
Gods glory, for the which he was created,
seeing that the wanting of potentiall wil, and
the impossibility of sinning arising thereof,
doe directly obscure the glory of God, but
not necessarily hinder the happinesse of
man? who cannot thinke that GOD
doth eyther compell, or any way cause
him to sinne, in that he hath made it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him to sinne? But what will be saide
for this impossibility of sinning, if so be it be
found hurtful to man himselfe, as it is indeed,
as will easely appeare to him who conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that it depriueth man, not onely of all
praise and commendation (which being
receiued at the handes of God, is not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be esteemed by man, who thinketh it
a great matter, <hi>Laudari a laudato,</hi> to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a worthy man) but also of holinesse
it selfe. For what is more ridiculous, then
that man should looke for any commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for not sinning, when as he coulde not
so much as be willing to sinne, seeing that
the brute beastes, yea stockes and stones
in the which there is no sinne, nor shaddow
of any, may as iustly looke for praise in that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7415:163"/>
respect, or for performing positiue dueties of
holinesse, comming not of a willing and
ready minde which God regardeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of
necessity and constraint, and as the due
praise of holinesse, so also holinesse it selfe is
taken away by this impossible possibillity of
sinning, for nothing can properly be said to
be the subiect of holinesse, which naturally
may not become sinfull; as nothing is saide
to haue life, or sight, which may not become
dead or blind. And therefore we doe not
say that stones and brute beastes, haue in
them any holinesse, because they cannot
haue sinfulnesse which is the priuation of it.</p>
                  <p>How then will this curious questionarie
say, can the holy Angels fall from God, and
doe ye make the nature of God a fit harbour
of sinfulnesse? not so neither, but we say
that God is not properly the subiect of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
(although it hath pleased him to set
foorth his incomprehensible nature to our
capacity, by taking to himselfe this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
attributes of the creature) for God is
the rule of holinesse, and any thing is then
truely holy, whenas it obeyeth the will and
commaundements of God: but we cannot
in proper speech say, that God eyther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
or obeyeth himselfe, as for the
holy Angels, they retaine as all the rest of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7415:164"/>
their natural faculties wherewith they were
indued in their first creation, so also this free
and potentiall will: &amp; if it be possible that
any of those which doe now keep their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in holines &amp; happines, should fall from
God; yet this is to be ascribed, not to any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
impossibility of sinning, which is not
to be admitted or supposed in any creature,
no not in the humane nature of Christ, to the
which the sinne of mankind could not haue
beene imputed, if it had beene naturally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of sin) but to the loue and grace of
God, who doth continue &amp; vphold them in
their holy state, not by mangling their nature
and detracting any natural faculty, as poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
will, or any other: but by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming their
actuall will in the natural inclination of it to
good onelie. Lastlie this natural impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of sinning, would make man either a
God, as hath beene said: or which is liker, a
senselesse stocke, not hauing in himselfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
life, &amp; the full power of mouing himself.
For how can we suppose that <hi>Adam</hi> shoulde
haue been created a liuing and a reasonable
creature, &amp; not to haue beene able to will, &amp;
to eate the forbidden fruit, or to do any other
thing incident into his nature? If it be saide,
that God might haue confirmed him with
his grace; We answere, that that is true, but
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7415:164"/>
he neither was bound to doe it, neither did,
or could thinke man worthy of more grace,
who did abuse so many and so excellent
graces as he had by nature.</p>

the practicall faculties, which by their

cannot but lead man into the pit of
sinne, and of eternall destruction.</p>
                  <p>But let vs consider these practicall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in particular, first the will, then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
As all the other faculties of man,
so also the will hath lost the created holines,
and what maruaile is it, that the will it selfe
is sinfull, seeing by it all the other faculties of
mans soule and body were made sinfull? Yea
it is more sinfull then the former faculties,
and so is iustly punished, for being the cause
of mans sinfulnesse: for it doth more, (if
more can be) abhorre and refuse good, then
the minde is ignorant of it. The meanes
whereby the will became sinfull, was the
owne default: for it being created by God,
actually onely good, and potentially more
good then euill, did by refusing good and
choosing euill, make it selfe for euer vnable
eyther to choose good, or to refuse euill: and
that by continuing in that wrong way,
wherein it had made one step in choosing
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7415:165"/>
forbidden fruit, and by adding one degree of
peruersnesse to another, till at length it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
habituall and naturall to it.</p>
                  <p>The sinfulnesse of mans will in this his
corrupt state, is the actuall and potentiall
inclination of it only to euill. This definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
needeth some explication and proofe, it
being greatly controuerted and oppugned
by many, who as if they were not of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie
of <hi>Adam,</hi> thinke that his fall doth not
belong vnto them: neither hath taken from
them the created holinesse of will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they affirme and defend, that the will
of man euen in this corrupt estate, is, if not
actually inclined to good, yet so free that it
may of it selfe incline it selfe and the whole
man either to euill, whereof no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or yet to good, wherein the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
standeth. But this opinion is not to
be receiued, for it is an enimie both to gods
glorie, in that it taketh a way the superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
worke of his spirite in regenerating
the faithfull, and ascribeth the saluation of
man, not to the loue, mercie and power of
God, but to the naturall faculties and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
strength of man: and also to the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome it deceaueth with a vaine
shew of conuersion, faith and holinesse. And
therefore that the truth of this matter may
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7415:166"/>
appeare. We will first set downe the state of
it, by shewing what is good and euill, and
what it is to haue freewill in regard of both (or
rather) either of good or euill.</p>
                  <p>Good therefore is to be defined by God: who
only is good &amp; therfore the only rule of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
for whatsoeuer in the creature is agreeable
to the goodnesse of God, that is straigth &amp;
good; as whatsoeuer is disagreeing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, is
crooked &amp; euill. Yet this goodnesse of God is
not that which is essentiall to his nature, and
cannot be comprehended by anie creature,
but a finite, created, and accidentall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which God hath put into euerie one of
his creaturs, as a shadow of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Now in man this goodnesse is his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and happinesse not deuised by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but appointed by God, and reuealed
in his word. Contrarilie, euill is the sinfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and wretchednesse of man: yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it haue neuer so greate an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of goodnes, holines &amp; happinesse, yet if
it be not that holinesse and happinesse which
is agreeable to the will of God, it is euil, sin &amp;
misery: This goodnes is the obiect of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wil
or the thing wherevnto he enclineth himselfe
who in the state of innocencie had power to
will &amp; choose true goodnes; yea he did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
choose it, being in all his thoughtes,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7415:166"/>
wordes, deedes, faculties, and in his whole
nature and state, made by his owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
conformable to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>But as touching the will or proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of man in this his corrupt state, we do
vtterly denie that he is able by any naturall
facultie in himselfe, by anie imagining,
inuenting, or discoursing; by anie wit, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
learning, reading, or knowledge;
by any good education, instruction and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise:
or ingenerall by anie meanes that a
naturall man can vse, or that all the men or
Angels in the world can vse in his behalfe
(without the supernaturall worke of Gods
spirit changing his nature) to incline him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to that which is good, that is, to that
holinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and happinesse which is agreeable
to the will of God. Or more plainly, he
cannot say thus with himselfe and doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
This is the true and only happinesse
appointed by God for man: This holinesse
is the only way which God hath appointed,
that man should walke in, as in the way lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that happinesse: This is the onlie happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which I do of my selfe propound to my
selfe, &amp; that in this way of true holines I will
walk all the daies of my life: I will by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall
studying and hearing the word, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
my owne desires, and auoiding all
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7415:167"/>
occasions of sinne, and by such meanes as
I can vse, get the true and sound knowledge
of God, true faith, and hope of eternall
glorie, and of the resurrection of the deade,
true repentance, mortification of sin, and
of all my corrupt affections, yea an vnfained
loue of God and of all goodnesse, and in
summe all the spirituall graces which are
the partes of mans holinesse, and the means of
saluation. This I haue resolued with my selfe
to doe, not that I thinke that I am able to
attaine the perfection of these things, but
yet my whole will, inclination, affection,
desire, care, studie, indeauour and labour
shalbe set on these things. This is to haue
free will to good, not for a man to say, I
desire to be a holy man, and to be in heauen
after this life, but to incline and bende his
wholle bodie, soule, and all the faculties of
them both to holy and heauenly things.
The which thing is as impossible for a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

                  <p>Besides this euident voice of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(the authoritie whereof ought to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
without any other proofe) we see this
error of freewill to be plainly confuted by
the experience of all times and places. For if
man were by nature free to choose either
good or euill, why shoulde not the choyse
of good, of holinesse, and of the way which
leadeth to saluation, be, if not as common
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7415:168"/>
as the other yet a very common and ordinary
matter. But we see, that of the naturall
men which haue liued, and doe liue in the
worlde, not one of a thousand haue once
set foote in the right way of regeneration
and saluation. And no maruaile, for howe
shoulde a man choose that as the onely good,
which he did neuer knowe, and whereof
he neuer dreamed or hearde? in the which
state all men are by nature, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant of the true God, his worde,
worshippe, and religion, and so hauing
no meanes of knowledge, but their owne
senses, which doe reiect that God, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
and religion, which is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the iudgement thereof, the which
doth plainely shewe the impossibilitie of
this freedome of will. For nothing hath
freewill to that which is against the nature
of it, as God hath not freewill to euil, a
man to flie, a horse to speake.</p>
                  <p>If it be obiected that a man may haue a
desire, inclination, and will, to that which is
impossible for him to doe and accomplishe:
We aunswere that this is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For when we deny that there is in
man any freedome of will to good, we doe
not deny that a carnall man may wish that
he were holy and happie, but that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7415:168"/>
accomplishe or begin the worke of his
regeneration and saluation. The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and working of grace, commeth
from the will, which is the fountaine of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
enclining men with all the faculties
of soule and body to any thinge. Now rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is a thing contrary to the corrupt
nature of man, for that faith and humaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
do fight together, no lesse then doe wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and foolishnes.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 18.</note> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. And so in
all the other partes of holinesse.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed also by continuall and
daily experience. For if regeneration were
agreeable to mans nature, it woulde be
common and ordinarie, whereas it is and
alwaies hath bene a rare miracle, not to be
founde among many thousandes of men.
Nay which is more, men doe neither of
themselues and their owne inclination seeke
after it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can by any meanes which they
can vse be brought vnto it. In other studies,
faculties, and exercises men doe daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and go forwarde; none being so dull
and blockish, but that he may with paines
in continuaunce of time be brought to
knowledge. But no paines, no time, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of giftes in the minister can make
men religious, or to be endued with
the true knowledge and obedience of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7415:169"/>
God. Yea for the most part the more that
men are taught religion, the more bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
and backwarde they become, and so
continue all their life time. We confesse,
that God doth sometime bestow on car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and reprobate men spirituall graces,
yea a shadowe of regeneration, whereby
both the mindes of men are inlightned to see
the trueth, and also their wils and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
lightly enclined to loue and embrace
it. As we are to declare in the last part of
this treatise. But this chaunge commeth not
of man but from God: neither is it an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
and totall inclination to good,
and therefore not that which is ment in this
question of freewill.</p>
                  <p>But the maintainers of freewill will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
yeeld to this, that no man can choose
the right way before he doe deliberate of
it, and that nothing is deliberated of which
is not first knowen. And therefore that
freewill is not actually in an ignorant man,
but being as it were fettered and chained
by ignoraunce, is stirred vp and set loose by
the knowledge of the worde of God, with
the which whosoeuer is endued, hauing
the right and the wrong way propounded
vnto him by the preaching of the gospell,
the same man hath freedome of will, either
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7415:169"/>
to choose or to refuse eternall saluation
with the meanes of it, yea although he haue
not as yet any supernaturall grace bestowed
on him. To this we answere, confessing
that the true illumination of the minde can
not be seuered from freedome of will, but
yet that neither the one nor the other can
be attained vnto by the naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the will: who although he may by
naturall meanes get a superficiall, and as
it is vsually called, an historicall knowledge
of all the pointes of religion, yet is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to gette any such true
knowledge, as will be effectuall to moue
his will in the choyse of good. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
many carnall men seeme to haue
a great measure of diuine knowledge, yet
they are farre from being firmly grounded
in the trueth, but doe make a faire shew of
religion, faith and holinesse, whenas their
heartes are full of Atheisme, vnbeleife and
all sinfulnesse, in the which (for the most
part) they are more wilfull, stubborne and
desperate, then they who are altogether
voide of knowledge. Neither indeede is
it any maruaile, that a naturall man should
be vnable to resist and offer violence to
his nature, to denie himselfe and all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasures, to forsake his sinnes which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7415:170"/>
are more pleasant to him then life it selfe,
and all for hope of eternall saluation, whereof
he neither seeth any probability for the time
present, nor can haue any certainty, and
assuraunce for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>If it be here asked what shoulde be the
hinderaunce, why man being now sinfull
cannot as well enclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> himselfe to good, as
he being innocent did choose euill, and
so returne to his first state by the same way,
whereby he fell from it? We answere, that
as a man hauing his sight and life, hath in
his owne power either to keepe them, or
to spoile himselfe of them, by putting out
his eyes, and by killing himselfe: yet after
that he is blinde and deade, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to take againe vnto himselfe his sight
and life: so man being in his innocency en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with spirituall life, and a ready incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to all good, had power to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in that estate, if he had so thought good:
but after that he had once by freedome of
will, lost the goodnesse of his will, and
wholly depriued himselfe of the spirituall
life of holinesse, he coulde not being
nowe deade in sinne restore himselfe to the
state of life. And therefore he hath no
more power of choosing good, then a dead
man wanting the fountaine of motion, is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7415:170"/>
able to mooue himselfe about any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>If it be further asked, why the word of God
biddeth men beleeue, forsake their sinnes,
turne themselues to God, repent, be holy,
refuse euill and choose the good, if so be
they are by nature altogether vnable to do
any of these things, or how that men can
be iustly blamed, or condemned for not
doing that which is not incident into their
nature, neither possible to be performed
by any naturall man: and lastly why men
shoulde trouble themselues in vsing the
meanes of attaining to regeneration &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
seeing that all their labour is in vaine
without the supernaturall worke of God, and
not rather sit still and expect the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lord wil change their natures, &amp; make
them capable of holinesse. We answere in
one word to all these doubtes: that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bidding men to choose good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
holy, doth commaund nothing but
that which is in their power to do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not meane that men should goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to change their owne corrupt natures,
and indue themselues with spirituall graces:
but onely that they should be carefull in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the meanes of holinesse, as namely, the
abstaining from those sinnes whereunto they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7415:171"/>
are giuen, the auoyding of the occasions of
them, the hearing of the word of God, &amp; the
doing of whatsoeuer is effectuall for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and may be done by an vnregenerate
man: but whenas men are altogether care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of their owne saluation, contemning
the word of God and all other meanes of
it, yea adding one measure of sinfulnesse to
an other, who can deny, but that they make
themselues subiect to the iust sentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
damnation? And therefore this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
impotency of will, which is in man, ought
not to make any man cease from vsing the
meanes of saluation: for howsoeuer it be
impossible for him or any other creature to
change his owne heart and nature, yet he
shall finde God to be ready and neare at
hand to all those that call vpon him, and
neuer to be wanting for his part.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth that we doe briefly shewe,
what liberty and ability of will is remaining
in man in this corrupt state, wherein if he
haue no will, he hath not in him the whole
fountaine of life &amp; motion, and so he is no
man, yea in truth worse then any brute beast:
&amp; if he haue a will, it is eyther a free will or
else no will, yet this freedome of will is not
indefinite, neyther doth it make him omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
&amp; therefore we are to see how farre
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7415:171"/>
it reacheth. For the knowledge whereof,
we are to distinguish betwixt the natures of
thinges indifferent, and of those which are
simplie good or euill. In the first kinde we
are to recken all common actions, as to eat,
to drinke, to mary, to sleepe, to build, to
plough, to learne, to teach, to study, to
speake, to thinke, and all other thinges of
the same kind, which are neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nor forbidden in the word of God. In
all these man hath freewill, being able of
himselfe to incline himselfe, to the doing or
not doing of any of them, as daily experience
doth plainely prooue. But it is not so with
him in the other kinde of thinges, eyther in
choosing good or in reiecting euill, yet he
hath some freedome in these thinges also:
first of good, then of euill.</p>
                  <p>In the good thinges we are to consider
the outward action and the inward grace, in
the outward action, a carnall man hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
being able to encline himselfe to the
doing or not doing of it. For example a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man may heare the word of God, or
not heare, worship God, or not worshippe
him, relieue the necessities of the Church,
or not doe it, suffer martyrdome for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the gospell, or performe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
action of any christian duety: but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7415:172"/>
as touching the inward grace, it is not in
his power to get it, but only to leaue it. As he
cannot indue his owne mind with the true
knowledge of God, with the feare of God,
with the loue of the godly: and therefore his
outward action is but a painted sheath or
sepulcher, not effectuall to his owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yea in trueth not to be esteemed good.
Againe, an vnregenerate man may of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
seeke and get inward graces, as some
knowledge of God, iustice, temperance, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
patience, and such other: Yet this
doth not make him to haue freewil to good:
for first in the question of freewill, this word
Good signifieth not any one, or a fewe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
graces or actions, but a generall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
effectuall for happinesse. Secondlie,
these giftes although they be partes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
holinesse in the beleeuer, in whome
they spring from the roote of a true faith:
yet in an vnbeleeuing &amp; vnregenerate man
they are not spirituall graces, but naturall
giftes, vnable eyther to sanctifie or to saue
him that hath them. Thus much of doing
good.</p>
                  <p>Likewise in the committing of euil, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man hath freewill not onely to doe it,
but also to leaue it vndone; for he may sinne
if he will, and he neede not except he list.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7415:172"/>
Of the first no man euer doubted, but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
needeth to be explaned in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
As good, so also euill is of two kindes,
inward, and outward: the inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sin cannot be auoyded by any means:
for beside the originall sinne which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the regenerate, and to the carnall
man, it is impossible that the inward faculties
of a carnall man should be free from actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sinfulnesse, dulnesse, ignorance, obliuion,
and peruersenesse, and therefore in regarde
of this inward corruption of the faculties of
the soule man hath no freewill, but sinneth
of necessity. Againe his outward sinnes are
of two sortes, the one is of those which are
sinnes not in their owne nature, but as they
come from the inward roote of infidelity, as
namely, all the indifferent actions of a carnall
man, his eating, drinking, speaking, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
buying, selling, and all other of that
kinde. Yea his good actions, as namely, his
hearing Gods word, his praying, his giuing
of almes, his temperate, honest and iust
actions; all these are sinnes in the sight of
God. And therefore the carnall man hath
not freewill in this kind of outward actions.
For whatsoeuer he doth it is a sinne, and if
he doe nothing, yet that his doing nothing
is sinfull, yet in particulars he hath freewill,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7415:173"/>
or liberty of not sinning, for although he
cannot but sin in euery thing that he doth,
yet it is in his freewill whether he will doe
that indifferent thing or no, and so whether
he will sinne in that particular or no, as
namely, a carnall man purposeth to builde
a house: if he doe it, he cannot choose
but sinne, because he cannot purge
himselfe from infidelity, yet he neede not
sinne in that particular except he list, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he neede not build the house except
he list.</p>
                  <p>The second kinde of outward sinnes, is of
those which are sinnes in their owne nature,
as being directy forbidden in the moral law,
as idolatry, periury, murther, adultery, theft,
&amp; such other: in the committing whereof, a
carnall man hath freewill, it being not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that he should commit them, as we see
in many vnregenerate men, whose outward
liues are irreprouable: for the inward force
of originall corruption, &amp; of corrupt desires
enclining the will to sinne, doth not make
any necessitie of any particular sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they may be repressed by naturall
strength and hindred, although not from
breaking foorth into any sinne, yet from
bringing forth this or that particular sin. For
whenas a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth adultery, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7415:173"/>
he doth it of a free, although a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
will, and not of any force or necessitie.
Thus we see in how manie respects the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of will remaineth, the which being
not distinguished from a true and generall
good, consisting in holinesse and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
haue beene the occasion of manie
errors in this point of doctrine, whilst many
haue thought that either a man hath freewil
by nature, or els he is able by learning and
knowledge to get an artificiall freedome of
will, and that in the worke of regeneration,
the will worketh together which grace, if
not strongly, yet weakly and faintly, as we
see a sicke man goeth about his businesse,
but the word of God teacheth vs to thinke
the will of man not only weake, but cleane
dead in respect of true holines, as hath beene
declared, and that an vnregenerate man is
no more able of himselfe to enter and goe
on in the way of godlynesse, then a deade
man is able to goe about the affaires of this
temporall life.</p>

mightie operation thereof, doth change
him into a new creature, taking from him
the dulnesse and ignorance of his minde,
the vntowardnesse of his wil and affections,
and enduing him with the contrarie graces.
This change is wholly to be ascribed to this
supernaturall working of the spirite, and
not in anie respect to the naturall force
of mans will: who howsoeuer perhappes
he before his conuersion, vsing the outward
meanes of regeneration and saluation, may

                     </gap> desire holinesse, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life: yet he is no more able to work
it by himselfe, then he was in his creation
able to take to himselfe created holinesse,
before the same were inspired into him by
God. For the will of man, as also all the
rest of his faculties, is not an agent or worker
in this action, but only doth suffer the worke
of the holie spirit, to whome it is as easie to
sanctifie the will of that man, who abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and detesteth all the outward meanes
of holinesse, as of him that is so carefull and
diligent in vsing them, that he might seeme
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7415:174"/>
to haue chaunged his owne will from euill
to good. This we see in the conuersion of
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> whose will being most
spitefully bent against the Gospell, was in
one moment chaunged to the true loue of
it.</p>
                  <p>But how is the will after this worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation?
Is it as idle and vnable to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing as before? Or is it now able of it
selfe without the immediate worke of Gods
spirite, to choose and doe good? We answere,
that although the holy spirite of God doth
neuer forsake him, whome he hath once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
but doth to the ende of his life, yea
for euer accompanie and assist him, yet there
is a greate difference to be put betwixt the
first act of regeneration, and the continual
course of renewed holynesse arising there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For a carnall man is renewed by the sole
worke of the spirite of God, without any
helpe, action or motion of his owne will (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we will say that it moueth, in that
it is moued) but a faithfull man being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
regenerated doth choose, imbrace, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and do good, and performe all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of renewed holinesse by the proper and
inherent facultie and motion of his owne
freewill. That the renewed holinesse of the
will, and of all the other faculties of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7415:175"/>
man, are proper and inherent in him no
man can doubt: for his knowledge of God,
and his inclination to good, although it were
wrought in them by the holy spirit, yet it is
not the proper holinesse of the holy spirite,
whose holinesse is perfect, infinite, vncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and essentiall, but this holinesse of the
faithfull man, is vnperfect, finite, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall:
not inherent in the nature of the
holy spirite, which is not capable of it, but
in the naturall faculties of the faithfull man.
Yea this holinesse is now made naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, for although it be contrarie to his
corrupt nature, yet it is agreeable to his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and renewed nature. So that the first
renewing of holinesse is a supernaturall,
miraculous, vnknowen and diuine worke:
But the continuall vsing of it is an ordinary
euident, and a humaine action. For as in the
first creation of man, it was a maruaile to see
a sensible lumpe of red earth turned into a
liuing and reasonable man, hauing free will
to doe either good or euill, but after that
man was once created, it was noe maruaile
to see him vse those faculties which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from God: So in his second creation,
it is as greate wonder to see a blockishe, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
froward, corrupt, sinfull, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man to become pure, holy, and heauenly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7415:175"/>
in al the faculties of soul &amp; body, but after that
he is renewed &amp; sanctified, it is no maruaile
to see him choose and doe newe and holy
actions. And therefore we are not to thinke,
that the holy spirite worketh the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
course of holines in the faithful, as in stocks
or trees, although he beginne it in them
in that manner, but that first he giueth to
them holy faculties, by the which they
worke the residue of their owne holinesse,
he created in them a holy will; then by
meanes and inherent power of that will,
they themselues choose and doe good.</p>
                  <p>Thus much ingenerall of the renewed
holinesse of the will, the which differeth
from the created holinesse, which it had
in the state of innocencie in two respects.
First whereas the created will of man, did
for the present act incline it selfe whollie,
onely, and perfectly to good, this renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will, (although it also doth actually
encline itselfe to that which is truely and
onely good) yet it doth this imperfectlie
and impurely. For by reason of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
of sinfulnesse which are in it, it doth
in part encline it selfe to some particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
as to this or that sinne: we say to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
euill, because it is impossible that this
renewed will shoulde reiect in generall the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7415:176"/>
true good,<note place="margin">Of the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d will of man.</note> consisting in true holinesse and
happinesse, the which maketh the second
difference betwixt the created and the
recreated will of man. For the created wil
of man might (as it did indeede) refuse good
and choose euill in generall: the which
thinge cannot happen to the recreated will:
for it is impossible that one truely renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
shoulde euer make a generall declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from good, which is a totall apostasie
from God, yet he may chuse and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe
many particular sinnes.</p>
                  <p>So that to conclude, the will in this state
of regeneration hath freedome and ability
of choosing good and reiecting euill: yet
this libertie is not so perfect that it can
wholly incline it selfe from euill to good,
but may be compared to one who hath
bene a captiue or prisoner all his life time,
and is nowe set at liberty, so that he may
goe whither he list, and doe what he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good: Yet hauing his fetters hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his heeles is so shakled and hindred
with them, that he cannot runne vp and
downe so readely and freely as otherwise
he woulde, yea they make him to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
often, and sometimes to fall on the
grounde: so the faithfull are freed from the
bondage of sinne, and set at liberty by Christ,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7415:176"/>
yet they are so shakled with the naturall
corruption of sinne remaining in them, that
they cannot so perfectly choose good &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
euill, but that they do often stumble, yea
fall into great sinnes. Yet as this renewed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of the will is during the time of this
short life, inferiour to the created holinesse
of it in the perfection of actuall freedome to
good, so it is to be preferred vnto it in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of perpetuitie and immutabilitie. For
this imperfect freedome of will is so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
vpheld by the secrete and mightie
grace of God, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not possibly be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lost: whereas the perfect freedome of
the created wil, was soone brought to an end.
Yet this difference is not to be put in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the renewed will: for as the will of
all creatures, so also the will of regenerate
men is mutable, and for any inherent and
naturall facultie which either is, or can be
in it, may loose the goodnesse and liberty
of it, but to be ascribed to the immutable
and supernaturall grace of God, assisting
the renewed willes of the faithfull, whereas
he left the created will of man to destroy it
selfe, that so by the weakenesse of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
the glorie of his power might the
more plainely appeare.</p>

wils or motions of the will, for so much
as they are nothinge but diuerse inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to apparant good, or declinations from
apparant euils. To make the nature of them
plaine by familiar examples: a man going
in the streete meeteth with his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
sonne, or some friende whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
dearely, straight way he feeleth a change
of his disposition, which before was quiet
and setled, his will enclining it selfe towards
that obiect, whereof commeth the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of loue: annon he meeteth with his
deadlie enimie, at the sight of whom his
stomacke riseth, he abhorreth from him
as from an euill, there is a contrarie dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
called the affection of hatred. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
he espieth a poore, impotent, sicke,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7415:177"/>
lame,<note place="margin">Of created loue and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</note> and naked man, whose extreame
miserie he cannot beholde for griefe, and
therefore he turneth away himselfe and
sigheth: there is pitty, mercy or compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Not farre off there appeareth a great
rich man, him he enuieth, although he
ought not either to hate or enuie. Straight
way he spieth a pleasant picture, or heareth
some good newes: there he is made glade
and reioyceth: but going a little further,
he seeth his friendes house on fire, then
his ioy is turned into sorrow or greife. If
he meete a man whom he knoweth to be
wise and iust, and seeth to be aged, him
he reuerenceth: but he contemneth a base,
vile, and lewd person: an offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
kindleth anger, as a lawfull action
worketh contentation. Lastly if he see any
thing, that he standeth in neede of, and is
greatly for his vse, that he desireth: but if
he chaunce to see a rotten carion or any
lothsome thing, that he abhorreth.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the nature of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nowe we come to the holinesse of
them. For although they be so suddainly
stirred vp in a man, that they may seeme
to come rather of foolishe rashnesse then of
reason and due regard, and make so great
a chaunge in him, as if the obiect did lay
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7415:178"/>
violent handes vpon his minde (in the which
respect they are called passions of the mind,
and therefore were disclamed by those phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
which professed constancie and
exact vertue) yet they containe in them
a part of mans holinesse and of the image
of God who cannot suffer, and in whom
there is no shadow of chaunge. But thus
it hath pleased him to shadowe out his
owne incomprehensible nature, by the
likenesse of our nature, resembling it, as
to the other faculties of the soule of man,
so also to these affections, yea so that a
greate parte of his glorie reuealed to his
church consisteth in them. For although
he hath manifested himselfe to the heathen
in his wisdome and power shining in the
creatures: yet in his church he is most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and renowned in respect of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
compassion and loue in Christ. The
which affections, as also anger, hatred, and
all the rest, are euery where in the scripture
attributed to God. In man they are then
holy whenas they are agreeable to the
nature of the obiect; as, when a man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
that onely which ought to be loued,
and hateth that which by the will and word
of God ought to be hated: and that
with due measure and moderation. Thus
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7415:178"/>
they being ordered by reason and the word
of God, are not contrary to holinesse, but a
part of it. Yea they are as bellowes blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp and encreasing spirituall graces, and
doe cary man forward to a high degree of
holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Nowe we are to declare these affections
in particular, but because the former part of
this treatise (wherin those affections which
imply subiection, as faith, hope, feare, and
reuerence, are already handled) is growen
in length farre aboue our purpose, as also
that there may be some place left for the
third part of this treatise, which in no case
may wholly be omitted, we will omit the
seuerall explication, and onely choose out
some fewe of them, which are the chiefe and
of most notable vse. In the which ranke
the first place is to be giuen to loue, being
taken not generally for that pleasure which
is taken in the fruition of some good thing,
in the which sense a man is said to loue this
or that thing, this or that kinde of meate, as
it is said of <hi>Isaac,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 9. But as the obiect
of it is some reasonable thing, to wit God,
Angels, or man, in the which sense it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
called charity, and may be described,
A hearty and vehement desire of the good
of an other, arising of an inward pleasure
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7415:179"/>
taken in some good which we see in him.
This affection is first and chiefly to be set on
God who onely is good, in the fruition of
whome there are infinite pleasures. And
therefore man ought to desire his good (in
the aduancement of his glory) aboue all
the thinges in the world. For he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
father or mother, sonne or brother, or
any creature whatsoeuer more then God,
is not worthy to enioy those fountaines of
pleasures, which the fruition of God doth
yeelde to the hearty and vehement louer,
<hi>Math.</hi> 10. 7. From this loue of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
the loue of the reasonable creatures,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ath. 10. 7.</note>
which being endued with the image of God
are for his sake to be loued. Euen as we
knowe that he that beareth hearty and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
loue to his friend, cannot but loue
his friends sonne, being a resemblance of
his father. Hence it followeth that all the
reasonable creatures are not to be loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but more or lesse as they are more or lesse
endued with the image of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
greater loue was due to Angels then to
men: and among men to those who did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
others in measure of holinesse and of
spirituall graces.</p>
                  <p>This is the first streame of loue flowing
from the loue of God as from a fountaine:
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7415:179"/>
beside the which there is an other fountaine
of loue, namely, the naturall affection which
euery liuing thing in the world beareth to it
selfe, whereby it taketh more pleasure in it
selfe, and doth more desire the good estate
of it selfe, then of any other thing. This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
loue hath place in man who, euen in
this his innocent estate, doth beare a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure of loue to himselfe then to any
other creature. The which selfeloue is not
to be reprehended, it being not onely in all
liuing creatures, but also in God himselfe,
who (as good reason is) doth delight more
in himselfe, then in any other thing, and
doth more desire his owne glory then the

                  <p>Thus much of loue, whereunto hatred
is contrary, the which also hath place, and
some vse in this state of innocency, although
not so great as loue hath, because there were
more good obiectes then euill. This affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being contrary to loue is in generall an
abhorring from any euill, but as it is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7415:180"/>
to those thinges which are endued with
reason, it is a desire of euill to happen to
that person which is hated, arising of some
inward griefe conceiued by meanes of him.
But what vse could there be of this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the state of innocency, or who was
the obiect of it? not God, for he is pleasure
and good it selfe, and therefore doth neither
deserue to be abhorred, being in no respect
euill; nor yet giueth any occasion of hatred
to man by grieuing him: not the Angels,
nor man himselfe who also are good both
in themselues and towards man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there remaine the wicked spirites only,
the deuill with his helhoundes, on whome
this affection is to be exercised. The which
thing man might lawfully do, requiting their
accursed and spightfull hatred of God, of his
glory, creatures, and specially of man and
his saluation, with a vehement hatred desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their eternall confusion, not simply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are sinfull and miserable; for they
are in that respect rather to be pittied, but

                  <p>First as touching God on whome man

as what hath he that he hath not receiued
from God: yet he cannot by them nor by

as greate as the fall of the deuill, and the

thought) especially seing that we knowe,
that all men by the instinct of nature delight
to haue a God, according to their owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,

naturall for man to encrease, as in all other

yet in that they doe hate the ministers and
seruants of God, which do zealously preach

spightfully, contumeliously, and malitiously

they doe hate God himselfe. As Christ wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,

                  <p>From this fountaine of the want of the

men. For if the carnall man doe
not loue God himselfe, surelie it is not like
that he loueth man for Gods sake, &amp; because
he is created or recreated after the likenesse

For we haue saide that this affection hath a

                  <p>But that we giue neither more nor lesse
to this affection then is due vnto it this is
to be held, that holinesse whether created
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7415:184"/>
or recreated doth not consist either in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one or in a fewe, but in many graces; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
the which loue hath the first place
assigned vnto it, yea often the denomination
either of the wholle holinesse of man, or
more commonly of the holinesse of all the
practicall faculties. Not as if it were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grace, for there are many distinct gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
euen as many as there are distinct fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of mans soule required in perfect
holinesse; or yet as if it were the chiefe
grace, for faith hath the first place, although
in nature it be not so excellent as loue which
is an heroicall grace, being the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as it were the subiect and ground-worke
not onely of loue, but also of all
other graces, and of all holinesse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
created or renewed. Why then is
loue more spoken of, and inculcated in
the scripture then faith or any other grace?
We answere that the spirit of God, hauing
continually in enditing the scripture respect
to the capacitie of men, propoundeth and
commendeth vnto them holinesse, not so
much in grosse and in generall, as in some
particulars, which are more easely, surely
and certainly conceaued then the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall:
in the which respect loue is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before faith, as being more euident,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7415:184"/>
apparant and sensible, and therefore a
more sure and infallible marke and note of
generall holinesse. The great appearance of
loue ariseth of these two causes. First be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
whereas faith hath relation to God
onely, loue extendeth it selfe both to God
and men. Secondly where as faith lieth hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the heart and minde, loue is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
practical, and therefore more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
and sensible. Againe loue is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before all other practicall graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
holinesse consisteth as partly in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be performed in respect of our selues,
so cheifely in duties to be perfourmed to
others, namely to God and to men: the
which a man cannot performe as he ought,
vnlesse he beare a loue and a harty desire
of the good both of God and of man.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of loue in generall. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of it are these. First the regenerate
man loueth God aboue all the thinges in
the worlde, desiring his good in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
of his glory much more then
his owne saluation. From the which foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the loue of God, springeth the
loue of all men, but especially of the Godly,
who are renewed according to the image
of God in holinesse and iustice,<note place="margin">Psalm. 16. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Psal. 16. 3.
All my delite is in the holy ones which are here
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7415:185"/>
on earth and cheiflie in those which excell in
vertue.</hi> This loue of the saintes is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
signe of true regeneration and of the
true loue of God, namely, whenas a man
loueth an other, hartelie and vehemently,
euen as it were his owne naturall sonne or
brother, for this cause onely (he being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
astraunger vnto him) for that he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in him manifest signes and argumentes
of true and vnfained godlinesse, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.

And <hi>Ioh. 13. 35. By this shall all men knowe
that ye are my disciples if ye loue one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe we come to the other fountaine of
loue, namely, selfe-loue, the which also
hath place in the regenerate, although in an
other manner then in carnall men. For
they loue themselues, yet so as that they
loue God more by infinite degrees, and
their brethren as themselues. Againe, they
doe not shewe or vse this selfe-loue in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
earthly and sensuall pleasures for
their bodies, but in procuring the eternall
saluation of their soules, and yet they doe
and ought to loue themselues more then
they doe any other, yea to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the good estate of their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and soules, then of the bodies and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7415:185"/>
soules of their brethren. Yet this must be
vnderstood in equall comparison: for a
faithfull man ought not to loue his owne
bodie and to desire the safetie thereof more
then the eternall saluation of his brother: the
which ought to be procured, yea with
the losse of our owne temporall liues <hi>Ioh.</hi>
3. 16.<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>As Christ laide downe his life for vs,
so we ought to lay downe our liues for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
Yet a man neede not depriue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of life for the safetie of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life of his brother being a priuate man,
nor of eternall life for the procuring of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
saluation.</p>
                  <p>If any man doe here obiect the examples
of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul,</hi> of whom the one desired
to haue his name blotted out of the booke
of life: and the other to be accursed from
Christ for the good of the Iewes. We a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere
that the Iewes were then to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered not
simplie as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but as the whol visible church
of God, the confusion whereof coulde not
but be a great hinderaunce to Gods glory,
the which ought to be procured, euen with
the eternall confusion of our owne soules,
if the case doe so require. For so <hi>Moses</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
that if God did destroy his owne
people, the Egiptians who were spitefull
enimies to God and his worshippe, would
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7415:186"/>
laugh at their distruction and blaspheme
God himselfe. And so we cannot doubte
but that the glory of God shall be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
enlarged by the conuersion of the
Iewes, and therefore it may be more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
then our owne saluation.</p>
                  <p>From this fountaine of selfe loue flow
the afore saide streames of speciall loue,
whereby the faithfull man is affected more
to those who doe any way come neare
himselfe, then to those who are estraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from him. This partial loue is good and
lawefull, for why shoulde not man encline
and cleaue more to those whom God hath
ioyned more nearely vnto him? Hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the speciall loue due to parentes,
which cannot be wanting but in him who
is notoriously vnnaturall, vnthankfull, and
vnholy. For if a man loue the houses and
places wherein he hath beene and liued
sometime, shall he not much more loue
his parentes from whose bodies he came.
Secondly the loue of children, with the
loue of whom he that is not touched
and enflamed, may be accounted lesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionated
then God himselfe, and more
senslesse then are the brute beastes. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this fatherly affection we haue in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>

Both these affections had place

and continuall vse of ioy man had in his

infinite blessings wherewith he was euen
compassed about, liuing not onely free from
all troubles, crosses, afflictions, daungers,
wants, incumbrances, and whatsoeuer
thing might any way grieue or hurt him, but
also in abundance and superfluity of al plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
belonging both to his body and soule,
in perfect strength and health, in wealth,
peace and liberty, in honour and glory, and
which is all in all, and in trueth the fountaine
of all true ioy, in the fauour and loue of
God.</p>
                  <p>The holinesse of this affection, consisteth
in this, that it be correspondent, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the goodnesse and excellency
of the obiect, and that the ioy which man
conceiueth by the fruition of any thing be
greater or lesse, as the thing it selfe is more
or lesse excellent, a greater or a lesse good,
and therefore man was chiefly to delight
himselfe and to reioyce in God who is the
chiefe and first, yea the onely infinite good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:7415:188"/>
Secondly as God hath put into euery one of
his creatures,<note place="margin">Of ioy, soro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</note> a finite and proper goodnes; so
it was lawfull for man to be affected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
with the pleasure flowing from the
said thing. For example, God created for
the vse of man great variety of trees bearing
sweete and pleasant fruite, all which man
might lawfully vse with ioy and pleasure.
Yea this ioyfull vse of the creatures was not
onely permitted to man, but also comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by God:<note place="margin">Deut. 26. 11.</note> for so we read, <hi>Deut. 26. 11.
Thou shalt bowe thy selfe, before the Lord thy
God, and thou shalt reioyce before him in all
the good thinges which he hath giuen vnto
thee, thou and thy whole family.</hi> For why? he
that reioiceth aright in the fruition of the
creatures, reioyceth in God, the maker
and giuer of them, and by them is stirred
vp to greater alacrity in seruing and praising
God.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching sorrow, it had also place
in the pure nature of man which was subiect
to this passion, howsoeuer he being in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
felicitie, had not any great vse of it, yet
we may suppose some causes of sorrow, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in this happie estate, both in man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who might be moderately grieued for
the want of some particular good, and in
some other respects, as also in other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7415:189"/>
for the miserable estate of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Angels hauing beene so glorious and
happie, especially the dishonour which they
did many waies procure to the name of God,
could not but worke sorrow in the heart of
man. So that the sorrow of man in this
first state, being rather in regarde of others
then of himselfe, ought to be called pitty
rather then sorrow. The holinesse of this
affection consisteth in this, that it be in
greatnesse correspondent to the greatnesse
of the euill, diligently waied with the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
circumstances of it, and also modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and qualified with contentation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the will of God, by the which the
said euill came to passe.</p>

as is the hearing of the word, praier, or

pleasures, as namely in the abundance, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netie,
goodnesse and sweetnesse of meates

                  <p>Not as if there might not a lawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
be taken in corporall and outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
as hath beene declared, but man pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by God the giuer of all these blessinges
placeth his whole ioy and felicitie in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of them, and so maketh them his Gods.
As the Apostle doth plainlie witnesse that the
coueteous man is an idolatour. He is not stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp by the sweetenesse which he feeleth
in the vse of the creaturs to reioyce &amp; delight

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7415:190"/>
then in aduersitie; and therefore God
doth so often forewarne the people of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
of forgetting him, whenas they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <p>Hence it commeth that the ioy of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man is vnconstant, vncertaine and
momentany, euen as is the matter of his
ioy. For as no worldly thing is constant, so
the ioy which ariseth of worldly things must
needes be vnconstant. Yea while it doth
continue it is not pure and sincere ioy, but
mingled with much sorrow and vexation
of minde, it being impossible that any man
should haue such perfect ioy in this world
in respect of worldly blessings, as is voide of
all manner of crosses and griefe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Salomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see the sinfullnesse of mans ioy in
this corrupt state.</p>
                  <p>Likewise his sorrow is not such as it ought
to be: he is indeede often grieued, but not
for the want of the fauour, presence and grace
of God, not for his sins by the which he doth

haue so greate and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
vse as that they may seeme to striue
for the preheminence whether of them
should beare the greater sway in the faithful.
Renewed ioy ariseth of the inward sense
and feeling of the loue and mercie of God
in Christ, whereby a faithfull man knowing
assuredlie that he hath attained remission of
all his sinnes, safetie and freedome from the
anger and iudgements of God, eternall
happinesse with all spirituall and temporall
blessings tending therevnto, is (and that not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7415:191"/>
without good cause) replenished in his soule
with an exceeding and vnspeakable ioy in
regard of this his happie state:<note place="margin">Of holy ioy &amp; sorrow.</note> the greatnes
whereof no man either knoweth or can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
but he in whome it hath pleased God
to worke it by his holie spirite. Yea if we shall
compare this renewed ioy with the ioy
which man had in his first estate, we shall
see that the faithfull haue both greater cause
of reioycing, and greater ioy then man
had in his perfect happinesse: in that he
hath not only attained to a more perfect,
absolute, and certaine happinesse, but also
hath escaped the contrarie miserie, euen
the eternall wrath of God due vnto him for
his sinnes, whereof man had no taste in his
first estate. This ioy differeth from the ioy
of the carnall man in many respectes: the
one reioyceth in God, the other in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures:
the one in temporal, vaine and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie,
the other in spirituall, heauenlie,
and eternall things, the one in the good
estate of his bodie the other in the good
estate of his soule: The one sheweth his ioy
in the vse of carnall pleasures: the other, in

                  <p>This renewed ioy, although it be so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great as hath beene saide, yet it is
mixed and indeede tempered with much
sorrow: so it hath pleased God in great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and mercy to giue to his children
in this life, not the absolute perfection of
that ioy and happinesse which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them; but rather to temper the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sweetnesse of it with sorrow and
afflictions, that so the bitternesse of the one
might make the other the more welcome
and acceptable vnto them. The causes of
this sorrow are diuerse, some in the faithfull
themselues, some in others: in themselues
first and cheifly their sinnes whereby they
doe displease and dishonour God, who hath
shewed himselfe to them so gratious,
bountifull and mercifull. Secondly the
manifolde temptations, crosses and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which doe daily befal them: these how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
by the gratious assistaunce of Gods
spirit, they doe often encrease this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ioy, yet being bitter and oftentimes
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7415:192"/>
intollerable to flesh and bloude they doe
preuaile against this spirituall ioy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the infirmitie of the flesh: and although
they cannot cleane extinguishe it, yet they
coole and diminishe it; yea and so driue it
into a corner, as that it doth not any way
appeare. Yea euen the ordinarie misery
and vanitie of this life, being compared
with the happinesse of the life to come, doth
worke in the faithfull sorrow, sighes, and
grones, as we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p>Beside this matter of sorrow which they
haue in themselues,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> they are continually
sore grieued, and euen tormented in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
when as they beholde the vaine and
wretched estate of the creatures, being
moued to pittie, euen by the miseries of
the brute beastes, the horrible sinnes
which abounde euery where, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
atheisme which raigneth in the
worlde, to the greate dishonour of the
name of God. And much more whenas
they consider the calamities, miseries, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
corruptions and defections of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
professing the name of Christ. These
thinges doe, and that iustly worke continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
greife in the heartes of the Godly, yet
this greife is moderated with patience, and
contentation in the will of God, and so
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7415:192"/>
it be commeth a godly sorrow, which doth
not bringe them to desperation and death as
carnall sorrow doth; but is at length the

and miserable, and againe becommeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here on earth and glorious in heauen:
but also in the particular chaunges hapening
in his seuerall states, whereof none can
make him so immutable as that he may say
truely of himselfe, I am that I was, and will
be that I am and no otherwise. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his created holynesse it coulde not be
either so firme and stedfast, but that it
might be in some sorte diminished, or so
absolutly perfect, but that it ought daily to
be encreased. But this vncertaintie and
mutabilitie appeareth farre more plainelie
in his other estates, the one of naturall sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the other of renewed holines, of both
which there are in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as many degrees
as there are carnall &amp; regenerate men in the
world. For although the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sin, haue
already so possessed all the partes &amp; faculties
of body &amp; soule, &amp; be as deeply imprinted
into the soule of man, as the spottes are in
the skin of a leopard, and therefore may
seeme not to admitte any encrease by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the greatnesse or any decrease by
reason of the naturalnes of it; yet both these
chaunges may be seene, the one vsually in
most vnregenerate men, who doe daily
plunge themselues deeper and deeper in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7415:193"/>
to the pit of sin, adding one sin to another, and
thirst to drunkennesse, as the scripture speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
the other in diuerse both within and
without the church. Likewise in regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the faithfull man neuer standeth at
one stay, but doth alwaies grow either vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
or downewarde in godlynesse. For
as vsually he encreaseth his spiritual strength,
chaunging his christian infancie with a ripe
and constant age, and adding grace to
grace till he become a perfect man in
Christ: so sometimes he decreaseth in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as we see the bodies of men doe in old
age, and so as it were returning the same
way he came, falleth into one sinne after
another, and so decreaseth in holinesse,
although not totally and finally, yet grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
and fearefully. Thus the spirituall
state of man chaunging it selfe from lesse
to more and from more to lesse, from
good to euill and from euil to good, yea
from good to better and from euil to worse,
is as variable as is the moone, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
decreasing or increasing in light,
appeareth euerie night in a newe forme.</p>
               <p>These chaunges, differences and degrees
are necessarie to be knowen of all christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that so they may be either sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or auoided, as they are either good or
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7415:194"/>
euill. And therefore we are here to declare
the degrees both of the holinesse and also
of the sinfulnesse of man: not the conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one estate into another, the which
is the argument of the two former partes of
this treatise; but the proper chaunges of each
state as first, howe <hi>Adam</hi> continuing in
the state of innocencie, might either haue
decreased or increased in holinesse. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
howe a carnall man abiding in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
sinfullnesse may be more or lesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And Lastly howe a regenerate man
may decrease or increase in spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Of these in order, if first we put the
reader in minde that these chaunges are
made from that measure of created holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of sinfulnesse and of renewed holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which hath bene declared in the two
former partes of this booke: wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
sometimes for illustration a higher
degree both of holinesse and of sinne be
mentioned, yet we haue indeauoured to
sette downe that mediocritie, as it may be
called, of holinesse both created and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is to be seene ordinarily and vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in men, in the state of innocencie and
of regeneration: and likewise that measure
of sinne which is naturall to all men, and
may be seene in many vnregenerate men:
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7415:194"/>
not in all, because in some it is diminished,
nor in most, because vsually it is encreased,
as afterward will appeare.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be doubted how man
liuing and continuing in his
innocent and happy estate,
could decrease in holinesse, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
seeing that (as hath
beene said in the first part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Chap. 3. Sect.</hi> 2.) all
the partes of his holinesse were so tyed and
linked together, that he could not loose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular grace without loosing all, nor
commit the least sinne in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
because by committing sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
in the very act, and moment of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, he should fall from his innocency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a sinfull state. Wee answere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all this be true, yet there must a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
be put betwixt the want of a grace
and the small measure of it, and so betwixt
the committing of sinne, and the decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in holinesse, which may be without
sinne: and that in this state, if so be it be
with these conditions: first that this decrease
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7415:195"/>
be not so great as that any grace or part of
holinesse be wholly wanting:<note place="margin">Of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of created holinesse.</note> for thereof
sinne would necessarily follow. Secondly,
that it be not continuall or finall, but onely
for some short space of time. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
we may well thinke that particular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as faith, loue, temperance might be
in man in the state of innocency sometimes
in great and sometimes in small measure.
For as he did cary about with himselfe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of humane nature consisting of flesh
and bloud, and was outwardly subiect to
the temptations of Sathan, so we cannot
doubt but that by these meanes his faith,
and withall, all the other partes of holines,
might receiue some wounde, although not
be cleane ouercome, and mingled with
doubting &amp; wauering, although not wholly
turned into it. Likewise the loue of God
and of his glory, might be abated for some
space of time by force of temptation, and he
made lesse zealous of Gods glory, and lesse
chearefull in seruing him, yea dull and
lumpish and without his wonted alacrity
The trueth hereof appeareth in the example
of Christ, whose humane nature although
it were endued with farre more firme and
plentifull holinesse, then was man in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
yet in that it was a humane, that is
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7415:195"/>
a created and weake nature, it could not be
freed from this mutabilitie whereunto all
creatures are subiect. Whereof it came,
that the vnspeakable force of his last agony
wherein he felt the infinite anger of God
due to the sinne of mankinde, did giue his
faith a great blow, yea it made an euident
decrease of it for a short time: insomuch
that he burst foorth into these wordes, <hi>My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.</hi>
Where we are not to thinke that his faith did
faile, which appeareth plainely in those
wordes <hi>my God my God.</hi> But as the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
champion receiuing a mighty blow is
made to reele and stagger by the force of
it; so was the faith of Christ shaken by this
temptation, as is a strong house by a greate
blast of winde, yet without daunger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ouerturned: now to proceede.</p>
               <p>As mans holinesse might haue beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
in regard of the measure of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
graces; so it might also haue beene
encreased in the same respect; not that we
suppose it to haue beene imperfect, but for
that, that which is already perfect, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more perfect. As namely that we may
make instance in some particular, the
knowledge wherewith man was endued in
his innocency was exceeding great as hath
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7415:196"/>
beene shewed, yet no man can doubt but
that the same would in processe of time haue
beene continually encreased, as God did
reueale himselfe, his word, counsels and
actions daily more and more. This encrease
of holinesse in the vnderstanding, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
faculties do follow: for the more that
man knoweth God, the more he trusteth,
loueth, feareth, obeyeth, worshippeth and
honoreth him: the oftner that man were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from danger by the goodnesse and
power of God, the greater woulde be his
affiance in God: the more blessings that he
doth receiue, the greater is his thankfulnes.
So that the life both of man and of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in their innocency being a continuall
exercise of holinesse, cannot but haue a
continuall encrease of it. Yea we may well
thinke, that both many of the Angels and
all mankinde were so easelie drawen from
God and brought to a fearefull ruine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were tempted to this Apostasie in
the beginning of their liues, immediately
after their creation, before they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and confirme their holinesse by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
and holy experience. By the which
meanes we are to thinke that euen the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels themselues, which doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
behold the face of God in heauen, haue
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7415:196"/>
since their first creation continually encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their holinesse, and so are a great deale
further from falling and sinning against God,
then they were in the beginning, being vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in all temptations suggested eyther by
their owne thoughtes, or by the wicked
Angels, although by the supernaturall
grace of God, yet not without the means of
this naturall encrease of their created ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
               <p>Againe this encrease of holinesse hath
place as in particular men, so also generally
in the ages of this innocent state: for as in
this sinfull estate wherein we liue, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages are more sinful then the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they partake the sins of all the former
ages; so if the state of innocency had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
the latter ages being taught by the first
would haue exceeded them in knowlege &amp;
in all other partes of holinesse. Lastly this is to
be noted, that we do not here speake of that
increase of holinesse which was in the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of man in his innocency, during which
time he did grow both in stature of body, &amp;
in holines of soule, as it is said that Christ did
in his innocency &amp; infancy, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2. 25.<note place="margin">Luke. 2. 25.</note> But
of the progresse in holinesse, after that he was
come to ripenes of age, &amp; the ordinary state,
measure and degree of holinesse, to wit, that

wherein <hi>Adam</hi> the first and the last man, of
this innocent generation was created.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the next place we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the changes which happen in
the sinfull state of man, the which
being the worst of all states ought not in
constancy to excell all other. First of the
decrease, then of the increase of sinne. By
the decrease of sinne, we meane the increase
of the reliques of Gods image, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the decrease of the corruption of
sinne which is contrary thereunto; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when as the light and knowledge remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the minde of man after his fall is by
any meanes encreased, and so the contrary
blindnesse and ignorance in part expelled.
This decrease may happen in al the parts of
mans sinfulnesse, for by it the dulnesse and
ignorance of the minde, the peruersenesse
of the will and affections, the wickednesse
of life in outward actions may be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
For the better vnderstanding of this
point, it is needfull that we set downe what
is the naturall state and degree of sinfulnesse
the which is sometimes diminished, and
sometimes augmented in men, that by the
mediocrity the extreames may be knowen.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7415:197"/>
It is hard to giue any real example of it,<note place="margin">Of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decrease of sinfulnesse.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the nature of man being in continuall
motion, is alwaies either vnder or aboue,
this state of sinfulnesse, yet it may be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
after this manner. Suppose a man of
ripe yeares of a soft and simple disposition
the which is to be founde in men whose
bodies are of some cold complexion
(for hote and fierie natures haue strong,
quicke, vehement and vnconstant motions,
able to change themselues without any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes, and therefore doe alwaies
runne into the one or the other extreame)
hauing liued in some solitarie place not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the fashions, corruptions
and sinnes of the world, not hauing giuen
himselfe either to continuall meditation or
beene instructed by others in the knowledge
of religion: looke what measure of sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is in this man, the same or there aboute
is the naturall sinfulnesse which all men take
from <hi>Adam,</hi> and bring with them out of
their mothers wombes into the world. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
suppose or rather beholde with your
eyes (for the liuing examples of the encrease
of sinne are infinite) one brought vp in the
companie of lewde and wicked men, and
indued with wit, beutie, strength of nature,
riches, honour, and all manner of worldly
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7415:198"/>
things, such a one may become a vertuous
and holy man, but vsually he is so in euery
respect, that a man may see plainly in him
a patterne of the encrease of naturall sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Lastly spie out one of a gentle nature
and ingenuous countenance, vertuously
brought vp from his first infancie, hauing
neuer vsed any euill companie, but being
continually giuen of himselfe to get learning
and all manner of knowledge, yea care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
inured by his parents, tutors and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to the dayly practise and exercise of what
soeuer thing is honest, good, right, &amp; any way
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, &amp; lastly who hath no tru touch
of religion, &amp; is indued with a competent
portion &amp; measure of the giftes of nature, &amp;
of fortune (as they are ignorantly termed) this
man although he may by the peruersnesse
of his corrupt nature treade all these things
vnder his feete, and become verie vitious,
yet vsually he may be an example of the
decrease of naturall sinfulnesse.</p>
               <p>These three men are all carnall and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet there is greate difference among
them, the which that it may the more plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
appeare, we will compare them &amp; their
diuers degrees of sinfulnesse together. The
first is the right naturall man. The second
is on his left hand hauing augmented his
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7415:198"/>
sinfulnesse. The third on his right hand ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
diminished it. The first is altogether
ignorant of the true God and of his worship,
yet he thinketh that there is a God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and doth worshipe his God verie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
one way or other after his fashion.
The second is fully resolued in his mind by
arguments inuented by him selfe and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
by the deuill and other Atheists like
to himselfe, that there is no GOD, and
therefore that it is but follie to worship any.
The third man is persuaded by manie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that there is a God, yea he knoweth
the true God, and performeth some parte
of his true worshipe. The first knoweth
not what to thinke of God, or to what thing
to resemble him, yet he thinketh him to be
powerfull, mightie and bountifull, ascribing
all his mishapes and his good lucke to his
false God. The second giueth all to blinde
fortune, wise counsell, &amp; hardie aduentures,
yea he defieth God in his hart, thinking that
to trust in him is the next way to all mishap.
The third knoweth &amp; acknowledgeth that
all thinges both good &amp; euill come from
that only true GOD, who is euery way
infinite and incomprehensible, &amp; yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not God in Christ as he ought to doe.</p>
               <p>Likewise for the sinfulnesse of the will
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7415:199"/>
the mere naturall man cannot choose and
incline himselfe to anie God, religion or
worshipe which is not sensible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot choose the true God, and
true holinesse, the which are spirituall and
contrarie to sense; no not if these were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to his will, either by his owne mind,
or by some other, but chooseth for his part,
eating, drinking, sleeping, ease, pastime,
pleasure, and voluptuousuesse. The second
man who is supernaturall in sinfulnesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth
and abhorreth the name of God
and of any thing that is good, but the third
may haue an inclination to good. Lastly
the first man doth not in his life commit
horrible sinnes, such as are murther, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
adulterie, robberie, or periurie being
restrained euen by his owne conscience,
condemning these hainous sinnes: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he beare no loue to any but to himself
&amp; to his owne, yet he meaneth harme to no
man. As for the second he abstaineth from
no sinne, tho neuer so hainous wherevnto
he is intised by any meanes. Whereas the
third man leadeth a life without all spot,
shew or suspition of any such matter, yea
he is good to euerie one as occasion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
being farre from hurting any. So that
to be short, the first man may be called a
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7415:199"/>
brute beast which is giuen to al sensualitie,
yet without either knowledge or practise
of good or euill. The second a deuil incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
the third a carnall and sinfull saint.</p>
               <p>Thus we see both by the naturall state
of sinne, as also by the increase of it, what
is the decrease of it. Whereof we are to
thinke and holde, first that although it
may be generall in any, or in all the partes
of mans sinfulnesse, yet it can not be totall
in any one, much lesse in all, for no part
of it can be wholly diminished in an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man. Secondly this decrease doth
take away the corruption of sinne, more
then it doth put the contrarie grace in the
roome of it: being in schoole termes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pruatiue then positiue. And therefore
the carnall man in this decrease of sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
doth not so much knowe, approue,
embrace and follow the true God and his
worshippe, as he knoweth all false gods
to be no goddes, condemning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
all idolatry. And so in life although
he can refraine himselfe from doing euil,
yet he is not able to performe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian duties. For the light of nature
being increased by such meanes as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man may vse, will teach and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him to abstaine from grosse sinnes.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:7415:200"/>
But the true knowledge and practise of
good, commeth onlie from the worke of
gods spirite; whereof it commeth that this
decrease of sinfulnesse is not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
true holinesse, neither any parte of it,
and so it is not effectuall to saluation.</p>
               <p>Thus much in generall of the decrease
of sinfulnesse, nowe we come to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kindes of it, the which are two in
number: naturall and supernaturall. The
first kinde (whereof the third of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
carnall men may be a shadow) we
call naturall: not that it is a naturall thing
for a man to decrease in sinfulnesse, in the
which he groweth as naturally as the smoke
goeth vpwarde, and therefore it is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
motion contrarie to his naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
but because it may be attained
by a naturall man, in whom there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true regeneration, nor any shadowe
of it, and that by naturall meanes without
the worke of the holy spirite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may be seene not onely in carnall
men liuing in the Church, but also (and
that more plainly) in many heathen and
professed infidels, who neuer heard tel of the
true religion &amp; worshippe of God, of whom
many as it were laying violent handes on
themselues, and their naturall dispositions
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7415:200"/>
enclined to all vice and sinfulnesse, haue
gotten the habite, that is, the constant and
permanent disposition of morall vertues, as
namely, of iustice, temperaunce, sobriety
and chastitie, in somuch that they haue
not onely led a life pure from the spottes
of grosse sinnes, but also haue after a sort
chaunged their wils, mindes and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from an euil and vitious, to a good
and vertuous disposition. This the Apostle
witnesseth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>The gentils ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

that is without spirituall grace, <hi>the
thinges contained in the lawe, and so are a
lawe vnto themselues.</hi> Of this decrease
we haue many and manifold examples e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
some of all sortes of men, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it appeareth in those who in old times
professed themselues to be philosophers,
that is, seekers and practisers of wisedome
and vertue as namely <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> with
many others, as <hi>Aristides, Cato, Seneca,</hi>
whose vertues we can not thinke to haue
bene mere hypocrisie, it being well knowen
that they were so affected inwardly in their
mindes as they professed outwardly in their
liues. Yet we confesse that this decrease
of sinfulnesse is not a like in all: for in some
it is inwarde and true as hath bene saide,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7415:201"/>
but in others yea most commonly it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in outward life.<note place="margin">Of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall decrease of sinfulnesse.</note> For many doe leade an

shame, others for vaine glories sake, as did
the pharisies. Againe this decrease is more
generall in some who abstaine from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kindes of vices, then it is in others, who
are faulty in many respectes. And Lastly
this decrease is more firme and permanent
in some continuing the wholle time of
their life: but in others it hath place in their
young yeares by force of good education,
but is afterwardes altogether forgotten
and reiected. In the heathen it is more in
regarde of the duties of the second table,
the which are more easelie knowen then
are the dueties belonging to the worship
of God. But in hypocriticall Christians, the
outwarde decrease of sinfulnesse is greater
in the dueties of the first table. For they
will be verie deuout, and diligent in the
outwarde seruice of God, and yet liue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
wickedly in regard of their brethren.
These and many other degrees and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of this naturall decrease, may ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be obserued in many both within and
without the Church, and also in all histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

it being impossible that two

doe worke in them a decrease of sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

we call supernaturall, because it cannot be

in those who doe yeelde obedience to the

the faithfull doe, yet in so greate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that this decrease of sinne may very
fitly be called a shadowe of true regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
there being no grace effectually

men. For not onely their life is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

with a kinde of faith, hope, loue, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and all other graces: and that not
in hypocrisie though many doe make an
outwarde shew and profession of those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whereof there is not any shadowe in
their heartes, but in trueth. As we read
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 5.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>It is impossible that they

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7415:202"/>
asked why God doth bestow these excellent
graces on the reprobate, as it were throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pearles among swine; we answere that
he doth it especially for these three causes:
first for the setting forth of his owne glory.
For by this worke, his loue, mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wisedome and trueth, appeareth euen
to the reprobate: on whom as he letteth the
raine to fal, and his sun to shine, as wel as on
the faithfull; so he powreth foorth his graces
as well on the one as on the other, although
not after the same manner: for although
the eternall loue of God which bringeth
with it eternall saluation, doth belong to
the elect onely, yet there is a generall, and as
we may terme it, a temporary loue which
God beareth to all his creatures and in them
towardes all men, both elect and reprobate.
Secondly this is done in regard of the elect,
for whose sake God blesseth the reprobate
with whome they liue, both in temporal and
spirituall things, and whose saluation is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
and some time wrought by the
giftes and ministery of these men. Lastly,
God doth by this meanes make them who
are indued with these graces, the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
in that they contemne and treade
vnder foote so great mercy.</p>
               <p>Nowe we are to declare the difference,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7415:203"/>
which is betwixt true regeneration and
this supernaturall decrease of sinne, which
is a shadowe of it. First therefore true
regeneration is generall stretching it selfe
ouer all the faculties and partes of the soule
and body, and working an vniuersall holines
as the leauen which being put into a greate
lumpe of dow, neuer ceaseth spreading it
selfe abroad, till the whole lumpe be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

the minde is enlightned in part, and in

professing and holding in iudgement
the trueth of the gospell, to witte of the
fund amental and chiefe doctrines of it,
doe together maintaine many errours and
heresies. We doe not deny, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

truely regenerate, may be in some errors
(for <hi>we all knowe but in parte, 1. Cor.</hi> 13.)
yet this is the force and propertie of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
minde to be able to discerne the
trueth from errour when as both are laide
before it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 1</note> howsoeuer it did not see it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And therefore when as we see a man,
although endued with many giftes yet to
be of a corrupt minde, and vnsound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
enclining alwaies to the wrong part
in matters of religion, his regeneration
may in that respect be suspected to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall.
This the Apostle doth plainely
testifie,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19</note> 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 19. There must be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
that those who are approoued may
be made manifest:</hi> that is, God doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
schismes and diuisions to be among
you, that by this meanes it may appeare
whose holinesse is sounde, and whose is
hypocriticall, or at the least light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall.
Secondly men truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
receiue a greater measure of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
graces as of faith, loue, and patience
then the other doe: Yea they doe daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in grace, whereas the other doe
commonly stand at a stay, neuer attaining
to any great measure of godlinesse, but
abide in a certaine indifferent kinde of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity
being neither hotte nor colde.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7415:204"/>
Besides true graces are fruitfull, but the
shadowes are barren, eyther wholly or
in part, as the faith of these men doth
not worke and shewe foorth it selfe by loue,
their loue is without workes of compassion
and Christian communion, their good works
without alacrity. Lastly the shadowe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
doth often come to nothing and
is turned into meere Atheisme, and want of
all religion: but true regeneration can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wholly decay, as <hi>Math. 3. 20. Some

                  <note place="margin">Math. 3. 20.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4. 5.</note> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 5, we reade of
those who being once made partakers of
the holy Ghost: doe afterwardes fall away
from Christ, yea while they doe retaine this
resemblance of true sanctification, they are
not constant, but variable in doing good,
<hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 8.<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>A double minded man is vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in all his waies:</hi> that is, a man halfe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and halfe regenerate doth not keepe
throughout the course of his whole life a
constant tenour of godlinesse, but often
changeth his minde, opinions, affections,
and practise.</p>
               <p>By these and such other notes which may
be obserued in the scripture, and by daily
experience, this shadowe of holinesse may
be discerned from the trueth: yet we ought
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7415:204"/>
not peremptorely to iudge, or rashly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
any man: for there may be found
euen in men truely regenerate many wants,
errours, sinnes and alterations, as afterwards
will appeare. Therefore we ought to thinke
the best, where we see any likelihoode
of good: and where there is none, to hope
for better in time to come: and so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
other men to Gods iudgement, to
censure our owne profession and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by these rules. Yet it is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and needfull, that we shoulde knowe
howe to distinguish trueth from falshoode,
right from wrong, good from euill, the
shadowe from the bodie in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our brethren. The which it is
the parte of euerie Christian to marke
and consider, to trie and thinke of it,
according to the trueth of the worde of
GOD: but in iudging and speaking to
vse greate moderation and wisedome.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first and most vsuall part of this
supernaturall decrease of sinne, is
the illumination of the minde,
whereby a carnall man, who before did
not beleeue the doctrine, eyther of the law
or of the gospell, is brought to see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the trueth of the one or of both.
To beleeue the law of God to be true, is to
haue a sight and a sense of sinne: to see sinne
is for a man to know himselfe to be so sinfull
in nature, in soule, &amp; body, in life and actions
as indeed he is. To feele sinne is to know that
for his sinne he is subiect to the wrath of God
which is eternall death. This first part of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
is far more easely &amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrought
in a naturall man then is the other: because
by the light of nature man hath some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and euill, and that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are to be rewarded as the wicked are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
punished. Hence it is that many make this
first step in this shadow of regeneration, and
goe no further. Thus <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> with

Yet it is plainely out of the 21. <hi>verse,</hi> that he
was not as then truly regenerated. Yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
carnall men attaine to so greate a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of knowledge, that there is no point
or heade of christian religion which they
doe not in some sorte conceiue, vnderstand
and beleeue, although not fully, for that
is impossible, yet so as that they are able to
performe the duty of teachers in the Church,
in laying open plainly and euidently to the
capacitie of the hearers, the mysteries of the
gospel, in resoluing al doubtes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies,
questions, obiections and arguments which
are moued about anypoint of doctrine. Thus
did the teachers at Corinth of whome the
Apostle writeth 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 2. Though I had
the gift of prophecie,</hi>

               <p>This knowledge is commonly called
an historicall faith: a gift common to the
elect and the reprobate, yet not so common
as it seemeth to be. Yea in truth more rare in
respect of the greate multituds of professours
and christians, then it is common in respect
of the small number of true beleeuers. For
to let passe those who know nothing of
religion, we are not to thinke that all they
who are learned, and as we say great clarkes
in diuinitie and profound schoole-men, do
in their mindes and iudgments hold these
things to bee true. Yea it appeareth plainly
in the example of <hi>Iudas</hi> (who although he

well thinke that many otherwise learned,
thinke that it is no such supernaturall work,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7415:206"/>
but that it may be attained by natural means.
Likewise how many, thinke wee, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in their heartes that this worlde
shall neuer haue an ende, or that there shal
be a new world, wherein the bodies of men
which were consumed to nothing many
thousand years before, shalbe raised vp &amp;
liue for euer.</p>
               <p>But to proceede: of the decrease of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
commeth the decrease of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
For as the minde is enlightned; so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
is the hearte affected: by the which
meanes it commeth to passe, that of the
aforesaide knowledge doth often spring
in vnregenerate men a kinde of fayth,
commonly called temporarie, because for
the most part it is lost in processe of time.
It is to be discerned from effectuall and
true faith by the fruites of it. For as we
cannot iudge what life and vertue is in the
root of a tree which lieth hid in the ground,
but by the branches, leaues, and fruit which
it sendeth foorth; so faith which is hid in the
hearte of man, cannot be tried by any other
meanes. The fruites of true faith are al other
spirituall graces, all good and holy actions
the which it sendeth forth plentifully, and
so carrieth with it a greate traine whereby
it may be knowen: but this temporarie faith
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7415:207"/>
is naked and destitute of these thinges ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly or in greate part, as hath beene
saide of this shadow of regeneration in the
former chapter. But that which is doubtful
whilst this saith standeth, is in time made
manifest: when as the finall and totall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of it doth shew what manner of faith it
was. For true faith abideth for euer, but
this temporarie faith may be lost by many
meanes as first by heauie crosses and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby it pleaseth God to trie his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,

and persecution come.</hi> True faith
saith, although God should kill me, yet
will I trust in him, but this light faith is clean
dismaied and euen nipt in the heade in time
of any greate miserie. Likewise it is lost by
the force of sinne, and of worldly pleasurs,
which make men to forget God and all the
affiance which they had in him, and so seeke
for happinesse in this present world, euen as
the naturall life of man being in the heart is
so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times kept down with extream sorrow, &amp;

                  <hi>hauing damnation,
because they haue made voide their first faith.</hi>
By this meanes it commeth to passe, that
many who in their younger yeares haue had
notable graces in them, become in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of time key colde in religion, mere
worldlings and cleane voyde of all faith.
For the longer that a man liueth, the more
he feeleth the pleasures of the worlde, and
so laying faster holde on them, decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in faith till it be vtterly lost, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth

               <p>Thus much of the decrease of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
from the which there commeth a
decrease of the other partes of mans sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
and a resemblance of all that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
which hath bene declared in the first
part of this treatise: for the carnall man
hauing this knowledge and faith of God,
doth serue and worshippe him by hearing
the worde and that with gladnesse, by
praying vnto God and by all other meanes.
Likewise he obeyeth God in the wholle
course of his life, he forsaketh his sin and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7415:208"/>
is humbled with sorrowe in regard of them.
He liueth vnblamably in the eies of men,
yea and may be indeede iust, vpright,
honest in all his dealing, and finally doth
in euery respect resemble the true beleeuer,
and yet the one is truely renewed vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, the other is but lightly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of sinne, whereby man goeth yet
further, and so exceedeth himselfe and his

is set downe at large,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. from
the 18. verse to the end of the Chapter.
Where the Apostle sheweth first the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of sinne against the first table of the
lawe, in that the gentils did worshippe
God in the likenesse of man, or of bruite
beastes, whereas man by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shining in the creation of the world,
seeth that God is of a farre more excellent,
powerfull and wonderfull nature then is
man, or any other creature. Then from
the 24. verse to the end, he sheweth
the encrease of sinne against the seconde
table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that they were giuen to vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
lust, to the violating of all common
equitie, trueth and honestie, in lying, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
couenantes, in commiting horrible
murthers, in wanting all naturall loue and
affection to their parentes and kinsfolkes,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7415:209"/>
in being cruell, mercilesse and sauage, euen
as are bruite beastes: and which is worst of
all in being professed inuentors of newe
sinnes, and open maintainers of wicked
and lewd men. In this catalogue of the
encrease of sinne against the second part
of the lawe of God, and of nature, the
Apostle inserteth one sinne of the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to wit, that many of the gentils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
haters of God. Whereas man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
hath a kinde of deuout loue vnto
his God: for so we are to distinguishe the
fall of man, from the fall of the wicked
angels, as in other respectes so also in
this, that they by reason of the great
measure of naturall strength and grace which
was giuen vnto them, fell from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree of holinesse into the contrarie
extremitie of sinne, being nowe so farre
from louing God as they did before, that
they beare a most desperate and extreame
hatred vnto him, as to their deadly enimie,
desiring and endeuoring by all meanes
to hurte and despite him by obscuring his
glorie: whereas man naturally and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
hath a blinde affection towardes
God, desiring both to worshippe and to
honour him. If we desire examples of this
increase of sinne, although it hath not place
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7415:209"/>
in all vnregenerate men, of whome some
doe diminish their sinfulnesse by meanes
either of naturall or of spirituall giftes as
hath bene declared, and farre mo doe so
restraine it that it cannot encrease, in the
which ranke all men outwardly and ciuilly
honest may be reckoned, yet there is no
age, country or story which doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
many examples of men who haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in impietie against God, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice
towarde men and in all manner of
wicked behauiour, the ordinarie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sorte of sinfull men by manie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p>The cause of this encrease of sinne, is the
crooked and corrupt diposition of mans wil,
which is wholly bent and set vpon sinne,
and doth so greedely and insatiably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
after it, as that vnlesse it be restrained
by some meanes, it can not rest, till it
come to the highest degree of wickednes.
For the which purpose it imployeth all the
partes and faculties of the body and soule:
yea all inwarde and outwarde blessings what
soeuer: it maketh the minde deuise newe
wayes of commiting sinne, newe excuses,
pretenses, coulours and defences for it,
being commited: so that the greater gifts
of the minde and of body that a man hath
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7415:210"/>
ceaued, the fitter instrumentes hath his
will and his corrupt desires to encrease
sinne. Here of it commeth, that not idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,
simple and vnlearned men, not the
weakest in body, or the basest in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not the poorest nor the youngest,
but the most witty, learned, strong, noble,
rich, aged are these notorious wicked ones.
The most horrible monsters in all outrage
of sinne, which any story doth menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were greate Emperours and mighty
men, as <hi>Nero, Caligula</hi> and such other, and
who are so wretched, couetous, worldly,
so peruerse and obstinate in ignoraunce, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
infidelitie, yea in hatred of all
goodnesse, as are they who by yeares haue
gotten wisedome, experience, riches, and
honour, so that we may easely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>Hence it is that sinne doth more abound
in this last age of the worlde, then it did

this froward &amp; godlesse generation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we liue.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as the excellencie of naturall
giftes and outward blessings, being abused,
is the meanes of the excessiuenesse of
sinne, not of it selfe but by the corrupt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of our nature; so the spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God, bestowed vpon men liuing in
the Church, doe often by the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, worke the same effect, and
that in far greater measure. For as it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that among heathen men, they who are
of smal wit, capacity, knowledge, strength,
and riches, should be wicked in so high a
degree as they who excell in the foresaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes:
so it is not possible that any, who
hath not receiued some of the spirituall
graces of God, shoulde come to so high a
degree of sinne, as they in whome it hath
pleased God to worke that shadowe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
which hath beene declared in
the former chapter. Hence it is that none
can fall into that extreame impiety which is
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7415:211"/>
the highest degree of sinne, euen the sinne
of the deuill and his Angels, called in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the sinne against the holy Ghost, which
can neuer be forgiuen, but they who did
sometime before receiue grace from God,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 5.</note>
to see, loue and obey the trueth, <hi>Heb. 6. 5.
It is impossible, that they who were once made
partakers of the holy Ghost if they fall,</hi> namely
into this sinne, which is an open, wilfull and
desperate hatred of God, of his glory, of his
religion, of his feruants and of all good
thinges (as many of the hebrewes did to
whome this was written) <hi>should be renewed
by repentance.</hi> This excellency of spirituall

and happeneth not but in those, who for
their cruell, spitefull, desperate and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
hatred to God and to the godly, are

not in full possession of happinesse in heauen,
yet past al peraduenture of perishing here
on earth, yet it commeth often to passe,
that such fearefull tempestes are raised by the
malice of sathan, the vnrulinesse of the flesh,
and the entismentes of the worlde, that
both the faithfull themselues and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
beholding them doe not without
cause feare shipwracke of faith and of good
conscience, and so the losse of eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
the which pretious iewell they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in these weake vessels. For as sometime
they are by the grace of God, and the
powerfull workeing of his spirite, euen lifted
vp to heauen in the aboundaunce of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
graces, and the great measure of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
wherewith they are endued: so at
other times they are by the frailtie of the
fleshe plunged into grieuous sinnes, and so
in a manner cast downe into hel as men void
of all goodnesse. This commeth to passe
first and cheifely by the will and pleasure of
God, withdrawing the assistaunce of his
spirit from the faithfull man, and so leauing
him to the temptations of sathan and his
owne flesh, suffereth him to fall not to his
destruction, but for the encreasing of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
For euen as a man by his intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7415:213"/>
or any other kinde of misgouerning his
body falling into some daungerous sickenes,
hath after his recouery more perfect helth, &amp;
greater strength then he had before his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
because he is now schooled &amp; taught
by wofull experience to know his owne
strength which he seeth now to be but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereof he did presume so much be
fore and whatsoeuer thing is of force either
to preserue or to impaire his health, and so to
be carefull and diligent in vsing the one, &amp;
wary in auoiding the other: so fareth it with
a christian in regard of the spirituall health
of his soule: for he being now by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God: raised vp from some grieuous
fall, receiueth a greate encrease of holines
and of spirituall graces. He seeth his own
weaknes, how vnable he is of himselfe to
resist temptation, or the corrupt motions
of his owne flesh, and so he is humbled
both in respect of God and of his brethren,
which is a grace much esteemed in the
eyes of God. Further he becommeth more
carefull in auoiding all occasions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations
of sinne, and in vsing all holie
exercises of hearing the word, of praying
and all other means whereby he may be
strengthned and encrease in holinesse. Hence
is is that this decrease of holinesse is in a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7415:213"/>
manner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the faithful, although
not in the same measure. For so it plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth
God to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at one time or other to
themselues and to the temptations of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
that so he may both see what is in
them,<note place="margin">2 Cro. 32. 31.</note> as he did to <hi>Ezechias 2. Chro.</hi> 32. 31.
and also shewe to them their greate weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The means of this decrease is the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
malitiousnes of that old serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who goeth
about continually seeking which of the
faithfull he may most hurt, vsing al that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which God graunteth vnto him &amp; imploy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
his whol time about no other busines, but
in putting euill motions into the mindes and
willes of men, and in casting baites before
their eyes and other senses wherewith to
catch them. Secondly this decrease com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by reason of the reliques of sin which
remaine in the faithfull, as long as they
remaine in the flesh, and which doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
send forth som sinne or other, euen
as the roote of a tree being left in the ground
will sproute forth although the bodie of the
tree be cut downe. Hither we are to referre
the manifould occasions of all manner of
sinnes, which doe offer them selues in the
course of manslife, and therefore it is no
maruaile that there happen to a Christian,
manifould chaunges, and decreases of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:7415:214"/>
no more then it is, that a man is
wounded being in the midst of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
malicious enimies, that he is scorched
who is forced to cary fier in his bosome,
or lastly that he is defiled, who is alwayes
among vessels ful of pitch.</p>
               <p>But to declare this doctrine more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
as the greate vse and necessitie of
it doth require: in that we speake of the
decrease of renewed holinesse, we suppose
a certaine state and ripenesse, which ought
to be in all Christians, and is to be seene in
most of those men who are truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
which is a holy and vnblamable
life proceeding from a sanctified soule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
endued in some good measure with all
and euerie one of those partes of holynesse
which haue beene described in the thirde
sections, of the first and second partes of this
treatise. This state may be called the ripe
age of a Christian, who as he doth from his
infancie and childhoode (whereof hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
grow vp till he come to a ripe man
in Christ: so when he is come to this state,
he doth not there stand at a stay, for there
is not any setled estate in this life, either
of holinesse or of sin) but somtimes groweth
on to a greater measure of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of
in the next chapter) or else he decreaseth
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7415:214"/>
in holinesse, and so groweth backward, euen
as we see it to come to passe in the bodies
of men, which being come to their ripnes
do daily decrease in strength and vigour,
till at the length they become as weake &amp;
impotent as they were in their first infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
This decrease is now to be considered in
the diuerse kindes of it which are two, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and Generall, Particular decrease
is when as some one part of holinesse is lost,
the other remaining: for although no one
part of holinesse can be wanting, but the
whole soule of man is the worse in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as we knowe that if any one member
of the bodie be brused or maimed all the
rest doe suffer with it, yet one part either
of bodie or soule may be out of order the
whole being in the naturall disposition.</p>
               <p>This particular decrease hath many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The first is when as the holinesse of
a man regenerate doth faile in some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
action, by giuing place vnto some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
and palpable sin. For as for light &amp;
small offences commited in thought, inword
and in some kindes of deeds, these are not
to be accounted any decrease of holines,
because they cannot be auoided, but will
alwaies, be found euen in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who are endued
with the greatest measure of sanctification
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7415:215"/>
but great sins such as are murther, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
theft, periurie or any other of that sort,
are seldome found in men truly regenerate,
and being founde they doe impaire the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
holinesse of their liues, For no man
doth account that life so holy wherein grosse
sinnes are somtimes found, as that which is
without spot of grieuous sin. This decrease
doth often happen to the faithfull, as we
know <hi>Peter</hi> sinned by denying Christ, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
by committing adulterie and murther,
<hi>Noah</hi> in drunkennes, <hi>Lot</hi> in incestand many
others in other kinds of sins, being thereto
caried by the force of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, as in a great
tempest by a mightie gale of winde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could be thinke themselues,
what they were about to doe, or what would
be the issue of it. Whereof it commeth, that
this decrease of holinesse, staying it selfe
in one or a few actions, doth not necessarily
argue any inward want of the contrarie
grace, or anie inward decrease of holinesse,
either going before or following after: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a man may fall into it as of a sudden,
before he be aware, and immediatly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his former station by true and vnfained
repentance. As we are not to iudg either <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid</hi>
voide of continencie for that adulterie
committed with <hi>Berseba,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> to haue
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7415:215"/>
wanted faith, because he did at one time
renounce the faith, or <hi>Noah</hi> to haue beene
an intemperate person, because he was once
drunke, no more then we are to thinke him
a weake man, who stumbleth by chaunce
at a blocke lying in his way, and yet doth
streight way saue himselfe from falling.
Yea sudden sinne may be with greater
graces, then they haue who are free
from the aforesaide sinnes of <hi>Noah, Lot,
Dauid, Peter,</hi> being farre inferior in
holinesse to them. Yet it is the dutie of all
who professe themselues the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God,
to labour by all meanes to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
pure and free as from the least and most
secret sin, so especially from open &amp; grosse
sins: and that for these causes.</p>
               <p>First because by them they dishonour God,
his religion, worshippe and name, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mouthes of Atheistes and infidels to
blaspheme his holy name: the which thing
ought to be more grieuous and bitter vnto
them then a thousand deathes and torments.
Secondly they prouoke God to lay some
fearefull punishment vppon them: who
howsoeuer he suffereth the reprobate ones
to goe on all their life time in sinne, yet he
neuer suffereth any notorious sinne of his
seruantes to goe vnpunished. Thirdly, they
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7415:216"/>
wound their owne consciences by a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
expectation of Gods heauie iudgmentes,<note place="margin">Of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
they grieue the holy spirite, against whose
will they commite that sinne, they offend
their brethren, shewing themselues to be
if not wholly destitute of that speciall grace,
wherewith they shoulde haue bene restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from sinne, yet but weake Christians in
that respect, as we may be bold to iudge
that the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> the continency of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> the temperaunce of <hi>Noah,</hi> were
at the time of their falles but weake, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they were endued with a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of other graces. Lastly one hainous
sin is to be auoyded, because vsually it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
moe after it; for when as a man hath once
taken a tast of sinne, and felt the sensuall
sweetnes of it, he is farre more easely drawen
to it, then he was before, and so he goeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the first degree of the decrease of holynes to
the second, namely, to an habit of some one
sin, or the want of some particular grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
which appeareth by the often committing
and iterating of the same sinne, yea after that
the faithfull man hath often by repentaunce
laboured to purge himselfe from that sinne,
and by prayer to obtaine the contrarie
grace at the handes of God. This decrease
also hath somtimes place in a man truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7415:216"/>
especially in that kinde of sinne
whereunto he is either by the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of his body and minde, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
custome gotten before his conuersion,
naturally enclined, whether it be pride, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
couetousnesse, or any other sinne. But
as it is farre more grieuous then the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
so it is with greater care to be avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for it doubleth and tripleth the wrath
and heauy iudgementes of God, the offence
of the godly, the reproach of the gospell, the
dishonour of God, and the corsiue of a
gnawing conscience: and Lastly it maketh
a ready way for higher degrees of decrease
to wit the habites of diuers sinnes, the want
of many particular graces, and so to the
highest and most fearefull degree, which
is a generall decrease of holynesse: which
is nowe briefly to be declared.</p>
               <p>Where first we are to put a difference
betwixt a generall, and a totall decrease: A
generall decrease is when all the partes of
renewed holynesse, and of spirituall
graces receaued, are diminished: but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
decrease is an vtter decay of holinesse,
as whereby nothing is left. This can not
happen to any one who is truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
who in the greatest extremitie and
depth of his fall, retaineth some reliques
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7415:217"/>
of Gods spirite and of grace receaued, yea
somelife of faith whereby he liueth to God
in christ, howsoeuer he be to the eyes of
all men, and euen in his owne coscience a
deade rotten stocke. Euen as we know that
the trees haue heate and life in their rootes
in the middest of the coldest and sharpest
winter, yea as many beastes ly all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
long in holes of the earth, without eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
drinking, stirring or hauing any
iotte of heate, sense or life in any of their
outwarde partes, and yet there is a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of life and of heat lurking in the hearte
which being in sommer stirred vppe doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
the beast, so that it is able to go or runne
vp and downe, and to performe all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
actions, in the same manner as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
This Christ doth plainely teache <hi>Ioh.</hi>
4. 14.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4, 14.</note> saying, <hi>Whosoeuer drinketh of the water
which I shall giue him</hi> (that is, whosoeuer

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 9.</note> and 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 9. Whosoeuer is borne
of God sinneth not</hi> (totally) <hi>for the seed
of God remaineth in him,</hi> and therefore he
can not fall cleane away from <hi>God, because
he is borne of God,</hi> yet a man regenerate
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7415:217"/>
may decrease not onely in one, in a fewe, or
in many graces, but also generally in all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
graces.</p>
               <p>This decrease of renewed holynesse,
is of two kindes, for as of bodilie disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
some begin at the hart which is the
roote and fountaine of life in the body, and
so spreade themselues ouer all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body: others haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in some outwarde and inferiour
partes and pierce in till that they come to
the hearte: so of these generall decreases of
holynesse, which are as grieuous diseases
of the soule, some begin at faith which is
the roote and fountaine of spirituall life,
and so hauing stopt the fountaine, doe
easily drie vp the streames issuing from it:
others begin at the meaner and baser partes
of sanctification, and so first kill the fruite
then the braunches and the body of the
tree, til at length they take hold of the roote
it selfe. Both these waies doth sathan vse
to destroy this wounderfull worke of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
wrought in the faithfull by the
spirite of God. The first way is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and readiest, for if faith once faile, all
holinesse falleth to the grounde: whereas
faith may stand in some sorte, although
most of the other partes of santification
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7415:218"/>
be wanting as the body may liue although
it lacke the armes, legges and other partes:
but if the heart be once wounded, death is
then hard at hand, and therefore Sathan doth
most of all and in the first place, labour to
ouerthrow the faith of the faithfull man,
desiring to strike through the hart at the
first stroke, that so as <hi>Abisai</hi> sayeth, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi>
26. 8.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>but he had
praied for him, that his faith,</hi> whereat sathan
woulde directly strike, <hi>shoulde not faile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The weapons wherwith he vseth to strike at
faith, are many and diuerse; as namely these;
First the crosses and miseries of this present
life which God layeth on his children for
the triall of their faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.<note place="margin">Pet. 1. 7.</note> But they
feeling them bitter, and after a sorte intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to flesh and bloud, labour by earnest
and continuall prayer as also by all other
meanes to be freede from them. The which
thinge when as they cannot bring to passe,
being suffered to languishe, yea often to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe
outwardly in their troubles, they
straight way are moued by sathan to thinke
that God hath forsaken them, and that there
is no helpe or good thing to be looked for at
his handes. This pollicie sathan himselfe
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7415:218"/>
doth bewray and confesse, <hi>Iob. 1. 11
Doth Iob feare God for nought? thou hast
blessed him in all thinges, but lay thy hand vpon
him in outward crosses and thou shalt see
that he will be so</hi> farre off from trusting in
thee,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>that hee will curse thee to thy
face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The temptation is then most force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
when as the faithfull in their greatest
miseries are exasperated, and, as it were, haue
their teeth set on edge by the great prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the wicked: insomuch that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repent themselues that they haue not
chosen that course &amp; manner of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they see them to flourish. But it is to be
withstood by considering that God doth
chastice his children, and purge them in the
furnace of afflictions, that so he might make
glorious and heauenly vessels of them
whereas the wicked are as sheepe fed fat
against the day of slaughter: that they are
by this meanes made conformable to Christ
their head: that the greatest afflictions of
this world are not to be compared to the
eternall happines of the life to come: &amp; that

life haue pleasure and the godly paine: so in
the world to come the godly shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
and the other tormented. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7415:219"/>
they are to be vndoubtedly perswaded
of the trueth of that which we reade,

I know that in the ende it will be wel with them
that feare God, and with no other.</hi> Againe the
faith of the godly is often tempted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
had of the impossibilities of the
doctrine of the gospell, as of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of dead bodies. For so by measuring
the trueth of God by their owne shallowe
reason, they stagger at it, and sometimes
fall flat downe. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and

in the scripture was already past, and
so they did subuert the faith of many: but
for this we are to knowe, that nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to God. The thirde temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the obscure, secret and hidden man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Gods working in these last ages:
wherein he hauing reuealed himselfe fullie
in his sonne, and in the gospell, doth hide
himselfe from the eyes euen of the faithfull,
in that he doth not appeare so in visions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations,
dreames, the giftes of miracles
in temporall punishmentes and blessings o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in any other sensible manner, but suffereth
all thinges to goe on and worke after their
owne inclinations, as namely, tyrants to rage
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:7415:219"/>
and oppresse his Church, to persecute his
people, to erect idolatrie, to deface his
worship, to blaspheme his name, so as if
he had cleane cast off the care of all things
here in this world. But this ought not to
trouble vs, for sensible apparitions, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
and actions were for the infancie of
the Church which now is come to her ripe
age, and yet the actions of God are no lesse
wonderful then before: yea they are as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to spirituall eyes, as euer they were to the
carnall eyes of men. The last weapon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Sathan striketh at faith, is ministred
vnto him by the faithfull themselues, to wit,
their manifould and grieuous sins, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those whereinto they fall againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
hauing often repented them, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they cannot by any meanes get the vpper
hand. Here Sathan thinketh that he hath as
much aduantage against the faithfull, as he
himselfe desireth. For in the other temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he did feight against the word of God
the which now he seemeth to haue on his
side, for whereas the scripture doth euerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
teach, that all who are iustified are
sanctified from a sinfull, life, and haue
power giuen them by the spirite of GOD
to resist and mortifie sinne, especially great
and hainous sins, hereof he inferreth after
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:7415:220"/>
this manner: thou hast no such power or
grace to resist sinne, thou canst not for thy
life abstaine from committing it, but doest
adde one fal to another, one sin to another,
euen against thine owne conscience &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy faith is nothing but eyther meere hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
and vnbeleefe, or at the most, it is but
some light shadowe of faith, which may be
found in many reprobates. This argument
is harde to be answered, and therefore it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
many faithfull men to their wittes end,
and euen to despaire of themselues, and of
the loue and mercy of God, which is a
most fearefull thing, killing all holinesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at the roote, and therefore to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by all meanes, especially by learning,
if we be as yet ignorant, how to answere
this argument thus cunningly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by Sathan. The best answere that
can be made is, that he who is thus
tempted, laboure by fasting, prayer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
reading, meditating, and hearing
of the word of God, by auoyding all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of sinne and diligent waying the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and manifolde euils ensuing of it, to
purge himselfe of the sinne wherewith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
doth so buffet him: and so to wring his
weapon by force out of his hand. But if
this cannot be brought to passe, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:7415:220"/>
the faithfull cannot get the maistery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their sinnes, and the corrupt desires of
the flesh, then we must answere, that a true
and sauing faith may be at some time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some fruite, as the trees are in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
season, as appeareth manifestly by the
examples of diuerse faithfull men, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Dauid</hi> that notable man, who did not
onely commit adultery which is a most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
sinne, the harme whereof cannot by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes be amended, yea and added
murther to it a more horrible sinne; but also
as may be probablie gathered, seemeth to
haue continued long in these sinnes without
repentance. Yet no man denieth but that
he was at that time and long before truely
regenerate, and endued with true faith. But
heere Sathan will reply and say, if it be so,
that sauing faith may be ioyned with a sinful
life, what difference is there betwixt the
elect and the reprobate, who may haue
a barren faith, yea a faith which will bring
foorth the fruite of an vnblameable life?
how knowest thou that the tree hath life,
but by the fruit, or that thou art in any better
state then a reprobate or then I my selfe,
who doe beleeue and tremble? To this he
maketh answere in this wise: I know and
confesse that no true faith is fruitlesse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:7415:221"/>
is my faith so: For first I doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the time when as my faith did bring forth
plentifull fruites in all respectes, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
God and my brethren, my life
being free from the least spot of any greate
sinne, and I trust to see that time againe ere
long. Yea euen at this time wherein it hath
pleased God to humble me by giuing
thee power to tempt and ouercome me,
there is difference betwixt me and any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
reprobate whatsoeuer: for my
life is not defiled with many sinnes, seeing
thou canst not charge me with any saue
only this or that sin: to the which I doe giue
place not alwaies but seldome, not of any
obstinate wilfulnesse but of humaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
not of set purpose, but against my
will, &amp; my flat resolution, hauing often fully
determined with my selfe neuer to commit
it. Yea I will neuer cease fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsing al meanes
possible of being freed from it: neither will
I euer thinke my selfe in good case, or that
I can stoppe thy mouth, till by the mercie
of God that be fully brought to passe. Thus
much of the temptations of faith, the which
because of the great danger, wherevnto the
faithfull are brought by them, are called by
the Apostle, <hi>Eph. 6. 16, The fierie dartes of
Sathan.</hi>

                     </gap>phe. 6. 16.</note> Now to proceed: from this decrease
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7415:221"/>
of faith whether it be lesse or greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the like decrease of euerie part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
holines, euen as the diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peratures of
the heart, and the hurt of the roote of a tree,
haue place in all the members of the bodie,
and in the whole stocke and euerie seuerall
branch of the tree. For as, where there is
no faith, there is no holinesse, so where there
is litle faith, there is litle holinesse, as hath
beene declared more at large in the chapter
of faith.</p>
               <p>There remaineth the other kinde of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
decrease, to wit, that wherein first the
inferiour partes of sanctification are dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and afterwardes faith it selfe: the
which way although it be not so readie and
dangerous as the former, yet it is more v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual:
for as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a theife goeth about to spoile
any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his goods, if he offer to break in at
the broadside of his house, he is streghtway
espied &amp; receiueth the repulse, but if he vnder
mine the house, he may be within it, and
on the dweller before he be aware: so when
as Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth as it were blu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to a christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an,
and doth at the first dash moue him to
forsake and renounce God by infidelitie, his
malicious purpose is soone espied, &amp; for the
most part so carefully resisted, that he hath
not any hope euer to preuaile by that means
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7415:222"/>
and to robbe the regenerate man of his
renewed holinesse: so that he is driuen to
take an other way by the end (for he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
giue ouer) &amp; to go more closely to work.
First therefore whereas the faithfull man is
not only godly, after the vsuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
manner in abstaining from grosse sins
and performing those duties which are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for at the handes of euerie Christian,
but also is verie forward and zealous in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God, in setting forth his glorie, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the good of his Church, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of his brethren, he maketh him
to be wearie of this kinde of life, and at length
to giue it quite ouer: yet so, as that he yet
remaineth as sincere a Christian, as vnbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
in life and as diligent in seruing God
as neede to be: only whereas before he was
more forward then was needfull, (as Sathan
will make him beleeue) and too busie in
setting forth the gospell of Christ by all
means so farre as his calling did permit, now
he imployeth all his time and care in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
his owne safty, ease, pleasure, wealth
and honour, all which he did verie much
neglect before: yet not by any euill means,
but so far forth as a Christian may do lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and with a good conscience. Afterward
the same temptation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing, the loue of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7415:222"/>
God and the practise of godlinesse doth
daily decrease, till at length he become af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a sort benummed, dead, &amp; euen keycold
in matters of religion, giuing himselfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the seeking and inioying of worldly
pleasures, so as if he looked for no other
happinesse: whereby it commeth to passe,
that his faith and affiance in God doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decaye. Thus the Apostle writeth 1.
<hi>Timo.</hi> 5. 11. 12.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 11. 12.</note> That many younger wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

minister to the Church as they had done
somtimes. And this he plainly affirmeth of
<hi>Demas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> 2. <hi>Timo. 4. 10. That he had forsaken
him,</hi> and the affaires of the Church, <hi>and had
embraced this present world.</hi> And this may
be seene in many Christians, whose faith,
loue, godlinesse, and zeale compared at
one time with that measure of grace which
sometimes appeared in them, will seeme
to be nothing at all.</p>
               <p>This kind of decrease happeneth especially
in the time of prosperitie and of age. For as
affliction and miserie doe strike at the fayth
of a Christian; so the inioying of worldly
pleasures in the time of prosperitie doth
diminish the other partes of sanctification
by the immoderate and vnlawfull seeking
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7415:223"/>
and vsing of earthly pleasures. Likwise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this decrease may happen in any
part of the life, as hath beene declared of
the younger widowes, yet most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is seene whenas Christians are som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
growne in yeares, &amp; haue gotten great
wisdome and experience in the worlde (the
which doth by litle &amp; little steale away the
heart of man from God to it selfe, if great
watchfulnesse and care be not had) and are
more linked and wedded to it then youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
men, although in all reason they should
esteeme lesse of it. This appeareth in the
examples of the kinges of <hi>Iuda,</hi> of whom
many did in their age loose their first loue of
God and of his worshippe. Thus did <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Rehaboam, Asa, Ioas, Achasia</hi> and
<hi>Huzzia.</hi> Lastly this kinde of decrease, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not so violent, as is that other
which beginneth at faith, yet in this one
respect it is more daungerous, namely,
because it cannot so soone be amended and
repaired. For as it vseth to be many yeares in
growing before it come to the full, so it
gathereth to it selfe the strength of many
reason, pretenses, defenses, worldly polices
and shifts, by the which a man flattereth
himselfe in that palpable decrease, as if
he were in as good an estate as euer he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:7415:223"/>
So that we may compaire the decrease
of faith, to a violent feuer, the which as it
may soone kill a man, so it may soone be
amended: but this latter kinde is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a lingering consumption, wherein as a
man pineth away by little and little, not on
a suddaine, but liuing in it for the space of
many yeares, so he cannot be cured of it
but in some longe space, because it is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in all the members of his body. Yet
both these kindes of decreases are most
fearefull conditions, and those, from the
which it standeth euery Christian in hande
dayly to desire the Lorde for his mercy sake
in Christ to deliuer him, and rather to take
him out of this world being in the state of
perfect godlinesse, then to suffer him to
fall so grieuously: as no doubt he doth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his deare seruauntes.</p>
               <p>Lastly it may here be asked what is the
issue of these great falles, which happen to
the faithfull, whether they continue in them
till death, or else recouer their former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
We aunswer, that God as he doth
for a time humble them vnder the tiranny
of sinne, Sathan, and their owne corrupt
fleshe, so he doth in his good time, shewe
forth the powerfull and mighty vertue of his
holy spirit, which all this while lyeth lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7415:224"/>
in the heartes of the faithfull, being
in the first moment of their regeneration
giuen vnto them, as an vnseparable guide
and ruler, to bring them through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde
temptations of Sathan and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunces
of their saluation to the glorious
presence of God in heauen. By this meanes
it commeth to passe, that the faithful man
doth after long struggling with his enimies,
yea after that he hath bene a long time in
bondage vnder them, yea cleane dead in
outward appearaunce, not onely recouer
his former degree of holinesse, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more strong in all spirituall graces,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 40. 29.</note>
then he was before, as we reade, <hi>Es.</hi> 40. 29.
God will giue strength to him that is cleane
wearied, so that he shal goe from strength to
stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gh &amp; renew his age as doth the eagle, he
shall bring fourth more fruite in his age, and
become more zealous in seruing God,
then he was at any time before. Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
it pleaseth God to make an end of these
spirituall conflictes, not by withdrawing
the force of the temptation from the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but by taking them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; out of this
worlde, which is the kingdom of sathan,
to that state wherein they shall no more
be troubled with any such temptation, as
may endaunger their saluation. So that the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:7415:224"/>
faithfull doe sometimes departe this life, as
in the middest of temptation, so in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of holinesse. Yet we are not to doubt
of their saluation: for he that is once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
and vnited to Christ by a true faith,
as all the regenerate are, whether he dy in
a holy life, or in some sinne, whether in
repentaunce or in impenitency, whether in
full assuraunce of faith or in much doubting,
yea although he seeme to despaire of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
alwaies he dieth in Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the fauour of God and in the state
of eternall life. For in the greatest decrease
of holinesse which can befall to a faithfull
man, there remaineth some sparkes of grace:
but especially the loue of God, of his glory
and of his children will shewe it selfe, (and
also the roote of faith, otherwise perhaps
inuisible) in the greatest agonie or tempest
of temptation whatsoeuer.</p>

wherein no Christian ought to rest as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himselfe with that small measure of
grace, but ought rather to be caried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to perfection. Especially seing that
this state of spirituall infancy is easely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
and brought to nothing by the
malice of sathan, it being weake, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:7415:226"/>
not able to resiste the force of temptation.
And therefore although some doe abide
longe in this weake estate and perhaps end
their dayes in it, yet vsually God giueth to
those who are truely regenerate, a daily
increase &amp; a newe supply of grace: insomuch
that in a competente time they become of
ripe age and of perfect strength in Christ.
Wherevnto a christian is then come, when
as he is not destitute of any grace needfull

and vnblamable, proceeding from those

               <p>And yet this perfect estate of a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

and beyond that measure of grace,
which the faithfull doe ordinarely attaine

in the minde is called <hi>Plerophoria,</hi> a certaine

that is, encreaseth aboue the
common and ordinarie measure, and that
their loue did abounde accordingly. This
aboundaunce of grace is to be seene in the

other of the seruantes of God, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are made types and patterns for vs to
imitate and set before our eyes, as lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes

blazing starres, that we might both admire
and labour to ouertake them in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
graces, and especially in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
vertues. For thus the scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
the vprightnesse of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with God in all his waies,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 11.</note> the patience
of <hi>Iob. Iam.</hi> 5. 11, the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the

of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the zeale of <hi>Phinies, Iosias</hi> and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:7415:227"/>
many others. Thus <hi>Paule</hi> mentioneth his
owne painefulnesse in preaching the gospel
to be farre aboue the labours of the rest of
the Apostles. Thus he sayeth, <hi>Rom 16. 7. That
Andronicus and Iunia were men notable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Apostles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 7.</note> and of <hi>Timothie,</hi> that none

               </p>
               <p>The notes and markes, whereby this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
may be knowen, are these; a burning
zeal of gods glorie, of setting forwarde his
worship and gospel, a vehement hatred of
idolatrie, and all shadowes of superstition, a
tender and bountifull loue toward the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a minde vndaunted with any torment,
death or miserie, a constant course of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
in all outward chaunges whatsoeuer,
as the Apostle sayeth of him selfe, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.
13.<note place="margin">Philip. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>That he coulde want and abounde, be full
and empty, and that he coulde do all thinges:</hi> a
life free from any grosse sinne, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
contempt of all worldly pleasures. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a manner of freedom from being either
ouercome, or almost tempted by any grosse
sinne. For although the corruption of flesh,
and the impudencie of Sathan who was not
ashamed to tempt Christ to commit sin, be
so great that no man be he nener so holy,
may lay away his weapons, and be secure
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7415:227"/>
in respect of temptations, yet by the blessing
of God and a long practise of all godlinesse,
the faithfull come sometimes to such a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
strength in grace, that as the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
horse going into the battel, scorneth
the feareful sounds &amp; noyse of the trumpets:
so this godly man (wherof we speake in this
chapter) laugheth at the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and the entisementes of the world yet
not presuming on his owne strength, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
himselfe wholly on the mighty power
of the spirite of God.</p>
               <p>The meanes of attaining to this high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of holinesse, is to seeke it by earnest
prayer at the handes of God, from whom
onely commeth euery good and perfect
gift. But the meanes which God vseth in
giuing it, are diuerse: some good, some euil
in themselues, and therefore not to be vsed
by vs: of the first sort are all holy exercises
appointed by God, for the begetting &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
encrease of grace: to the carefull, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
long and continuall vse whereof, God
doth often graunt this happie successe, euen
as he blesseth the diligent and painfull hand
with greate plenty in temporall thinges. Of
the second sort is the abundaunce of sinne
before regeneration, the which it pleaseth
God, some time to chaunge into this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:7415:228"/>
of grace, as we see that the highest
floudes follow the lowest ebbes. This God
doth to make manifest the great power and
efficacy of his spirit in renewing the elect:
which is able to bringe the greatest measure
of holinesse, out of the greatest wickednes,
as cleare light out of palpable darkenes. This
Christ teacheth vs.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>ers. 47.</note> sowhere sinne
doth abound, there grace aboundeth much
more. Yea for this purpose God doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vse the hote fiercenesse of affections,
and the violent disposition of nature, the
which as of it selfe it carieth a man head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into the most outragious sinnes: so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sanctified by Gods spirite, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the whetstone of holinesse. Thus was
the Apostle <hi>Paule,</hi> both naturally and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
affected: and therefore being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell,
he was a most superstitious pharisie
more then mad in persecuting the church,
and becomming a faithfull man, passed all
others in vnquenchable zeale of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.
Lastly as touching this abundance
of grace, no man can attaine so high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:7415:228"/>
of it, as that he may sitte downe as
being at his iorneis end: but as the greater
riches that a man hath the greater is his
gaine, desire and encrease of riches, so the
more holinesse that any man hath, the more
carefully ought, and the more fruitfully may
he laboure in encreasing it. <hi>Phil. 3. 13. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
saieth the Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I count not that I

still I doe forget that which is behinde, and

which is in no wise to be admitted, would
of necessitie follow, that man doth not in
regeneration recouer as good a state and as
great a measure of holinesse by the mercy

and lost by his owne sinne in <hi>Adam.</hi>
And therefore we are to goe on a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this treatise, and in our desire till we
come to such an absolute perfection of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
holinesse, as is free from the least
spot of sinne whatsoeuer. This perfection
may without all question, yea must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
be attained vnto. For man can not be
perfectly happie by enioying the presence
of God, into the which nothing being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
can enter, as long as he is imperfectly
holy. Yet he that seeketh for it in this world,
doth no otherwise then if he shoulde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to finde out in some parte of the earth,
a mine of so pure golde, as is not mixed
with earth, base mettall, or any manner of
drosse. And therefore we are with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> to thinke that the grace of
God is sufficient for our saluation although
it be not altogether free from sinne. And as
for this angelicall purity, it is to be hoped
for not in this worlde, but in heauen where
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:7415:229"/>
all the faithfull shall both in happinesse and
in holinesse be made like to the angels, yet
it being reuealed in the worde of God,
may be knowen of vs in this life, yea it
being the marke whereat we must ayme
in this life, although we are not to hope to
hit it, it is needefull to be knowen. And
lastly it is to be handled in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is nothing else but the absolute
perfection and highest degree of renewed
holinesse. For as the bodies and the soules
of the faithful shallbe the same in the world
to come, that they are in this world, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
shall their holinesse. Neither can it be
otherwise: For God is the same both in
earth and in heauen, to day and to morrow,
now and for euer. The subiection of the
creature to God, and the image of God in
the creature is the same at all times in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
although some particulars, haue
not so greate vse in the state of perfecte
happinesse as they had before, to wit, all
those the obiectes whereof, are either fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or euill, as namely hope, sorrow, pittie,
and such other affections: yet these also
shall haue both place and vse in the world
to com, although not so greate as the other.
In the which respect, we may declare this
celestiall encrease of renewed holinesse, by
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:7415:230"/>
comparing it with the created holinesse
of mans innocent estate, the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
verie neare vnto it, and is as a mean
betwixt the greatest abundance of holines
which can be had in this life, and this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
holinesse: for as it is greater then the
one, so it is lesse then the other. So that
if we would know what is the holinesse
wherewith the faithfull shallbe endued in
the world to come, and shall shine as the
glorious Angels in heauen, let vs haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to all the first Sections of the two
former parts of this treatise. For al the parts
of the holinesse of mans first estate as well
of his subiection as of his conformitie to
God belong to his last estate in heauen,
wherein man is not exempted from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to God, but still remaineth first his
subiect, and therefore ought to trust and
hope in him, yea to feare him, secondly
his sonne, and therefore he ought to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
imitate and seeke vnto him, and so
in the other kindes of subiection there
declared. Where this is to be noted that of
the two kindes of faith, legall and euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall,
handled in the first part of this
treatise, not the latter but the former is
part of this celestiall holinesse. For in the
life to come, the elect shall be restored to
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:7415:230"/>
that perfect inherent holinesse, wherein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was created: by vertue whereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any inputed righteousnesse borrowed
from anie other, they shall looke for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
euen as the holie Angels doe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for the other part of holinesse, which
we call the conformitie of man to God,
we are not to doubt but that the faithfull
shall in the world to come, haue the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of minde, memorie, will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so disposed, as hath beene declared.
For all these are common to all thinges
which are indued with reason. Now as
touching the difference, it is this, celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
holinesse is more excellent and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the other: for as the bodies of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
shalbe more glorious, pure, and after
a sort spirituall, then was the bodie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
in his innocenceie, as we reade 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 48. So also shall the faculties of the
soule and bodie be more able,<note place="margin">1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

quicke in performing their seuerall duties
and functions. We shal haue more full and

be more like to him as to a father, more
quick in obeying his commaundementes,
as seruants ought to be to their maisters;
our mindes shalbe more capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and more enriched with actuall

the will, although of it selfe it shalbe
