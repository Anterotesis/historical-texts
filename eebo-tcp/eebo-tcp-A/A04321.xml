            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue bin greatly delighted in
the contemplation of the
properties and vertues of this
admirable creature of God
which we call the <hi>Magnet,</hi> or
<hi>Loadstone.</hi> And as my lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and occasions haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by conference from time to time, with the
skilfullest <hi>Nauigators</hi> of our age, by reading all the
Treatises (as came vnto my knowledge) of such
as had written thereof, and therewithall trying by
practise the truth of those things which I doubted
of, and lastly finding some things by my owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of good importance by others not at all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15201:3"/>
mentioned. The chiefe of these which I iudged
profitable for common vse I did set forth in a small
Treatise intituled <hi>Magneticall Aduertisements.</hi> And
although of mine owne louing affection towards
such (as yee are) I haue bin alwaies ready to further
you in these knowledges the best I could, yet I doe
assure you faithfully, that diuers of good iudgment,

according to his owne conceipts, and so supercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to controll (and censure the things which he
vnderstood not) he hath missed of the truth very
farre and wide, and hath herein wronged both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and mee, and his readers, but most of all his
beleeuers; and yet such is his kinde disposition,
that he hath purloyned out of the scambled copie

So that it cannot but seeme to any indifferent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
very strange, that <hi>Doctor Ridley</hi> would publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </gap> my name, no not so much as
once to acknowledge it in all these things which
he hath by stealth learned of mee, and inserted into
his <hi>Magneticall Motions</hi> for his owne, the which
with their consequents if you withdraw from his
Treatise, you will leaue his motions very dull.
For except this <hi>Ridley,</hi> had ploughed with my
Heifor, hee had not knowne my Riddle. <hi>Sic vos
non vobis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my aduertisements indeed, I made mention
that some body had in this manner dealt euilly with
mee, and I reproued certaine faults that some body
had committed, especially in the fundamentall
<hi>Magneticall</hi> heare-sayes of misnaming of the true
North and South, in Magnets and Magneticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and in making the Inclinatory needle with the
one end heauier than the other, and some others:
But these two especially, for because they doe draw
on many others, as they doe both in his Booke, and
wheresoeuer they shall be admitted, they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
like a snow-ball, waxing still greater as they
goe, and all his dawbing of them with his vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
morter in his silly <hi>Animaduersions</hi> do amend
the matter nothing at all, but make it farre worse
than before. For the common good, I might not
let them passe vnreproued, and yet I would not
publikely name him, but vsed this word some body.
The like himselfe hath, <hi>viz.</hi> Some say, some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to cleare, some thinke &amp;c. in his booke mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
mee, being not contented onely to vsurpe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15201:4"/>
that which was properly mine for his owne (as
aforesaid) but also hee tooke vpon him (although
very ignorantly) to confute some of mine vnder
these termes, and this onely out of a stolne Manu-script.
Whereas all men know that Manu-scripts
ought to be vncontrould vntill the Author hath
published them, who may alter and change things
in the meane space as he thinketh good.</p>
            <p>He stileth himselfe principall Phisition vnto the
Emperor of <hi>Russia,</hi> the which many men wonder
at, being so yong as he than was, and supposed that
he went ouer only as Phisition vnto our Merchants
there, that he should in so short a time become that
Emperors principall Phisition. If he were, he sped
better then <hi>Bomelius</hi> did, who is said to haue died
there in that cold climat of the extreamest hot
kinde of Calenture.</p>
            <p>Out of all question, somewhat it is more then
ordinarie, that maketh him of so hauty a spirit, so
to braue the world with such prodigious assertions
of his Magneticals, in, and aboue the Moone; the
earths Magneticall circular Motions, and his paltry
abusing of the holy scriptures to support his luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
fictions vnder the name of Magneticall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie.</p>
            <p>There are yet two texts of Scripture, which it is
a wonder how they escaped him; the one is in
<hi>Iosuah 10. ver.</hi> 12. and the other is in <hi>Esay</hi> 38.
<hi>ver.</hi> 8. In the one: That the Sunne and the Moone
stood still the space of a whole day: The other,
that the shadow in <hi>Achas</hi> diall went backe 10 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15201:5"/>
and the Sunne in the skie returned 10 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
by the which he was descended.</p>
            <p>For it is his guise to make contrary conclusions
vnto that which the Scriptures affirme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
blame him not, if he doe so despise <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
who neuer taught any such Logicke.</p>
            <p>Now therefore that yee may in few words vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the vntruth of the earths <hi>Magneticall Motion,</hi>
that is so mainely emblazoned by him, and the
weaknes of my <hi>Animaduersors</hi> Magneticall skill,
you must know, that the Magneticall Motion is a
naturall inclination of two Magnets or Magneticall
bodies, that may freely moue, respecting the one
the other within the Orbe of their forces with their
convenient ends, that is to say, the North end
of the one alwaies respecting the South of the
other.</p>
            <p>If the two Magnets or Magneticall bodies be of
like quantitie, forme, and goodnes, their Motions
will be of like quicknes of the one towards the
other; but if they differ in any of these, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
will be so much the slower.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch as all Magneticall motions are
alwaies respectiue of the one Magnet or Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
bodie towards another, it followeth by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
consequent, that no Magnet or Magneticall
body, can either moue, or be moued of it selfe, but
is vtterly voide of all intrinsecall or selfe-Motion,
the true and onely cause of his Motion being euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
without it selfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore mine Animaduersors selfe-motion

of the Globe of the earth circularly, by Magneticall
vigour, in the which hee doth so gallantly triumph;
is but an idle figment, and a meere <hi>Chimera:</hi> but his
definition of Magneticall bodies is very sutable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; <hi>viz.</hi> very monstrous; namely, That wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
to be a Magneticall body, which doth remaine
and place it selfe in one place, or kinde of situation
naturall, not alterable, as all starres doe, and the
great Regent globes of <hi>Saturne, Mars, Iupiter,</hi> the
<hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> doe: or such, as with respect
and attendance follow other globes, as the two
starres which support <hi>Saturne;</hi> the foure attendants
vpon <hi>Iupiter,</hi> lately discouered by the truncke-spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle;
the two trauersers about the Sunne, called
<hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> and the Moone, which doth
follow or goe about the earth, and respecteth the
same alwayes with one Pole, and therefore hath a
peculiar Magneticall vertue, that guideth her in this
kinde of situation.</p>
            <q>Auditum admissi, risum teneatis amici,</q>
            <p>Any man that considereth this goodly defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being the foundation and ground of his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall
discourse, and the very first sentence of his
booke, and many the like fancies in his Motions and
and Animaduesions will easily discerne what his
Magneticall skill is, and what a vanity it were for
me, to spend any precious time to confute in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
such vnreasonable and senselesse opinions,
which haue more neede of <hi>Helleborus</hi> to purge them
out of his head, then Arguments to confute them
in his booke. And in his friuolous animaduersions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15201:6"/>
seeking to maintaine his former errours, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so snappish to haue them amended, hee maketh
them ten times worse then they were before, and far
more palpable: But my tetricall Animaduersor
must be ruled by reason, and affoord all those his
patience that do beleeue the holy Scriptures, which
flatly doe denie the Earths motion, and affirme the
motion of the Sunne, Moone &amp; Stars, in the whole
current thereof, as <hi>Psal. 19. 6. 104. 5. Iosua</hi> 10. 12.
13. 14. <hi>Esay 38. 8. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also that hee will giue men leaue to credit their
senses, in matters subiect vnto sense, and not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
vnto reason; and that he will not be offended
with those who do pitifully laugh at his Magneticall
Astronomy, with those topsituruy motions, like
<q>Voluitur Ixion, &amp; se sequitur que fugitque.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For although some great learned men in those
Sciences, have vsed the supposed motion of the
earth, for an Hypothesis, seruing their ready calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
as they haue done also their supposed Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cycles,
for the motions of the Planets and their
courses: yet that is no reason for to auouch them
for to be in themselues true and reall things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto some mens vaine fancies, who doe argue
after this sort.</p>
            <p>It is an easier matter, and more (as they say) agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
vnto nature, for so small a body as the globe of
the Earth is in comparison of the heauens, to mooue
circularly in the space of foure and twenty houres,
then it is for the huge Vniuerse so to doe; and that
which is done with lesse hazard, is to bee preferred
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15201:6"/>
before the like, which may not bee performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare of a greater danger, with diuers other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
like vnto these.</p>
            <p>But although such as these are, may goe current
in a mechanciall Trades-man shop, yet they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
insufficient to bee allowed for good, by men of
learning, and Christians by profession, who know
right well, that it is great folly for to oppose that
which we call difficult, vnto an omnipotent power,
<hi>Who stretcheth out the heauens like a curtaine, and
spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in,</hi> Esay 40. ve. 22.
<hi>He stretcheth out the North ouer the empty, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the earth vpon nothing, &amp;c.</hi> Iob 26. ver. 7.</p>
            <p>And that which we call Nature, it being nothing
else but Gods ordinance; there can bee nothing
contrary, but all things agreeable vnto nature, which
God hath ordained. But God hath ordained the
motion of the Sunne, Moone, and Stars (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd)
and the vnmooueablenesse of the earth; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is more easie, and more agreeable vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which is preserued onely by obeying Gods
ordinance, and heerein onely that consisteth, and
hath her being. And that the earths magneticall
vertue hath no power at all to performe or help any
such motion, as is also before made manifest.</p>
            <p>But that mine Animaduersors magneticall skill
is ascended vp into our Moone it selfe; yea, and yet
higher, farre beyond the Moone, vnto the other
Planets and Starres, and into euery one of them,
this is such a point of his Magneticall Philosophie,
that would make Stupidity it selfe astonished to
heare of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:15201:7"/>There was (as the Poets faine) a certaine King of
<hi>Phrygia,</hi> that had a gift giuen him of the Gods, at
his owne request, that whatsoeuer he touched with
his body should be gold, but by that meanes being
ready to starue, because his victuals were also turned
to gold, he entreated earnestly that he might surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his gift.</p>
            <p>It seemeth that mine Animaduersor endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for to make shew, that he hath a stranger gift;
namely, that by his very lookes (for his lookes, with
his Truncke-spectacle, are his meanes) he can turne
all things to be Magneticall, that hee doth earnestly
behold; He hath scowred the Heauens already, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from the one end vnto the other, that both Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and Stars are become magneticall in his head;
what tumultuous stirre may they breed there, no
man can tell, it is his safest way to confine his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netismes
vnto the earth, as their naturall seat, and
not suffer them to clamber vp into the skies, where
they haue nothing to doe, lest that infinite dispersion
of his magneticall knowledge, doe in the end ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his braine, and make him magnetically mad,
or at the least to incur the censure of him that said,
<q>Delphinum siluis appingit, fluctibus aprum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore whilst his wits are yet his owne, it is
his surest way (like the King of <hi>Phrygia)</hi> to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that gift againe, to leaue his trifling with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, and to bee no more a censuring Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduersor
in matters that he hath but small skill in:
and that he will heereafter learne to be wise vnto so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
<hi>Metirise quemque suo modulo ac pede verum
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15201:7"/>
est.</hi> And forasmuch as his animaduersions containe
nothing at all, of any truth and importance against
mine Aduertisements, but onely many ignorant,
many wilful mistakings, contradictions &amp; cauillings,
and maintainings of his former absurdities, the
which the more they are stirred by him, the more
they stinke. I will content my selfe with this breefe
discouery of this Animaduersor, and his animaduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and so to leaue him for this time peeping in
his truncke-spectacle at his celestiall magneticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
globes, with his proud motto:
<q>Non sufficit orbis.</q>
To try whether he can yet finde vs heere hence any
more new glorious dreames, wherby he may either
encrease the number of the hundred of merry tales,
or els augment the noble history of <hi>Huyn</hi> of <hi>Burgis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he chargeth me opprobriously for
to haue in my Treatise nothing of mine own, but all
of other mens, and some of his: mine answer is, that
he knoweth in his owne conscience (if he haue any)
that hee speaketh a manifest vntruth, contrary vnto
his owne knowledge in both. Yea, I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that if he would but giue his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
leaue to speake out, it would ring him a tale in
his eare vnto this effect: That he himselfe knoweth
right well, that where my knowledge (euen such as
it is) in these matters faileth: all the store of skill
that he hath, cannot aduance it, no not so much as
one strawes bredth, notwithstanding all the great
countenance hee setteth on it, with his swelling ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of his Magneticall bodies and motions, and his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15201:8"/>
Aristarchicall censuring of my Aduertisements.
<q>Nil dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu.</q>
And for my iust defence, I will rehearse but these
few things (yet such as are of principall importance
in this Art) whereas I could name diuers other.</p>
            <p>I was the first that made the inclinatory instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
transparant, and to bee vsed pendant, with a
glasse on both sides, and a ring on the top, whereas
Doctor <hi>Gilberts</hi> hath but of one side, and to bee set
on a foot. And moreouer, I hanged him in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
box, where with two ounces waight he will
be fit for vse at sea.</p>
            <p>Another is, that I was the first that found out
and shewed the difference betweene iron and steele,
and their tempers for magneticall vses, which hath
giuen life and quickning, vniuersally to all magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
instruments whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>I was also the first that shewed the right way of
touching magneticall needles.</p>
            <p>I was the first that found out and shewed the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and cementing of Loadstones.</p>
            <p>I was the first that found out and shewed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why a Loadstone being double capped, must
take vp so great waight.</p>
            <p>These things (yee worthy Gentle-men) haue I
mentioned onely to giue you content and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
For although my magneticall knowledge be
no manner of way gainefull vnto me, as all that are
acquainted with me, know how little I doe esteeme
of it in any such respect, yet forasmuch as I haue
published my Magneticall Aduertisements of my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15201:8"/>
very earnest affection towards such as yee are, and
dedicated them vnto one right worthy Gentle-man
of your Society in steed of all, euen for your sakes
I could not suffer my paines and good will towards
you, to be so scornfully trampled vnder foot (with
out some gaine saying) and pratled out of conceit
with cauilling only, and multiplicity of vaine words
and peeuish brauadoes, The Lord prosper you in
all laudable knowledge and vetuous practise.</p>
            <signed>Yours in all hearty affection,
