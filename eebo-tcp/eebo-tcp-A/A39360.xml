            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF you have any thing to object against the use of
the Book of Common Prayer, (I must confesse
some expressions in the Forme for the Buriall of
the Dead, and for Baptisme are such, that,
though I do not dislike them, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to vindicate them, because I do not finde that
God has directed my minde so much to the study of
those Points): But, Sir, if you have any thing to object
against that Excellent Book (excepting those expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions)
either as a forme of Prayer in generall, or as an
Inconvenient Forme, I have no small confidence that
I shall be able (by Gods assistance) to answer your
Objection: And to give you some occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some Spirituall Notions concerning Prayer,
which possibly (for want of a due reflection upon your
owne Opinion concerning Set Formes, &amp;c.) you have
not yet had; I shall intreat you to write me your
thoughts, as <hi>briefly</hi> as you can with <hi>perspicuity,</hi> and
plainnesse. Sir, I ackuowledge your superiority in
respect of Yeares, and Learning; but yet, let me tell
you, I do not thinke you Infallible, neither so know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but that some of your Brethren, who are much
your Inferiours in <hi>Parts,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> may have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Father of Lights</hi> some particular Portion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41689:4"/>
of sacred Truth, which as yet you have not received.
And therefore, Sir, I beseech you (as you expect that
dreadfull Day, wherein you shall answer for all your
Actions before him that shall <hi>judge the Quicke and the
Dead</hi>) that you would not despise my Youth, and
scorn to send mean Answer. If you convince me, I
doubt not, but the GOD, whom I serve will give me
Grace to acknowledge my selfe Oblig'd to you for it:
And if you do not, I firmely hope there shall be such
an issue of our Controversie; that if you be so pious, as
some good Men take you to be, you will not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for having written to me. Sir, Farewel; And if
you love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, be not so
Uncharitable, as to thinke otherwise, then that 'tis
the love of Him that puts me upon any business of this
nature, which is so great a Trouble to my Outward
Man. I am</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEeing suddenly surprized yesterday with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Letter from an unknown person by a
strange hand, and having made a cursory view
of it, with respect to its contents, I thought it best to
muse a while, and not hastily return; but having since
reviewed againe, I finde these heads observable
therein.</p>
            <p>1. A challenge of me to be an Opponent against an
Excellent book of Common-prayer, wherein, <hi>you have
no small Confidence, that you shall be an able Respondent, &amp;
give some Occasion to conceive some spirituall Notions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Prayer, which possibly (for want of a due reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my owne Opinion concerning Set Formes,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>I have not
yet had.</hi> Sir, I shall be heartily glad to catch at any
reall Notions about the spirit of Prayer, for I want
much of it; but I should strange to see such spirituality
to arise out of the flesh, and of prayer as stated
by men; however I should be glad to see your promise
performed.</p>
            <p>As for my objecting, and your answering, it will be
requisite, that the Question be rightly stated, and to
know what Book you mean, there was that of <hi>Edw</hi>
the sixth, which since hath had many Editions and
Additions to make it unlike it self: and yet of all these
it is asserted by men wiser then my selfe, that none of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41689:5"/>
them are established by Law; which I suppose is a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
whereon you would not a little lean; It were meet
that the speciall Subject were assigned; or perhaps the
quaere may grow higher and more generall, whether
any set Forms as imposed by men, are warranted by
God; and if none, your particular will fall in that:
but I list not to be an Opponent yet, though provoked
by you. I look for an higher Call.</p>
            <p>2. Your censure of me, <hi>as to yeares, &amp;c.</hi> yet you <hi>tell
me, you do not thinke me infallible, nor so knowing, but
some Inferiours in parts and Learning, may receive from
the Father of Lights some portion of sacred Truth, which as
yet I have not received.</hi> All this is truly spoken, I finde
it as well as you say it; yet for saving truth, I trust I
have received, what the Gospel revealeth, though but
in my measure, and I am pressing on. What other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Truth you may intend, I know not, but I am not
so old, but shall be willing to learn any truth of
God.</p>
            <p>3. Your adjuring of me, (<hi>that as I expect that dreadful
day, wherein I shall give an account of all my Actions before
him that shall judge the quicke and the dead) that I despise
not your youth, and scorn to send you an answer.</hi> Sir, I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at Gods Word, and take it well to be minded of
that great day; yet thus to be adjured upon so slight a
matter, as the sending you an answer, I think is more
than you can exemplifie from <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
such a solemn charge upon the highest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I thanke God I despise no mans youth, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
to see them grow in grace; and for your selfe, I
know not how old, or young you be; yet without
scorn, I shall say in Gods presence, among the many
that I have known (if your owne word may be taken)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41689:5"/>
you are <hi>Iuvenum confidentissimus.</hi> The Lord humble
me and you also. You add fair hopes of the Issue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Victus</hi> or <hi>Victor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, if <hi>I be so pious, as some good men take me to
be, I will not be troubled for having written to you.</hi> Sir, I
hope I love piety, yet it quiets not my heart that good
men thinke so well, nor much troubleth me to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
judged of the world, I stand not at mans stay
or judgement; but I hope, if I had not written to you,
it could not certainly argue with you an utter defect
of piety in me; I trust I shall lay the proof of piety up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better evidence. To take away therefore that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
from you, I have written what you see; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I choose as you provoke me, to be an Obiector,
but in generall I desire rather to be a Quaestionist, and
aske of you satisfaction to some Questions or cases a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Prayer, which may let you see some difficulties
in your particular instance. Take them thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Whether the Scripture inspired by God be the only
rule for Prayer, as for Faith, which must frame it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether in this Scripture doth appeare any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
imposing a set forme of prayer upon the Church, or any
practice in the Church of Christ answering such a precept?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Whether in case the Law of God doth not impose any
forme of prayer, even the best upon the Church, it be in the
power of men to do it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Whether the Booke mentioned in your Letter be
not so imposed by men, without precept or example from
God?</p>
            <p>Sir, in all these is not queried, what may be the
lawfulnesse, or usefulnesse of set formes of Payer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some, nor how far prudentiall, good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
forms may be commended; but whether it be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41689:6"/>
lawfull for men to impose any such formes upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that those and none but those must be used
in the Church, by any who are able to make use of the
Scripture Directory in all cases of their addresse to
God. Unto these your clear answer is desired if you
please, before we come to a congresse about particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
wherein if you deale rationally and ingenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I may afford a further Reply; but otherwise, my
worke is too much for my time, and I shall not spend
hours vainly in such writing-contests. I shall give you
no worse Farewell, than I had from you, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you the Book of books, from which your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Book hath all that is good in it. Make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
your rule of your Faith, and Prayer, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

            <p>I Thanke you for your Letter, but must crave your
pardon for not answering your <hi>Quaeries,</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to my Designe in writing to you, which
is, To know, whether or no you have any thing to
object against this Position: That a man may worship
GOD in <hi>Spirit, and in Truth</hi> in the Use of that form of
Prayer for Morning, and Evening, which we call the
<hi>Common Prayer (simply</hi> considered, without <hi>respect</hi> to
it's being imposed, &amp;c.) I conceive you might easily
have apprehended this to have been my Aime by the
expressions of my other Letters. As for the Forms for
the Buriall of the Dead, Baptisme, &amp;c. Though I do
not except against them, yet because there are many
expressions in them, from which such Controversies
may easily arise, as a <hi>Spirituall Man</hi> cannot well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse
without losse of Time; I shall not undertake to
vindicate them, unlesse provok't to it by any that
professe that they are scandall'd at my using of them.
I have heard many men speak much against the use of
the <hi>Letany,</hi> if you have any thing to say against it, I
shall entreat you to insist on that in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
For, as yet I cannot apprehend any thing that
can be objected against it, but what may easily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
into a <hi>Phanaticke</hi> humour: And I would faine
know where the strength of that Opposition lies that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41689:7"/>
may be made against that, which I conceive may be of
so great use to the Church of God. As for that I said I
might give you some occasion to conceive some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Notions concerning Prayer, &amp;c. I shall maintain
the expression. If your Opinion be, That a man cannot
pray <hi>in Faith,</hi> using that form we speak of, I doubt not,
but if I shall be able to discover to you the workings of
mine own spirit, mov'd by God, in the use of that
<hi>Forme, I</hi> shall be able to do that <hi>I</hi> said <hi>I</hi> had no small
confidence that <hi>I</hi> should. Good Sir, deal with me, as
'tis fit for one Christian to deale with another, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
as much as you can, all such expressions as may
probably be made <hi>Instrumentall</hi> by the <hi>DEVIL,</hi> to
worke in me that sinfull <hi>Anger,</hi> to which J am natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
inclin'd upon such Occasions, as in <hi>Writing-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests</hi>
(to use your own words) men are apt to give one
to the other: But, blessed be God the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with his Sons <hi>Blood</hi> J am able to
<hi>Quench the Fire</hi> of that, and all other <hi>Lusts,</hi> as soon as
J perceive it to be <hi>Kindled</hi> in me. Jf you say in your
heart at the Reading of this, <hi>Let him that standeth take
heed lest he fall,</hi> I shall entreat you to pray for me that
J may take heed.</p>
            <p>As for my <hi>Adjuring</hi> of you, J take the matter to be
of so high Concernment, that J did well in so doing.
You say (reflecting upon some expressions of mine)
<hi>For saving Truth, I trust, I have received what the Gospell
revealeth.</hi> God forbid that J should be so Uncharitable
as not to hope that you have received all the <hi>Principall</hi>
Truths that concern Eternall Life; but there may be
some <hi>Subordinate</hi> Truths (that I may so speak) the
Apprehension of which might make the Knowledge
of the other, more <hi>Intense,</hi> and more Powerful in their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41689:7"/>
Influence upon the <hi>Heart.</hi> Such Truth I meant by
that expression which you seeme not to apprehend.
Some Discoveries of such Truth (<hi>viz.</hi> Particular
Notices of the <hi>Meanes of Grace</hi>) I have often received
from the Discourses I have had with <hi>Experimentall

            <p>YOur reply of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> instant, I received the fifth,
and finding your resolution not to answer my
Quaeries, I cannot but in civility return these
lines as a close to your Chalenge begun, seeing the
matter is not determined by the Respondent, unto
which Objection should be made; for J know, the
hinge of the Controversie about set Forms imposed,
depends upon Scripture-Authority (from which in
this case, as in all matters of Faith, J shall not depart,
<hi>ne hilum quidem</hi>) As to what you write of other mens
speaking against the Letany, J shall not meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
nor as what you can say to other pieces of the book
you mention; But this I shall say, if I understand what
<hi>Letany</hi> is, neither is the word reciprocall with your
matter unto which it is prefixed, nor the matter with
the Word. And however you say, <hi>nothing can be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, but what may easily be resolved into a Phanaticke
humour,</hi> I suppose if you read those Books written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this Argument, of which J think you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
you may find more reason to be answered, than
phancy to be jeered. If you seek for Objections, I refer
you to them. As to other passages in your Letter, I
shall be silent, lest I give you occasion to be angry; Only
(I hope) as you urge the experience of your own heart
in your way of prayer to give you proof of its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41689:8"/>
so you will allow the experience of others in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way of praier than by book, to plead for them.
Sir, I shall make this amicable close with you, as to any
more writing; You say my <hi>Quaeries were impertinent to
your designe:</hi> Truly I know not what your designe was,
but I am sure they were pertinent to determine the
question of imposing formes of Prayer on them, who
have no need of them in the Church of God. You say
also <hi>(you consider it simply, without respect to its being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:)</hi>
If you stand to your word, I come to this issue,
if you argue not to impose it on the Church of God,
which can by Scripture directory make their addresses
to God without it, I shall not trouble you nor any that
think your selves to stand in need of any lawfull forme
of Prayer to help you. Onely do not bind men to crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
whom God hath inabled to go without them. I
have done as to any more Letters about this matter;
And now commending you to the Word of Gods
grace, which is able to keep you, and give you an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
among them that are sanctified, I shall ever rest,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Thank you for your last Letter; but should thank
you more, but that I finde and expression in it, which
I apprehend, as very <hi>Scopticall,</hi> and Unfriendly:
That is this: <hi>As to other passages in your Letter, I shall
be silent, lest I give you occasion to be angry.</hi> Sir, if those
passages were <hi>Evill,</hi> I conceive you should be Bound
in Conscience, having so fair an opportunity, to shew
me wherein, (and that in such Plainnesse, and <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
of expression, as is fit to drop from the Tongue,
or Pen of a CHRISTIAN, one that carries the
Heavenly DOVE in his <hi>Bosome:</hi>) if they were not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi>
you ought not to have such a reflexion on them,
as I conceive you had in the writing of that expression.
I must confesse a <hi>Carnall Man</hi> might easily have taken
an occasion to scoffe at me, if I had written to him as
I did to you, desiring that you would avoid all exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
Language. But, Sir, I take you to be a Person,
who know by your own Experience that it must needs
be an exceeding great Trouble to any one that would
alwayes <hi>Repose</hi> his Spirit in the GOD <hi>of Peace,</hi> to be
at any time Discompos'd, though it be but by the
least <hi>Act</hi> of Animosity, or Indignation against any mans
person; and therefore that 'tis not so Foolish to do, or
say what we can to prevent any thing, by which the
<hi>DEVIL</hi> may possibly frame in us a Temptation to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41689:9"/>
that Sin of <hi>Anger,</hi> or <hi>Roughnesse</hi> of Spirit. If you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
why I should feare that you would deale <hi>Vncivilly</hi>
with me, I must tell you, you gave me too much
reason for it in your first Letter: namely by your <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venum
Confidentissimus,</hi> your so <hi>slight a matter, as the
sending you an Answer:</hi> Your putting in these words,
<hi>An Able Respondent,</hi> as mine, though they were not
to be found in any part of my Letter: If I had exprest
my selfe in those words, the expression must have
implyed a vaine boasting of mine owne Abilities,
whereas the expression that I used implied onely a
Confidence of the Goodnesse of my Cause, and the
Strength that thereupon I should expect from God,
when ever I should (in a pure, and vertuous inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
undertake to maintain it.</p>
            <p>Sir, I cannot but wonder that you should say, <hi>I
know not what your Designe was,</hi> when I had told
you what it was <hi>expresly</hi> in these words: <hi>To know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no you have any thing to Object against this Position:
That a man may Worship GOD in Spirit, and in Truth,
in the Vse of that Forme of Prayer (for Morning, and
Evening) which we call the Common-Prayer:</hi> Which, I
told you, I consider'd <hi>simply,</hi> without respect to the
imposing of it; And I do stand to my Word. But this
I say, that if the KING shall thinke fit to impose it
(by the reinforcement of that Old Act) I doubt not
but there will be men enough found out that shall be
ready to manifest to the World the reasonablenes, and
the piety of such an Action: but this Worke GOD
hath not Call'd me unto That which I undertake is,
to maintain the Assertion above mentioned; which I
shall be ready to do (God willing) when ever I finde
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41689:10"/>
any thing like reason propos'd against it. And I shall
humbly entreat you to tell me what Book you would
chiefly advise me to read which hath any thing in it
expresly against the <hi>Letany,</hi> which I take to be the
best part of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> if any part may be said
to be better then another in a Composition so entirely
Excellent. Alas, Sir, I do not stand in need of a <hi>Set

            <p>I Have reason to suspect that what has been spoken
by you, and others in this County against the use of
the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> hath begotten in the minds of
severall persons such a prejudice against it, as deprives
them of many of those good Thoughts which they
might enjoy, when they hear their Ministers say that
Service, if they did duely, and without prejudice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

of Prayer,</hi> which we call the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> I shall
earnestly entreat you to shew me what Reason you
have (or rather what you take to be a Reason) for this
your Opinion, which I take to be very Erroneous,

you think your Reason Convincing, pray make use of
it, and endeavour to convince me. If you refuse to

            <p>THese are the Truths, which I <hi>Edmund Elis,</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Jesus Christ, <hi>Principally</hi> endeavour to
make known to the sons of Men. 1. That the
good Things of this life, Honours, Riches, &amp;c. unlesse
we make use of them in the service of God, are but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and vexation of Spirit; And in no wise any more
capable to satisfie, or content an immortall Soul, then
<hi>Lime,</hi> and <hi>Ashes,</hi> and <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> and such like Trash are
to satisfie, and keep in health the bodies of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who through the depravedness of their Appetite,
desire to feed on them. 2. That nothing but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God, the Fountain of all Goodness can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and really content an immortall Soul. 3. That no
man can enjoy God, but he that loves Him with all
his heart, and with all his soul, and (for his sake) his
Nighbour as himself. 4. That, though every sincere
Convert, or Regenerate person loves God continually
with his whole heart, as to the <hi>Habit,</hi> or <hi>Root</hi> of Holy
Love; Yet whilst he is in the Body, he may sometimes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41689:12"/>
fail of the <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Fruit</hi> of it, &amp; may offend God through
the love of the Creature. Which Truth (so much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in these days) is clear, and manifest in the Holy
Scriptures: particularly in the Records of the heynous
Sins of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle. 5.
That the soules of the Faithfull are always growing in
grace, whilst they are in the Body, and at the <hi>Instant</hi>
of Death, or separation from the Body, our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
shall present them to the Father without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pot, or
blemish. 6. That no man can so know God as to
love him with all his heart, and with all his soule, but
through the knowledge of <hi>Iesus Christ, &amp; him crucified?</hi>
Who, by those grievous sufferings which he endur'd
when he was upon Earth, made satisfaction to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God for the sins of all those that believe in His
Name: so that it is as consistent with the Justice, as
with the Mercy of God, to forgive them their sins, and
make them Heirs of Eternall Life. God is just, and the
Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. 7. That the
ready way to receive <hi>CHRIST,</hi> the onely <hi>LIGHT,</hi>
by which we may see the Way to Heaven: or so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Him that we may be saved by Him, is, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all that we have that we may be his Disciples: that
is to say, to take off our Affections from things on the
Earth, and to set them on things above, where Jesus
sitteth on the right hand of God: putting our Trust &amp;
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in the <hi>Free,</hi> &amp; <hi>Infinite</hi> mercy of God, through
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> to be guided by him in all our wayes, to be
led by his good Spirit in all those wayes of <hi>GRACE,</hi> and
Holiness, through which we must pass before we can
attain to Glory: Which I beseech the great God, the
