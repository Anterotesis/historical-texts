         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER OUT OF SCOTLAND, FROM Mr. R. L. S. To His Friend, H. B. IN LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honest <hi>Harry!</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to my promise, I should have Wrote to you long since, to have given you an account how squares go, but the grief and affright of heart I was in, and the long and tedious Journey, had so tyred me, that I was forced to lye a Bed and think of my wicked fate; and whilst I was musing, I received the <hi>Skeldry,</hi> or that damn'd picture of <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi> which so inraged me, that it put my before-heated Blood into a Feavor. What <hi>Rogues</hi> were these, to tye my dear Friend to my Arse too? I must confess they are now even with me for my <hi>Iack-an-Apes</hi> on <hi>Horse-back.</hi> I know <hi>Hal,</hi> thou wantest me, for I do not hear of any great Feats thou hast done since I left to brandish the Pen: And I as much long to be Scribling again, and having a longing desire, after I had rested a while, I had begun a Dialogue between <hi>Iockey</hi> and <hi>Blew-cap,</hi> but a Friend of mine coming in, made me burn my papers, for he told me, That 'twould prove to me more fatal than <hi>Citt</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> or that between <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Baxter,</hi> or any other Dialogue I had ever wrote, for that these plaguy <hi>Scots,</hi> if they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107093:2"/>
but smelt I was writing of <hi>Dialogues</hi> would knock out my Brains, and would never take it so patiently as the <hi>English</hi> had done, He advis'd me therefore not so much as to think of writing in this place. I find indeed they are a company of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fellows, and that they but look a squint at greater persons than my self. I am not here known to be <hi>R.</hi> they would take me then for a Papist in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> and then I should surely go to pot, for they have an invetrate Hatred against all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> so that I am now putting on a new shape, and appear like a <hi>Presbyterian:</hi> what a sad thing is this, that I should feign the thing I so much hate? but <hi>Hal,</hi> Life is sweet, and tho' I am old, I care not to leave this World, for I know not if there be any Scribling in that to come; and since I am now at the worst pass, except Hanging, I desire to live to see a little more Mischief. Well <hi>Hal,</hi> let me tell thee there are some besides my self of my mind, and I am now scouring up my old Pistols, which I must now handle instead of my Pen; we are prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and things will not always run with so smooth a stream, we are pudling the Waters all we can, and let the <hi>Citts</hi> look to themselves, we may chance to have a brush at their Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kots. Those Furious Gentlemen at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that go on so vigorously, may perchance find some repulse, if the interest and power of my <hi>Master</hi> and the Popish party, are able to do it: We yet believe that it will not be so easie a matter for you to put the <hi>Duke</hi> besides the Saddle, what do you think he has no Friends? no Money? no Interest? nor Allies to help him? we are yet upon <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> and it will not be long e're my Master will give you a Civil Visit, he has Intreagues in his Head, and some Friends at the Helm who yet know how to Steer for his Interest. I confess that my Hopes are not so very great as they have been, for I did once believe that you should not have been able to have taken off any of the Heads of the Lords in the Tower, but I see I was mistaken, for one of them is taken off: You have droven furiously like <hi>Ieheu,</hi> impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Judges, and almost all my Masters <hi>Secret Friends:</hi> On my Word 'tis high time for him to look about him, least they pull the painted <hi>Iezabell</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> out of the Windows, that the little Currs that have worried her hitherto, may lick her Blood. I had your Peers Speech too, 'tis brave that any durst speak so plain <hi>English,</hi> but this comes of the Liberty of the Press; when I sat at the Helm, these things never were, I would have given it a squeese, you know my Fingers were like Pitch, what ever they laid hold of, stuck to them so fast, they could never be got from them; I tell thee that Speech was almost as Bad as the <hi>Appeal,</hi> a dangerous <hi>Libell.</hi> Had I been at <hi>London,</hi> I would have Answered it, but I tell thee that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107093:2"/>
I have been so terrified with the inveterate hatred of these <hi>Blew-Caps</hi> against Scriblers, that I am fain to make them believe I never wrote in my Life: I dare not adventure to give you a Visit, tho' my Master should come, and tho' the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that <hi>Bug-bear,</hi> should be Prorogued, for I dare not be seen, least the Bayliffs should seize me, for I have not yet got the Money I was promised, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I now write to you to certifie my mind; but I know my Master is just to his Word, and I have hopes <hi>Hal,</hi> if we Thrive, I shall requite your kindness. I am thinking of some great place for thee, I will be thy True and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Friend, and that <hi>Broom</hi> which was tyed to <hi>Towsers</hi> Tail, shall be Advanced to thy Crest, ever hereafter. But if we fail of our Hopes, I cannot be worse than I am, and therefore give me leave to Hope a little. I intend, when I dare to Write again, to Write a New History of the <hi>Popish-Presbyterian-</hi>PLOT, I will License it my own self, and no Body shall Print it but you, I will set them forth in their Colours, I have an excellent Defamilory Black taught me by an <hi>Italian Iesuit.</hi> But yet I cannot but sigh to think of the dismal present time; I am got into a Cold Country, where in silence I often hear my self Rail'd at most profoundly. I was ask'd by a Pyde-mouth'd Rogue the other Day, because I was an <hi>English-Man,</hi> whether I knew <hi>R. L. S.</hi> or as they term it, the <hi>S. R.</hi> and shewing me the Picture of <hi>Towser,</hi> ask'd me if it was not like him, and if it was Drawn by the Life? I could willingly have dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Teeth out if I durst: But <hi>Hal,</hi> since I cannot write as I was wont, because I must be Employed, I am now learning to play upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Bag-pipes, which I will Endeavour to set up instead of the Organs in Churches: I am also learning to speak thorough the Nose, and am getting by Heart the <hi>Scotch-Covenant,</hi> I may be a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite at last, and put on that Vizard, as well as that of the <hi>Protestant.</hi> I know not how to end when once I have begun to you, but all I have now to desire of you, is, That you will send me all the News you can, both good and bad. I long to know if the <hi>Parliament</hi> shall Sit again, for some of us have here Great Expectations: I saw all the Votes and Resolves you sent me; God Bless me, said I, from falling under the Clutches of a <hi>Parliament;</hi> I think I did more wisely than Justice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> when I fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run away; 'twas a madness I thought to Fight with Four or Five Hundred Resolute Men. I remember that Black Prophet Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> once told me at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> twirling his Hat about, well Sir, we shall have a <hi>Parliament;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107093:3"/>
but I did not then believe him; I now acknowledge him as great a Prophet as Mother <hi>Shipton,</hi> which the <hi>Scots</hi> I assure you have in Veneration. Our <hi>Astrologers</hi> here predict strange things from the Comet that has been lately seen here; some say it portends the Downfall of the <hi>Pope,</hi> another of the <hi>Popish-Plot,</hi> another of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> some of the King of <hi>France,</hi> others of the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> they cannot agree, and to tell you the truth, I believe none of them; I rather think it signifies the Advancement of some <hi>Great Man</hi> in our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts, to high Honour and Dignity; tho' a bold Fellow with his Bonnet on his Head, the other Night, looking at the Star, told me, when my Masters Beard was as long as the train of that Star, he should be King of <hi>England,</hi> and not before; Thus the <hi>World</hi> goes, and people I see will speak their minds, and I cannot help it, I am forced now to endure all. I have no present to send you, if I had any thing by me for you to get a Penny by, I would. If you please, you may print this Letter, which I wrote by stealth, for if my Name be set to it, you know it will sell, what ever stuff is in it: Pray you therefore accept this as a New-Years Gift, for I have nothing else to send you. Let me hear from you as soon as you can, and direct your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Mr. <hi>Crack-fart,</hi> Lodging at Old <hi>Sawny's</hi> the <hi>Bagg-pipe-</hi>Maker, in the <hi>High-Street</hi> in <hi>Edinborow.</hi>
