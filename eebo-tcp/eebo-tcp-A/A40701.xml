            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce the happy Concluſion of the Peace, that many
of your Nation have had their Tours into <hi>France:</hi>
It is very obſerveable, how ſtrangely the Mouths
of ſome come back, are filled with the mighty Actions
of that Heroick Gentleman, pretended Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi>
they ſeem ſo to adore him, that were he truly what
they pretend, King <hi>James</hi>'s, or His Queens Son, (as he
is neither) theſe Gentlemen could not exceed their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Praiſes: It muſt be confeſs'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Pomp and
Shew often makes Men ſeem what they are not, and ſo
it does here; For this young Spark being by the late
King and Queen own'd as their Son, as ſoon as Born of
Mrs. <hi>Gray,</hi> it behoves them to mantain him as ſuch,
whilſt there is any hopes of impoſing him to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Roman Catholick Cauſe, which was the firſt
Ground of their Deſign; and even at this day is no leſs
than what the Jeſuits and Prieſts both at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
do very confidently affirm, will anſwer their
deſign of ſettling Popery in this Kingdom in a ſhort
time: Being my ſelf in <hi>July</hi> laſt at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
there with ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts and Jeſuits,
particularly one Father <hi>Hunter,</hi> a Jeſuit, the only <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
in the great and famous Colledge there; he told
me plainly, That however Matters ſeem'd to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Intereſt of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time;
He queſtion'd not but to hear <hi>Maſs</hi> ſaid a Hundred
times in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in <hi>London</hi> before he Died;
adding for one Reaſon, That he was much younger
than King <hi>William,</hi> and hoping to out live him, he
ſaw no other obſtacle in their way; moſt of the other
Jeſuits and Prieſts gave their Opinion to the ſame Effect,
and ſeem'd to ſpeak not of their own Judgment barely,
but according to their Advice from <hi>England</hi> &amp;c. And
<pb facs="tcp:57126:3"/>
did frankly tell me, That they had now, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Secondly, This Noble Author would inſinuate, That
whatever I publiſhed at that Time, (it being in the laſt
Year of the late War with <hi>France)</hi> I ſhould be ſilent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
when once a Peace was concluded, and that the
Perſons I charged with the management of that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
had the opportunity to anſwer for themſelves.</p>
            <p>To this I Reply, That it is ſufficiently known, the Wars
have now been over about the Years, and thoſe Perſons
He would iuſtify have had all the Opportunities imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abie
to have made their Defence, and done themſelves
and the pretended Prince, Right: if it had Injurd either.
They could not be ignorant of what I charged againſt
them, by Reaſon many of my Books in <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſent
to <hi>France,</hi> and the ſame Book was Tranſlated both into
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Printed at the <hi>Hague</hi> and <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57126:5"/>
and other Places beyond the Seas, as is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known.</p>
            <p>But to avoid Arguments, not material, and come cloſe
to the matter, I muſt now tell the World, that I lately ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
my ſelf abroad into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where I met my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Tutor, Father <hi>Lewis Sabran,</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits Society,</hi> he
being now a kind of Superior to theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones of
that <hi>Society,</hi> who Reſide at the City of <hi>Liege.</hi> He was Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
to the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and one of the
chief Actors in the management of that Impoſture (as
You find him charged in my former Book) With this
Father I had ſome Diſputes at the later end of <hi>July</hi> laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and his Endeavour was to perſwade me to return to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and live the Remainder of my Life in
that Place, by entring my ſelf into their <hi>Society</hi> (that is
to be a Lay Brother) but I could by no means yeild to his
Inducements. Upon which, after a ſhort ſharp Diſput,
the good Father and I parted with this Reſolve, That to
what I had formerly publiſhed, I would at my coming to
<hi>England</hi> expoſe his Letters, and all the remaining Paſſag-wherein
he was concerned, and ſend him them in Print,
deſiring his Reply and Confutation, if I did him or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
any Injury. He promiſed he would do it if <hi>I</hi> gave
Occaſion. Therefore, with humble Submiſſion, I think,
I cannot proceed more fairly to juſtifie the Truth of my
Narrative, than by ſetting down firſt what I know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Management of that Intrigue, which has been
already, and can at any Time be ſufficiently prov'd as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That in <hi>May</hi> 1688. The Counteſs of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>
came over from <hi>Ireland</hi> in the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yacht, Captaine
<hi>Wright</hi> Commandder, and brought with her two Young
Gentlewomen big with child. This is prov'd by Capt.
<hi>Wright,</hi> and others belonging to the Yatch, as alſo by a
great many People of Quality and others in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do aver, That one of theſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

fell on Labour, and lay in at <hi>St. <hi>Alban</hi>
               </hi>'s, which is Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd
by ſeveral on that Road, and the Inhabitants as
<hi>St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I do aver, That the other of theſe Women
that came over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to <hi>London,</hi> with the
Counteſs of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> (her Name being Mrs. <hi>Mary Gray)</hi>
was brought big with Child, and Lodged in two ſmall
Chambers over the Lady <hi>Stricklands</hi> Lodgings, near to
the Queens Apartment, in the palace of St. <hi>James</hi>'s,
which ſaid Chamber, joind alſo to the Marchioneſs of
<hi>Powis</hi>'s Lodgings, and were the moſt privat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for their intended purpoſe in the whole Palace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I do aver, That on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th. of
<hi>June</hi> 1688, the ſame Mrs. <hi>Gray</hi> fell into pains, upon
which Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> was brought to her, and that Aftre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
the Queen came privatly to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
alſo of a ſudden to find the Symptoms of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Delivery, which increaſed according as Mrs.
<hi>Gray</hi> did in Reality; and Mrs. <hi>Gray</hi> being deliver'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Hours of Nine and Ten on <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning,
the Tenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Child of the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Gray</hi> was
convey'd in a Warming-pan, which I ſaw Mrs. <hi>Labaddie</hi>
carry from Mrs. <hi>Grays</hi> Chamber along the narrow Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
and ſo paſſed into the back Room, next to that
the Queen lay in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I do aver, That this very ſame Mrs. <hi>Grey,</hi>
three Weeks after the time of her Delivery, was by
Command ſent to <hi>Dover</hi> in a Coach and ſix Horſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
by Father <hi>Lewis Sabran,</hi> the Marchioneſs
of <hi>Powis</hi>'s Woman, and my ſelf; and that ſhe was there
met by one Father <hi>Grey,</hi> a ſecular Prieſt, who liv'd at
<hi>Calis,</hi> and call'd her Siſter, with whom ſhe went on
Board the Packet Boat, in order to go for <hi>Calis,</hi> and
from thence to the Benedictine Nunnery in <hi>Paris:</hi> And
this is prov'd by the Perſons where ſhe and we lodged,

and is well remembered by the Maſter of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Boat, who had often before and ſince, both ſeen and
Drank with Father <hi>Grey</hi> her Brother, at <hi>Calis,</hi> and heard
him ſay, his Siſter, meaning this <hi>Mary Grey</hi> was gone
to end her days in a Nunnery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I do aver, That the ſaid <hi>Mary Grey,</hi> in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
1690, (there being a Breach in the Garden-Walls
of that Cloyſter at that time) did make her eſcape
out of the ſaid Convent of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Benedictine Nuns in
<hi>Paris,</hi> and upon which, a diligent Search was made
after her in <hi>Paris,</hi> and after three days ſhe was found
again.</p>
            <p>This I prove by ſeveral Perſons Inhabitants in <hi>Paris,</hi>
who dwell near the Convent, which will remember the
Breach at that time, and the ſearch which was made
after a Woman who had made her eſcape. And if our
Enemies ſhou'd here alledge it was another Woman, and
not Mrs. <hi>Grey.</hi> I anſwer, It behoves them to prove who
that other Wowan was; And foraſmuch, as in a few
Days after Mrs. <hi>Grey</hi> was carried to St. <hi>Germains</hi> from
the ſaid Convent, (where ſhe was kept under a ſtrict
Guard after her Eſcape) it likewiſe concerns them
to demonſtrate, what became of her afterwards.</p>
            <p>And whereas, I do further charge them with Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
her; certainly, if they're no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Guilty, it is eaſy
to diſprove my Aſſertion, by either producing her, or
proving where, and how ſhe died.</p>
            <p>And yet further, I do atteſt, That this <hi>Mary Grey</hi>
was meerly Murther'd (ſhe being the true Mother of
the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales)</hi> to prevent her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the ſame to the honeſt People of <hi>England,</hi>
whom they rerm the Enemies of the late King and
Queen: Therefore, if ſhe were not put to Death,
meerly on that account, it will be a mighty Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Court of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> if they pleaſe to ſhew
for what cauſe ſhe was Murther'd, ſo that theſe my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57126:6"/>
poſitive Aſſertions, being ſo anſwer'd, as I propoſe, I
will not only confeſs my Error, but ſhall freely lay my
Life at their Mercy, tho' I am ſure to find none: As
for Father <hi>Sabran,</hi> I verily believe I have left him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no Room for a Reply. But partly purſuant to
a former promiſe of mine, in my firſt and ſecond Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and to make the matter more apparent, I here

Copies of Letters, writ by the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Queen,
and others, concerning Mrs. <hi>Grey;</hi> and the firſt two
Letters were wrote upon the occaſion of a great Fright,
which Mrs. <hi>Grey</hi> gave the Queen, when ſhe made her
eſcape, which occaſion'd the Queen to order me to go
for <hi>England</hi> with the ſaids Letters immediatly; but Mrs.
<hi>Grey</hi> being taken, and exprſs was diſpatch'd after me,
to call me back to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> when I found the
Queen overjoy'd at taking of the <hi>loſt Sheep,</hi> as the Queen
was pleaſed to term Mrs. <hi>Grey.</hi> The following Letter

Queen fear'd the Conſequence of rhis Womans getting
ſafely into <hi>England,</hi> and ſurely, were not the Cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
Her Maieſty (whoſe Soul is haughty enough)
would not be ſo Frighted at her Eſcape: But the Intereſt
of the Holy Church was as the ſtake, that is, the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
ſhe fear'd, would be Expoſed, &amp; her Maſterpiece
of Intrigue brought to nothing, but redound to her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
diſhonour; So poor Ms. <hi>Grey</hi> muſt Die, whatever
Trouble or Pains it coſt, even one of the beſt Friends
the late Queen had in <hi>England,</hi> and that too at her firſt
Landing, before the mighty Secret was divulged, and
what that Secret was, ſurely her Majeſty in this Letter
does Her ſelf fo plainly hint at, that it needs no furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Interpretation. The next was given me at the ſame
time, and is much to the ſome Purpoſe.</p>

her Fears concerning <hi>Mrs Grey</hi> being over, but yet ſome

ſomething of this intreague, and the pretended Princes

concern'd her to keep this Murther and dealings with
Mrs. <hi>Grey,</hi> as ſecret as might be, well knowing, that the

            <p>All I ſhall ſay concerning theſe Aſſertions, is, that u-En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uiry,
the Perſons who, wrote them, are of unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd
Reputation, and ſo well known, that I cannot
hear of any (tho' many perſons of Quality and others,
have ſeen the foregoing Letter) who can give the leaſt
Reaſon for Invalidating their Teſtimoney, which is alſo
confirm'd by many more; ſo apparent is it, that the
late Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was the true Father of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have thus ſhew'd you part of the Letters I promiſed,
and according as I have occaſion, I ſhall publiſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
being a much greater Parcel: And theſe
being ſufficiently prov'd Authentick, will begin, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
on the ſtricteſt Scrutiny imaginable; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſee if my Adverſaries will give any Anſwer:
which if they prove ſo candid as to do on plain honeſt
Terms, I ſhall be oblig'd to them, and think it my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
by publiſhing what remains, to put this Matter
(if poſſible) out of Diſpute. Therefore, I would humbly
beg this favour of them to ſtick cloſe the matter of Fact,
otherwiſe I ſhall not concern my ſelf to make a Reply.</p>
