            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS Complaint hath been made to His Majeſtic on the behalf of the Inhabitants of this County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that although they have agreed to a great weekly Contribution by way of Loane towards the Proviſion of His Majeſties Horſe, yet in many parts of this County, they ſuffer in theſe particulars following, wherein they humbly pray to be releived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Souldiers do put their Horſes into the ſtanding-corne, and do eate and ſpoile it, which will be an utter undoing to the owners, if it be not remedied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They turne their Horſes into their Meddowes, and mowing-graſſe, whereby they ſhall have no Hay to keep their Cattell the next winter, refuſing other graſſe fit for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas there is 3<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> by the week allowed for a Souldiers Dyet, in many places a Souldier, a Woman, and a Child, or a Boy, be all billetted and dyeted at the ſame rate, as for one man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Many of them refuſe to give Tickets, when they have been billetted a moneth, or ſix weeks in a place, and ſome who do give Tickets, will not make them ſo perfect, as that the Maſter of the family can have allowance thereof, when it is brought to the Sheriffe or other Collectour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Where Souldiers are quartered in a Pariſh, and ſometimes one or a few houſes receive them, as the Quarter-Maſter appoints it, they who receive them can have no contribution from them of the ſame Pariſh or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, who receive either none, or a fewer number, whereas the charg being borne by all of ability indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would be the eaſier, and the more equall.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtic taking theſe things into His Princely conſideration, doth give His approbation of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them all. And being willing to caſe His good Subjects in all things which He can, and the necesſity of the times will permitt Doth now declare His Royall Pleaſure and Command that theſe things above written, and complained of, be from henceforth reformed. &amp; doth require the Commanders and Officers of His Army, as much as in them lyeth, to ſee the ſame obſerved, and that whoſoever ſhall offend therein muſt expert to receive puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtrictly, according to the quality of his offence, and that both the Inhabitants of the County, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may take the better notice hereof and obſerve it, His Majeſtie doth command that this be forthwith Printed and Publiſhed in every Church and Parochiall Chappell within this County.</p>
