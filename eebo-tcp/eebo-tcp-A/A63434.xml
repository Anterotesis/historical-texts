            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Preſume it's no News to you that I was apprehended and committed to the Marſhalſea, for the wicked and felonious entring into, and ſetting on Fire, the Houſe and Dye-houſe of <hi>Peter Delanoy</hi> of <hi>Southwark,</hi> Dyer, it being made publick to the World, by our infallible, unerring, <hi>Protestant</hi> News-monger, and therefore I forbore declaring to you my Caſe, or giving any Account of my ſelf about it, enduring my heavy Irons, my melancholy Impriſonment, and all other my reproachful Sufferings quietly, till God was pleaſed to deal with me according to my Innocency. And I ſhould ſtill with the ſame reſolution have forborn troubling you, were it not to vindicate my ſelf from the Scandals, that infamous Tongues aſperſe me withal, concerning the contriving of the ſaid Fire, together with the honourable Profeſſion of a Souldier, the Imployment I follow. And therefore I hope you'l pleaſe to peruſe patiently theſe, and pardon me for them.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place I do declare, and I take God to be my Witneſs therein, that I am a <hi>Protestant,</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I was born and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo, and never knew my ſelf any other Religion, nor any of my Relations to be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> although my Accuſer ſwore me a <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
                  <p>I do in the ſecond place profeſs before Almighty God, that knows the truth of all things, I never ſaw, ſpoke to, or drank with the Maid that accuſed me,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60217:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
till after I was apprehended nor did I euer ſee, or hear of Mr. <hi>Delanoy,</hi> or his Houſe, or what Trade he was, until ſuch time I was brought before the Juſtice no, nor was I in <hi>Southwark</hi> of a Month before I was taken, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
                  <p>I am a Gentleman you know, and a Souldier, though <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It may ſeem incredible, that a perſon of my Parts, and Profeſſion too ſhould be imploy'd in, or that (if it were true) I ſhould treat with an unknown Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, about ſo weighty an Affair; or if it were ſo, what ſhould induce me, next morning and next door, (as I am informed it is) to come, where I had committed ſuch a Fact over <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, Sir, I am acquitted, and I do nevertheleſs solemnly proteſt; as I hope for mercy at the laſt Day, I am as innocent of that Crime as the Child that is yet unborn, elſe may I never ſee God in his Throne, which, with the following particulars of my Caſe, I hope may ſatisfie you.</p>
                  <p>And if you, the moderate, and the doubtful, be but ſatisfied, I value not my Misfortunes; let the envious and rude Rabble think what they pleaſe, for 'tis not eaſie to perſwade them to believe the truth, when they are once poſſeſt with the contrary; nevertheleſs, if any of them will be ſo critically curious, as to enquire into any one of the particulars of my Caſe, they will find what I have therein roughly ſet down, will plainly appear to be a great truth.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay very little as to the Woman that ſwore againſt me; only give me leave to tell you, that thoſe who are acquainted with her, know well what ſhe is, and ſuch as do not, may eaſily be ſatisfied, if they pleaſe, by ſeveral of her late Maſters, who have been to viſit her in Priſon; I pray God forgive her, for I do from my Soul, yet while I live, I ſhall never forget her, nor the

                  <p>But now as to my Trial: I was this morning Indicted, Convicted, Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Tryed, with <hi>Margaret Clark,</hi> my Accuſer, both by one Indictment, to which I pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> (as God knows I might without ſinning, ſafely do) and ſo did my Yoke-mate; there were 4 Witneſſes ſworn, two Men, and two Women, of little credit, and leſs faſhion; the Men wanted Matter to ſwear, and eſpecially a peeviſh Waterman; they proved the Fire; that was evident before, by the Maids own confeſſing, (though ſhe pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi> now) which was ſufficient for her turn; the two Women, the other Witneſſes, one of them very briskly ſwore, ſhe had oft ſeen me in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and particularly on <hi>Thurſday</hi> before the Fire broke out, but could not ſay, ſhe had either ſeen me in <hi>Delanoy</hi>'s Houſe, or in his Maids company; the other Witneſs ſwore, ſhe ſaw a Man go on <hi>Sunday</hi> into <hi>Delanoy</hi>'s Houſe in a red Coat, and come out again, but did not ſee his Face, nor could ſhe ſay I was the perſon; very angry the Witneſſes were they could ſwear no better; how my Perſecutors were pleaſed, I leave that to themſelves, believing they had rather hanged me innocent, than the Maid guilty, judging ſo, from what words a giddy Brain, paſſionate Coxcomb, an Apprentice to <hi>Delanoy,</hi> ſpoke in Court, who thought he had more wit than my Judge, and more honeſty than my Jury, and would
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60217:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have me damned before I was condemned; I am ſo much a Chriſtian, as not to wiſh him harm, but the contrary, deſiring his Soul may find Favour from the great Judge of Aſſize in the other, for certain I am, his Face will find but little from the leſſer Judges of this World.</p>
                  <p>The Maid her ſelf was examined; ſhe denied impudently what ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confeſſed, as to her ſelf, but ſtood firmly to her firſt principles; as to my particular, I was the perſon, and like <hi>Cataline,</hi> reſolved to add greater Evils to thoſe ſhe had before committed; but ſhe being Arraigned, her Evidence was of no effect.</p>
                  <p>The ſtreſs lying chiefly on <hi>Thurſday, Jan.</hi> 9. and <hi>Sunday, Feb.</hi> 1 ſome of my Witneſſes were examined, and then the Judge proceeded to give the Jury their Charge. In fine, they brought her in <hi>Guilty,</hi> and me otherwiſe, a Favour I could not have expected from many <hi>Southwark</hi> Juries, I thank this kindly for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> I am contented, but I hope to have no further experience of their Favours; and now I only wait for my Diſcharge, not doubting in a day or two to be with you.</p>
                  <p>There were many Priſoners, and ſeveral Trials of ſundry natures, which I ſhall not trouble you with; only thoſe of three Gentlemen, <hi>Seamour,</hi> alias <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Sherby;</hi> two of them are caſt in five Indictments, and the third in four Indictments, for Robbery and Felony on the High-way: With which I conclude my tedious Epiſtle, and leave you to peruſe my Caſe truly ſtated with a Copy of my Commitment.</p>
