            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All which occaſions ſo great a decay and ſtop of trade, that your Petioners are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoveriſhed, and our miſeries are growne unſupportable, we having already ſpent all that little meanes which we had formerly by Gods bleſſing and our great labour obtained; and many of us had not, nor can tell where to get bread to ſuſtaine our ſelves and families; and others of us are almoſt arrived at the ſame port of calamitie, ſo that unleſſe ſome ſpeedy remedy be taken for the removall of all ſuch obſtructions, which hinders the happy progreſſe of your great endeavours, your Petitioners ſhall not reſt in quietneſſe, but ſhall be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lay hold on the next remedy which is at hand, to remove the diſturbers of our peace, want, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, breaking the bounds of modeſty: And rather then your Petitioners will ſuffer themſelves and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to periſh through hunger and miſerie, (though hitherto patiently groaned under) they cannot leave any meanes unaſſayed for their reliefe.</p>
            <p>The cry therefore of the poore and needy, your poore Petitioners, is that ſuch perſons who are the obſtacles of our peace, and hinderers of the happy proceedings of this Parliament, and the enjoyment of the long lookt for puritie of Religion, ſafety of our lives, and returnes of our welfares, may be forth with publiquely declared, to the end they may be made manifeſt, the removall of whom we humbly conceive will be a remedy to cure our miſeries, and put a period to theſe deſtractions, and that Noble-Worthies of the Houſe of Peers, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with you in your happy Votes, may be earneſtly deſired to joyne with this Honourable Houſe, and to ſit and Vote as one intire body, which wee hope will remove from us our diſtracted feares, and prevent that which oppreſſion will make the wiſeſt and peaceableſt men to put in execution.</p>
