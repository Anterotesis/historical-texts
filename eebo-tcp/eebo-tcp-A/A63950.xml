            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Schism, by mingling all Sects, and giving countenance to that, against which all Power ought to stand upon their guard. There is now nothing left, but that we take care that men be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: For concerning the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Advantages of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we cannot make that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision we desire; <hi>Incertis de salute, de gloriâ minimè certandum:</hi> For since they who have seen <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> in prosperity, and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the order of the Morning and Evening Sacrifice, and the beauty of the Temple, will be tempted to neglect so excellent a ministration, &amp; their assembling themselves together for peace, and holy Offices, and be content with any thing that is brought to
<pb facs="tcp:55311:3"/>
them, though it be but the husks and acorns of Prodigals and Swine, so they may enjoy their Lands and their Money with it; we must now take care that the young men who were born in the Captivity, may be taught how to worship the God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> after the manner of their fore-fathers, till it shall please God that Religion shall return into the Land, and dwell safely and grow pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>sperously.</p>
            <p>But never did the excellency of Episcopall Government ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare so demonstratively and conspicuously as now: Under their conduct and order we had a Church so united, so orderly, so govern'd, a Religion so setled, Articles so true, sufficient, and
<pb facs="tcp:55311:4"/>
confess'd, Canons so prudent and so obey'd, Devotions so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and constant, Sacraments so adorn'd and ministred, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches so beauteous and religious, Circumstances of Religion so grave and prudent, so useful and apt for edification, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Church, who serve the Pope in all things, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in some, who dare transgress an Institution and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Christ, but dare not break a Canon of the Pope, did despair of prevailing against Us <hi>and Truth,</hi> and knew no hopes but by setting their faces against us to destroy this Government, and then they knew they should triumph without any enemy: So <hi>Balaam</hi> the son of <hi>Bosor</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:55311:4"/>
sent for, to curse the people of the Lord, in hope that the son of <hi>Zippor</hi> might prevail against them that had long prospered under the conduct of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in stead of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Condition and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Religion, the people are fallen under the harrows and saws of impertinent and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Preachers, who think all Religion is a Sermon, and all Sermons ought to be libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Truth and old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and expound Chapters that the meaning may never be understood, and pray, that they may be thought able to talk, but not to hold their peace, they cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to obtain any thing but
<pb facs="tcp:55311:5"/>
Wealth and Victory, Power and Plunder; and the people have reap'd the fruits apt to grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such Crabstocks: they grow idle and false, hypccrites and careless, they deny themselves nothing that is pleasant, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise Religion, forget Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and some never think of Heaven; and they that do, think to go thither in such paths which all the ages of the Church did give men warning of, lest they fhould that way go to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>But when men have try'd all that they can, it is to be suppos'd they will return to the excel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and advantages of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, as it is taught by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for by
<pb facs="tcp:55311:5"/>
destroying it, no end can be serv'd but of Sin and Folly, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Death eternal. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, no Church that is ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to this, does worship God in that truth of Propositions, in that unblameable and pious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, and in preaching the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of holy life, so much as the Church of <hi>England</hi> does; besides this (I say) it cannot be persecuted by any Governour that understands his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, unless he be first abus'd by false Preachers, and then prefers his secret opinion before his publick Advantage. For no Church in the World is so great a friend to Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as she, and her Sisters of the same perswasion. They that
<pb facs="tcp:55311:6"/>
hate Bishops have destroy'd Monarchy, and they that would erect an Ecclesiastical Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, must consequently subject the Temporal to it. And both one and the other would be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in Consciences; and they that govern there, with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that in all things they ought to be attended to, will let their Prince govern others, so long as he will be rul'd by them: And certainly, for a Prince to persecute the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is as if a Physician should endevour to destroy all Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Fathers kill their Sons, and the Master of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies destroy all Formalities and Courtships; and as if the Pope should root out all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick
<pb facs="tcp:55311:6"/>
State. Nothing so combines with Government, if it be of Gods appointment, as the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because nothing does more adhere to the Word of God, and disregard the crafty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the world. If any man shall not decline to try his Title by the Word of God, it is certain there is not in the world a better guard for it, then the true Protestant Religion, as it is taught in our Church. But let things be as it please God; it is certain, that in that day when Truth gets her Victory, in that day we shall prevail against all Gods enemies and ours, not in the purchases and perquisites of the world, but in the rewards
<pb facs="tcp:55311:7"/>
and returns of Holiness and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Faith and Charity; for by these we worship God, and against this interest we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve any thing else.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we must by all means secure the foundation, and take care that Religion may be convey'd in all its material parts, the same as it was, but by new and permitted instruments. For let us secure that our young men be good Christians, it is easie to make them good Protestants, unless they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd with prejudice, and suck venome with their milk; they cannot leave our Communion, till they have reason to reprove our Doctrine.</p>
            <p>There is therefore in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb facs="tcp:55311:7"/>
pages a Compendium of what we are <hi>to Believe,</hi> what <hi>to Do,</hi> and what <hi>to Desire;</hi> It is indeed very little, but it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to begin with, and will serve all persons so long as they need milk, and not strong meat. And he that hath given the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Assistances to thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to be even a door-keeper in Gods House, and to be a servant of the meanest of Gods servants, and thinks it a worthy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to teach the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and make them to know Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> though but in the first rudiments of a holy Institution. This onely he affirms, That there is more solid comfort and material support to a Christian spirit in one Article of Faith, in
<pb facs="tcp:55311:8"/>
one period of the Lords Prayer, in one holy Lesson, then in all the disputes of impertinent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who take more pains to prove there is a Purgatory, then to perswade men to avoid Hell: And that a plain Catechism can more instruct a soul, then the whole dayes prate which some daily spit forth, to bid men <hi>get Christ,</hi> and persecute his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>Christian Religion is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for its wisdome, for its simplicity; and he that presents the following papers to thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to teach thee as the Church was taught in the early dayes of the Apostles. To believe the Christian Faith, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; to represent plain Rules
<pb facs="tcp:55311:8"/>
of Good Life; to describe easie Formes of Prayer; to bring into your Assemblies Hymnes of Glorification and Thanksgiving, and Psalms of Prayer. By these easie paths they lead Christs little ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fold of their great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; and if by this any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be done to God, any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery to the Soul of a Childe or an ignorant Woman, it is hoped that God will accept it: and it is reward enough, if by my Ministery GOD will bring it to passe, that any Soul shall be instructed, and brought into that state of good things, that it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for ever.</p>
