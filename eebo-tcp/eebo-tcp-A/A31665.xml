            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of Magistracy.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>RELATION is nothing else but that State of Mutual Respect and Reference, which one Thing or Person has to another.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>Such are the Relations of Father and Son, Husband and Wife, Master and Servant, Magistrate and Subject.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>III.</head>
               <p>The Relations of a Father, Husband and Master, are really distinct and different; that is, one of them is not the other; For he may be any one of these who is none of the rest.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>IV.</head>
               <p>This distinction proceeds from the different Reasons, upon which these Relations are Founded.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>V.</head>
               <p>The Reason or Foundation, from whence arises the Relation of a Father, is from having Begotten his Son, who may as properly call every Old Man he meets his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as any other Person whatsoever, excepting him only who Begat him.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>VI.</head>
               <p>The Relation of an Husband and VVife is founded in VVedlock, whereby they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually consent to become one Flesh.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>VII.</head>
               <p>The Relation of a Master is founded in that Right and Title which he has to the Possession, or Service, of his Slave or Servant.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>VIII.</head>
               <p>In these Relations, the Name of Father, Husband, and Master, imply Soveraignty and Superiority, which varies notwithstanding, and is more or less Absolute, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Foundation of these several Relations.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>IX.</head>
               <p>The Superiority of a Father is founded in that Power, Priority, and Dignity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which a Cause hath over its Effect.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>X.</head>
               <p>The distance is not so great in VVedlock, but the Superiority of the Husband over the VVife, is like that of the Right Hand over the Left in the same Body.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>XI.</head>
               <p>The Superiority of a Master, is an absolute Dominion over his Slave, a Limited and Conditionate Command over his Servant.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>XII.</head>
               <p>The Titles of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and <hi>Sponsus Regni,</hi> Father of the Country, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Realm, are Metaphors and Improper Speeches: For no Prince ever Begat a whole Country of Subjects; nor can a Kingdom more properly be said to be Married, than the City of <hi>Venice</hi> is to the <hi>Adriatique Gulph.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>XIII.</head>
               <p>And to shew further, that Magistracy is not Paternal Authority, nor Monarchy founded in Fatherhood; it is undeniably plain, that a Son may be the Natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord of his own Father, as <hi>Henry</hi> the second had been of <hi>Ieffrey Plantagenet,</hi> if he had been an <hi>Englishman</hi>; which, they say, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh did not Love to think of, when his Sons grew up to Years. And this Case alone is an Eternal Confutation of the Patriarchate.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>XIV.</head>
               <p>Neither is Magistracy a Marital Power, for the Husband may be the Obedient Subject of his own VVife, as <hi>Philip</hi> was of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Nor is it that Dominion which a Master has over his Slave, for then a Prince might Lawfully Sell all his Subjects, like so many Head of Cattle, and make Money of his whole stock when ever he pleases, as a Patron of <hi>Algiers</hi> does.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>XVI.</head>
               <p>Neither is the Relation of Prince and Subject the same with that of a Master and Hired Servant, for he does not Hire them, but, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>They pay him Tribute,</hi> in consideration of his continual <hi>Attendance</hi> and <hi>Imployment</hi> for the Publick Good.</p>
