            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have, with unſpeakable grief of heart, long beheld the Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Our Kingdom; Our very Soul is full of Anguiſh, untill We may find ſome remedy to prevent the miſeries which are ready to over-whelme this whole Nation by a Civill War. And though all Our endevours, tending to the compoſing of thoſe unhappy differences betwixt Vs and Our two Houſes of Parliament (though purſued by Vs with all Zeale and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) have been hitherto without that ſucceſſe We hoped for, Yet ſuch is Our conſtant and earneſt Care to preſerve the publike Peace, That We ſhall not be diſcouraged from uſing any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, which, by the bleſſing of the God of Mercy, may lay a firm foundation of Peace, and Happineſſe to all Our good Subjects. To this end, obſerving that many miſtakes have ariſen by the Meſſages, Petitions, &amp; Anſwers betwixt Vs and Our two Houſes of Parliament, which haply may be prevented by ſome other way of Treaty, wherein the matters in difference may be more cleerly underſtood and more freely tranſacted, We have thought fit to propound to you, That ſome fit perſons may be, by you, enabled to treat with the like number, to be authorized by Vs in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch freedome of debate as may beſt tend to that happy Concluſion, (which all good men deſire) The peace of the Kingdom. Wherein, as We promiſe, in the word of a King, all ſafety and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch as ſhall be ſent unto Vs, if you ſhall chuſe the place where We are for the Treaty, which we wholly leave to you, preſuming of the like care of the ſafety of thoſe We ſhall employ, if you ſhall name another place; So We aſſure you and all Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, That (to the beſt of Our underſtanding) nothing ſhall be therein wanting on Our part which may advance the true Proteſtant Religion, oppoſe Popery and Superſtition, ſecure the Law of the Land (upon which is built aſwell Our juſt Prerogative as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and Liberty of the Subject) confirme all juſt Power and Priviledges of Parliament, and render Vs and Our people truly happy by a good Underſtanding betwixt Vs and Our two Houſes of Parliament. Bring with you as firme reſolutions to do your duty, and let all Our good people joyn with Vs in Our prayers to Almighty God for his bleſſing upon this work. If this Propoſition ſhall be rejected by you, We have done Our duty ſo amply, That God will abſolve Vs from the guilt of any of that blood which muſt be ſpilt. And what opinion ſoever other men may have of Our Power, We aſſure you nothing but Our Chriſtian and pious care to prevent the effuſion of blood hath begot this motion. Our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Men, Arms, and Money, being ſuch as may ſecure Vs from further violence, till it pleaſe God to open the eyes of Our People.</p>
