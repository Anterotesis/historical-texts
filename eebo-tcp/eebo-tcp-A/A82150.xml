            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION of the Free-born people of ENGLAND, now in Armes againſt the Tyrannie and Oppreſſion of OLIVER CROMWELL Eſq.</head>
            <p>BEing ſatisfied in our Judgements and Conſciences of the preſent neceſſity to take up <hi>Armes</hi> for the defence of our Native Rights and Freedoms, which are wholly invaded and ſwallowed up in the Pride and Ambition of <hi>OLIVER CROMWEL Eſq</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>Lord Protector</hi> of ENGLAND, and hath rendred all Engliſh-men no better than his Vaſſals: We expect to be branded with the infamous name of <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traytors,</hi> or to be miſ-repreſented both to the <hi>Army, City,</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> as Common Enemies, Diſturbers of the Publick Peace, <hi>Arbitrary Cavaliers,</hi> or under ſome other odious notion, that may provoke the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to endeavour our deſtruction: But if we may prevaile to be heard before we be Condemned and Executed, We ſhall ſubmit our cauſe, and the righteous end we ſeek, to the judgement of the <hi>Army,</hi> and every honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, and if the <hi>Army</hi> it ſelfe (according to their many engagements) will undertake (and their ſtrength be ſufficient) to redeem Us from Our preſent ſlavery, and ſettle that Right and Freedome, unto which Our birth gave Us title, we ſhall readily lay downe our preſent <hi>ARMES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Chriſtian world knowes that our Engliſh <hi>Earth</hi> hath been drunk with <hi>Blood</hi> theſe twelve yeares, through the great conteſt for Right and Freedom, and the whole Treaſure of the Nation exhauſted in that quarrell. How then can any Man, whoſe Hand or Heart hath been ingag'd in that Bloody conteſt, either acquit himſelfe to God, his Conſcience, or his Countrey, in yeilding up tamely and ſilently all the Lawes, Rights and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> into an Uſurpers hand? We have for many yeares patiently borne all kindes of Oppreſſion, Arbitrarineſſe and Tyrannie, and ſuffered under ſuch heavy burthens of Exciſe and Taxes, as <hi>England</hi> never knew in former ages, having been fed by him that now calls himſelfe <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> and his <hi>Army,</hi> with ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and moſt alluring promiſes (ſeconded with many Appeales to God for their integrity of heart in them) that true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty, ſhould be ſetled and ſecured, Impartiall Juſtice provided for, Arbitrary Power aboliſhed, and every yoak of Oppreſſion broken, and every Burthen eaſed: And we did believe, as they told us, that our preſent ſufferings, were onely like a rough ſtormy paſſage, to the Haven of Juſtice, Right, and Freedome: We cou'd not ſuſpect theſe ambitious deſignes in <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and his Confederates, that are now proclaimed to the World: We could not thinke it poſſible, that a Man of ſuch meane Quality and Eſtate as he, ſhould aſpire to make himſelfe an abſolute Lord and <hi>Tyrant</hi> over three potent Nations: But above all, his pretended zeal for God and his People, his high profeſſions of Godlineſſe, Simplicity, and Integrity, his Hypocriticall Prayers, and dayes of Faſting to ſeek the Lord, his diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled humility and meekneſs, and his frequent compaſſionate teares upon every occaſion, We ſay, Theſe things, together with his Ingagements publique and private, his moſt Solemne Proteſtations, with Imprecations of Vengeance upon Himſelfe and Family, if he diſſembled, and his moſt frequent Appeales to God for the truth of his Profeſſions and Declarations; That he deſigned nothing but the ſecuring the Liberty of Gods people, and the adminiſtration of Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all juſtice, and ſought no Power, Honour, Riches or Greatneſſe to Himſelfe or any particular <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Intereſt:</hi> We ſay, theſe things rocked us aſleep, with the pleaſant Dreames of Liberty and Juſtice, untill he hath made a Sacrifice of all our <hi>Lawes, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> unto his owne Ambition. And now he is not afraid to owne what he before diſclaimed, and Declared againſt; He that formerly Proteſted before the Dreadfull God, and to the Long <hi>Parliament,</hi> That He and his Army ſhould be wholly ſubject to their Civill Authority, and that whoſoever ſhould attempt any violence againſt them ſhould make their way through his Blood, <hi>He</hi> now ownes the breaking them in pieces with ſcorne and contempt. <hi>He</hi> that declared ſo much Humility and Selfe-denyall, claims and owns a Power ſupreame to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and exerciſeth an Abſolute Dominion over the Lawes and Eſtates of Three Nations: <hi>He</hi> that ſeemed ſo zealous for Liberty, now dares owne every private Engliſh Man his Vaſſall, and their Parliaments his Slaves: <hi>He</hi> publiſheth in Print in his owne Speeches to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the benefit that all Engliſh Men have in the execution of any Lawes amongſt them is from <hi>Him,</hi> and that the Authority which their Parliaments have, and ſhall have, is onely derived from <hi>Him: He</hi> hath publiſhed in the whole world, that he hath diſſolved all civill Government, and that He had in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, an abſolute unlimited Arbitrary power, without check or controle, untill He put ſome limits upon Himſelfe (if he may be believed in his paper of Government.) Now what <hi>Patroon</hi> in <hi>Algier,</hi> ever claimed more Maſtery over his Slaves bought in the Market, then this claime of <hi>Cromwells</hi> extends unto over Us: If We have the benefit of the execution of no <hi>Laws</hi> but from Him, then all the Rights, Priviledges, and Eſtates we have, are enjoyed by his mercy only, and without the execution of Lawes, no man hath more right to Lands, or Goods, then another, nor is any mans life under any ſecurity, if another be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get than he. So that <hi>Cromwell</hi> ownes and profeſſeth, that the bread that every man eates is by his Mercy: And if his Power was without limit (as he ſaith) untill he had put ſome bounds, then 'tis of his Grace and Favour onely, that all Engliſh Men have now a ſeeming right in their Wives, Children, Servants, Lives, and Eſtates, if his owne limits of his Power gives any ſuch right: And if he pleaſe to throw away, (or burne by the hand of the Hangman) his <hi>Limits</hi> in his paper of Government, who can trouble him? He may doe what he liſt with things of his owne making; 'Tis the old Engliſh proverb, <hi>he that can binde can looſe;</hi> And he may doe what he liſt alſo with the Authority of Parliaments, if it be as he ſayes, of his owne giving: Now wherein doth a <hi>Patroons</hi> Power over his purchaſed <hi>Slave,</hi> exceed this which <hi>Cromwell</hi> ownes over Us? The <hi>Patroone</hi> can but give the <hi>Slave</hi> his Lawes, his Cloaths, his Meat, his Life, and all this <hi>Cromwell</hi> ownes to have given us, onely he ſpeaks it in ſuch language as ſounds not ſo harſhly.</p>
            <p>Now after the expence of ſo much Chriſtian blood, for the ſetling the Rights and Liberties due unto Us, as Men and Chriſtians; when he that was truſted with an Army for that purpoſe, hath ſo unworthily betrayed his truſt, ſpilt Innocent Blood like Water, falſified all his <hi>Declarations, Promiſes, Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> and aſſumed to himſelfe ſuch a dominion over our Countrey, as is deſtructive to all Right and Liberty, and renders Us and Our Poſterities, <hi>Slaves</hi> to him and his Succeſſors, with a payment of a <hi>Fifth</hi> (or thereabouts) of our Eſtates certain in <hi>Taxes</hi> to be intailed upon our Poſterities, beſides other burthens <hi>We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale</hi> to the Conſcience of every honeſt Man, whether a preſent Neceſſity, and an incumbent Duty be not upon us to <hi>Arm</hi> our ſelves in defence of our antient Lawes, and deareſt birthrights, againſt the preſent <hi>Impoſtor</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper:</hi> And we hope moſt of the <hi>preſent Army</hi> have not extinguiſhed their Love to their Countreyes Freedome (although <hi>Cromwells</hi> Hypocriticall profeſſions, Prayers and Teares, have much deluded them) but that they will readily concurre with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and other honeſt <hi>Engliſh men</hi> in our preſent attempt, by force of <hi>Armes</hi> to redeem our Countrey out of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> bonds, and to ſeek thoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends, which we doe hereby declare to be thoſe, for which we now hazard our Lives, and with which we ſhall reſt ſatisfied, and returne to our homes in peace: And they are theſe following. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>That all Aſſumed and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers and Authorities over our Country may be utterly aboliſhed.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>That the Government may be ſetled upon a juſt</hi> Baſis, <hi>with the due Bounds and Limits to every</hi> Magiſtrate.</item>
               <item>III. <hi>That the</hi> Ancient <hi>Liberties of</hi> ENGLAND <hi>ſetled by</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>the Petition of Right, and other Lawes, may be ſecured inviolably: That no mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be moleſted, impriſoned, restrained or touched, without a Legall cauſe ſhewn in the Warrant, whereby he is moleſted or restrained, (and that alſo in a due courſe of the Laws known proceedings, without countermands from the will of any man) whereas now mens Perſons are troubled and reſtrained at will, and deſtroyed by long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, no man knowes for what: And alſo that no mans Eſtate may be lyable to any diſpoſall or prejudice, but by the known Laws of the Land, and the lawfull judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his</hi> Equals.</item>
               <item>IV. <hi>That Free Succeſſive Parliaments may be ſetled, with times of their Beginning and Ending, and with their</hi> Ancient <hi>Power and Priviledges: And that the</hi> Juriſdictive Power <hi>which Parliaments have taken upon them to exerciſe in theſe times of Warre and Diſtraction, (by taking upon them the judgement of particular Cauſes concerning mens Perſons and Eſtates, ſometimes by their Committees, and ſometimes by themſelves, contrary to the knowne proceedings of the Law) That ſuch Power (we ſay) may be Declared againſt, and ſecure Proviſion made against the ſame: That thereby Parliaments may be free from the temptations of Profit, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and all private Intereſts, by which onely they can be corrupted.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>V. <hi>That the Militia of the Nation may be ſo dispoſed, that no man may be able to be Abſolute Maſter of Parliaments; And alſo that ſecure proviſion may be made, That no Parliament ſhall make it ſelfe Perpetuall, and inſlave the People to them.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And that ſuch a Settlement may be made of Right and Freedome, and theſe our ends obtained, and a Peace firmly eſtabliſhed, we know no means, under God, but a truly FREE PARLIAMENT.</p>
            <p>Now for the defence of theſe our Rights and Liberties, we are reſolved to expoſe our Lives to the utmoſt hazards; And we ſhall neither wrong nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any man who doth not joyne himſelfe to the preſent <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> to deſtroy or prevent theſe our righteous ends: And though we have reaſon to belive, That no perſon fearing <hi>GOD,</hi> or of Conſcience, Honour, or Reaſon, can ſatisfie himſelfe to ſhed our innocent blood for ſeeking theſe things, yet however we ſhall commit our ſelves and our juſt cauſe to the tuition of the righteous <hi>God,</hi> and hope in his mercy, That our indeavours may procure Juſtice, Freedome, Peace, and Settlement unto this diſtracted <hi>Nation.</hi>
