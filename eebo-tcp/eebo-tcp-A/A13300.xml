         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

withall, or els by taking away the greateſt parte of the
ſame matter which cauſeth and mainteyneth the ſickenes,
and therefore it is very meete &amp; neceſſarie for euery Phiſition,
before ſuch time as he doe miniſter any thinge at all to the ſick
perſon, diligentlie to learne, and to ſearch out perfectly the
principall cauſe of the diſeaſe, in the which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>be be ignorant,
it is more by good fortune, then by any cunning or ſkill, that he
doe euer cure any diſeaſe at all. For how is it poſſible to helpe
nature, with that which ſhe hath neede of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> except it be firſt

cauſe of the diſeaſe be firſt manifeſtly knowne vnto him, ſoe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
he may miniſter thinges directly, contrary to the cauſe of the
ſame diſeaſe. And therefore I doe moſt greatelye lamente
<pb facs="tcp:18663:4"/>
the ignorance of the common ſort of People, who for the moſte
parte are perſwaded, that one medicine is ſufficient for one
diſeaſe, &amp; not regarding that one diſeaſe may come of ſundrye
cauſes, and therefore it doth neceſſarilie require diuers medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
as for example, weaknes of the ſtomacke (that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
digeſt well, or that it hath no good Appetite) is one diſeaſe,
which neuertheleſſe may come a dozen ſundrie waies at the
leaſt. Therefore the cure of it cannot be alwaies with one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
As if weakenes of the ſtomacke, doe come of a weake
diſtempure of it ſelfe onely, then it muſt of neceſſitie be made
hotte by ſome meanes, but if heate be the cauſe of weakenes,
then it muſt needes be cooled, Likewiſe you muſt moiſten dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and drye moiſture, But if the weakenes doe come of ſome
ſuperfluous humour that both abound, which hath flowed into
the ſtomacke, or hath been there ingendred, then muſt that ill
humour, of neceſſitie be purged out, eyther by a vomite, or els
a purgation with a meeke medicine for it, And if it be fleame,
then with a medicine that expelleth ſleame, But if choller be
abounding there: then muſt it be ſuch a medicine as doth purg
choller, And likewiſe for melancholy, a meete Purgation
muſt be vſed to expell the humour, But if the imbecillitie of the
ſtomacke, be cauſed by a diſtillation and Rewme, that falleth
out of the head into it, then is the cure to be remedied in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> head,
and not in the ſtomacke, Likewiſe if diſtempure of the liuer
or ſpleene, doe weaken the ſtomacke, then the cure conſiſteth
in the healing of thoſe members, and not in miniſtring of any
thinge for the ſtomacke.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no man thinke it ſufficient for the Phiſition,
if he knowe that a man hath ſuch a diſeaſe, as the Ague, the
Collick, the Flix, or ſuch other like &amp;c. that then hee maye
ſtraighte way (if he be ſkillfull) miniſter a medicine meet for
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Noe not foe, but he muſt firſt ſearch by all meanes poſſible,
the very cauſe it ſelfe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſeaſe, which many ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
doe perſwade themſelues, that a ſkilfull Phiſition may doe
<pb facs="tcp:18663:4"/>
in all diſeaſes, by the onely ſight &amp; inſpection of the <hi>Vrine,</hi> But
alas they are altogether deceiued, and for to come to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the cauſe of ſome inward diſeaſe, the <hi>Vrine</hi> profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, for in moſte inwarde diſeaſes of the bodye, there
ought as greate a regard to be had and taken to the <hi>Pulſes,</hi>
and to the diſpoſitions &amp; ſtate of the <hi>Braine,</hi> of him that is ſick,
as there ſhould be had of the <hi>Vrine.</hi> Alſo the <hi>Egeſtions, Sweat,
Spettle,</hi> and other <hi>Excrements,</hi> are not to be neglegted, in ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that at ſome time they do declare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſe of the diſeaſe,
and the ſtate thereof, when the <hi>Vrine</hi> doeth not ſhewe any
thinge at all.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe for example, in a <hi>Pluriſie,</hi> or an inflamation of the
<hi>Lunges,</hi> or in a <hi>Squinancie,</hi> or ſuch like, there is more to be
knowne by <hi>Spettle,</hi> then there is by <hi>Vrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in a <hi>Laſke,</hi> or a bloudye <hi>Flixe,</hi> or in a <hi>Collicke,</hi> or <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake,</hi>
there is more certaintie of Iudgment, to be geuen by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion</hi>
or <hi>Ordure,</hi> then there is by <hi>Vrine:</hi> Which thinges,
thoſe that are not altogether addicted to their owne fantaſies,
may eaſely by good reaſon, be perſwaded to credite, for <hi>Vrine</hi>
is nothing elſe, but the watrie and waſhie parte of the bloude,
for it is ſeperated from bloud in the <hi>Liuer,</hi> and ſucked from
thence into the <hi>Raines,</hi> from whence it diſtilleth downe into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               <hi>Bladder,</hi> and ſoe paſſeth foorth. Seeing therefore that <hi>Vrine</hi>
is the excrement that is ſeperated from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bloud: there is good
cauſe why it ſhould ſhew the ſtate of the <hi>Liuer,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Bloud,</hi>
in all partes of the body, and it can alſo declare the ſtate of all
ſuch members as it paſſeth by, as of the <hi>Raines,</hi> the <hi>Bladder,</hi>
and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>But certainely in other diſeaſes that be out of the <hi>Vaines,</hi> &amp;
be diſtant from the places, by which the <hi>Vrine</hi> paſſeth, there is
no certaine iudgment to be geuen by the <hi>Vrine</hi> vnleſſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie
of the diſeaſe hath infected the <hi>bloud</hi> or the <hi>Liuer</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome ſort, Neuertheles ſuch is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many people,
that they thinke him woorthye of noe eſtimation in Phiſicke,
<pb facs="tcp:18663:5"/>
which cannot at the firſt ſighte of the <hi>Vrine</hi> (although it hath
been carried xx. Miles) tel whether it be the water of a man
or a woman, and how the diſeaſe greeueth the patient better
then himſelfe, &amp; alſo whether he ſhall liue or dye, what diſeaſe
ſoeuer it be, which thinges vndoubtedly in diuers diſeaſes are
impoſſible to be knowne by the onely ſight and inſpection of
the <hi>Vrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is very neceſſarie for him that will miniſter
Phiſicke, duly and rightfully to obſerue theſe 4. rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(That is to ſay) firſt to ſee the ſick Perſon, &amp; to conferre
with him or her, which ſoeuer it be, for there is none that can
ſoe well declare any griefe (whatſoeuer it be) as he can that is
troubled therewith. Secondly to view and feele the Pulſes,
and to obſerue well the ſtate of them. Thirdlye to view very
diligently all the excrements, not onely the vrine, but alſo the
<hi>Spettle, Sweat</hi> and <hi>Ordure.</hi> Fourethlie and laſt of all, to haue
a reſpect to the place where the griefe is, and to conſider well
the accidents that doe ariſe thereof, not omitting to know the
former diet and trade of life, which the ſicke perſon hath vſed,
Theſe thinges then being diligentlie &amp; ſeuerally marked, the
Phiſition may more certainly learne the chiefeſt cauſe of the
diſeaſe, the ſtrength thereof, and to what ende it will come
vnto, then by ſeeing the <hi>Vrine</hi> onely, and alſo by what meanes
he may miniſter a meete medicine for it, whereby the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may ſoone finde eaſe, and purchaſe vnto himſelfe excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
greate fame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> haue I partely declared, what thinges oughte to be
knowne of euery Phiſition, that thereby he might withdraw, &amp;
take awaye the fonde and fooliſh opinion, that a greate
number of people do deeme to be true, that is, that the ſight of
the <hi>Vrine</hi> is ſufficient ynough, for a cunning Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to know the diſeaſe of the ſicke, and the true cauſe thereof,
&amp; to miniſter apt medicines for it. And now I ceaſe to ſpeake
any more hereof, but I will as briefly as I may entreate ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the vſe and benefit that doth ariſe &amp; come of <hi>Purging,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18663:5"/>
and <hi>Bloud-letting,</hi> &amp; I would wiſh all thoſe that do practiſe
the ſame, to be carefull thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo that if the bodye of a manne, doe abound with
humours, which are ready to oppreſſe nature, then whether
there be any ſicknes in the body preſent, by meanes of them, or
if there be but daunger of ſicknes, thoſe humours muſt be eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuat
out of the bodie, eyther by <hi>Bloud-letting, Purging, vomit,
Sweating Bathes,</hi> or elſe by ſome other kind of euacuation.
But I will ſpeake here onely of euacuation by <hi>Bloud-letting</hi>
and <hi>Purging,</hi> and firſt of all of <hi>Bloudletting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be diuers thinges to be conſidered of, before <hi>Bloud-letting,</hi>
as the age of the patient, the complexion, the time of
the yeare, the region, the cuſtome, the ſtrength, and the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The age muſt be conſidered, becauſe Children vnder 14.
yeares of age, and old folke may not be let <hi>bloud,</hi> vnleſſe great
neceſſitie require it.</p>
            <p>The complexion is to be noted, becauſe a hote complexion
hath large vaines, and aboundeth with much <hi>bloud,</hi> and they
may therefore forbeare a good quantitie of <hi>bloud;</hi> But colde
complexions haue narrow vaines and litle <hi>bloud,</hi> and therfore
theire euacuation muſt be ſmall.</p>
            <p>The time of the yeare muſt be very well marked, that the
weather be not too hote nor too colde, and therefore the ſpring
time is the moſt apteſt time for <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> becauſe that
then it is temperate.</p>
            <p>The Region and Cuntrey, is to be ſpoken of, becauſe it is
to be noted, that if the Region be very hote, or elſe very colde,
it is not good to let <hi>bloud,</hi> but a temperate Region is moſte
meeteſt of all for it.</p>
            <p>Cuſtome is not to be neglected, for thereby we may knowe
that they that haue bene accuſtomed to <hi>bleede,</hi> may better
ſuffer <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> then thoſe that were neuer letten <hi>bloud</hi>
at any time before.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of the Perſon muſt be regarded, for if there be
<pb facs="tcp:18663:6"/>
greate weakenes, then is it very daungerouſe to let <hi>bloude</hi> at
all, except great neceſſitie compelleth.</p>
            <p>Alſo the vehemencie of the diſeaſe is worthie to be marked:
for if it be a vehemente diſeaſe, then you muſt let <hi>bloud</hi> foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
if the former circumſtances will permit it.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges being conſidered, if they will permit <hi>bloud-letting,</hi>
and if it be in a needefull cauſe, then it ſhalbe very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to knowe in what ſigne the Moone is in, for you muſte
take heed that ſhe be not in the ſigne that gouerneth that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
wherein you intend to open the vaine, &amp; alſo to forſee that
ſhee be in ſuch a ſigne, as is good to let <hi>bloude</hi> in.</p>
            <p>The vſes and commodities of <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> are theſe that
are here expreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is a generall rule, that <hi>bloud-letting</hi> is a very
good remedie for all diſeaſes that be engendred of aboundance
flowing or eruption of <hi>bloud,</hi> as be chieflie the Feuers called
<hi>Sinochy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo the <hi>Phreneſie, Squinancie, Pluriſie, Peripnewmony,
Opthalmie,</hi> and againſt all inflamatious, and impoſtumatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
engendred of <hi>bloude</hi> in the <hi>Lyuer,</hi> the <hi>Spleene,</hi> the <hi>Raines,</hi> the
<hi>Wombe,</hi> the <hi>Share,</hi> the <hi>Arme-holes,</hi> the <hi>Armes,</hi> the <hi>Legges:</hi>
and to conclude, in all inwarde or outwarde partes, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the inflamation bee: <hi>bloud-letting</hi> is good for it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be now preſent; or that there be any danger, that it wil
ſhortely engender.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Bloud-letting</hi> is good in <hi>Feuers,</hi> whether they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
or intermittent, inſomuch that the obſtructions &amp; ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinges
of the <hi>Vaines,</hi> be cauſed of immoderate repletion of the
humoures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo that <hi>Bloud-letting</hi> doth emptie aud euacuat from
the bodie, all humours alike, as well the good as the bad.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is chieflie to be vſed, when there is to great
an ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dance of <hi>bloude</hi> in the bodie &amp; other humours, which
doe ſtraine the <hi>vaines,</hi> and that there is greate daunger &amp; ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie
in breaking of ſome <hi>vaines,</hi> or the bruſing out of ſome
<pb facs="tcp:18663:6"/>
fluxe of <hi>bloude,</hi> or of choking, and to extinguiſh naturall heate.
And therefore in ſuch caſes, you muſt let <hi>bloud</hi> with all ſpead,
although the ſicknes be not already preſent.</p>
            <p>For by letting of <hi>bloud</hi> in due ſeaſon, the ſuperfluous full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the <hi>vaines,</hi> is brought into a meane ſtate againe, and the
paines that came of the fulnes and ſtretching of the veſſels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed:
And the heauines that was felte in the bodie, is cleane
taken away, and the bodie is lightened, and made more quick
and nimble, to doe all ſuch actions as nature hath ordeyned it
to doe. Alſo it cauſeth nature, to haue a larger ſcope, &amp; a free
paſſage by opening &amp; emptying of the ſtraight waies &amp; paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
of the <hi>vaines</hi> and <hi>Arteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt of all, if it be done in time, it preuenteth diuers and
ſundrie diſeaſes, into which the bodie was both apt and readie
to haue fallen into.</p>
            <p>Many more commodities might here be rehearſed as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>bloud-letting,</hi> which is done when neceſſitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and as it ought to be done, but to conclude (omitting all
other) Note this for a generall rule, that <hi>bloud-letting</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good againſt all kinde of diſeaſes, which be cauſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
of <hi>bloude,</hi> and not onely when the diſeaſes are preſent,
but alſo it is good letting of <hi>bloude,</hi> to preuent any ſuch diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
if they be forſeene or feared, alwaies regarding that there
be none of theſe impediments aforeſaid, which doe prohibite &amp;
forbid <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> except it be in great neceſſitie and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
for then as the common prouerbe is, <hi>Neceſſitas non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
legem,</hi> that is: Neceſſitie hath noe lawe.</p>
            <p>Heere would I leaue of to ſpeake of <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> but that
there commeth into my minde, the common opinion of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people, which doe certeinly beleeue, that if any perſon
be let <hi>Bloud</hi> one yeare, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he muſt likewiſe be let <hi>bloude</hi> euery
yeare, or els he is in (I cannot tell) how great danger, which
fond opinion of theires (whence ſoeuer it ſprong at the firſt) is
noe more like to be true, then I ſhoulde ſay, when a man hath
a greate wounde by chaunce, in any part of his body, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:18663:7"/>
he loſeth much <hi>bloud,</hi> and that after it is healed, he muſt of
neceſſitie haue the like wounde againe the next yeare, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
as much <hi>bloud,</hi> or els he is in daunger of greate ſicknes
or of death, Which opinion, if I my ſelfe did affirme it to be
true (although it be moſt falſe) yet I might vſe the like reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and aucthoritie to defende it, that the common people doe vſe
for theires: for they can ſay nothing if they be aſked why they
thinke ſoe, bnt that they haue heard many ſay ſoe, Therefore
I would wiſh that noe man ſhould credite any longer this fond
and fooliſh opinion, being moſt falſe, vnleſſe he can ſhewe good
reaſon for it, which I ame very well aſſured of, noe man can
doe. Mary this I thinke, that like as <hi>bloud-letting</hi> is not good
againſt all diſeaſes, ſoe alſo it is not good in all perſons, but
onely in thoſe that will be content to vſe afterward a moderate
and conuenient diet.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore that doe abound with <hi>bloud,</hi> and will be let
<hi>bloud</hi> to preſerue themſelues, from the daunger of any diſeaſe,
which is like ſhortely to enſue and moleſt them, They muſt for
a long time after, be content to vſe a moderat and conuenient
diet, For thoſe that be vntemperat &amp; gluttonous in meates, or
are great drinkers, &amp; wine-bibbers, they doe not onely receiue
no commoditie at all by <hi>bloud-letting:</hi> but alſo often times,
they catch more hurt by it, then they ſhould haue had without
it, for in 3. or 4. daies ſpace after, they fill &amp; ſtuffe themſelues
with more raw iuices and humours (by meanes of vnmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
diet) then they had before, and often times they do dye
through connulcion.</p>
            <p>And therefore note that there is ſuch force and vertue in a
moderate diet, to eſchue and decline diſeaſes, that without the
due obſeruation of it, <hi>bloud-letting</hi> is to noe purpoſe at all.
And therefore if the common ſaying of the people be true in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
body, that they muſt of neceſſitie be let <hi>bloud</hi> often, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
true, but it is in ſuch as keepe an immoderat diet, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after <hi>Bloud-letting,</hi> and therefore I do aduertiſe all men,
to beware of exceſſe in eating &amp; drinking after <hi>bloud-letting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18663:7"/>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> after <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> none ought to walke very

be quiet and reſt himſelfe, vntill ſuch time as his ſpirites ſhall
be wel refreſhed and quieted againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo, that no perſon being let <hi>blood,</hi> ought to ſleepe
immediatly after <hi>bloud-letting,</hi> but let him keepe himſelfe
both quiet and wakinge, and auoiding all contention and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of body and minde, and about two houres after lettinge
of <hi>bloud,</hi> there may a litle foode be taken, but let it be ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will make good iuice and nouriſh apace, and within 4. or 5.
houres after <hi>bloud-letting</hi> or ſome what afore, the patient may
be permitted to ſleepe, ſoe that it be prouided for, &amp; taken heed
of, that he doe not turne himſelfe vpon that Arme, where the
<hi>vaine</hi> was opened, and let him alſo take good heede that he do
not looſen the band, and ſoe let the <hi>bloud</hi> flowe out againe, and
let him afterwardes vſe a ſparing diet, dayly increaſing it by
little and litle, vntill ſuch time as he be come to his accuſtomed
or ordinarie diet againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> note that the morning is the moſt meeteſt time of all for
<hi>bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting,</hi>
when euery digeſtion is perfectly finiſhed, &amp; the
ſuperfluities and excrements of ech of them fully auoided out,
which thinges of neceſſitie muſt be foreſeene, that they bee ſo,
Or at the leaſt in a time of great extremitie, the next apt time
to let <hi>blood</hi> in, is when the ſtomacke is ſomewhat emptie, and
that is about ſixe or eight houres after meate. <hi>Thus</hi> much I
haue entreated of as concerning <hi>blood-letting,</hi> and now I
am purpoſlie minded to ſpeake ſomewhat of the vſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that come of <hi>Purging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> it is to be vnderſtood, that euery kinde of <hi>Purgation,</hi>
hath that ſecret vertue and propertie in it ſelfe, that when it is
receiued into a mans body, and prouoked to exerciſe the vertue
that it hath by naturall heate labouring to digeſt it, then doth
it draw vnto it all ſuch humours, as it hath vertue and power
to <hi>Purge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore a <hi>Purgation</hi> is an euacuation of vicious and
<pb facs="tcp:18663:8"/>
corrupt humours, which doe oftentimes trouble and moleſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
body, but not of all corrupt and bad humours alike.</p>
            <p>For euery <hi>Purging</hi> medicine, doth drawe vnto it ſelfe, one
peculier and proper humour (that is) eyther <hi>Hegme</hi> or <hi>chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
or elſe melancholie or watery humours.</p>
            <p>And therefore thoſe perſons that be perfectlie in health,
ought not to take a <hi>Purgation,</hi> ſince they doe not abound with
corrupt humours, wherefore in thoſe, when the medicine fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
no ſuch ſuperfluous humours as it hath vertue to drawe,
it conſumeth and waſteth the <hi>bloud</hi> and the fleſh. And for that
cauſe, whole folkes are not purged by <hi>purgations,</hi> but rather
conſumed and waſted, for it is manyfeſt hereby, that <hi>Purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>
be very daungerous to them that are in perfect health, which
thinge is teſtified alſo of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 37. <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> of
his ſecond booke, where he ſaieth after this ſort, <hi>Qui corpore
bene ſe habent hos purgare periculoſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt,</hi> (that is) it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
purging of thoſe that be in perfect health.</p>
            <p>Alſo becauſe euery purging medicine hath vertue to drawe
one peculier homour, there is good heede and care to be taken,
that ſuch a medicine be miniſtred as hath vertue to drawe out
the humour abounding, and none other, or elſe in ſtead of much
good, that of it ſelfe it would doe, if it were conueniently mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred:
it may contraryewiſe doe exceading great hurte, and
woorke many inconueniences to the body. And accordinge to
to the ſaying of <hi>Hipocrates</hi> in the laſt <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of his firſte
book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in this maner. <hi>Si qualia oportet purgari purgentur, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert,
et facile ferunt, ſi contra, difficulter,</hi> that is, yf ſuch things
be purged as ought to be, it profiteth, and may eaſily be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but if it be contrarywiſe, it hurteth and may ſcarcely bee
borne. Therefore there ought diligent care and heed to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the receiuing of a <hi>purgation,</hi> that it be miniſtred by a
ſkilfull Phiſition, that hath certainly found out what humour
it is that aboundeth. But alas the greateſt number of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſort of people, do, hould an opinion that if they may haue
a medicine for a little money, which will poruoke them often
<pb facs="tcp:18663:8"/>
to the ſtoole, what humour ſoeuer it be, and purgeth out, they
are ſafe ynough: howe be it, I would wiſh them hereafter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to haue in minde this ſaying of the moſt excellent Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<hi>Hipocrates</hi> in the xxxii. <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of the firſt booke,
<hi>Deiectiones non multitudine ſunt eſtimandae, ſed ſi talia deijci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur,
qualia conueniunt,</hi> that is: Egeſtions are not to bee
eſteamed for their great quantitie, but if ſuch bad humours be
purged out as they ought to be (that is) ſuch vicious &amp; corrupt
humours as doe abound and bee ſuperfluous in mans bodye,
then is the bodie quieted for a long time after, if it be dieted as
aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>There be diuers thinges chiefly to be conſidered of by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
Phiſition before ſuch time as he doe miniſter any <hi>Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to the ſicke perſon: as the qualitie and quantitie of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
the ſtrength of him or her that is ſicke, the age, the time
of the yeare, and laſtly the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The qualitie of the homour is greatly to be conſidered, that
thereby he may perfectly knowe what kinde of humour is to be
euacuate, &amp; purged out, for it muſt be onely that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the bodie, with ſuperfluous aboundance thereof.</p>
            <p>As if great aboundance of <hi>fleame</hi> doe moleſt and trouble the
bodie, then hee muſt of neceſſitie miniſter a medicine whiche
purgeth fleame, and ſo likewiſe for all other humours what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
abounding in any part of the bodie.</p>
            <p>Alſo he that doth vndertake the miniſtring of any medicine,
ought to haue great reſpect to the ſtrength of the ſicke or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed
perſon: for if he be very weake and feeble, there ought
no <hi>purgation</hi> at all to be miniſtred vnto him, becauſe all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>purgations</hi> doe both weaken nature &amp; diminiſh ſtrength,
and the ſtronger the ſicke perſon is, the more he is weakened
thereby. Let all men therefore beware of vehement &amp; ſtrong
<hi>purgations,</hi> leaſt they put their liues in hazard &amp; danger. By
the age of the Patient. the Phiſition is put in minde that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and old men ought not to receiue any <hi>Purgations,</hi> except
maruailous great neceſſitie doe require it. The time of the
<pb facs="tcp:18663:9"/>
yeare is not to be neglected, for there be ſome times of the yeare
wherein <hi>Purgations</hi> ought not to be miniſtred, as in Sommer,
and eſpecially during the time of the <hi>Dogge daies,</hi> as they are
moſt commonly called, and alſo during all the time, that the
Sunne is in <hi>Leo,</hi> for then is nature burnt vp, and made ſoe
weake withall, that ſhe is not able to ſuffer the force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of a <hi>Purgation,</hi> but the Spring time is the moſt meeteſt
and principaleſt time in all the yeare, for the taking of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
becauſe it is then temperate.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, the Phiſition ought diligently, to behould &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the diſeaſe, that he knowing certainly what kind of
diſeaſe it is, may the more better finde out of what humour, it
is cauſed, <hi>As for example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yf</hi> the Phiſition do perceiue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diſeaſe to be a tertian <hi>Feuer,</hi>
ſtraightway he knoweth that it is cauſed of great aboundance
of choller, and therefore he muſt of neceſſitie miniſter a meete
medicine to purge choller, withall, and ſo likewiſe in all other
diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> likewiſe, that if there be none of the impediments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
named, a <hi>Purgation</hi> is good to be miniſtred to all ſuch as
haue aboundance of euill iuice or corrupt humours in the
body, for it draweth out all the bad humours that doe moleſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
body, and thereby doth reſtore it to his owne ſtate againe.</p>
            <p>But if a <hi>Purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> be raſhly miniſtred eyther to one that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it not, or at an inconuenient time, or that it be ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
as draweth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out the humour which then aboundeth,
or if the medicine be vehement and very ſtrong, it will ſurely
put the Patient in great daunger of his life.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges therefore ought to be well taken heede of by
all menne, leſt they catch great hurt when they hope for ſome
great profite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> if a <hi>Purgation</hi> be diſcreetly miniſtred to him that hath
need of it in due time, and by an apt and meet medicine, which
is of that force and abillitie, to drawe out the abounding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in ſufficient quantitie, then doth the medicine purchaſe
<pb facs="tcp:18663:9"/>
moſt ſinguler great commodties to the body, for it euacuateth
and emptieth out all the chiefeſt cauſes of the diſeaſes and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
eyther preſent or els to come, being ingendred of any
ſuperfluous or corrupt humour, as are moſt commonly <hi>Feuers,
tercians, quartaines, quotidians,</hi> or <hi>Fluxes,</hi> and are cauſed of rawe
humours or ſharpe choller, <hi>Dropſies, Goutes, Palſies, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>targies,</hi>
and diuers other &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo that before a <hi>Purgation</hi> be miniſtred, there ought
a medicine to be taken, which ſhould prepare the body, &amp; make
it apt to purge, and therefore it is called a preparatiue, it is
geuen for two cauſes, eyther to deuide, extenuat, &amp; make them
groſſe and clammy humours, that they may be ready to flowe
out, when the medicine draweth them, or elſe it is geuen to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and vnſtoppe the conduits &amp; veſſels of the body, by which
the <hi>Purgation</hi> muſt drawe the ſuperfluous humour to it.</p>
            <p>And this is that which <hi>Hipocrates</hi> doth counſaile in the firſt

any man will purge the body, he muſt make it flowing, by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and vnopening of the veſſels.</p>
            <p>The moſt meeteſt time of al to receiue a <hi>Purgation</hi> is in the
morning, for then are all the digeſtions perfectly finiſhed, and
the ſtomacke is without meate, There is alſo great heede to be
taken in what ſigne the moone is in, before ſuch time as any
<hi>Purgation</hi> be miniſtred, for ſome ſignes are very good for it, &amp;
other ſome are euill, Therefore I would wiſh all ſuch as doe
take vpon them the miniſtring of any <hi>Purgation,</hi> to haue great
regard before they do miniſter it, of the ſicke perſon, the time,
and the place greeued, and alſo to marke wel all ſuch thinges
as are before rehearſed, leaſt that they doe more hurt thereby
in one day to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſicke perſon, then they are able to doe him good
in a whole yeare, and yet they may doe it of meere ſimplicite,
not knowing themſelues what they haue done, neyther are
they able to cure the ſame wound which they themſelues haue
made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18663:10"/>
A <hi>Purgation</hi> muſt be taken hote, for ſoe it offendeth the
ſtomacke leaſt, and it will worke the ſooner.</p>
            <p>Alſo thoſe that are apt to vomite, and are not able to endure
the ſmell of the <hi>Purgation,</hi> let them ſtoppe their noſethrills, or
elſe let them ſmell to ſome odorifferous thinge, when they are
about to take it, and aſſoone as it is taken, it is good for the
Patient, to ſmell to a toſte of browne bread dipped in <hi>vineger,</hi>
and to applie warme clothes to the ſtomacke, and to waſh the
mouth preſently after that it is taken, with ſome odoriferous
<hi>wine,</hi> or els to chew ſome ſweete and pleaſant thing to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the bitter taſte or ſmell of the medicine, &amp; by this meanes
vomiting ſhal be eſchewed.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe for the ſpace of one houre after that the <hi>Purgation</hi>
is taken, let the Patient ſit ſtill and keepe himſelfe quiet, and
without any ſleepe at all, that the ſtrength of the medicine may
paſſe into all partes of his body, but if the <hi>Purgation</hi> do worke
ſlowly, let him walke vp and downe for a good ſpace after, if he
can, and when it worketh, in any caſe there muſt be great care
taken, that the Patient do not ſleepe, for ſoe the operation of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
medicine would be ſtopped.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the time of <hi>Purging</hi> immoderate heate and cold are
to be eſchewed, and therefore a very great fier, and the cold &amp;
open ayre are both hurtefull, for the body muſt be kept in a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
heate.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Purgation</hi> hath done workinge, the Patient
muſt be nouriſhed with a meane quantitie of ſome broth, that
will breede good iuice, and be eaſelie digeſted, and afterwards
by little &amp; litle, returne to his accuſtomed diet againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> haue I as brieflye as I could, declared the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which doe come of <hi>bloud-letting</hi> and <hi>Purging,</hi> being wel

that will euſue both of <hi>bloud-letting</hi> and <hi>Purging</hi> if they be at

ſeeke for the counſaile and aide of one that is
