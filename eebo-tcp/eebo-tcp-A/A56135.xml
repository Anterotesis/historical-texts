            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Legacies were 430l. and more given by a certain Kinſman named <hi>Farnham,</hi> to the Widow and her Children. At the inſtance of the widow, when as the Executor denied or delayed to pay the Legacies, I obtained Letters from the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> in favour of the Widow, (for the Duke was Mr. of the Horſe, and the ſaid <hi>George Wright</hi> was one of the Kings ſervants under him,) when I had now the Letters in my hand, and was about to give them to the Widdow, to ſend into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Executor lived, this night <hi>George Wright</hi> appeared to me in a dreame, dead at leaſt two yeares before; hee ſeemed to me very handſome, and merry enough.

            <p>You have now a ſhort Hiſtoricall View of the Arch-biſhops life, written for the moſt part with his owne hand; in which you may obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How many Benefices, Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſticall Preferments he paſſed through in his dayes; at moſt of which he was never Reſident, nor did any good to Soule or body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By what meanes he procured moſt of his preferments; to wit, by unlawfull Actions, as by marying the Lady <hi>Rich</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Devon</hi>; by his baſe flatterie of, and obſequiouſneſſe to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by incenſing his Majeſty againſt Parliament, invading the Subjects Properties, Liberties, &amp;c. as will more fully appeare in the Relation of his tryall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What a ſuperſtitious obſerver, and diligent Regiſter he was, of his owne idle dreames; and how ominous ſome of them have proved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How great a Creature, Inſtrument, aſſiſtant, Advocate he hath beene to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> who firſt brought him into favour at Court. What a friend to <hi>Strafford</hi>; and malicious Enemy to the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. What extraordinary tranſcendent favour and power he obtained with the King whom he oft miſcouncelled to the publique prejudice and what ill inſtruments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61240:21"/>
and creatures of his owne he placed about his Majeſty; as <hi>Windebanck,</hi> and others to effect his owne deſignes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What a great favorite and Inſtrument he was to the Queene and Popiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how grand an Enemy, a Perſecuter of the zealous Proteſtant partie, under the name of Puritans.</p>
            <p n="7">7. What a bitter Enemy he hath beene to Parliaments and their proceedings; and how odious he became both to Parliaments and people for his Tyranny, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Popiſh Ceremonies, Innovations in Religion and unjuſt proceedings.</p>
            <p n="8">8. What an Arch-Incendiary he hath ſhewed himſelfe, betweene his Majeſty and his people, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. What a buſie body he hath beene in all kinds of ſecular affaires, incomparible with his ſpirituall function.</p>
            <p n="10">10. How ſedulous he hath ſhewed himſelfe to exalt the Power, Pompe, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Biſhops and the Clergie; to advance them above, exempt them from all ſecular powers, juriſdictions, and to ingroſſe the greateſt temporall Offices into their hands, that ſo they might Lord it over all men.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That he hath beene exceedingly devoted to and promoted Popiſh Ceremonies, and greatly favoured, advanced men Popiſhly affected, as <hi>Windebancke, Mountague, Manwaring</hi> and others.</p>
            <p n="12">12.

            <p>The firſt is, his pulling downe of the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> to repaire <hi>Pauls,</hi> and ſending the Pariſhioners to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi>: which being related by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hungerford</hi> to Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> during his cloſe impriſonment in <hi>Ierſey,</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon preſently replyed, <hi>that this ſeemed to him a moſt certaine preſage, that the Arch-Biſhop, the Sea of Canterbury, &amp; Popery ſhould have a speedy fall in England</hi>: for Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> to whoſe memory this Demoliſhed Church was dedicated, <hi>was the</hi>

               <hi>firſt founder of the Archbiſhopricke and Sea of Canterbury, from whom it derived both its being and precedency, and</hi> Auſtine <hi>the</hi> Munke (ſent over by him) <hi>the firſt Archbiſhop of this Sea, who introduced the firſt dreggs of Popery into our Britiſh Church</hi>; ſeing therefore the Arch-Biſhop was now growne ſo unthankfull as to demoliſh Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> his owne founder, (from whom Doctor <note n="*" place="margin">Sunday no Sabbath. p. 3.48 Altire Chriſtianum, p. 144.</note> 
               <hi>Pocklington</hi> in his late printed bookes, derived his Lineall ſucceſſion) that himſelfe, and his Sea of Canterbury could not ſtand long after, ſince the building muſt needs fall to ground, when the foundation is raſed; and the ſending of the people from <hi>Pope Gregories</hi> Church to <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> was a good <hi>Omen</hi> that the Popes Church and party in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be demini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, demoliſhed, and <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> repleniſhed, reedified: all which we now viſibly behold in a great meaſure fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The 2. is, That when the Archbiſhop kept his Metropoliticall viſitation, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1635. &amp;c. he concluded it at <hi>Barkin</hi> Church next to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> gate: which Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> (then a Priſoner in the Tower) obſerving; told the Lieutenant of the Tower, and others: <hi>that the Archbiſhop had now viſited all places within the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>as well thoſe exempt as not exempt, except only the Tower, which was reſerved for his laſt viſitation, and that he doubted not but he ſhould ſee him a Priſoner in the Tower ere long, and, himſelfe a freeman</hi>: which accordingly came to paſſe; The Archbiſhop ſitting at Church in the Tower Chappell in the ſame ſeat, where Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> uſually ſate dureing his impriſonment.</p>
            <p>The 3. is this, which is moſt remarkable; being a miraculous Omen from Heaven it ſelfe, of his owne and his Seas downfall by, his meanes.<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall. Newes from <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> p 13.14.</note> The Prebends of <hi>Canterbury Anno</hi> 1639. hearing of the pacification with the <hi>Scottes</hi> and being falſely informed, that they had condeſcended to entertaine Biſhops; did for joy of theſe glad-tidings, in the hight of their Prelaticall glory, ſet up foure great Iron Vanes upon the 4. Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of their higheſt Cathedrall Tower, called <hi>Bell-harry</hi> Steple; on which the Coat-Armes, of the <hi>King, Prince, Church,</hi> and <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> were ſeverally,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61240:21"/>
guilded, But on <hi>Innocents</hi> day following very early in the morning, being the 27th. of <hi>December,</hi> in the mideſt of their Chriſtmas Iovialities, and Cathedrall Gamballs, the Vane which had the Archbiſhops Armes in it, had a tumbling caſt from the Toppe of the Steeple, being ſtrucke downe by a ſtroke from Heaven in a fearefull tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt. The Archbiſhops Armes in the fall pulled downe the toppe of the Pinnacle which upheld them, and being carried (partly againſt the wind) a good diſtance from the Steeple on which they ſtood, fell upon the roofe of the Cloyſter, in the concave and lower part whereof the Armes of the Archbiſhopricke of <hi>Canterbury</hi> were Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Stone; which Armes in the Cloyſter were daſhed and broken in peeces by the Armes that fell from the Steeple; <hi>The Armes of the preſent Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, breaking downe the Armes of the Archbiſhopricke, and Sea of Canterbury,</hi> The fall was ſo violent, that it brake through the Leads, plankes, Tymber, Stone-Arch of the Cloyſter, and made an impreſſion in the pavement of the Cloyſter, as if it had beene done with a Canon ſhot, which is partly to be ſeene at this very day, though repaired, being very neere the place, where that proud Arch-prelate of <hi>Canterbury, Thomas Becket.</hi> was caſt downe headlong in that Cathedrall for his Treaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. The Cathedraliſts hereupon tooke downe the other three Vanes, and repaired the Cloyſter withall ſpeed and ſecrecy, that ſo leſſe notice might be taken of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ruine.</p>
            <p>Neither was this ſad Omen ſingular, but ſeconded with others both at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and <hi>Croyden</hi> the ſelfe-ſame night, as appeares by this paſſage in the Archbiſhops Diary under his owne hand. <hi>December</hi> 27. 1639. <hi>Friday</hi> being Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> day at night, betweene 12. and 2. of the Clocke the next morning, the greateſt winde that ever I heard blow: many of the Watermen at <hi>Lambeth</hi> had their Boats tumbled up and downe, and broken to peeces, as they lay on the Land. One of my ſervants went to <hi>London,</hi> and durſt not come home that evening the weather was ſo foule: that night the Shafts of two Chimnies at <hi>Lambeth</hi> were blowne downe upon the roofe of his Chamber, and beat downe both the Lead and Rafters upon his bed; where had hee beene that night, he muſt have periſhed, At <hi>Croyden</hi> one of the Pinnacles fell from the Steeple, beat downe the Lead, and the roofe of the Church neere 20. Foote ſquare, All which, compared with the ſincking of the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Ferry-boat with the Archbiſhops Coach-horſes Coach and men to the bottome of <hi>Thames Sept.</hi> 19. 1633. the very firſt day he removed from <hi>Fulham</hi> to <hi>Lambeth</hi> houſe, was no doubt an ominous preſage of his owne and the Archbiſhopricks ſincking, through his pride and violence.</p>
            <p>The 4th. is this. That his Majeſty in the Moneth of <hi>February,</hi> 1641. caſually paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Citie of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with the <hi>Queene</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> did in Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines Abbey of Canterbury</hi> (the firſt Archbiſhop of that Sea) ſigne the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>againſt the Biſhops Votes in Parliament</hi>: which Act unlorded our Lordly Prelates, and gave them a fatall overthrow, ſuch as ſtrucke proud <hi>Canterbury</hi> dead at heart, and undermined all his Prelaticall deſignes, to advance the Biſhops Pompe, and Power.</p>
            <p>The laſt is, his owne fatall Dreame at <hi>Oxford,</hi> long ſince publiſhed, and lately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted from his owne mouth at his Tryall in the Lords Houſe, the ſumme whereof is this: That when he was a young Scholler in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he dreamed one night, that he came to farre greater preferment in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and power in the State, then ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man of his birth and Calling did before him; in which greatneſſe and worldly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines he continued many yeares; but after all this hapineſſe, before he awaked, he drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he was hanged. The firſt part of this Dreame, hath been long ſince really verified, and the concluſion of it, is in all probability like to be ſpeedily accompliſhed, upon the cloſe of his Tryall: The exact Compleate Relation whereof, may (God aſſiſting and the Parliament commanding) hereafter follow in its order, wherein the criminall part of his life will appeare moſt foule, and deteſtable, in all the Particulars of his impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
