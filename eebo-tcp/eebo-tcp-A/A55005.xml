            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A Brief Account of the Life of Mr. <hi>Herbert Palmer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Reverend Author of this enſuing Treatiſe, was (whilſt living) prized by good men for his Piety, and loved by all wiſe men (that knew him) for his Learning: And now he is dead, let not the Reader in this ſhort Epitome of his life, expect any more than a brief
<pb facs="tcp:44356:5"/>
Narrative or Account of his moſt eminent, peculiar, publick, paſſages and tranſactions in the world.</p>
                  <p>He was the Son of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Palmer</hi> of <hi>Wingham</hi> near <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Kent,</hi> where he was born about <hi>March 1601.</hi> he was prudently and piouſly educated, and in his Infancy made great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the ſerious ſtudy of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Learning, ſo that when he was <hi>4</hi> or <hi>5</hi> years of age, he would oft cry to go his Mother, <hi>To hear ſomewhat of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From a Child he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:44356:5"/>
and earnestly deſired to be <hi>A Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had excellent natural parts, both intellectual and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; his excellency and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the French Tongue, (which he could ſpeak almoſt as ſoon as Engliſh) and the great knowledge he had, as well of the perſons places and affairs of the French Nation, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the pronunciation of the Language, made many ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (to his Nativity) believe he was a French-man born; and after his call to the Miniſtry, he Preached to the French Church at <hi>Canterbury</hi> on two ſeveral ſolemn days to the great
<pb facs="tcp:44356:6"/>
edification and approbation of the hearers.</p>
                  <p>His Industry alſo in learning the Latine Tongue, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by his great proficiency therein whilst young.</p>
                  <p>His dutifulneſs and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards his Parents, as well when grown to years of maturity, as whilſt young, ſpake his great reverence and esteem of them; and as he was a great Example of Filial obedience in his Converſation, ſo he was a great Aſſerter of Parental au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>At the age of about <hi>14</hi> years,
<pb facs="tcp:44356:6"/>
(to wit) in the year of our Lord <hi>1615.</hi> he was admittod as Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Commoner in <hi>St. Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And according to his stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſert, took the degree of Maſter of Arts in the year <hi>1622.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the following year was conſtituted Fellow of <hi>Queens Colledge</hi> in the ſame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity; and whilſt he ſo continued, he took on him the great care of many Pupils, who (by his prudent and painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and care over them) made great proficiency in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whilſt they continued with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44356:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>And in the year <hi>1624.</hi> he was called, and ordained to the work of the Miniſtry, by a Licence from the then Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In the year <hi>1626.</hi> he was called to the publick exerciſe of his Miniſtry at <hi>Alphage</hi> Church in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> where by his laborious Induſtry, ſound Doctrine, and exemplary converſation, he proved himſelf to be a burning and ſhining light.</p>
                  <p>In the year <hi>1632.</hi> he removed to <hi>Aſhwell</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> by the preſentment of <hi>Laud</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The plainneſs of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:44356:7"/>
did manifeſt his great deſire to be underſtood by his Auditors for their Edification.</p>
                  <p>His pains in Catechiſing the ignorant, his charity in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Bibles for the poor, and his humility in admitting perſons of all ranks and degrees to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him for their Souls edification, got him love, reſpect, and honour, from all acquainted with him, and was a great means of reformation amongst the people to whom he was a Paſtor, obliging them to ſeveral excellent reſolutions againſt drunkenneſs, ſwearing, or other open debaucheries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44356:8"/>He made and printed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Catechiſm entituled, <hi>An endeavour of making the Principles of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion plain and eaſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Domestick or Family Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was as pious, as his Eccleſiaſtick or Church care was painful; he would not permit any of his houſhold for (frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excuſes) to be abſent from family duties, neither would he entertain any in his family, that either were not truly God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Religious, or willing to be instructed in the wayes of God. He read the Scriptures, and prayed, twice every day in his family, Catechiſed twice
<pb facs="tcp:44356:8"/>
every week; and after every meal he cauſed to be read, as at his own, ſo at his ſervants Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a portion of Gods word; requiring alſo on the <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> an account, from thoſe under his Tuition, of what they remembred of the Sermon I reached the Sabbath day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He would not ſuffer any of his ſervants to ſit up late (about their weeks work) upon <hi>Saturday</hi> at nights; neither on the Sabbath would he eat of any diſh, if he underſtood it kept any of his ſervants from the publick ordinance, by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it.</p>
                  <p>And as he was painfull in
<pb facs="tcp:44356:9"/>
his Eccleſiaſtick, and exemplar in the Domeſtick Government, ſo alſo was he pious in his more private retired cloſet duties, being a great admirer of, and having great knowledge in, the Scriptures, which he took great delight in when young, and highly honoured whilſt he lived.</p>
                  <p>He kept a perfect Diery of all (or moſt of) the paſſages of his Life.</p>
                  <p>He often ſet whole days apart, to humble himſelf, (in private) by Faſting and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>He took the degree of Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Arts, in the year <hi>1630.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44356:9"/>
and in <hi>1632.</hi> he was taken in by the the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, as a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Preacher.</p>
                  <p>In the year <hi>1643.</hi> he was called to be one of the Aſſembly of Divines, and ſome time after, elected as Paſtor in <hi>Dukes-Place,</hi> from whence he removed to <hi>New-Church</hi> in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> (where he was the firſt Miniſter that preached there) in both, which places, he was highly and greatly eſteemed of, and by all his Auditors (that were profeſſors of piety.) Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo his Miniſtry at <hi>New-Church,</hi> he was a Lecturer at the <hi>Abbey Church</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and ſo painfull was he
<pb facs="tcp:44356:10"/>
(in the ſervice of God,) that he never declined any Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial exerciſe that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to perform, whether in publick or in private.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>April 1644.</hi> he was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Maſter of <hi>Queens-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> where he cauſed the exerciſe of Sermons, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the <hi>Colledge</hi> Chappel weekly, all the year; where alſo he endeavoured to promote
<pb facs="tcp:44356:10"/>
Learning, by his conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Scholars to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity in their studies; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing alſo (by his own moneys) many Authors, which he gave to the Library, and maintained at his own charge, divers poor and neceſſitous Scholars.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of a publick ſpirit, laying out himſelf, for God: greatly ſelf-denying, and very Zealous for and in the things of God.</p>
                  <p>His freedome, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in reference to the publick affairs, may appear by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he preach'd before the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44356:11"/>
Divers of which are now in Print.</p>
                  <p>His Temperance and Sobriety were great, as well in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, as in his Dyet.</p>
                  <p>The good works he did, (while living) commands us to praiſe his liberal charity, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table liberality.</p>
                  <p>The time of his ſickneſs was not long, his diſtemper having little to feed on; he (whilſt in health) ſpending himſelf ſo much in the ſervice and work of God.</p>
                  <p>His humility, his patience
<pb facs="tcp:44356:11"/>
in ſickneſs, his faith upon God, and ſubmiſſion to Gods will, did moſt eminently diſcover themſelves while ſick.</p>
                  <p>His deportment therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy and heavenly, and his diſcourſe full of ſuch expreſſions, that diſcovered where his heart was.</p>
                  <p>One exhorting him, to cast the burden of his ſickneſs upon God, he made this reply, <hi>I ſhould do very unworthily, if when I have Preached to others, that they ſhould caſt their burden upon God, I ſhould not do ſo my ſelf.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y true Friend, It hath been an uſual ſaying with me, (would God I could ever have the feeling of it in my ſelf,) <hi>That the Character of a godly man, is to make Religion his buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will now a little deſcant upon it, ſo as to ſet down what I ſhould and would do in this kind. I ſhall ſet a copy, at leaſt to teach my ſelf, and provide a remembrancer to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44356:14"/>
quicken my frequent dulneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I deſire to have my Affections all moulded by Religion and towards it</hi>; my thoughts, and words, and deeds, to be all <hi>exerciſes of Religion,</hi> and my very <hi>ceſſation</hi> from <hi>works com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> by <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>circumſtantiated</hi> by <hi>Religion,</hi> my eating, drinking, ſleeping, journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, viſiting, entertaining of friends, to be all <hi>directed</hi> by <hi>Religion</hi>: And that above all, I may be <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>buſie</hi> in the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> about the Word, Prayer, Praiſes, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sacraments; not only that the duties in each kind be performed, but <hi>religiouſly</hi> performed, with life and vigour, with Faith, Humility and Charity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To theſe ends, <hi>I deſire my heart may be poſſeſſed</hi> with theſe two fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Religion is the end of my Creation,</hi> and of all the benefits,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44356:14"/>
not only ſpiritual, but temporal, which God beſtows upon me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That Religion is my felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even for the preſent, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that eternall felicity, which is now laid up for me, and to be hereafter poſſeſſed by me in Heaven:</hi> So glorious is that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; that from the firſt moment of our intereſt in it, it caſts a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, gladſome brightneſs upon the ſoul, even many years ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the enjoyment of the fulneſs of it: like to the Sunne ſhedding forth his fore-running beams to enlighten all our part of the world, many minutes before his full light offers it ſelf to our eye.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When I ſpeak thus of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to be <hi>Felicity,</hi> I mean it of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> without whom, <hi>Religion</hi> is but an empty <hi>Name, a pernicious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44356:15"/>
errour.</hi> But as <hi>Religion is to know God and him whom he hath ſent, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, it is eternal life,</hi> begun now here below: but never to end in any time or place.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>I wiſh theſe thoughts may meet me firſt in the morning, as worldly-minded mens buſineſſes do them:</hi> that I may count all things but interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions till my mind be ſettled in its courſe for that day, and that my mind be ſo ſetled and habituated in theſe purpoſes, that it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in order ordinarily and only need time for <hi>ſolemn performance</hi> of <hi>religious duties,</hi> and for <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary projects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Specially I wiſh as I am bound by millions of eternal obligations, <hi>That I may love the Lord my God, Chriſt Jeſus my Redeemer, with all my heart, with all my ſoul, with all my mind with all my ſtrength,</hi> to the utmoſt extent of all theſe phraſes;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44356:15"/>
and that to make my mind more apprehenſive of them, I may not prophane any of them by uſing to ſay in ſlight matters, (<hi>I love ſuch a thing with all my heart,</hi> or, <hi>I will do ſuch a thing with all my heart</hi>) It may ſeem a nicety to check ſuch a phraſe: But I read this morning, <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Keep my Commandments, and live, and my Law as the apple of thine eye.</hi> (Which ſentence by Gods bleſſing hath occaſioned this whole Meditation whatever it is.) The Apple of the Eye is the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thing in the World of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things,</hi> the Law of God no leſs (infinitely more) in <hi>Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals.</hi> As I therefore like not the word (<hi>infinite</hi>) but when we ſpeak of God: ſo thoſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med phraſes ſeem to be Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar: and that one main cauſe, why common men ſo readily ſay, <hi>They love God with all their heart,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44356:16"/>
(I mean, why they ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves in ſo ſaying) is, becauſe they have adulterated the phraſe [<hi>with all my heart</hi>] and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to every baſe trifle. Say, if it be not ſo. And then as Saint <hi>James</hi> blames for not ſaying. [<hi>If the Lord will,</hi> &amp;c.] though every one will grant ſuch words neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and pretended to ſuppoſe them: ſo is it not blame-worthy to ſay <hi>in petty matters,</hi> what ſhould make a <hi>ſacred ſound</hi> in our ears, and to our ſpirits?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>I wiſh I could looſe my ſelf in a holy trance of meditation, every time I think of God and Chriſt,</hi> as the Author, Fountain, Life, Subſtance of all my happineſs; (All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, (alone ſufficient) only-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for my ſoul, and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and good.

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>I wiſh, I could forget all reſpcts to my ſelf, carnal, natural, while I have any ſervice to perform to God,</hi> as I have every moment [though I cannot ever think ſo] that I might ſhew I love God with ſtrength; <hi>My God with all my ſtrength,</hi> and never be weary: of his immediate ſervices eſpecially: or if naturally, yet not ſpiritually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luſts are vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, when the body languiſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent. <hi>Oh why is not grace more ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>I wiſh my heart may never recoil upon me, with ſaying, Thou mighteſt now or ſuch a time have done thy God, thy Saviour more ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44356:17"/>
than thou didſt; even when thou didst ſomewhat, thy body and ſpirits would have held out longer time, and endured a geater ſtreſs of zeal.</hi> And much leſs, <hi>Thou didſt wholly loſe ſuch an opportunity of doing or receiving good,</hi> (though ſcarce can any one do good, who receives not ſome preſent payment, at leaſt in ſoul, the enlargement of Grace and holy affections) and leaſt of all, <hi>Thou didſt wholly employ thy ſtrength to ſin, or thou haſt weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy ſtrength by intemperance, or any other fooliſh or ſinfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>I wiſh that every day among my firſt thoughts, one may be, What ſpecial buſineſs have I within doors?</hi> within my ſoul, <hi>What ſin to mortifie</hi>? Whether lately raging, and even but laſt day or night prevailing over me? Or which I have had (at leaſt ſome late) vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories

over, that I may allot <hi>time to purſue it,</hi> and by no means <hi>forget it</hi> in my paryer, and <hi>arm my ſelf</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>encounter,</hi> if there be any poſſibility of my being aſſaulted that day. <hi>And what grace to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?</hi> wherein I have been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feeble of late? or even begun to obtain ſome vigour? which it may eaſily be loſt, and will be, if not with all care and means, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fomented and cheriſhed; that ſo I may prepare for it. <hi>Theſe are a Chriſtians main buſineſſes within himſelf alwayes.</hi>

                  <p>Withall, <hi>I wiſh to die dayly.</hi> I mean not, that I dayly wiſh for death; but that I may foreſee it more than poſſible, and may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, reſolvedly, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that I may look at it, as at a means of happineſs, and take ſuch order as it may not cut me off from any main neceſſary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

                  <p n="13">13. <hi>I deſire in all places, companies, and entercourſes, to remember my Calling.</hi> And not only to take heed that my example (or any one that depends upon me) pull not down at any time, what my work is to build, or build what I am to pull down; but alſo to know my ſelf authorized, whereever I come, to profeſs my ſelf a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector, an Architeſt for my heavenly Maſter</hi>: and therefore not only to be ready to undertake the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (ſatisfaction) of any ſoul

that calls for my help, but likewiſe where I ſhall neither take any other mans work out of his hand; nor hinder that which is more properly mine own work; to be forward and offer my ſelf upon the leaſt probability of doing good.</p>

and the leſs burthenſome to thee withall I muſt needs ſay, I meant thee ſomewhat more: but whileſt (in the midſt of many Imployments) I was getting it ready, a strange hand was like to have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me of the greatest part of this, by putting to the Preſs (unknown to me) an imperfect Copy of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.</hi> This made me hasten to tender a true one, and to content my ſelf for the preſent with the Addition of the other leſſer Pieces, which here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them.

                  <p n="11">11. He believes the moſt juſt God to have puniſhed a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon, and to have juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, though a moſt ungodly ſinner.</p>

                  <p n="16">16. He is ſo aſhamed, as he dares not open his mouth before God; yet comes with boldneſs to God, and asks any thing he needs.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. He is ſo humble as to acknowledge himſelf to deſerve nothing but evil; yet ſo confident, as to believe God means him all good.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44356:41"/>
contented, yet ever craving.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. He bears a lofty ſpirit in a mean condition; and when he is aloft, thinks meanly of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. He is rich in poverty, and poor in the midſt of riches.</p>

                  <p n="25">25. He loſes his life and gains by it, and even whiles he loſes it, he ſaves it.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. He lives not to himſelf, yet of all others is moſt wiſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. He denies himſelf often, yet no man that moſt pleaſes himſelf, loves himſelf ſo well.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. He is the moſt reproached, and moſt honoured.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. He hath the moſt afflictions

and the moſt comforts.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. The more injury his enemies do to him, the more advantage he gets by them.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. The more he himſelf forſakes of worldly things, the more he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys of them.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. He is moſt temperate of all men, yet fares moſt deliciouſly.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. He lends and gives moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet is the greater Uſurer.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. He loves all men as himſelf, yet hates ſome men with perfect hatred.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. He deſires to have more grace than any hath in the world, yet he is truly ſorry when he ſees any man have leſs than himſelf.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:44356:42"/>38. He knows no man after the fleſh, yet gives to all men their due reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. He knows, if he pleaſe men, he is not the ſervant of Chriſt, yet for Chriſts ſake he pleaſes all men in all things.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. He is a peace-maker, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fighting, &amp; an irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. He believes him to be worſe than an Infidel that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides not for his family, yet he himſelf lives and dies without care.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. He is ſevere to his children, becauſe he loves them; and being favourable to his enemies, revenges himſelf upon them.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. He accounts all his inferiors his fellows, yet ſtands ſtrictly upon his authority.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. He believes the Angels to be more excellent creatures than
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44356:43"/>
himſelf, and yet counts them his ſervants.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. He believes he receives many good turns by their means, yet he never prays their aſſiſtance, nor craves their prayers, nor offers them thanks, which yet he doth not diſdain to do to the meaneſt Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. He believes himſelf a King, how mean ſoever he be, and how great ſoever he be, that he is not too good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be ſervant to the pooreſt Saint.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. He is often in priſon, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at liberty, and a free-man though a ſervant.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. He receives not honour from men, yet highly prizes a good name.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. He believes God hath bidden evey man that doth him any good to do ſo; yet he of any man is the moſt thankfull to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44356:43"/>
them that do ought for him.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. He would lay down his life to ſave the ſoul of his enemy; yet will not venture upon one ſinne to ſave his life that hath ſaved his.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. He ſwears to his own hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance and changes not; yet knows, that his mouth cannot tie him to ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. He believes Chriſt to have no need of any thing he doth, yet makes account he relieves Chriſt in all his deeds of charity.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. He knows he can do nothing of himſelf, yet labours to work out his own ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. He confeſſes he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet as truly profeſſes he can do all things.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. He knows that fleſh and bloud ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God: yet believes he ſhall go to heaven body and ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. He trembles at Gods Word,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44356:44"/>
yet counts it <hi>ſweeter to him than the honey and the honey comb, and dearer than thouſands of gold and ſilver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="57">57. He believes that God will never damn him; and yet he fears him for being able to caſt him into hell.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. He knows he ſhall not be ſaved by his works, and yet doth all the good works he can, and believes he ſhall not be ſaved without them.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. He knows Gods providence orders all things; yet is he ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his buſineſs, as if he were to cut out his own fortune.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. He believes beforehand God hath purpoſed what ſhall be, and that nothing can make him alter his purpoſe: yet prays and endeavours as if he would force God to ſatisfie him however.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. He prays and labours for what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44356:44"/>
he believes God means to give him, and the more aſſured he is, the more earneſt.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. He prays for that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he ſhall not obtain, and yet gives not over.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. He prays and labours for that, which he knows he may be no leſs happy without.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. He prays with all his heart not to be led into temptation, yet rejoyces when he is fallen into it.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. He believes his prayers to be heard, even when they are denied, and gives thanks for that which he prayed againſt.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. He hath within him the fleſh and the ſpirit; yet is not a double-minded man.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. He is often led away captive by the law of ſin, yet it never gets the dominion over him.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. He cannot ſinne, yet he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44356:45"/>
can do nothing without ſin.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. He can do nothing againſt his will; yet he doth what he would not.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. He wavers and doubts, and yet obtains; he is often toſſed and ſhaken, and yet like Mount <hi>Zion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="71">71. He is a Serpent and a Dove, a Lamb and a Lion, a Reed and a Cedar.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. He is ſometimes ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that he thinks nothing is true in Religion; and yet if he did think ſo, he could not be at all troubled.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. He thinks ſometimes God hath no mercy for him, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to die in the purſuit of it.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. He believes like <hi>Abraham,</hi> in hope and againſt hope, &amp; though he can never anſwer Gods Logick, yet with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he hopes to prevail with the rhetorick of importunity.</p>

                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:44356:70"/>4. Rather, as much as thy body and ſpirit will give leave enlarge it, as a delightful opportunity of Good, by riſing earlier, and ſitting up as long as thou canſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Count the publick Aſſemblies, the ſolemneſt ſervice of the day, and let no pretence (ordinarily) hinder thee, or thine, from being preſent, from the firſt (continuing to the laſt) both moring and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.</p>
