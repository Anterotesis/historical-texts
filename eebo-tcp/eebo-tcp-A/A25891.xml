            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But your true Engliſh and my way, is to vvrite your Plays with double ſence and brisk meaning Songs. Take me, you ſhall have the Ladies laugh at a little bawdy jeſt as if they would bepiſs themſelves, and the young Mounſieurs clap as if they meant to wear their hands out in the ſervice; and if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, this is eaſy and a large ſubject, eſpecially to one that will be at the charge to keep a wench that underſtands her trade, you can't imagine what hints and pretty things ſhe will pick up. Now Sir, if you can but maintain two or three of thoſe Characters, no matter what your plot is, your love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will do here agen, and 'tis but ſaving alive and marrying thoſe that you would kill in Tragedy, and you have done.</p>

                  <p>'Tis this, when I have writ a Play, I pick ſome Lady out of general acquaintance, or favourite at the Court, that would be thought a wit, and ſend it in pretence for to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to her judgment.

            <l>HOw do you like our Reformation now?</l>
            <l>Come, we're amongſt our ſelves. Here are Wits too.<note place="margin">pointing to <hi>Pacheco</hi> and <hi>Tutour.</hi>

            <l>Or ſhall's to th' Coffee-houſe and there debate,</l>
            <l>Each take his Chair and Pipe and judg in State?</l>
            <l>Lord how they wait a Wit that's fam'd in Town!</l>
            <l>He lookes about him with a ſcornful frown,</l>
            <l>Then picks his Favourite out and ſits him down.</l>
            <l>Take me how is't? Have you ſeen our new Play?</l>
            <l>Yes faith; and how? a half Crown thrown away,</l>
            <l>Pox on't he cries, I Droll'd and Slept it out;</l>
            <l>'Twas ſome Raw Fop: Then proudly ſtares about;</l>
            <l>Then ſhrugs and whiſpers, laughs, then ſwears aloud.</l>
            <l>The whilst there's ſilence kept by all the Croud.</l>
            <l>At length he nods and cocks, is heard to ſay,</l>
            <l>D— me 'tis true, and thus he damns the Play,</l>
            <l>Riſes, lookes big and combs, then goes his VVay.</l>
            <l>'Tis ſtrange to think how abſolute they are,</l>
            <l>VVhen lookes, half VVords and Oathes, deſtroy or ſpare.</l>
            <l>VVe can expect no favour; theſe are known</l>
            <l>Foes unto every thing that's not their own.</l>
            <l>And rather too, than that ſhall want applauſe,</l>
            <l>They'l clap themſelves and that way gain the cauſe.</l>
            <l>By ſuch like Arts they rule the ſtage and you,</l>
            <l>And what was Favour firſt, now claim as due.</l>
            <l>For ſhame uſe your Authority and free</l>
            <l>Your ſelves from theſe uſurpers Tyranny,</l>
            <l>Ne're wait their cenſure more, but let them know</l>
            <l>You have the power that they pretended to.</l>
            <l>They wheadle you to clap bad plays they write:</l>
            <l>To be reveng'd do you clap this to night.</l>
            <l>But Ladies you our Author hopes to find</l>
            <l>In your own Cauſe and for your own ſakes kind,</l>
            <l>Since 'tis the firſt deſign of's Poetry</l>
            <l>Both how to gain and give you Liberty.</l>
