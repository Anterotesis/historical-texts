            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Authour cannot: Hauing therefore preached

            <p>2. I call it noble and notable, in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
working thereof, which is strange and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
and it is on this manner: First the minde
thinkes a thought either good, or bad; and then
the conscience by doubling and reflecting the same,
doth thinke againe of that thought, and iudgeth
whether it be good, or bad. Wee haue a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
thereof in the eye, for the eye that seeth
all things that may be seene, seeth not it selfe but by
way of reflection, and the helpe of a looking-glasse;
So it may be said of the minde, it mindes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
all things that may be vnderstood, yet it
vnderstands not it selfe, nor its owne nature, but by
recoiling, reflecting, &amp; recollecting the beames &amp;
rayes of that diuine light in and vpon it selfe; which
made some to say that Conscience is nothing else
but <hi>anima reflexa,</hi> the soule of man recoiling, and

            <p>4. The fourth and last thing in the definition, is
the Subiect or Obiect whereupon Conscience doth
worke, or the matters wherewith it intermedleth.
It medleth not with vniuersalities, as Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
nor with other mens matters, as busie-bodies
doe; but it deales wholly and solely in our owne
proper and particular actions. And of these it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4483:7"/>
written; which made S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vse the same
comparison which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> long before: <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
est codex in quo quotidiana peccata conscribuntur;</hi> A
booke wherein all our daily sinnes are written.</p>
            <p>Now Conscience when it giueth iudgement, it
first reades ouer the Law-booke, and examineth
what is written there, what is bidden or forbidden
by the law of God, &amp; nature: And then it turneth
ouer the records, and seeth what is done or left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and accordingly it giueth iudgement either
with vs or against vs.</p>

cleare, guiltlesse, and without offence; or

               <hi>A good conscience is a continuall

            </p>
            <p>The two <hi>good</hi> belong properly to the godly; and
the two bad to the wicked, whose conscience is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too quiet, or too vnquiet.</p>

                  <hi>Good,</hi> but not <hi>quiet.</hi>
               </note> 1. The first kinde of Conscience is <hi>good,</hi> but not
<hi>quiet.</hi> I call it good, not simply, but in respect of
the tendernesse of it, and fearefulnes to offend; yet
<hi>vnquiet</hi> for want of true light and information.
Such is the conscience of those that are <hi>erronious</hi> in
iudgement, or ignorantly <hi>dubious</hi> and <hi>scrupulous,</hi>


               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4483:8"/>
making many quaeries and questions for conscience
sake, where God and his word makes none. They
may be compared to a wilde and a wall-eyed horse,
which stirres and starts at euery shadow, without
cause or occasion.</p>
            <p>Such are many of my Brethren, both on my right,
and left hand, I meane the Recusants in both kinds,
Catholiques and Catharists, Papists and Puritans,
who are no lesse offended, the one with an egge on
a fasting day; the other with a Cap, Crosse, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plesse,
then with some hainous offence. I commend
their zeale, but not their iudgement; their affection,
not their discretion; they haue indeed a kinde of
tendernesse of Conscience, but they want the right
rule thereof, both which are required in a good
Conscience. Their iudgement is weake and crazie,
vnable to digest any hard matter, or difficult questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
They mistake the grounds of Conscience,

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4483:8"/>
of all euill, S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought to be no sinne, while
the scales of ignorance were vpon his eyes. And
so doe many ignorant men in their blinde Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thinke many a sinne to be no sinne: They
thinke that a few heartlesse prayers, and <hi>Lord haue
mercy vpon vs,</hi> at the last gaspe, will serue their
turne: They dare not looke into the glasse of Gods
holy Word, least the number of their sinnes, and
the foulenesse of their soules, should affright them.
But if God once open their eyes, as he did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

of euils, and Diuels, in them, and against them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Secura.</note> The second degree is the <hi>secure and carelesse,</hi> the
<hi>sleepie,</hi> and <hi>drawsie Conscience,</hi> that can and will not

The flesh, the world, and the Diuell hath so lulled
them a sleepe, that they neuer dreame of Heauen,
nor Hell, death, nor iudgement, they neuer thinke
of their sinnes, nor of the euill day; the noise of
carnall pleasures, and the voyce of worldly profits
doth drowne the voyce of Conscience in them, as
the Drummes in the sacrifice of <hi>Moloch</hi> did the cry
of the infants: Their <hi>Conscience is quiet,</hi> not because
they be at peace, but because they are not at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
O thinke vpon this you that swim in worldly

whole life time to conferre with your poore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which is a very dangerous thing. For if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

as many times it doth in the time of aduersity, as

            <p>

which (by adding sinne to sinne) is so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that it hath no sence nor feeling of sinne. The

<hi>shame of face</hi> and <hi>remorse of Conscience</hi> in many, that
they are giuen ouer to a <hi>reprobate sence,</hi> to worke
vncleanenesse with greedinesse. At the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans Conscience will speake vnto him, as

Then art thou most tempted, when thou doest not feele

<hi>Quid miserius, misero non miserante seipsum? What
more miserable, then a wretch that seeth not his owne
misery?</hi> O hearken vnto this you that harden your
hearts, and seare your Consciences, by quenching
the motions thereof, and sinning the rather when
your Conscience is against it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Good <hi>and</hi> quiet</note> 3. The third kinde of <hi>Conscience</hi> is that which is

and neuer condemneth; and if it hap to

for as the godly haue the first fruit of the spirit, and
certaine tasts of heauenly ioyes, euen in this life by
the goodnes of their Conscience: So the wicked on

Conscientia quae proprijs agitatur stimulis: No plague,
nor punishment more grieuous then a guilty Conscience,
which is tormented with a sting in it selfe, a worme;</hi>


               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:4483:10"/>
And a worme that euer gnaweth, and neuer dyeth.
Such is the Conscience of wilfull and wicked mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
and malefactors, which despaire of Gods
mercy, and oftentimes lay violent hands vpon
themselues. <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> writes, that <hi>Richard</hi> the
third had a most terrible dreame the night before
<hi>Bosworth</hi>-field, in which he was slaine: He thought
that all the Diuels in hell haled and pulled him in
most hideous and vgly shapes; <hi>It credo non fuit som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
sed Conscientia scelerum,</hi> That was no fained
dreame (saith <hi>Polydor</hi>) but a true torture of his
Conscience, presaging a bloudy day to himselfe and
to his followers. And we see by daily experience a
great many that are driuen by the terror of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Conscience to hang, drowne, and murther
themselues; And of these it may be said that, <hi>Iudas</hi>-like,
they are both <hi>Iurie</hi> and <hi>Iudge, accusers</hi> and <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners</hi>
of themselues.</p>
            <p>Thus you see the different kindes and qualities
of Conscience, with the degrees and gradations
thereof; Some too <hi>quiet,</hi> as the <hi>blinde,</hi> the <hi>secure,</hi>
and the <hi>seared;</hi> and some too <hi>vnquiet,</hi> as the <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
dubious,</hi> and <hi>desperate,</hi> or <hi>guilty:</hi> The meane is
the best; not lulled asleepe with a habite of sinning,
nor yet affrighted with the terrours of guilt and
despaire, but well-seasoned with <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>faith,
hope</hi> and <hi>loue,</hi> which is the <hi>best temperature</hi> of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

All which are closely included in the words of my

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obedience.</note> 1. First, to haue a good Conscience, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
an <hi>vniuersall</hi> and <hi>Catholique obedience</hi> in all
duties humane and Diuine, towards God and men,
the workes of Piety and Charity, in the first and
second Table: For the conscionable man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vnto all the Commandements of God, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not to breake any, although hee may faile in
many;<note place="margin">Lumbard.</note> 
               <hi>Bona Conscientia non stat cum proposito peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di;
A good Conscience stands not with a purpose to sin.</hi>
He is no true penitent that mournes for sinne past,
and at the same time meanes to commit the same
sinne againe. He is no good man that makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of one sinne, and not of another; so hee
that breakes one Commandement,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> hates the rest,
and is guilty of all. <hi>Herod, Naaman,</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi>
made conscience of many sinnes, they went a great
way towards Heauen, but for their Pride, Incest,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4483:11"/>
Idolatry, and Sacriledge, they were cast downe to
Hell. Many there are that hate Pride and Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
but they loue Whoredome and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse.
And some there are that make a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the duties of the first Table, specially those
that crosse not their will and affections, that are no
way against their profit and pleasure, and that are
glorious before men; they will not misse a Sermon,
sweare an oath, nor doe the least worke on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth
day, which are very good things in them, for
part of our endeauour, though it be not mere
righteousnesse, yet is it lesse sinne. But as for the
duties of the second Table, which are the best
Touchstone of the Conscience, if we looke to their
doings and dealings with men, you shall finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them full of fraud and falshood, full of malice
and mischiefe, as if their holinesse were a discharge
vnto them from righteousnesse. And others there
are that liue orderly with their neighbours, and
pay euery man his due, but they rob God of his
due; they haue no care of the duties of the first
Table, neither make they any Conscience of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The first are like the <hi>Pharises,</hi> who were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>holy,</hi> but <hi>vniust;</hi> the others like the <hi>Saduces, good
liners,</hi> but very <hi>bad belieuers,</hi> for they belieued that
there was neither <hi>Spirit, Angell,</hi> nor <hi>Resurrection:</hi>
And of both these I may say, that they doe their
duties by halfes, and <hi>Agrippa</hi>-like, they are but
<hi>semi Christiani,</hi> almost, or rather halfe-Christians;
whereas the conscionable man makes conscience
of all the Commandements of God, euen from the
greatest to the least, generally, though not equally;


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4483:11"/>
for most of all hee straines and striues against the
great and grosse sinnes, yet swallowes not the least,
hee abhorres adultery, and hates dalliance; He
is so farre from pride, couetousnesse, and other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
sinnes, that hee abstaines from all occasions
and appearance of euill,<note place="margin">Iud. 23.</note> hating euen the garment
spotted by the flesh. In a word, he is a perfect <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
quoad partes</hi> (as the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> speake) though
not <hi>quoad gradus;</hi> as a Childe is said to haue all the
parts of a perfect man, although he want age &amp; sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so the conscionable man hath all the parts and
properties of a perfect Christian, which may be had
here <hi>in via, in the way,</hi> although he attaine not those
high degrees of perfection, which they haue <hi>in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi>
in their Country.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sincerity.</note> 2. Secondly, in a good Conscience there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Sincerity, integritie, and vprightnesse of
heart and affections, which the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in my Text doth well import, if you change but the
Case, and reade it thus, <hi>before God &amp; men.</hi> All things
are before God, and nothing is hid from him; yet
properly that is said to be <hi>before God,</hi> which is hid
from men, and which is before none but God only,
as the heart and the conscience. God is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the searcher of the heart, and tryer of the reines.
And therefore he saith,<note place="margin">Prou. 23. 26.</note> 
               <hi>My Sonne giue me thy heart.</hi>
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Whatsoeuer ye doe, doe it heartily,
as vnto God, and not vnto men: For God is a spirit,
and he will be serued in spirit and truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 14.</note> We cannot
<hi>complement</hi> before God <hi>with faces and phrases,</hi> as we
doe with men. A little done in sincerity and truth
from the heart, is more worth then all the workes


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4483:12"/>
of hypocrites; yea, without this integrity of the
heart all our labour is but lost. And therefore the
Hypocrite,<note place="margin">Math. 6. 2.</note> that sounds a Trumpet when hee giues
almes, that prayes in the corners of the street, and
doth all his workes to be seene of men, can neuer
please God, nor haue a good Conscience, for <hi>a good
Conscience</hi> cannot stand with hypocrites.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Constancie.</note> 3. Thirdly, to haue, and to hold, a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
there is required Constancie, Continuance,
and Perseuerance in well-doing: Not <hi>Demas</hi>-like
for a spurt,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10. Gal. 5. 7.</note> nor as the <hi>Galathians</hi> for a time, <hi>Ye ranne
well, who hindred you?</hi> But alwayes, and in the
whole course of our life.</p>
            <p>In the life of man there are many windings and
turnings; but the conscionable man, turne him
loose, hee is not <hi>bonus cum bonis, malus cum malis,</hi>
godly in one company, prophane in another; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to day, deboyst to morrow; but like a square
Cube, he is <hi>semper idem,</hi> euer the same, which way
soeuer you turne him. There is not any, but at times
haue fits and flashes of a good conscience: They
are affected for the time present with some good
Sermon, or vpon some great deliuerance they grow
a little holy; but that little is little worth, for they
are soone out of breath, and quickly weary. And
therefore my Text saith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> alwaies, and at
all times. It is true, that the best doe sometimes
faile, the most faithfull haue their faults and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Who can say, <hi>My heart is cleane?</hi> In many
things wee sinne all of vs; But the godly, though
they fall, <hi>yet shall they rise againe,</hi> and be renued by
repentance; they fall not finally, neither doe they


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4483:12"/>
finne <hi>pleno consensu,</hi> with full consent, and bent of
the will: Their will and desire is, yea, they are sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
purposed with <hi>Dauid,</hi> to keepe all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God; And though they faile in
many particulars, yet God accepteth their will for
the deed, their good endeauour, as if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience: And therefore to haue a good
Conscience, wee must bee constant in well-doing
at all times, <hi>effectu,</hi> or <hi>affectu,</hi> in <hi>deed</hi> or <hi>desire,</hi>
in <hi>action</hi> or <hi>affection.</hi> And that this may bee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,

and <hi>exercise,</hi> then is the <hi>Circle round,</hi> or <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
compleat. <hi>Conscience, like a vessell,</hi> may easily
be kept pure and cleane, if rinsed euery day; but if
it goe longer, it gathers soile and corruption, and
requires more then ordinarie repentance to purge
and cleanse it. Wee sinne daily, and therefore wee


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4483:13"/>
must daily wash our consciences with the teares of
inward sorrow and contrition, which bringeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
not to be repented of. This was S. <hi>Pauls
exercise,</hi> to keepe his Conscience vnspotted, and
without offence; and this must bee the daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of euery good Christian: Now the onely <hi>Bath</hi>
or Lauacre to <hi>wash</hi> our <hi>Consciences</hi> in, is <hi>the bloud of
Iesus Christ,</hi> which cleanseth vs from all our sinnes,
I say the bloud of Christ applyed by faith. In which
respect Faith is said to purifie the Conscience from
dead workes: And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ioyneth them together,
<hi>Keepe faith and a good Conscience;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> as if the one could

            <p>Out of the flesh of man, when the body is dead,
are bred those wormes which consume the flesh.
Euen so from the corruption of the Conscience
there breeds a worme a thousand times more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
euen the worme of Conscience, which euer
gnaweth, and neuer dyeth.</p>
            <p>To preuent this, we must purge the Conscience
