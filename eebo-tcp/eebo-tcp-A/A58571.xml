            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as the <hi>Act</hi> of his Majeſties privie Councill, dated the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day of <hi>December</hi> laſt, did ſettle the prices of Ale and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beer: ſo as there might be a due proportion betwixt the ſame
and the pryces of rough-Bear, and appointed the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> to be
put in execution, be the Commiſsioners of Excyſe in the ſeverall
Shires and Burghs: And the Brewers and Maltmen within the ſame, to finde
caution for their due obſervance thereof: Likeas the Brewers within the Shires of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and
<hi>Haddington,</hi> having made application and offer to the ſaid Privie Councill, and given Bond to pay
no leſs then ſeven pounds ſcots the boll, for all the Bear they shall buy of the Cropt 1676. The
Lords of his Majeſties ſaid Privie Councill, have given licence and allowance to the ſaids Brewers,
to ſell the Ale and drinking-Beer at twenty pennies the pynt beſids the Excyſe; as alſo, to ſell double
or three shilling Ale, and have authoriſed the ſaids Commiſsioners of Excyſe of the ſeverall Shires
and Burghs, to allow the ſame Latitude to all ſuch as will make the like offer: And the Earle
<hi>Mariſchall,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Aboyne,</hi> and <hi>Sir Iohn Keith,</hi> three of the Lords of the ſaid Privie Councill,
being appointed to ſee the ſaids <hi>Acts</hi> receive due execution within the Shire of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and to
procure the due obſervance thereof from the ſaids Commiſsioners, Malt men and Brewers; the
ſaid Privie Councill, be two ſeverall Letters direct to them, have authoriſed them and the ſaids Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of Excyſe, to take that ſame courſe as to the Brewers and Malt-men, within the Shire
of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and Burghs Royall of the ſame. And in caſe the ſaids Brewers and Malt-men, do
not make offer of the price, and give Bond to that effect as aforeſaid, have ordained the certification
contained in the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> of Councill, and Proclamation following thereon to be put in execution.
In purſuance whereof, and obedience to an Print <hi>Advertiſement</hi> published through the whole Shire,
the ſaids three Lords of Privie Councill, and ſeverall Commiſſioners of Excyſe, Barrons, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors
of the Shire, having conveened here this day, and having read and peruſed the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> of
Councill, and other <hi>Acts</hi> made in reference thereto, with the ſaids Letters and Commiſſions from
the Privie Councill, and ſtrict Order therein contained, for putting the ſame to full execution;
conſidering that they are ſtrictly commanded and obliedged to put the ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> to all due execution,
alſe well for any tranſgreſſion thereof bypaſt, as what may be in tyme comeing: Have reſolved,
(as in dutie they are tyed) to uſe their utmoſt endeavoures thereanent; And for that effect, have
Ordained their next Meeting to be at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> the eighteenth day of <hi>April</hi> inſtant Requyring the
whole Commiſsioners of Excyſe of the ſaid Shyre, to be preſent at that Meeting, for giving their
concurrance therein: And Ordaines the whole Heritors of the Shyre, betwixt and that tyme, to
take notice of the Brewers within their reſpective Lands and Heritages, who have tranſgreſſed the
ſaids <hi>Acts</hi> of Councill, and to report faithfully thereanent to the ſaid next Meeting at <hi>Aberdeen:</hi>
And withall recommends to the ſaids ſeverall Heritors, within whoſe Lands any Brewers are, to be
ready againſt that tyme, to become bound as Cautioners for their ſaids Brewers, that they shall
obſerve the ſaids <hi>Acts</hi> for the future: And in caſe, the Heritors and Maſters of the ſaids Brewers,
be unwilling to binde for them, Ordaines the Brewers themſelves to be preſent at the ſaid Meeting,
with other ſufficient caution, declaring that all thoſe who shall be abſent, shall be repute and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
breakers, and contumacious contemners of the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> of Councill; and that thir preſens shall
extend alſewell to Malt-men as Brewers, and theſe within Burghs Royall, as without the ſame.
And in reſpect, the Lords of his Majeſties Privie Councill, have been ſo carefull for the good of
his Majeſties Subjects, It is expected, that both Commiſsioners and Heritors will to their uttermoſt
power endeavour the proſecution of the ſaids <hi>Acts,</hi> under the certifications contained in the ſamen
<hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and power granted by the ſaid Privie Councill: Lykeas, The Lords and
Commiſsioners foreſaids, continues any thing relating to the Excyſe, to that ſaid Meeting at
<hi>Aberdeen,</hi> the ſaid eighteenth day of <hi>April</hi> inſtant, at which tyme they intend to ſettle the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſe
for one Year after the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> next. And that none may pretend ignorance, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
is appoynted to cauſe Print and publish thir preſents, at the ſeverall Parish Kirkes of the
Shyre, the enſuing LORDS-DAYES.</p>
