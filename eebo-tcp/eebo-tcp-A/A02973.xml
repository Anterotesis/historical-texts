            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>Vttered out of his owne mouth to the Lords and Gentlemen</hi> of his armie, before the Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> the 8. day of this preſent moneth of Auguſt. 1590.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords, I do not doubt, but the moſt part of you do well remember the precepts and ſolemne othes which my L. the late king deceaſed (my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor) cauſed me to make in the preſence of you all, for the tranquilitie and peace of this Realme, that day wherein he was hurt, ſeeing himſelfe néere his end. If you be remembred, among many other matters, he chiefely charged me with this one principall point, that I ſhould maintaine all my ſubiects in frée li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to vſe their conſcience in both religions: that is to ſay, the reformed religion, and the Romiſh religion, vntil that by a generall, or nationall Councel a better reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be made thereupon. Inſomuch as his Maieſtie ſaw there was no other meanes to pacifie the troubles &amp; diſſentions of this Realme, but that if God had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him the grace to haue raigned longer, he would haue vſed this readie and ſingular remedie aforeſaid. Thus I tell you my Lords, and alſo I pray you to beleeue that I haue nothing in ſo great care as to kéepe all my othes and vowes, which I haue already done and ſhall doe hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17141:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->
and ſpecially this ſame, for that it is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Nowe I am informed that ſome of the Nobilitie of this armie do ſpread abroade that they cannot doe mee ſeruice, vnleſſe I make profeſſion of the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and thereupon they will forſake mine armie. Meaning thereby to trie whether I ſhoulde be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to giue ouer and recant that which is deareſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in this worlde, that is to ſay, my religion and mine othe.</p>
            <p>Therefore (my Lords) at this preſent I haue cauſed you to be aſſembled, to the end I might declare in your preſence that I am reſolued (and I pray vnto God, rather to take me out of this world, then it ſhould be otherwiſe) not to varie nor chaunge in any wiſe my religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any thing contrarie vnto mine othe, before I be inſtructed by a holy Councell, the which I will heartily yéeld vnto, and vow to follow the ſame: wiſhing nothing more then that ſuch men ſhould depart from mine armie, chooſing rather to haue one hundred of faithful Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on my ſide, then two hundred of ſuch fained friends: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſure that God is alwayes with them that be godlie.</p>
            <p>Two cauſes there be (as I beleuee) that moue theſe men to ſow this Darnell: the one is the oth which they haue made long ſince vnto the enimies of this realme: the other is the ſmal vertue and aſſurance which do appeare in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of valor and honor. Therefore let not ſuch men be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to demand our licence to depart: for I ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly declare vnto them that they are not ſo readie to requeſt it, as I am willing to grant it vnto them. Notwithſtanding I am very ſory, that they be no better Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only for their owne profit, and for no other cauſe. For although gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally at ſhould forſake me (which thing I cannot beleeue)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17141:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->
I haue friends inough at may commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me to their ſhame in mine authoritie. And if all thoſe meanes ſhould faile me, yet God is my ſure ſtrength and ſhield: who hath accompanied me with his holy &amp; my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous bleſſings from my birth to this preſent: whereof all ye are witneſſe. For <hi>Dauid</hi> neuer came better into his kingdome of Iſrael without all hope and force of men, nor with more labour and perill, then I am come into this ſame my kingdome, in ſuch a ſort that I confeſſe in very deed that God hath myraculouſly brought me into it, and eſtabliſhed me therein. Moreouer if all mans help ſhould faile me, for to maintaine me therein, yet I knowe, that the almightie God will neuer fayle me: aſſuring my ſelfe that he hath not begun ſuch a myraculous worke for to leaue it vnperfect, and not onely for my ſake, but alſo for his holy name, and for ſo manie perſons that are afflicted in diuers ſortes in this mine owne kingdome, who crie for mercie: whome alſo I deſire to ſuccour: and I doe promiſe as a king to performe it as ſoone as God will giue me leaue.</p>
            <p>Let then this companie of euill ſpeakers ceaſe, and let them truely beleeue that neyther this Crowne, nor the Empire of all the whole earth were able to make me chaunge the Religion wherein I have bene brought vppe and inſtructed from my mothers pappes, and the which I vphold to be true: and alſo that I acknowledge nothing but the onely word of God to be my guide and to reforme me to a holy councell as I haue ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>All ye, my Lords, doe know, that I am a true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Frenchman: and I am ſuch a one as men need not to doubt of me. For my actions in time paſt may teſtifie how I haue vſed my ſelfe in the behauiour of that which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17141:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 8 -->
I haue done within theſe ſixtéene or ſeuentéene yéeres that I haue raigned in my kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> being a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie vnder mine obedience. It is eaſie to be iudged what I am, though I haue great occaſion to féele my ſelfe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the wrong done vnto me of the enemies of this crowne.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, my Lords, I leaue you to thinke how hard it is for me, being your king, and leauing yon in libertie for the exerciſe of your religion, to forbeare, that there ſhould be ſome among you, yea of the baſer ſort, who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour themſelues to rule me according to their vaine opinion. For this cauſe I pray all good men of this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie and others of this realme to be iudges thereupon. And foraſmuch as none can be perfect, I pray you al my Lords, if I haue forgotten anie thing concerning my dutie, to pray with me vnto the Lord God continually to conduct and aſſiſt me hereafter with his holy ſpirite, for the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the kingdome of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and for the entertainment of mine eſtate, and alſo for the comfort of mine owne ſubiects.</p>
