            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theris no man, whiche deſireth not
<pb facs="tcp:19498:19"/>
rather to ſuffer (if it might bee) all theſe euils &amp; mo ſorowes &amp; miſeryes, to auoid death. The ſaintes feared death. Jeſus Chriſte him ſelfe, had it in ſuche horror that his ſoule was heauy, yea ſo heauy that droppes of bloud, dropped from his moſte holy body, inſomuche that our good and merciful God ſheweth that there is no euill in the whiche is more neede to comfort the feble and weak then in this euil, as is to be ſeen heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As now all theſe thingꝭ, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon too all men, as be alſo the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of helth, commen in the ſame euilles to them. Moreouer the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians haue a new and needful cauſe to haue in horrour and too feare the euel to come, the whiche neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe dooth ſurmount all the euelles afore ſaid, whiche is that ſaint Paul deſeribeth in the. 10. Chapiter of the. 1. to the Corinthians, ſaying. He that ſtandeth: let him take heed that hee fall not. The way is helding and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19498:19"/>
the path ſlippery, our enemy is ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iſſaunt, yea armed with our owne proper force and ſtrength, that is to ſay, with our own fleſhe and with all oure wicked affections, garniſhed with a numbre of worldly armures, hauing the voluptnous delites and pleſures on the righthand: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked willes and deſires on the left hand, beſide wicked carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence with the whiche he is gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed, and he hauing ſuche boldnes to noy, to deceiue, and deſtroy vs in a thouſand ſacions and waies. We liue ſo that we be not aſſured of our good purpoſes nor ententes, not the minute of an houre. Saint Ciprian reciteth many like thinges in his booke of mortality, and ſhe with that we muſt think vpon death, as that that commeth ſudenly to diſpatche theſe euelles. Now this commeth cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtomably to thoſe that conſider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in their mindes, theſe infinit daungers of hell, hauing their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

firm &amp; conſtant. We ſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times, they deſire to be loſed out of this priſon of the body, deſpiſing life and death, that is to ſay, all theſe aforeſaid euilles, to the ende to bee deliuered from this burden of ſinne, in the whiche they be in, as wee haue ſaid in the firſt ſpeculation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whiche they may fall into, where of wee wil heerafter ſpeake. And ſo theſe two reaſons be moſte true, not onely to deſire the death: but alſo to diſpiſe all the euils, and more ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beare eaſely one only euel. If the Lord doth ſo graciouſly moue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man: as it is verely a gift of God to be moued with theſe thinges, for he that is a right Chriſtian, dooth not onely deſire to be ſick: but alſo to dy, ſeeing him ſelf, and feeling to be in ſinne, when he is in helth, and alſo ſeeing him ſelf at euery houre ready too fall into greater and a greater number of euilles and ſinnes, and to do without ceaſſing thingꝭ contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry

&amp; mercy of God our father, mighty to comfort vs in all our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guithes and ſorowes. For there is not one of vs all, that ſhall feele the hand of God more preſently vpon him: then when he calleth to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the yeeres of his life paſt. Saint Auguſtine ſaith, if the choice were geuen to a man, to dy or to returne againe, to his firſt life, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe the death, ſeeing ſo many euilles and ſo great daungers, that he hath paſſed, and with how great difficulty, and pain. The whiche ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is true if it be well conſidered. For as we may ſe heere, how often times that man without his own en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deuour, without any care, yea with out and againſt his own deſire, hath doone and ſuffred many thinges of whiche if he had taken councell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were done, or that he did take councel, that after the wurk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, he was conſtrained and abaſſhed in him ſelfe, and to ſay. Too

what purpoſe are theſe thinges hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me? or how are they come to paſſe, contrary to my entent and thought? or that I haue purpoſed far other wiſe. So that this prouerbe is true. Man purpoſeth and God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. That is to ſay, he dooth it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and clean contrary to that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath purpoſed. So that if we had but onely this to beholde: we can not deny but our operations, oure life and our actes to be gouerned by the counſaile and bountifull puiſſaunce of God, &amp; not by our owne prudence. Heer wee may ſee how often times God hath bene w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, when we ſaw him not, nor felt him, and how veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it is that Sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Peter hath ſaid.

Wherefore if wee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes nor preaching, yet our owne liues caried and led thorow ſo many euelles and daungers: would ſhew vs ſufficiently the deuine boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifulnes of God is very neer vs, as

though he had borne and kept vs, in his boſome without our deliberation and without any feeling of vs in any thingꝭ, as ſaith Moiſes in Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 32 Chap. The Lord hath mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teined and defended him, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an eye.

I haue remembred the daies paſt. I haue meditatid all thy woorkes, and I haue thought vpon the woorkes of thy handes.

               <p>Now theſe thingꝭ and all other like tend to this end, that we may know this, that God hathe bene euen then preſent with vs, when we thought not of him, and ſpecially when it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he was abſent from vs, for hee

that hathe receiued vs into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection without vs, yea in ſo many ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſities, yea in ſmall thingꝭ, and yet while it ſeemed that he had forſaken and left vs, neuertheles he hath not throwen vs of, as it is ſaid in Eſay. I haue forſaken thee for a litle time, but I will gather thee againe in my great mercy. And let vs ioyn this to it. Who is it that hath had care for vs, in ſo many nightes while wee haue ſlept? Who hath cared for vs ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſo many times, as we haue felt our ſelues greeued, when wee wandred about in our owne folies, and haue doone numbers of thinges, in the whiche wee haue not had reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to our ſelues? or ſince what time haue we had care, or taking charge of our ſelues? When the auaritius man is in care and ſtudy, to gather great heapes of mony, hee dooth dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and earneſtly ſtudy and care to ſeek and heap vp together.

When we heare that Jeſus Chriſte the ſonne of God, hath clenſed and ſanctified by his moſte ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſuffringes, all perſecutions and paſſions, yea the very death, he hath bleſſed the curſe, hee hath glorified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame and ignomini, and inriched the pouerty, ſo that death is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to be the gate of life, the curſe is conſtrained to bee cauſe of bleſſing, and the ignomini mother of glory. Now how can wee be ſo ingrate and vnthankful, that we doo not earneſtly deſire, yea and loue all theſe paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and afflictions, dipped and ſanctified by the moſte pure fleſh and moſte ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blood of the Son of God, the whiche

be made to vs moſte helthful bleſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For if by the touching of his moſte pure fleſh, hee hath ſanctifyed all the waters to be holy and needful to baptiſme: yea all creatures, how muche more hath he ſanctified by bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſm of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, or of blood, all death, all paſſions, all iniuries, all outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, all maledictions, all ignomini, &amp; that by the bleſſed touching of his fleſh, and blood whiche is moſte preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? as hee ſaith in the. 12. of Saint Luke, of this baptiſme namely the paſſion.

paſtor, and as a moſte faithful phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, he haſted him ſelf, and prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not the death, that hee might make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afflictions &amp; paſſions, yea the very death good to vs, by his holy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring, ſo that wee may eſtéeme the death to a Chriſtian as the braſen ſerpent of Moiſes, whiche had the fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a ſerpent ouer all, and in all pointes and yet was nothing leſſe then liuing, he was without venim, without mouing, without byting, ſo likewiſe it ſeemeth to the eyes of the fooliſhe that the faithful dy, but truly they be in peace, we be like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dy and the apparence of our death is none other but as others bee. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theleſſe the trueth is otherwiſe, for to vs death is dead, alſo all our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and paſſions bee like to their afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but it is only by appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For verely our paſſions be the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninges of impaſſibilitie, as the death is the beginning of life. And this is it that the Lorde Jeſus ſaith, in the. 8
<pb facs="tcp:19498:38"/>
of Saint John. If any keepe my woord he ſhall neuer taſte of death. How ſhall he not ſee death? Becauſe that in dying hee beginneth to liue, and ſo the life that he be holdeth: cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he doothe not ſee death. The night is heer made bright as the day for aſmuche as the brightneſſe of the life beginning, is clearer then the death departing. Theſe thinges bee moſte certaine to all thoſe whiche be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>léeue in Jeſus Chriſte, but not to the vnfaithful. Now if they doo kiſſe, if they loue and embraſe the apparrel, the veſſelles, the cuppes, and finally thoſe thinges whiche Jeſus Chriſte hath touched, or that he vſed, ſo they honour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as great reliques, with great deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they ſay that he hath ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the touching therof. But wherfore doo we not the embrace, kiſſe, and loue rather the the paines, the ſhames, rebukes, the opprobries, the euilles of the world, and the very death, the whiche were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19498:38"/>
not onely ſanctified, by his holy tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: but alſo be bleſſed &amp; dipped in his moſte precioꝰ blood, &amp; embraſing them with a moſte ardent zeale and great charity, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the very death.</p>
               <p>Beholde in theſe thingꝭ wee haue much more reward, helth &amp; goodnes, then in reliques. For truly by theſe thingꝭ, wee doo optain victory ouer death, hel, and all our ſinnꝭ, &amp; not by reliques. O good God, if we might look into the hart of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sonne of God, and ſe perfectly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſtrained on the croſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der death dead &amp; ouercome, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ardent zeale &amp; affection he embraſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death and the paines therof, for thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bee fearful &amp; for thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abhorre death &amp; the paines therof, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; wil hee hath firſt drunk of this moſte bitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What ought we to doo, wee that haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo long reſt, and ſo many good houres, and will not ſuffer a little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel one poore houre?

all, yet it is to many, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to thoſe that bee not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to ſuffer euelles and miſery. For as I haue ſaid before, he geueth greater ſtrength to thoſe whome he geueth leſſe goodes, that all thinges may be equall, &amp; he may be knowen a righteous iudge in all thingꝭ. For great abundance of goodes and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bringeth not ſo great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as dooth a good conſcience and a ioyful hart. And alſo hee geeueth to ſome plenty of children, whiche is a ſouereign pleaſure (as they ſay).

knowledge, prudence, or wiſedome. Now our good God, dooth moderate the equality of his adminiſtration in theſe goodes, aſwel as in the other, ſo that hee dooth not preferre the one before the other. For in ſteed of theſe goodes whiche lacketh to ſome: he ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth more courage, or more reſt, or greater tranquility. Now in all theſe thinges we muſt conſider the great liberalitie of God, with thankeſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and comfort our infirmitie, ſo that we doo not diſmay in our ſelues, although in this multitude of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent goodes, there is ſome ſharpneſſe mingled with it. For among vs men that be volupteous, there is no meat ſodden, roſted or otherwiſe, what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, whiche is found good nor ſauery without ſauce, that hath ſome egar taſte of nature, or that may ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it. For this is moſte true, that when one vſeth to eat nothing, but ſweet thinges, and dooth continew with the ſame: it is a thing intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:19498:42"/>
ſo that it is wel ſaid of ſome, that ſay all pleaſure and volupteouſneſſe engendreth werines, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Alſo volupruoſitie is finally conuerted into wearines and paine, that is to weet. This life is not ſo ſtrong, that it may beare the onely vſe of goodes and pleaſures, without ſome temperature of euelles mixed therewith. From thence commeth this prouerbe, that the bones ought to be ſtrong, whiche ſhould beare all their daies in welth and proſperitie. And for my part, I haue wel conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red this prouerbe and oftentimes, and I maruail of the ſentence, which containeth ſo effectuall trueth. For ther is in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certain deſtres whiche doo repugne the one againſt the other the whiche ſeeke but good daies, and neuertheleſſe, when they haue that they moſte deſire: they can leſſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, then if they had euel daies.

in the death to come. Firſt the death is an end of all the tragedy of euelles, of this preſent life, as it is written. The death of the faithfull is pretious before the face of God, &amp; againe. I ſhall ſleepe in peace and reſt me. If the righteous be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by death: hee findeth quickening and comfort. And contrary the death to the wicked, and Infidels: is the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning of euelles, as it is ſaid. The death of the wicked is moſte vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, alſo the euel dooth ouertake and katche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked in his death. In this maner was Lazarꝰ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which hath receiued heere his euel, and the riche glotton, vnhappy was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe hee receiued his goodes heere in this life. By this meanes alſo it commeth that the Chriſtian findeth him ſelf alwayes better and encreaſing in goodneſſe, whether he liue or whether he dye, ſo bleſſed a thing it is to be a Chriſtian, and to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue in Jeſus Chriſte, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:19498:47"/>
Saint Paule ſaith. Chriſt is to me aduauntage, whether I liue or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I dy. And to the Romaines. 15. Hee that liueth: liueth to the Lorde, and he that dieth, dieth to the Lorde, be it whether we liue, or whether we dy: we be the Lordes. Jeſus Chriſte hath begotten vs this aſſurance. For he is dead and riſen againe, to thend that he might be Lorde of the quicke and the dead, hauing powre to make vs ſure and to certify vs aſwel in the death as in the life, as is ſaid in the. 23. Pſalme. Though I ſhould walke in the middeſt of the ſhadow of death yet wil I feare no euel, for thou art with mee. But if we be not certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of this aduauntage of death: it is a ſign that the faith of Jeſꝰ Chriſt is in firm and weak in vs, the whiche doo not wurthely eſteeme the gaine and price of his moſte precioꝰ death. They cannot beleue yet the death to be good: becauſe that is letted by the olde man, and the wiſedome of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19498:47"/>
fleſhe, whiche hath yet to muche vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſtrength, and therfore wee ought to aſſay and auaunce to know and to loue this benefite of death. It is a hard ſaying and difficul, to ſay that the death which is to others the greatiſt of all euelles, ſhalbee to vs the moſte excellent gaine and profit. And if Ieſꝰ Chriſte had not wrought this good in vs: what profit were it for vs to habandon and forſake our ſelues? But this wurke that he hath wrought in vs, is a ſinguler deuine wurk. For this cauſe no man ought to diſmay, for he hath made the euel of death to bee turned to moſte good and profit. Wherefore death is now to the faithful dead, and is not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but only the outward apparence, euen as a ſlaine ſerpent hath yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining the terrible figure or appa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence of a ſerpent that hee had: and yet is it but the figure or image. So there is but one euel dead, and it may no more noy or hurt vs. And
<pb facs="tcp:19498:48"/>
alſo as Moyſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to make a ſerpent of braſſe, and to beholde and looke vpon it, did put away the ſtinging of the quicke ſerpentꝭ, as it is ſaid, in the. 21. of Numery: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if our death be looked vpon with a godly eye, and ſtedfaſt in the faith of Chriſte: it periſheth and nothing appereth but onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure of death. So louingly dooth the bountifulnes and mercy of God entreat vs, which yet be weaklinges and infirme tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row theſe and ſuche like figures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of neceſſitie, death muſt take vs away. Neuertheleſſe he hath ſo ouercome and brought to nought the ſtrength and powre of death, that to vs remaineth no more but the onely figure, and for this cauſe the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res doo rather call it a ſleepe then a death. The ſecond benefite of death is, that not only it maketh an end of paines and euelles of this preſent life: but alſo bringeth a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing, that is an end of vice and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19498:48"/>
ſin, the whiche cheefly maketh death moſte deſirable to the faithfull ſoulꝭ, yea more then dooth any worldly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, as wee haue treated heere be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore. For truly the euellꝭ of the ſoule whiche is vice and ſinne, be without compariſon, worſe then the euelles of the body, for if we were wiſe: theſe onely euelles in deede ſhould make to vs death more deſirable, and more louingly to embrace it, whiche if it doo not: it is a ſigne that we feel not that we ought to feel, nor yet doo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently hate the euelles of our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, conſidering that this life, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many daungers, and the falli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and ſliding of ſinne dooth compaſſe vs about, with ſnares on euery ſyde. And finally wee cannot liue without ſynne. Beeholde then that death is a moſte ſinguler good remedy, for it de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liuereth vs from theſe daungers, it cutteth vs away and deliuereth vs wholy from ſinne, and therefore the authour of the booke of Sapience
<pb facs="tcp:19498:49"/>
concludeth in the praiſe of the righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſe in the. 4. Chapiter, ſaying. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made at one and beloued of God liuing amongeſt ſinners, was taken away and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported to the end that ſinne and euell ſhould not chaunge his vnderſtanding or that deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould not begile his ſoule, for the bewitching of lies and dremes maketh good thinges darke, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſtnes of volupteous deſire: tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away the vnderſtanding of the ſiple. O how true be theſe thingꝭ? &amp; how doo we ſe this to come pas daily? And in an other text. Though he was ſoone dead: yet fulfilled hee muche time, for his ſoule pleaſed God, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he haſted to take him away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the wicked. So it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe by the mercy of God, that the death whiche was the paine of ſinne to man: is now made the ende of ſin, and the beginning of life and righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to the Chriſtian. Therfore of neceſſitie hee that loueth life and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19498:49"/>
ryghteouſneſſe: loueth alſo death, whiche is the miniſter and the ſhop of life, and is in no cace afraid of it. For otherwiſe he ſhall neuer attaine to life nor righteouſnes, and he that cannot ſo doo: let him be diligent to pray to God that he may haue ſuche aminde. For the cauſe why God tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth vs to ſay, thy will be doone, is that we can not deſire this of our ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues, but we rather doo abhorre death, ſo that wee doo rather loue ſinne and death: then life and righteouſneſſe. Therfore did God ordeine death, for the deſtruction of ſinne. For we may gather by this, that incontinent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin hee ſet &amp; ordeined death to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam as a deliuerance from ſin, and that before hee caſt him out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, to the ende that hee would ſhew vs that death neither dooth nor wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any euell in vs but is the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of all good, for it was ſet forth in Paradice in maner of a ſatiſfaction. But trueth it is, by the enuy of the
<pb facs="tcp:19498:50"/>
deuel, death is entred into the world, but thorow the mercy and goodneſſe of God, hee dooth cauſe that death is not hurtful to vs, but hath ordeined it from the beginning, to bee the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement and death of ſinne, for he ſignified the ſame when he ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of death to Adam in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement. Neuertheles he ſtayed not in his wurds: but pronounced death and qualifyed the rigour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. But GOD did not in plaine wurdꝭ declare death: but on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſaid, thou art duſt, and into duſt thou ſhalt return. Item thou ſhalt return into earth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which thou art come. As euen then hating death would not name it, as it is ſaid.</p>
               <p>Wrath is in his indignation, and life in his wil. Now it may be ſaid that if death had not bene neceſſary, to put away ſin: God would not haue pronounced it But God taketh no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wepons againſt ſinne whiche hath engendred death, but death it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19498:50"/>
ſelf. Heere is fulfilled that one ſaid properly, that the inuentor of death is dead by his owne inuencion, alſo the ſinne is deſtroyed by his owne frute, and ſlaine by the death that he hath enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred. As a viper is ſlain by her owne yung ſerpentꝭ. Beeholde a thing moſte pleaſaunt to heere and vnderſtand, that ſinne is deſtroyed by no other meanes, but by her own proper wurk, and her throte cut by her owne knife, and her hed cut of by her owne ſwoord as was Goliath. Goliath was the figure of ſin. This Giaunt was fearfull to all men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to little Dauid, that is to ſay the Sonne of GOD Jeſus Chriſte: the whiche hath ouerthrowen this terri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble Giant, and hath cut of his hed with his owne ſwoord.

It is good for me to ioyne my ſelf to the Lorde, and to ſet

my hope and truſt in my God, as if he had ſaid. Although I ſuffer, ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing them deliuered and free without trouble, yet I haue this confidence, that God wil let me feele his clemen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy and goodneſſe muche more then ſhall they.

It is it that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Jeſus commaundeth vs in the ſixt Chapiter of Saint Mathew, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the birdes of the ayre and the Lillyes of the feeld, ſaying.

So neceſſary it is that all thingꝭ happen to the beſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful.

As is ſaide in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 6. of Geneſis. The Sonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men that they

For thoſe whiche he can not ſwallow by entice<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes and incorporate to him ſelf by offences: hee aſſayeth to repulſe and put fro him by adueru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyes, and driueth them of by paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, procuring alwaies againſt them ſnares by examples of ſin, &amp; foining out his furies by horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes and paines. This is the mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter that the Poets doo call Chimery, whiche hath the hedde of a damoſell and gratious countenaunce, the wombe of a Lion, and the taile of a venemus ſerpent. For the ende to whiche the world pretendeth, what with his volupteouſnes, and what w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his tiranny: is poiſoned death and dampnation eternally.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation dooth ſtrengthen my Infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>delitie.

and therefore vnder the glory of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſhame ſhalbe couered and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, by their habundance: my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie ſhalbe fulfilled. Who is he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can diſpaire in his ſinnes? Who is he that wil not now reioyce in his afflictions and ſuffringes?

Suche an excellent thing is it to be of the Communion of the faithful, and of the Churche of Jeſus Chriſte. But if there be any that beleueth not theſe thinges to be thus: he is an Infidel, and dooth diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jeſus Chriſte and his Churche, becauſe he feeleth not theſe thinges whiche be infallible true.

               <p>But now in what thinges doo the ſaintes communicate? They commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicate in good and euel. For all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be to all men, as the ſacrament of the ſupper of the Lorde repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame to vs, in bread &amp; wine, where wee bee called by Saint Paul one onely body, one bread, and one drink. For who is he that can offend or hurt the leaſt part of our body: but by and by he greeueth the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the ſame? Who may ſuffer the leaſt prick in our toe, but all the body wilbe greued with the ſame? What

Euen ſo are wee all one body, for all that one ſuffreth: I ſuffer alſo, and what ſoeuer good is doone to one, is doon to my ſelf. For who can take any part or porcion of the bread or ſupper of the Lorde how little ſo euer it bee, to whome it may not be ſaid that he hath receaued the Lordes ſupper?
