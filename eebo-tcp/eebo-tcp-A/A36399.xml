            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>At which day and place the ſaid Lady <hi>Eleanor Douglas</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, appeared perſonally; In whoſe preſence the Articles objected againſt her, and her Anſwers made thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46296:5"/>
were publiquely read, with certain printed Schedules &amp; Exhibites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed, which ſhe acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be of her own penning and publiſhing in print; and the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to be her true Anſwers, and to be Subſcribed with her own hand: By all which it evidently appeared to the Court, by her own Confeſsion, That ſhe had lately compiled and written, and cauſed to be printed and publiſhed, the three ſeveral Schedules annexed to the ſaid Articles, ſome containing Expoſitions of divers parts of the Chapters of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> ſome other ſcandalous matter, by way of Anagram or otherwife, againſt Eccleſiaſtical perſons and Iudges of eminent place, and ſome others, both derogatory to His Majeſty and the

State. And firſt as touching thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of high nature, which concerned his Majeſty, the Court did not any ways proceed againſt her, as holding them of too high a nature for this <hi>Court</hi> to meddle withal. But foraſmuch as ſhe took upon her (which much unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her Sex) not only to interpret the Scriptures, and withal the moſt intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and hard places of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> but alſo to be a Propheteſs, falſly pretending to have received cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Revelations from God; and had compiled certain Books of ſuch her fictions and falſe Propheſies or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which ſhe had in perſon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with her beyond the Seas, and had there procured them to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Licenſe, and after brought them over here into <hi>England,</hi> and here
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46296:6"/>

And foraſmuch as by vertue of the Statute of <hi>Primo Eliz.</hi> and by vertue of Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> this Court hath full power and authority to puniſh as well all tranſgreſſors and offendors againſt the ſaid Decree of Star-Chamber, touching the printing and publiſhing of unlicenſed Books,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46296:6"/>
as ſuch bold attempts as thoſe of hers, in taking upon her to interpret and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the holy Scriptures, yea, and the moſt intricate and hard places therein, ſuch as the graveſt and moſt learned Divines would not ſlightly or eaſily undertake, without much ſtudy and deliberation. For theſe her ſaid bold attempts and impoſtures, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſhonor of God, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Religion, whereof ſhe was found and adjudged guilty by the Court, ſhe was thought well worthy to be ſeverely puniſhed; and was firſt Fined in the ſum of 3000 l. to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties uſe, ordered to make a publique Submiſsion <hi>in conceptis verbis,</hi> at ſo many times, and in ſuch places as this Court ſhall appoint, and as ſhall be delivered her under the Regiſters
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46296:7"/>
Hand of this Court; And ſhe was further committed cloſe Priſoner to the Gatehouſe, and ordered there to remain during his Majeſties pleaſure, who had taken ſpecial notice of her and her Cauſe, and referred the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Cenſuring thereof into this Court. And laſtly ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Expences and Coſts of Suit, which are to be paid before her enlargement: And the Keeper of the ſaid priſon was required and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to ſuffer her to have any pen, ink or paper to write any thing, in reſpect that ſhe hath ſo much abuſed her liberty in that kinde already.</p>
