            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
Tranſlator's Preface.</head>
            <p>AS ſoon as this little Book fell into
my Hands, I could not forbear
making Enquiry, whether any
of our Countrymen had done the good
Service of communicating it to the <hi>Engliſh
Readers.</hi> The Entertainment it gave me,
the exceeding Characters I had heard of
it, (which indeed I thought Extravagant,
till my own Peruſal convinced me, they
were it's juſt due) and the deſire of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe wiſe Obſervations, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of them more diffuſive, as well
as that of impreſſing them more ſtrongly
upon my ſelf, moved me to reſolve upon
ſpending ſome leiſure hours in Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
this Great Foreigner. But the
Undertaking ſoon appeared more difficult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
than the Proportion of the Book tempted
<pb facs="tcp:59885:3"/>
me to expect. For the Tranſlating every
where literally and conciſely, would have
left ſome Paſſages Dark and ſcarce Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.
And a looſe Paraphraſe (beſides that
it is a Liberty not to be indulged, except
in Caſes of great Neceſſity) would take
off from the Beauty and Strength of ſuch
Reflections; the very deſign of which
Requires a ſhort Cloſe Style. With what
ſucceſs I have endeavoured to decline both
theſe Extreams, the Judicious Reader
will diſcern better, becauſe more imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
than I can; and the Failings he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers,
will, I promiſe my ſelf, be eaſily
forgiven, for the ſake of ſo good a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
as the giving him this Ingenious
Book in our own Language. For it is
to be hoped, he will think it more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
that this is done now by a very
indifferent and unknown Hand, than that
it hath not had this Right done it, by
ſome of the beſt and moſt Eminent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Behn</hi> indeed hath attempted part
of it, but ſhe ſeems not to have intended
a perfect Work, ſo much as the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb facs="tcp:59885:3"/>
her Self and her <hi>Lyſander,</hi> with
ſuch Paſſages as were moſt applicable to
her Darling Paſſion of Love. Upon
which occaſion and ſome others, ſhe takes
the Freedom of Paraphraſing, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
as ſhe ſaw fit, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to her own Diverſion, than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice to the Author. And beſides
Her's is only a Collection of ſome ſcattered
Reflections out of the Firſt and Second,
without any Notice taken of the Third
and Fourth Parts.</p>
            <p>This Tranſlation follows the Edition
of <hi>Lyons 1691.</hi> But becauſe there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of the ſame Year at <hi>Paris,</hi> without
any diſtinction of Parts, in which there
are ſeveral Additions, to what my Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
hath in the two firſt Books, I have
taken care to ſubjoyn thoſe Additions at
the end of the ſecond Part here; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that in Comparing the two Books
together none will be found to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
me, nor any other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them now remaining, except in the
Order of the Reflections. The Paſſages
added are likewiſe Numbred according to
<pb facs="tcp:59885:4"/>
the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, from whence they are
taken. The French Preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Tranſlated from thence, becauſe
ſomething larger; and referring particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to a Diſcourſe upon theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wholly wanting in the Impreſſion
at <hi>Loyns.</hi> That Diſcourſe (Engliſhed by
another Hand) is likewiſe inſerted here,
the deſign whereof is to remove ſome
Objections, to which this Book hath been
thought liable. So that all due care
hath been taken that this Tranſlation
might have it's utmoſt Perfection, and the
Author now appears in Engliſh more full,
and with much greater Advantage, than
any Edition of his, that ever I yet ſaw in
the Original Language.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE General Approbation
which the Publick has been
pleaſed to give theſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reflections,</hi> is infinitely above
what I am able to ſay in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and if they are really of that
intrinſic Value, as I take them to
be, and have very good Reaſons to
believe, 'tis almoſt impoſſible to do
them a greater injury, than to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they ſtand in need of an Apology.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59885:5"/>
I ſhall at preſent content my ſelf
to remark too things; First, That
by the word <hi>Intereſt,</hi> our Author
does not always underſtand what we
commonly call worldly <hi>Intereſt,</hi> which
has the purſuit of Wealth for its on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Object, but an <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Honour
and Glory. My Second Remark is,
(and 'tis in a manner the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all theſe Reflections) that the
judicious perſon who made them, only
conſiders Mankind in the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
State of Nature, as 'tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run
with Ignorance and corrupted
by Sin; and therefore whatever he
ſays of that infinite number of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that are to be found in their
apparent Vertues, does not in the
leaſt concern thoſe Happy but few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
whom Heaven is pleaſed to
preſerve from them by a particular
Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59885:5"/>
To remove the prejudices which
ſome well meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> People have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
againſt theſe Maxims, I
thought it convenient to inſert the
following Letter, which lately fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Hands, and was Written ſince
the firſt Edition of this Manuſcript;
and now at this juncture, when every
Reader takes the freedom to paſs
his own judgment upon them, it comes
out very ſeaſonably to clear the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Difficulties that may be urged
againſt theſe Reflections, as alſo to
explain the true Sentiments of our
Author. This at leaſt it has perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
it has abundantly Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to contain nothing but a
pure Abridgment of Morality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to ſeveral Fathers of the
Church, and that the Perſon who
Writ them, had a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe, that he could not well
miſs his way in following ſuch Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb facs="tcp:59885:6"/>
and Diſintereſted Guides.
And laſtly, that he had full Liberty
to ſpeak of <hi>Man</hi> after the very ſame
manner as the Fathers had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</p>
            <p>Now after all, if the Veneration
which is due to theſe Illuſtrious
Lights of the Church, is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſtop the Mouths of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
but they are reſolved in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to good Manners and Senſe,
to condemn the Opinion of theſe Great
Men, in condemning this Book, I
wou'd adviſe the Reader not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by ſuch partial Judges, nor
ſuffer himſelf to be determined by the
firſt Motions he finds ariſe in his
Heart, and to take all imaginable
care that <hi>Self-love</hi> ſhall have no ſhare
in the judgment which he paſſes upon
them; for if he ſuffers himſelf to be
Directed by ſo corrupt a Counſellor,
it is not to be ſuppoſed that he will
<pb facs="tcp:59885:6"/>
ſhew any great favour to theſe <hi>Maxims.</hi>
As they particularly charge <hi>Self-love</hi>
with Debauching the Reaſon, that
powerful Seducer will be ſure by way
of Requital, to prepoſſeſs the Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ſcore, the Reader
ought to take care that this prevention
or prejudice ſhall not juſtifie the Truth
of them, and to perſwade himſelf that
nothing can ſo effectually Eſtabliſh the
truth of theſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> as that
Heat or Subtilty he expreſſes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
them. But as it will be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter to perſwade every ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man that he cannot condemn them
out of any other Motive than that of
<hi>Intereſt</hi> diſguiſed, of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Self-love;</hi>
the beſt way the Reader can
take in my Opinion, is to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that none of theſe <hi>Maxims</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
him in particular, and that he
alone is excepted from them, although
they ſeem to be General. After he
<pb facs="tcp:59885:7"/>
has done this, I dare Anſwer for him
that he will be the firſt Man that
ſhall Subſcribe to the truth of them,
and what is more, believe that they
are of mighty benefit to the World
in Diſcovering all the weakneſſes and
<hi>Foibles</hi> of Mankind.</p>
            <p>As for what regards the order of
theſe Reflections, the Reader will at
firſt view diſcover that as they are
all upon different matters, it was in
a manner impoſſible to place them in
an exact Method. And tho' there
are ſeveral upon the ſame Subject, it
was not judged <hi>à propos</hi> to place
them always one after another for
fear of Diſguſting the Reader, who is
generally beſt entertained with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Variety.</p>

               <head>A Diſcourſe upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Am not able poſitively to tell you
whether the <hi>Moral Reflections</hi>
were Writ by Monſieur <hi>De</hi>—altho
the Stile and Manner of them
ſeem to reſemble his. But give me
leave, Sir, to tell you, that upon theſe
occaſions, I generally diſengage my ſelf
from popular Reports, and 'tis enough
to make me believe, that they do not
belong to him, becauſe the publick o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
has father'd them upon him.
Thus I have fairly and ingenuouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
your firſt Queſtion, and as for
the reſt, if you had not an abſolute
<pb facs="tcp:59885:8"/>
Authority over me, which I muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Diſpute, I ſhould wave a farther
Examination of them; for a man ſo
highly prepoſſeſs'd, as I am, in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
for this Work, has not that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to judge truly of it as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite;
nevertheleſs ſince you have been
pleaſed to order it ſo, I will frankly
give you my Opinion without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
to ſet up for a maker of Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or concerning my ſelf with the
Perſon who is ſuppoſed to have Writ
this Book. 'Tis eaſie to diſcover at
firſt Sight, that it was never deſigned
to viſit the World, but only Writ for
the Satisfaction of a Perſon, who in
my Opinion does not Aſpire to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of being an Author; and if it ſhould
happen to belong to Monſieur <hi>De</hi>
—, I can aſſure you, that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is Eſtabliſhed in the World
by ſo many better Titles, that he wou'd
be no leſs diſturbed to hear that theſe
<pb facs="tcp:59885:8"/>
                  <hi>Reflections</hi> are made publick, than
he was when the <hi>Memoirs</hi> that were
attributed to him were Printed. But,
Sir, you need not be informed what a
propenſity there is in this Age to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
all manner of Novelties, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe that go under any celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Name, which of it ſelf is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to recommend them to the World.
This you know is an undoubted Truth,
Names alone, ſet a price upon things
with thoſe People that are not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of finding out their intrinſic
value. The true merit of theſe <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
is underſtood but by a very few
People, tho 'tis certain that abundance
of preſuming <hi>Wou'd-be-Wits</hi> pretend
to give you their Opinions of them.
As for my ſelf, I don't pretend to have
Delicacy and Penetration enough to
form a true judgment of them; I ſay,
Delicacy and Penetration, becauſe to
qualifie a man for ſuch a Province, he
<pb facs="tcp:59885:9"/>
muſt be maſter both of one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and tho it were poſſible for me
to flatter my ſelf, that I poſſeſſed both
theſe qualities, I am inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that I ſhould find but very few
paſſages in theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.
I can there diſcover nothing
but a happy Force and Spirit, thoughts
truly Elevated and Bold, a noble turn
of Expreſſion accompanied with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
air of Quality, that does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to all that have vanity enough to
ſet up for Authors. I own indeed
there is not that Order and Art in
them which one would deſire, and
that a Learned Man, who enjoyed a
greater ſhare of leiſure than our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
affairs ſeem to allow him, wou'd
have thrown them into a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
But a Man who purely Writes
for himſelf, and to divert his mind
after the fatigue of other Buſineſs,
who ſets down his Thoughts juſt as they
<pb facs="tcp:59885:9"/>
come into his Head, does not ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
obſerve the niceties of Rules,
as they who make a profeſſion and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of Writing, and hope to get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
by their Pens. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
this Irregularity has its peculiar
Graces, and ſuch Graces too as Art
can never imitate. I don't know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will agree with me in this
point, but tho' I am ſure of incurring
the Indignation of the Criticks by
what I am going to ſay, yet I cannot
forbear to affirm to you, that as long
as I live, I ſhall make no ſcruple to
prefert the eaſie negligent ſtile of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Condition, which has Wit and
Spirit in it, to the ſlaviſh regularity
of a Doctor that never converſed with
any thing but his Books.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dictaque factaque ejus quanto ſolutiora, &amp; quandam ſui negligentiam praeferentia, tanto gratius in ſpeciem ſimplicitatis accipiebantur, <hi>Tac. Ann, l. 16.</hi>

Thus I have briefly acquainted you
with my Sentiments of this Work in
general, but at the ſame time am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that this is not enough to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you, ſince you requeſt me to anſwer
all thoſe Objections more particularly,
which you tell me have been urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. As I remember, the firſt
is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
deſtroy all the Vertues: To
which it may be anſwered, That our
Author was far from entertaining the
leaſt inclinations to deſtroy them; he
only pretends to ſhew that they are
ſeldom to be ſeen in a perfect ſtate of
Purity, and that the greateſt part of
our Actions are never without a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Error and Truth, Perfection
and Imperfection, Vice and Vertue.
He conſiders the Hearts of Men cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
invaded by Pride and Self-love,
and encompaſs'd about with ill
Examples, as the Governour of a Town
<pb facs="tcp:59885:11"/>
beſieged, who is in want of Silver;
he makes Money of Leather and Paſt-board.
This Money in ſhape and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
reſembles the good, 'tis put off
at the ſame Price, but nothing but
downright miſery and neceſſity makes
it go current among the Beſieged. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner, the generality
of humane Actions which paſs with the
world for ſo many Vertues, oftentimes
have only the bare image and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of them. Nevertheleſs they
don't ceaſe to carry ſome merit with
them, and to challenge our eſteem in
ſome meaſure, it being very difficult
humanely ſpeaking to have any better.
But admitting our Author believed,
that there was no truly perfect ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in Man, yet conſidering him in
the pure ſtate of Nature, he is not the
firſt that advanced this Opinion. If I
were not afraid to lie under the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of a mighty Man in Quotation with
<pb facs="tcp:59885:12"/>
you, I cou'd cite you ſeveral Authors,
nay, Fathers of the Church and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Saints, who were of Opinion,
that Self-love and Pride were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soul of the moſt Heroical Actions
the Pagans can boaſt off. I cou'd make
it appear that ſome of them have not
even pardoned the chaſtity of <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
whom all the World believed to
be vertuous, till they diſcover'd the
falſity of that vertue, which produced
the liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and has drawn
the admiration of ſo many Ages after
it. Can you imagine, Sir, that <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
himſelf who makes his Wiſeman
ſtand upon the ſame level with the
Gods, was truly wiſe, or that he was
really perſwaded of what he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to inculcate to other people with
ſo much Inſolence and Oſtentation?

Sir, that this mortified Hypocrite,
who ſo well counterfeited the Maſter
of his Paſſions, cou'd in Conſcience
pretend to any Vertue but that
ſingle one of concealing his Vices,
and that when he ordered his
Veins to be opened, he did not
repent him a thouſand times that
he left his Imperial Pupil the
power to make him Die? Do but
view this mighty Pretender at a
nearer diſtance, and you'll ſee that
in making all theſe fine reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
upon the immortality of the
Soul, he endeavors to Hoodwink
himſelf againſt the fears of Death;
he ſummons up all his forces to
make a ſolemn Grimace at parting:

                  </note> diveſt
a man of all Paſſion, and inſtead of
humbling his Pride, he raiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
above the Divinity. Now in my
Opinion he had acted much more like
an honeſt Man, if he had fairly own'd
the Weakneſſes and Corruption of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, and not taken ſo much
pains to Banter the World with his
impracticable Notions. On the other
hand, the Author of theſe Reflections
uſes a different Conduct; he lays open
all the Miſeries of Man, but then we
muſt underſtand him of Man, as he is
abandon'd to his own Caprice, and not
of a Chriſtian. He makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear, that in ſpite of all the
Efforts of his reaſon, Pride and Self-love
will ſtill take Sanctuary in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:59885:14"/>
of the moſt private receſſes of his
Heart, where they meet from time to
time with ſufficient nouriſhment to
ſpread their Venom imperceptibly
upon the greateſt part of its Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection you told me of,
and which has a great deal of Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the former, is, <hi>That theſe
Reflections paſs in the World rather
from the Subtilties of an Auſtere
Cenſor, who puts an ill Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the moſt indifferent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
than for ſolid Truths. You</hi>
tell me that ſome of your Friends
have aſſured you with all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
appearances of Sincerity that
they knew by their own experience,
that a man does ſometimes do good
without having any other view or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
than that of good; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
without any view at all, either
for Good or Evil, but by a natural inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<pb facs="tcp:59885:15"/>
of mind, which inclined him to
what is good without his own thinking
of it. I wiſh it were in my power to
believe theſe Gentlemen upon their
word, and that it were true that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature has none but reaſonable
Motions, and that all our Actions
were naturally vertuous. But, Sir,
how ſhall we reconcile the teſtimony of
your Friends to the ſentiments of the
greateſt Fathers of the Church, who
have aſſured us, <hi>That all our Vertues
without the Aſſiſtance of Faith, are
only imperfections, that our will
was born blind; that its deſires were
blind, its Conduct ſtill more blind,
and that it was no wonder if a man
under ſo much blindneſs was in a
perpetual ſtate of wandring.</hi> Nor is
this all, for they proceed to talk in a
higher ſtrain, and tell us that in ſuch a
condition, <hi>the prudence of man does
not penetrate into future things, and
<pb facs="tcp:59885:15"/>
appoints nothing but as it has a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Pride; that his Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
moderates no exceſſes, but
thoſe that his Pride condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that his conſtancy no farther
ſupports its ſelf under the preſſure
of Calamities, than as it is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by his Pride; and laſtly, that
all his vertues with that exterior
pomp of merit, which makes them
be admired, had no other end but
this Admiration, the love of vain
Glory, and the intereſt of Pride.</hi>
One might find almoſt an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Authorities upon this Opinion,
but if I ſhould once begin to cite them
regularly to you, the effect wou'd be,
that I ſhould give my ſelf a little more
trouble by the ſame token that you
wou'd not receive more pleaſure by it.
For this conſideration, I think the
beſt way both for you and me, will be
to give you an Abridgment of all this
<pb facs="tcp:59885:16"/>
Controverſie, done by an excellent
Poet of our time in the compaſs of ſix

them from the common impurities of
the World, I will with all my heart
give my Vote for their Canonization,
and here freely declare to them that
the <hi>Moral Reflections</hi> don't in the
leaſt concern them. There is no reaſon
to imagine that the Perſon who Writ
them, ever deſigned to meddle with
the Saints; for as I told you before,
his buſineſs is only with Man as he is
corrupted. He maintains that he
generally commits evil when his Self-love
flatters him that he's doing good,
and that he often deceives himſelf
when he wou'd judge of himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nature does not ſincerely explain
to him the real Motives that make him
Act. In this wretched ſtate where
Pride is the original of all his Actions,
the Saints are the firſt that declare

               <p>The Third Objection which lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to anſwer, is that abundance of
people complain of the great obſcurity
in the Senſe, as alſo in the expreſſion
of the Reflections. You need not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
Sir, that obſcurity is not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Author's fault. Reflections,
or if you pleaſe, Maxims and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:59885:19"/>
as the World has been pleaſed to
call theſe, ought to be Writ in a
ſuccinet cloſe Stile, that hinders a Man
from giving that perſpicuity in his
Writings which is to be deſired. They
are like the firſt ſchetches of a Picture
where an ingenious Eye will eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
all the perfection of Art, and
the beauty of the Painter's deſign. But
then this Beauty is not underſtood by
all the World, and altho' the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not ſet out in their proper
colours; yet for all that, they diſcover
a maſterly hand. For this reaſon the
Reader ought to penetrate into the
ſenſe and force of the words, the
mind ought to run over the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their ſignification before it ſits
down and proceeds to judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth Objection, unleſs I am
miſtaken was this, <hi>That the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
for the moſt part are too Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
You have been told <hi>that 'tis a</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:59885:20"/>
                  <hi>piece of Injuſtice to fix the defects
of particular Men upon the whole
Race.</hi> Beſides the account I have
received from you of the different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
you have heard upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I know what uſes to be General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Objected to thoſe Perſons who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and condemn Vices. Their
cenſure is called the Portraiture of a
Painter; 'tis urged againſt them that
they reſemble People that are troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Yellow Jaundice, who ſee
every thing Yellow becauſe they are
ſo themſelves. Now if it were true
that a Man cannot cenſure the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heart in General, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding more of it in himſelf than
another does, we ought then to take it
for granted that thoſe Philoſophers,
whoſe Apophthegms have been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down to us by <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi>
were the greateſt Debauchees of their
times; we ought to attack the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:59885:20"/>
of <hi>Cato,</hi> and believe he was the
moſt profligate wretch in <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cenſured the vices of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
If this is the caſe, I dare
ſwear for the Author of the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whoever he is, that he will not
be much troubled at the ill nature of
his Adverſaries, ſince the buſineſs of
Religion excepted, he will ſcarce be
taken either for a better or wiſer
Man than <hi>Cato.</hi> As for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
his expreſſion, which ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
pretend is too general, I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay this, that it is a difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to avoid it in ſentences, without
robbing them of all their Salt, their
Force and Spirit. Nor is this all,
for common converſation teaches us
that even where general expreſſions
are uſed, we take them in a limited
Senſe with ſuch and ſuch Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and this without any body's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing
to inſtruct us; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb facs="tcp:59885:21"/>
when we hear a Man cry,
<hi>All</hi> Paris <hi>went to meet the King,</hi>
or <hi>all the Court is in Mourning,</hi>
every one knows that it only ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the greateſt part. If you are of
opinion that theſe Reaſons are not
ſufficient to ſtop the Mouths of the
Criticks, you need only tell them
that when Gentlemen are ſo eaſily
ſcandalized at the terms of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cenſure, 'tis becauſe it touches
them after too lively a manner
in the moſt ſenſible part of their
hearts.</p>
               <p>'Tis indeed very certain, that you
and I are acquainted with ſeveral
Perſons of great Worth and Honour,
who are not in the leaſt offended at
the freedom of theſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> I
mean, thoſe that have a mortal aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to Hypocriſie, and who make no
ſcruple at all to confeſs both what
they feel in themſelves, and what
<pb facs="tcp:59885:21"/>
they obſerve in others. But few
People are capable of thinking of
them aright, or that will put
themſelves to the ſevere expence
of doing it, and if by mere acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they do, Self-flattery ſtill
attends them, and ſo hinders the
operation of the Phyſick. Let me

               <p>Obſerve, Sir, in what terms we
ought to Speak of the Pride of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature; inſtead of being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with the mirrour that ſhews us
our Faults, inſtead of bearing an ill
will to the Perſon who is ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to diſcover them to us, ought
we not rather to make uſe of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Lights they give us to find
out our Self-love and Pride, and to
preſerve our ſelves from the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
attempts they make upon our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
Can a Man ever expreſs Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
enough to thoſe two vices that
were the lamentable occaſions of the
revolt of our firſt Parent, or too much
decry thoſe unfortunate ſources from
whence all our miſeries proceed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:59885:22"/>
Others are at their liberty to take
the <hi>Reflections</hi> after what manner
they pleaſe; as for my ſelf, I look
upon them to be a true and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Repreſentation of all the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of your impudent pretenders
to Wiſdom. I fanſie that in every
ſtroke the love of truth pulls off his
Mask, and ſhows him as he is in his
proper Colours. I conſider them as
the inſtructions of an able Maſter, who
was perfectly verſed in the Art of
knowing Men, who dexterouſly lays
open all the ſeveral parts they play
upon the Theatre of the World, and
who not only bids us mind  the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Characters of the Perſons upon
the Stage, but lifts up a corner of
the Curtain, and ſatisfies us that
this Lover and that King in a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
are the very numerical Actors,
that play the Mountebank and the
Merry-Andrew in a Farce. I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:59885:23"/>
own to you, that I have read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this Age, that gives me a
greater contempt for Man, or makes
me more ſenſible of my own Vanity.
I fanſie that as often as I open the
Book, I find ſomething that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the ſecret Movements of my
Heart, I enquire into my ſelf to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether he ſpeaks the Truth,
and I find that generally he tells
both me and others more than they
ſaw. At firſt I am ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with him, I ſometimes bluſh
to ſee how exactly he has Divined,
but after I have with ſome violence
to my Nature read Him, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that if I don't from thence learn
to become more wiſe, I learn this at
leaſt that I have no pretence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to that Title; and laſtly, I
learn from the true Repreſentation
he gives me of my ſelf, not ſottiſhly
to fall into an admiration of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:59885:23"/>
Vertues, the very ſplendor of which
offends our Eye-ſight. Hypocrites
indeed paſs their time but very ill
in reading a Book of this Character,
and thoſe are the only Perſons in
the World that will raiſe a Noiſe
and Clamour about it. Let me
therefore conjure you, Dear Sir,
to give no heed to thoſe that vent
their Malice againſt it, and reſt
aſſured that the true Reaſon of
their Indignation is to ſee thoſe
Myſteries revealed, which if it lay

               <p>Self-love is the <hi>Love</hi> of a mans own ſelf,
and of every thing elſe for his own ſake.
It makes people <hi>Idolaters</hi> to themſelves,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59885:25"/>
and <hi>Tyrants</hi> to all the World beſides, as
they would plainly make appear if <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
did but furniſh them with Power and
Opportunities of ſhewing it. It never
reſts or fixes any where from Home, and
if for a little while it dwell upon ſome
other thing, 'tis only as <hi>Bees</hi> do, when
they light upon <hi>Flowers,</hi> with a deſign to
draw all the <hi>Virtue</hi> there to their own
advantage. Nothing is ſo raging and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
as its Deſires, nothing ſo cloſe as
its Deſigns, nothing ſo ingenious as its
Management of them; it hath more
Fetches and Doubles than can ever be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
it transforms it ſelf into more
different ſhapes, than are in all <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſes,
and its Extractions are more
ſubtle and refined, than any <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> can
Parallel. It is an <hi>Abyſs,</hi> too deep ever
to be ſounded, and too dark ever to be
ſeen thorough: There it ſits undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
even from the niceſt and moſt pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
<hi>Eye,</hi> and runs a thouſand wild <hi>Mazes</hi>
undiſcerned. Nay, it is ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from its own ſelf, and conceives
and cheriſhes, and brings up a world of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59885:25"/>
                  <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> without ſo much
as being ſenſible when they are <hi>Born,</hi>
or how they are <hi>Bred.</hi> And ſome of theſe
<hi>Conceptions</hi> are ſo monſtrous, that when
they come to the <hi>Birth,</hi> it either does not
know them, or cannot be prevailed upon
to own them. From this groſs Darkneſs
proceed all its extravagant and ridiculous
Opinions of its ſelf, all its Errours, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances,
and ſottiſh Stupidities in its own
caſe. This is the reaſon, why it often
thinks thoſe <hi>Paſſions</hi> killed, and dead,
which are only laid to Sleep; Happineſs it
ſelf is content to ſit down quietly when it
is only taking Breath for a freſh <hi>Chaſe,</hi> and
thinks thoſe <hi>Appetites</hi> quite loſt, which are
only ſatisfied a little for the preſent. And
yet this thick <hi>Miſt</hi> which hinders it from
ſeeing it ſelf, is no Obſtruction to its ſight
of any thing elſe; for in this it is like the
Eyes of our Body, which perceive all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

all its Attention, it Sees, and Feels, and
Hears, and Imagines, and Suſpects, and
Penetrates, and Preſages perfectly well, ſo
that nothing eſcapes it; and a Man would
be apt to ſuſpect, that each of theſe <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
under its Conduct, have ſome ſtrange
<hi>Magical Power</hi> peculiar to it. No <hi>Cement</hi> is
ſo ſtrong, none ſo cloſe as its Engagements,
which it attempts to break or diſſolve, but
to little or no purpoſe, even when driven
to it by the greateſt and moſt impending
<hi>Miſchiefs.</hi> And yet it happens ſometimes,
that what the continued Endeavours of
many years were not able to accompliſh,
a very little time and pains effects, which
gives us juſt Ground to conclude, that its
deſires are all kindled by its own hand,
and owing more to it ſelf, than to the
<hi>Beauty,</hi> or the worth of its <hi>Object;</hi> and
that its own <hi>Palate</hi> gives them all their
<hi>Value,</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> is the falſe Gloſs that ſets
them off. That it ſelf is the only Game
it purſues, and its own Inclination the
thing it follows, rather than the <hi>Objects</hi>
that ſute its Inclination; it is all extremes,
and acts in the greateſt contradictions to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59885:28"/>
it ſelf. It is Imperious and Submiſſive,
Sincere and Hypocritical, Frank and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
Compaſſionate and Cruel, Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Couragious. It puts on different
Inclinations according to the different
Tempers, that diſpoſe and devote it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to Honour, ſometimes to Riches,
ſometimes to Pleaſure. It ſhifts theſe, as
our Age, or our Fortunes, or our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
change; but as to it ſelf, it is the
ſame thing, whether it have one or more
ſuch Inclinations, for it divides it ſelf to
ſeveral, or collects and determines it ſelf
entirely to one at pleaſure, and as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
offer themſelves. It is fickle, not
only becauſe the things without us are
unſtable, but from a thouſand inward
<hi>Cauſes,</hi> entirely owing to it ſelf. Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
Levity, Love of Novelty. Nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atings,
and Diſguſts, and being tired with
what it hath already, make it changeable
every Moment. It is Whimſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cal and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome,
and you may ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it taking infinite pains, and uſing
the utmoſt Application and Zeal, for
things that cannot be any advantage, nay
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59885:29"/>
which are ſure to prove Prejudicial, and
yet purſue them it will, merely becauſe it
will have them. It is unaccountable and
childiſh, and often buſies it ſelf about
Trifles and Impertinencies; finds the
greateſt Reliſh and Delight, in the flatteſt
and moſt inſipid things, and reſerves all
its eagerneſs and warmth for the meaneſt,
and moſt contemptible. It enters into all
<hi>Qualities</hi> and all conditions of <hi>Life,</hi> it
lives in every place, it lives upon every
thing, nay it lives upon nothing; it ſerves
it ſelf both of the Enjoyment of things,
and of the want of them. It takes part
with the very Men that make <hi>War</hi> upon
it, and <hi>Engages</hi> in their Deſigns againſt it
ſelf; and which is moſt ſurpriſing, it joins
with them in the Hating of it ſelf, Plots
to its own Diſadvantage, and Conſpires
and Endeavours its own Deſtruction. In
a word, all its care is to ſubſiſt, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than not be at all, it is content to be
its own <hi>Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> We ought not therefore
to think it ſtrange, if we meet it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Mortification, and find it entring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59885:29"/>
boldly into <hi>League</hi> with this <hi>Adverſary,</hi> to
work its own <hi>Ruine;</hi> for at the ſame time,
that it pulls it ſelf down in one place, it
builds it ſelf up in another. When we
think it renounces, and forſakes its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
it only ſuſpends or changes it; and
when we fanſie it <hi>Conquered,</hi> and totally
<hi>Routed,</hi> we find it riſe Victorious, and its
very Defeat contributes to its <hi>Triumph.</hi>
This is the true Picture of <hi>Self-love,</hi> which
is ſo predominant, that a mans whole life
is but one continued Exerciſe and ſtrong
Agitation of it; the <hi>Sea</hi> indeed is a very
ſenſible reſemblance of this <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and the
perpetual <hi>Ebbings</hi> and <hi>Flowings</hi> of the
<hi>Waves</hi> there, are a lively and faithful <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme</hi>

               <p>After having expoſed the falſity of ſo
many ſeeming <hi>Vertues,</hi> it is but reaſonable
I ſhould add ſomewhat of that Deceit
there is in the <hi>Contempt</hi> of Death. That
<hi>Contempt</hi> of it I mean, which the Heathens
pretended to derive from the ſtrength of
<hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> without any hope of
a better Life to animate them. There is
a great deal of difference between ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death with Bravery and Reſolution,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59885:86"/>
and ſlighting it. The former is very u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
but I very much ſuſpect, that the
other is never real and ſincere. There
hath been a great deal <hi>Written,</hi> 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd,
and as much as the <hi>Subject</hi> will bear,
to prove, that <hi>Death</hi> is no Evil; and
Men of very inferiour <hi>Characters</hi> as well
as <hi>Heroes</hi> have furniſht us with a great
many eminent Examples in confirmation
of this Opinion. But ſtill I am very much
perſwaded, that no wiſe Man ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
ſo; and the trouble they are at to
perſwade others and themſelves, ſhews
plainly, that this was no ſuch eaſie under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
There may be a great many
Reaſons, why Men ſhould be out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
with Life; but there can be none,
why we ſhould deſpiſe Death: Even thoſe,
who run voluntarily upon it, do not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
it ſo inconſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a matter, but are
confounded, and decline it as much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if it approach them in any other
ſhape, but that of their own chooſing.
The great Diſparity obſervable between
the <hi>Courage</hi> of a World of brave Men,
hath no other Foundation than this, That
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59885:86"/>
they have different <hi>Ideas</hi> of Death, and
that it appears more preſent to their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon ſome occaſions, and at ſome times,
than it does at others. Hence it is, that
after having ſlighted what they did not
know, they are afraid when they come
to be better acquainted with it. If a
Man would perſwade himſelf, that it is
not the very greateſt of Evils, he muſt
decline looking it in the Face, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
all its Gaſtly <hi>Circumſtances.</hi> The
Wiſeſt and the Braveſt Men, are they
that take the faireſt and moſt Honourable
Pretences, to avoid the conſideration of
it. But every Body that knows it as it
really is, finds it to be a thing full of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>
The neceſſity of Dying, was what
the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> owed their <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of
mind to; they thought when there was
no Remedy, but a Man muſt go, it was
beſt to go with a good <hi>Grace.</hi> And, ſince
there was no poſſibility of making their
lives <hi>Eternal,</hi> they would ſtick at nothing
to make their Names ſo, and ſecure all
that from the wreck, which was capable
of being ſecured. Let us put the beſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59885:87"/>
Face upon the matter we can, ſatisfie our
ſelves with not Speaking all we think;
and hope more from a happy <hi>Conſtitution,</hi>
than all the feeble Reaſonings, that gull
us with a Fancy of our being able to
meet Death unconcerned. The Honour
of dying Gallantly, the Hope of being
Lamented when we are gone, the Deſire
of leaving a good Name behind us, the
Certainty of a Deliverance from the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the preſent Life, and of depending
no longer upon a fickle and humourſome
Fortune, are Remedies that we ſhall do
well to make our beſt of.</p>
               <p>But theſe, though they be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Remedies, yet we muſt not
ſuppoſe they are infallible ones. They
may help to put us in Heart, juſt as a
poor <hi>Hedge</hi> in an <hi>Engagement,</hi> contributes
to Encourage the <hi>Soldiers</hi> that are to March
near, where the Enemy are Firing behind
it. While they are at a diſtance, they
imagine, it may be a good Shelter, but
when they come up to the place, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
convinces them it is but a thin De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
'Tis a vain Imagination, and too
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59885:87"/>
fatal a Flattery, to think that Death hath
the ſame Face near at Hand, which we
fanſie him to have, while we view him
at a Diſtance; and that our Reaſonings
which in Truth are weakneſs it ſelf, will
prove of ſo hardned a Temper as to hold
out proof, and not yield to the ſevereſt of
all <hi>Tryals.</hi> Beſides, it ſhews we are but
little acquainted with the Power of <hi>Self-love,</hi>
when we imagine, that will do us
any ſervice toward the looking upon
that very thing as a Trifle, which muſt
of neceſſity be its utter Ruine; and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
in which we ſo often take Sanctuary,
hath not the power upon this occaſion to
make us believe, what we wiſh to find
true. So far from that, that this betrays
us oftener than any other thing; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of animating us with a <hi>Contempt</hi> of
Death, gives us a more lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of all its <hi>Terrour</hi> and <hi>Gaſtlineſs.</hi> All
it is able to do in our behalf, is only to
Adviſe, that we would turn our Heads
another way, and divert the thought by
fixing our Eyes upon ſome other Objects.
