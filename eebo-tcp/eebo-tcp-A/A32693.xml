            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I cannot tell you the Womans <hi>name</hi>; my Authors having been in that point unanimously silent; but you may call her, if you please, the <hi>Wandring Greek</hi>: for, she hath visited more <hi>Countries,</hi> than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Queen <hi>Christina,</hi> (who, though now naturalized a <hi>Roman,</hi> doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain much of the <hi>Goth</hi> and <hi>Vandal</hi>) and

If I have set her forth in an equipage somewhat too <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>solemn,</hi> according to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of my own phansie, which is most delighted with sad colours, and plain useful garments; so that she may now seem the Mistress rather of a <hi>Philosopher</hi> than of a Courtier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was, because I would not have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And because she is a <hi>Mourner,</hi> I have accoutred her in a sable Veil: which she puls down, as often as she hath occasion to hide her blushes; and turns up again, when she is pleased to be more free, and discover the charms of her smiles.</p>

Besides, what is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> (as she seems to be) must, you know, be ever <hi>young</hi> and flourishing.</p>

And should Heaven be so mercifull, as to forgive it, (which was dangerous to presume) yet certainly the Ghost of her Husband would not; since, if he loved

her while alive, he could not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with any violence she should offer to her self, but would rather abhor the society of so great a Criminal, among the Shades; at least, if Souls departed hence have any sense or cognizance of the actions of Mortals upon Earth.</p>

And more she would have said, but that a fresh flood of tears running down her cheeks, robbed her lips of the freedom of their motion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Souldier</hi> seeing this, and fearing a relapse, had immediate recourse to the <hi>Antidote of the Bottle,</hi> of whose cordial juice he had so admirable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: and without more ado, he holds up her head with one hand, while with the other he drencheth her with a round dose of the remaning liquor: And

she had no sooner felt the warmth and vigour of it in her stomach, but the fountains of her tears were instantly sealed up, her forehead smoothed, and all her face reduced to its native sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Nay more, this last draught wrought so divinely, that her mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so seemed perfectly restored to its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient mildness and tranquility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and she became the most affable, compleasant, and chearfull creature in the world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as if a new Soul had been infused into her.

neerly dependent upon the humours and temperament of our bodies, as to be, in a manner, the pure and natural consequents or results from them; and that our humours and temperament be so easily and soon variable, according to the various qualities of meats and drinks received into our stomachs; both which seem verified in the instance of this Ephesian Woman, who by the generous quality of the Wine, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juice of the Meat, was, as it were, in a moment altered in her whole frame; of a highly discontented and desperate wretch, becomming a quiet, tractable, and good humour'd creature, quitting her morosity and contumacy in a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous resolution, for frank affability, yieldingness, and alacrity; Why should not men believe, with his Master <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> that the Soul is nothing else but a certain <hi>composition or contexture of subtle Atoms,</hi> in such manner figured and disposed, and natively endowed with such activity, as to animate the body, and actuate all the members and organs of it; or, with <hi>Galen,</hi> that the Soul is but the <hi>Harmony of Elements,</hi> concurring in the composition of the body, at first, and in the same tenour

Now, though we deny not, but the rational Soul, in respect of this her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the Body, is in some degree subject to the Laws of Matter; and consequently, that the humours and temperament of the Body, have some influence or power to alter and work upon the mind, especially in weak-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded persons, who make no use of the arms of their reason, to encounter and subdue the insurrections and assaults of sensual appetites: Yet cannot we grant, that the impressions which the body makes upon the mind are such, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to question either the Immortality, or derogate from the Soveraignty of the Soul over the Body.</p>

Methinks I perceive certain symptoms in her, which signifie not only a change of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but even a perfect metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of her person also; and so strangely is she altered, that did not the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her mourning habit (and yet she hath dropt her Veil) together with the circumstances of time and place, assure me to the contrary; seriously I should not easily be perswaded that she is the same woman. She appears now to have so little of the sorrowful Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in her, that if I might have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>Physiognomists</hi> take, of divining by outward signes, I should take her for the most pleased and happy Bride in the world. Her <hi>forehead</hi> seems not only smoothed, but dilated also to a more graceful largeness, and over-cast with a delicate sanguine Dye.

touches of his lips, and longed to leave the impression of hers upon them. Nay, she takes no care to shut them, as if that negligent posture were more natural to the freedom of her kindness; or, as if she were in more readiness to receive that soul, she would have him breath into her. Nor doth any thing make her take off her mouth from his, but the impatience to have her eyes so long empty of the images of his form; and when she hath feasted that sense, with giving and receiving some fixt amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous looks, (for now they are no longer oblique glances) she instantly returns again to her banquet of kisses, as if the pleasures of her <hi>Eye,</hi> though high and ravishing among mutual Lovers, were yet inferior to those of the <hi>Touch</hi>; or, as if the pleasures which each of these excellent senses doth affect the soul with, in such cases, were so great and violent, as that she is not capable of being intent upon both at once, but is forced to apply her self one while to one alone, another while to another, lest being distracted betwixt them, she might lose any whit of what her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tells her, is requisite to consummate the fruition she aims at. In a word, (for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52245:24"/>
we are fallen upon a Subject, whose nature is not to admit of much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) there is nothing of liberty, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of dalliance, nothing of caresses and indearment, which this sportful <hi>Lady</hi> doth not use, both to make her self grateful and charming to her new <hi>Gallant,</hi> and to enkindle fresh ardors in him. So that if what we see be not <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> her self, sporting with her beloved <hi>Mars</hi>; yet, doubtless, it is one of her own daughters, in the heighth of solace with one of his sons. But, here Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty commands us to turn our backs upon this pleasant couple; for, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, he hath not yet exhausted all his Amunition, and that, grown more sensible of the Magique of her wanton incitements, he is arming himself for a second encounter, and stands ready to do that <hi>Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let us, therefore, seasonably avert our yet innocent Eyes, and leave these her new Votaries quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to finish those <hi>Cytherean</hi> Rites they are going about: especially since their Zeal is so servent, as not to scruple at the nicety of making the Dead Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Coffin, the Altar, whereon to kindle and exhale the incense they have brought. And while they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie at their silent devotions, let us have recourse to the Oracle of Reason, and there consult about the powerful <hi>Cause</hi> of this great and admirable Change in our <hi>Matron,</hi> who (you see) is no longer either Mourner, or Widow. ¶<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it be well known, that the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and tenderness of their Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is such, as renders them like wax, capable of any impressions, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as correspond with those their

inclinations, that Nature hath implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them as goads to drive them on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that principal End, for which it hath made them: yet, who is so rashly prodigal of his life, as to incense that Revengeful sex, by calling in question that Constancy in affection, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Woman so much boasteth of, and is ready to defend even with her blood, and whereof every day produceth so many notable Examples? For my part, truly, notwithstanding I was never so happy, as to be much in the Favour of Ladies; yet will not the honour I bear them, permit me willingly to incurre their displeasure, especially by asserting so scandalous an Heresie: nor will I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any opportunity to demonstrate, that the services I desire to do them, are such as hold exact proportion with the strongest of their Inclinations, and the highest of their Perfections. There is not an Attribute their Excellencies challenge even in their own opinion, (which all allow to be favourable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,) but I am ready to give it them: nor can I doubt the verity and weight of any thing they say, but admire and believe them as Oracles. My Ears can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so soon drink in their promises, as

my Faith swallows them down, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I hear any Lady but say, (though she use no protestations) that she either hath been, or will be constant and firm to her Servant; I am ready instantly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and swear, the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves even in their substance are more subject to Alteration, that Nature her self can sooner change her Course, her Laws, and run into the confusion of her primitive Chaos; than she be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Object, upon which she hath placed her Love. When any Widow sighs and weeps at the funeral of her Husband; I compassionate the Reality and Profoundness of her Grief, am afraid she should despair, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy her self; and I sooner expect to see her Husband revived, than her to entertain any the least thought of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting another into her bed. If I but hear the sad story of some young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin deprived of her first Love; I cannot forbear to beat my breast, and cry out, Ah! what pity it is, so fair a Flower should be lost to all Mankind, and wither for want of a hand to gather it? For, certainly, she poor Soul, devoting the disconsolate remainder of her days
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52245:26"/>
to solitude and Fidelity, will never be brought to listen after another for a Bridegroom; no, without doubt she will live and die a pure Virgin, and all the hopes she hath, are to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the honours reserved in the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, when I read those witty and elegant Writers, who have exercised their Pens in illustrating <hi>Femal Glories,</hi> in erecting <hi>Galleries of Heroical Women,</hi> and collecting <hi>Examples</hi> of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, Conjugal</hi> Love, and other <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>; O! how am I delighted, how am I enflamed with Emulation of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and esteem those Authors have purchased to themselves thereby! And, had my Stars been so propitious and bountiful to my Nativity, as to have inspired me with a competent portion of Wit, I should not have conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Argument either so worthy in it self, or so agreeable to my <hi>Genius,</hi> as the <hi>Commendation of Ladies.</hi> And I shall not stick to confess to you, as my Friend,

So that you may well perceive, how irreconcileable an Antipathy I have to any such opinion, as derogates from the Honour due to the <hi>Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of that delicate and sweet Sex, which the kindness of Nature made for our Comfort, solace, and delight, and without the assistance of which we should fall short of doing that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Act, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To impute it to the force of the <hi>Wine</hi> the Souldier gave her, is to pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Grand and <hi>Principal</hi> Agent, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52245:27"/>
rest in what was but an <hi>Accessory</hi> at most; to lay the whole weight of the wonder upon what seems to have had no more than a finger in it. For, first the <hi>Quantity</hi> she drank, though suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to renovate her spirits, cherish her vital warmth, and quicken the motion of her well-nigh congealed blood; was yet too little to intoxicate her brain, and enflame her to the height of desires so inconsistent, so repugnant to the frigid temper and low condition it found her in. And, as to the <hi>Quality</hi> of it; though good Wine be the <hi>Milk of Venus,</hi> and as subtle and powerful a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of Chastity, as a Nurse or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, as Night, as Opportunity, yea as Gold it self, (which the Antients inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in placing the Chappel of <hi>Venus</hi> behind the Temple of <hi>Bacchus</hi>; and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in that speaking of Wine and Drunkenness in his third <hi>Problem,</hi> he toucheth upon <hi>Venery</hi> in his fourth: And is a chief reason why the <hi>Rhenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> Houses are so much frequented by our Gallants.) Yet doth it seldome work that effect, but where it meets with bodies predisposed to admit and concurre with its sprightly and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning influence. For, as all Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52245:27"/>
have their power and energy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the capacity of the Patients, upon which they operate; so in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Wine is not so universal an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirer of Amorous and hot inclinations, as not sometimes to meet with resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence and suppression, in persons of cold Temperaments, or chast Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And, therefore, whensoever it heateth and irritateth to Courtship, it doth not more than add some sparks to that inward Fire, which, however cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly raked up in the ashes of apparent Modesty, was yet scorching before, and wanted not much of breaking forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a furious Flame. So that our Matron having not enlarged her draughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of temperance and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; and being by her long fasting, sorrow, and remaining in the cold, (all which are profest and irreconcilable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to <hi>Venus,</hi>) so debilitated, that we ought not to believe she had much of that fewell in her veins, which the spirits of Wine enkindle, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth that burning Appetite we are speaking of: It cannot consist with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to aggravate her facility, by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it wholly upon the innocent means of her refreshment and recov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MOst certain and manifest it is, that the proper object of all <hi>Appetites,</hi> is <hi>Good,</hi> either Real, or only Apparent; and the Reason is, because the Object, in which this Good is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or apprehended, is conducible to the perfection of that thing, whose the Appetite is, or which desireth it. For, Appetite or desire always presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth in the thing desiring, a want or <hi>Need</hi> of the thing desired; and what is in want cannot be perfect, without receiving what it doth want So that the <hi>Agreeableness,</hi> or <hi>Profitableness,</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> which is betwixt the Nature of the thing wanted, or desired, and the perfection requisite in the Nature of the thing wanting or desiring; is the <hi>Cause</hi> why it is desired, or loved; and also the ground of that <hi>Pleasure</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which is perceived in the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or <hi>Fruition</hi> of it. And this, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the Foundation of all the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that are to be found in Nature; and of the Love we have for all that is truly, or seemingly Good for us. I say,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52245:32"/>
Good for us; because there is no such thing in the World, as Good <hi>Absolute</hi>; nor do we account any thing Good, but with <hi>Respect</hi> to our selves.</p>
                     <p>Now, forasmuch as the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the object, to the nature of the thing desiring it, is the cause both of the Appetite's being particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to it, as that which serveth to its perfection (which consisteth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the advancement of its Power into Act,) and also of that Pleasure which attends the attainment of it: it cannot be denied, but the Appetite is accompanied or rather ushered by a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Knowing</hi> or discerning that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableness, wheresoever it meeteth with it among objects, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the Appetite therunto; since, what is not known to be Agreeable, cannot be desired. And since those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions, which men call <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> are but the results of such Conceptions, as are formed in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Understanding, after the Appetite hath been excited by the Good or Convenience of the thing proposed to it; There must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a faculty of knowing what is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, what not. And since to know
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52245:33"/>
a thing, is to have a Conception, or Notion of it, correspondent to its <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which declareth or manifesteth its self only by its Qualities and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: those Qualities are the <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Marks,</hi> by which the <hi>Faculty Cognitive</hi> is enabled to judge of its Good, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and accordingly represent it to the <hi>Appetite,</hi> to be embraced or rejected. And this, as it is the reason why Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture furnished all Animals with senses, and Man, with both sense and Reason, by which, the Marks or Signs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in objects, may be perceived, and so the Nature of the thing, in which they appear, be made known to the Faculty, whose Function it is to judge of them: So is it likewise of this, that whatsoever the senses (the observers of the marks of Good and Evil) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to the Imagination (which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Conceptions of them accordingly) for Good, Profitable, or Agreeable, is accounted Good, or Fair, or Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and afterward desired or pursued by the Appetite. This considered, the rule of pure Consequence teacheth, that the reason why <hi>Corporal Beauty</hi> so delighteth the senses, and rav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of that interior power or agreeableness, which is in the subject to which it adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and which our Appetite wanteth, in order to its attainment of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is required to its nature. So that, in this Sense, we cannot much find fault with his definition of <hi>Beauty,</hi> who called it the <hi>splendor of Goodness</hi>; nor condemn his of <hi>Love,</hi> who termed it <hi>Need,</hi> or want.

And the sum of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion concerning this kind of Love, is this. That a Man, whose Mind is full of Wisdom and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues, is naturally inclined to seek out, and dearly affect some beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull person, of age and capacity to conceive, in whom he may by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent instructions and familiar wayes of insinuation, beget or produce the like Wisdome and Virtues: and that the delight he receives therein is very great, as the Motive to it is very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And this is the Idea of true Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Love.</p>
                     <p>Now, as for the <hi>Truth</hi> of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though it be honourable to instruct
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52245:39"/>
the ignorant, and sow the seeds of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the minds of such as though fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til in capacity, were yet actually barren of them before; and though it be a high delight of the Mind to propagate knowledge, and make the wisdom of others derive it self from the bounty of ours: yet am I not convinced, either that there is any such strong natural inclination generally in wise and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons, to seek and court the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and prone to vice, that they may instruct and make them like themselves; because Experience assureth that few Learned and Prudent men are so easily Communicative, as <hi>Plato</hi> represents <hi>Socrates</hi> to have been, at least, out of meer Natural inclination; or that they select none but beautiful and youthful persons to become their Schollars, since Beauty of the body is not always a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mark of singular Capacity in the Mind to Science and Virtue; and there have been many eminent in both, who yet were not adorned with Corporal comeliness.</p>
                     <p>In this particular, therefore, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s belief, who, though a great admirer of generous <hi>Friendship</hi> as his excellent discourse, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled

When you were pleas'd last Summer, to send me your <hi>EPHESIAN MATRON,</hi> with strict Command, that I should entertain her, as jealous <hi>Italians</hi> do their Mistresses, mew her up in my Cabinet, from sight of the whole world: You sent a <hi>Present</hi>

In a word, your Injunction to me, to restrain her from the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all others, was not only tyrannical and inhumane in it self (for, as our great Moralist, and beloved Author, <hi>Chaucer,</hi> in the Wise of <hi>Bath's</hi> Prologue.

And we should live but uncomfortably at best, if we denied them, especially while they are young, handsom, and well dress'd, to shew themselves abroad in company, and appear in frequent assemblies. Besides, as the same Wife of <hi>Bathe</hi> speaks in the name of her whole sex,

Nor is it less difficult to put restraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Lady of her sprightly and debonaire humor, than to imprison the Sun-beams, catch the winds in a net<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or impound an

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52245:51"/>Again, you were not ignorant, that I am of so <hi>Charitable</hi> and Communicative a <hi>Genius,</hi> that I hate to eat my morsels alone, though they be never so sweet and delicious. One of my Maxims is, <hi>quo communius, eo suavius;</hi> the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable I find any thing to my self, the more desirous I am to impart the same to my Friends and Acquaintance: it being not the least of my pleasures, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and please others.</p>
                  <p>Knowing, therefore, on one part, that the <hi>Ephesian</hi> was amiable, tempting and witty; and on the other, that I am no Monopolizer of such Commodities, but of a publick spirit and free-hearted: You ought either not to have put her into my hands, or not to have expected I should restrain her from shewing her self to the world. Nor am I to be so much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for permitting her to go to <hi>London,</hi> and appear openly in the <hi>New Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi>: as you are for imagining, that so fair and polite a Creature deserved
<pb facs="tcp:52245:52"/>
such harsh usage, as to be alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with me in an obscure Country Village among Fanatick Weavers and Cloth-workers.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>you'll</hi> say (I presume) as poor <hi>Malbecco</hi> said in excuse of his jealousie; that you grounded your command of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie, not upon distrust of the <hi>Matrons</hi> virtue, but upon fear of having your <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> brought into question, if the censorious World should once come to know, who it was, that brought her from <hi>Rome,</hi> and furnished her with so handsome an <hi>English</hi> dress. And this seems a good Caution; but was it a prudent one? What cause had you for it? More than one. Well then, I guess at your thoughts. You feard, lest some men might be of so severe a brow, as to think you had forgotten the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> required in a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and one of your ripe years, while you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged your Pen, the liberty of touching
<pb facs="tcp:52245:52"/>
upon an <hi>Amorous</hi> Argument, though without violation of Modesty, and only for divertisement. You feard, lest others, less acquainted with Books, might mistake the History for a <hi>Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and you for the <hi>Author</hi>: and thereupon take occasion to discredit both. You feard again, lest others might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the sense of your Text by a false <hi>Comment,</hi> interpret what you inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only for an innocent and facete <hi>Exercise</hi> of your <hi>Wit,</hi> to be a designe of Malice, a studied <hi>Satyr</hi> against <hi>Women.</hi> These are all the Reasons I can imagine you could alleage against my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to publick view that good-natur'd <hi>Stranger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To let you see, then, how much you were deceived in the weight of these <hi>Objections,</hi> suggested to you by your fear of Detraction and Scandal; and withall briefly to Apologize for my own transgression of your Command,
<pb facs="tcp:52245:53"/>
in transmitting the <hi>Ephesian</hi> to the <hi>Press</hi> (for, that I own to my act:) I find my self obliged to perpend them one by one in the ballance of Equity.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>First</hi> place, you had no reason to think <hi>Love</hi> to be so <hi>juvenile</hi> and sooty an Argument, that you could not handle it without contracting stains upon your <hi>Reputation.</hi> For, that <hi>Erotic passion</hi> is allowed by all learned men to be a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and in that name your very <hi>Profession</hi> gave you a just title to inquire into the origine, nature, causes, signes, symptomes, &amp;c. thereof. Again, you have the authority of no less man than <hi>Marsilius Ficinus (in praefat. ad Convivium Platonis) omnem Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem honestum esse, &amp; bonum, omnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que amore dignos, qui bene dicunt de amore;</hi> that all Love is honest and good, and all those worthy to be loved, who speak well of it.

memorable. One is that of <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> a reverend Bishop, who penned the famous Love-story of <hi>Theagines</hi> and <hi>Chariclea</hi>: and when some sowr <hi>Cato's</hi> of that time reprehended him for it, chose rather (saith <hi>Nicephorus, Histor. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 34.) to leave his Bishoprick, than disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow his Book. The other is of <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> an ancient Theologue; who after the 40. year of his age, as himself confesseth <hi>(in praefat. lib.</hi> 1.) composed that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Roman of <hi>Euryalus and Lucrecia.</hi> To these I could have added other two eminent Divines of our own time and Nation, <hi>Mr Burton,</hi> who wrote copious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learnedly of <hi>Love-melancholy;</hi> and <hi>Dr. Tailer,</hi> who thought it no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his Gravity, to recount (if <hi>I</hi> remember well, in his Art of <hi>living and dying virtuously)</hi> the very same story of the <hi>Ephesian Matron,</hi> as an instance of Human Frail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To conclude this first part, therefore, of your Iustification; if it were no dishonour to these grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to have treated of Love; why should you, a Natural Philosopher, and yet no old man, apprehend it so dangerous a thing to your good name, to let the world know, you had bestowed a few va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant hours, for your divertisement, upon the same Subject?

<pb facs="tcp:52245:55"/>
to make wholesome and usefull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques thereupon, for the advice and caution of greener heads.</p>
                  <p>As for your <hi>Second</hi> imaginary <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> viz. that the <hi>Ephesian</hi> might be thought the <hi>Minerva</hi> of your Brain, your <hi>natural</hi> Daughter, when indeed she was only your <hi>adopted</hi> one: certainly, my <hi>dear Friend,</hi> you had laid aside your considering-cap, when you sufferd so light a conceipt to make any the least impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon your skull. For, every Scholar very well knows, that the Lady being the Daughter of <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> in his <hi>Satyricon,</hi> cannot therefore be less then sixteen hundred years elder than you. Whether she was a <hi>True,</hi> or a <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> one; the <hi>Author</hi> having kept that in his breast, I am not able, after so long an interval of time, to determine. But thus much I can assure those, who doubt of her <hi>Reality;</hi> that <hi>Flavianus, apud Salisberiensem,</hi> affirms that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a true one, and that the Woman
<pb facs="tcp:52245:55"/>
suffer'd death for her parricidal wiched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and adultery, as he (in my judgment too severely) stiles her fault. This <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> begets a <hi>Digression.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say, too <hi>severely;</hi> because her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being newly dead of some violent sickness, and she then a Widow, when she so graciously obliged the Souldier: where was either her <hi>Parricide,</hi> or her <hi>Adultery?</hi> I should think, that either the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Laws against removing the dead out of their Sepulchres, were inhumanely strict; if her Iudges were thereby obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that fact in her equivalent to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide: or that <hi>Flavianus</hi> had been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed in that part of the Story. For, as to the other part of her Charge, her so facil and suddain giving her self up to the Souldiers embraces; had the Laws of the place made it capital (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they did not, because I never read of any Laws so extremely rigorous, in any of the Cities of <hi>Greece)</hi> yet she had wit enough to evade them, by pretending
<pb facs="tcp:52245:56"/>
                     <hi>Marriage</hi> to her new Lover. Here I have an opportunity to observe to you, that though that excellent Divine, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quoted, <hi>Dr. Tayler,</hi> was pleased so to sweeten and extenuate the Levity of the Woman, as to tell his Readers, that she <hi>married</hi> the Souldier in the Vault, yet I cannot assent to him in that particular. The words of <hi>Petronius,</hi> indeed, are these; <hi>Jacuerunt,</hi> (or, as the best <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi> read, <hi>latuerunt) una, non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum illa nocte, qua nuptias fecerunt, sed postero etiam ac tertio die, &amp;c.</hi> But all who are conversant in the Latin tongue, well understand, that <hi>nubere</hi> &amp; <hi>nuptias facere,</hi> is by a modest <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsis</hi> used, by the ancient Romans, <hi>pro</hi>

Which I occasionally touched upon, not as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Iudgment, but an excess of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in that learned and pious Divine;
<pb facs="tcp:52245:56"/>
who was willing to honest the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans lapse, by an interpretation to her most favorable, and to her Sex least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive.</p>
                  <p>To return to my tracing of the Story it self. <hi>Jan.

Hence it is, that Lovers are more eloquent in their sighs than in their words, as if no messengers were so fit to convey their sentiments, as their vital breath: and like <hi>Paphian</hi> Doves, they grone forth living Epistles. Nay, they discourse together silently by the rhetorick of their fingers, and weave dialogues in Chaplets. By affable nods, and darted smiles, the vocal Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of desire, they treat about their union; and read each others Soul in glances. Their <hi>Colloquies,</hi> like those of Angels, are made by <hi>intuition</hi>: and they express themselves also, like them, not by the Intellect, but the <hi>Will.</hi>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their contracted brows threaten displeasure; but at the same time they contract them with such sweetness, that they rather invite than discourage; and their very frowns are obliging. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Souls interchangeably sally forth at their Eyes, and steal kisses at a distance; and then return home again triumphing in their invisible thefts. Thus both sides gain, yet neither lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; both lose and both gain. Their chief aim is, to be surprised: and yet their chief pleasure and glory is, not to be perceived. Thus that which is so often brought into the Theatre, flies all spectators, and acts in its own person.

of old issuing from their Statues, they inspire the person, to whom they speak; as if two Minds met to animate one Body, and conversed together with no less silence, than one uses to converse with it self alone. Of all our affections, this alone knows not to be expressed; and the sacred rites thereof (as those of the most ancient Gods of the Heathen) are performed in the dark. Though the passion be of it self innocent, yet it is alwayes conjoyned with secret shame: and the same blushes that betray our flame, strive to hide it.

But the true reason why Joy ariseth for the most part from <hi>titillation,</hi> I conceive to be this; that the pleasure of all sensation consisteth in the Objects causing in the Nerves and Brain some motion, which might violate and hurt them, in case they were not firm and tense enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist it; This resistence makes upon the centre of the brain an impression, which

Which, because they can no way harm us, seem to tickle the soul by touching her. And <hi>Pain</hi> ordinarily produceth <hi>Grief,</hi> because that offense of the sense, which is called <hi>Pain,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from some Action so violent, as to hurt the Nerves: of which the soul instantly becoming sensible, looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as an <hi>Evil</hi> extending to her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and thereupon is affected with <hi>Grief</hi>; unless in some such cases, where she is strongly diverted by expectation of a greater Good from that Evil. As <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> have exulted in their torments, not that they were insensible of them, but because their souls were possessed with

                     <p>The <hi>Reason</hi> is, that the Lover, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending no fruition total, no possession intire, supposeth some further good in the object, than what his former enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made him acquainted withall: nor doth he propose to himself meerly a Continuation of the Good he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd; because whoever wisheth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of a Good, considers it not as a thing present, but to come, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently

as a thing which yet he doth not know; for no man can know what is not.

                     <p>IN such spiritual efforts and sallies, the <hi>Body</hi> indeed suffers a manifest, though a grateful <hi>detriment</hi>; but (what's a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der even for wise men) the <hi>soul</hi> acquires <hi>Augmentation.</hi> For, as if she were also definable by <hi>Extension,</hi> being by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>expansion</hi> more diffused than before, she that was originally the Guest of one breast, become's thenceforth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness of two. Confused betwixt two bodies, she scarcely knows for which she was first formed: but as it were sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended betwixt both, she perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms neither. By one Law of Nature she is confined to one body; by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law of the same Nature, <hi>Love,</hi> she is carried forth to animate and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess another, which she strives to make equally her own: so that in this case you are obliged to acknowledge both a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution</hi> and an <hi>Increment</hi> of her So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty. Every <hi>Individual</hi> in love, is thenceforth a <hi>Number</hi>; carrying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with him, as <hi>Antipheron</hi> did, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Himself</hi>: if at least he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be a Number, whom one computes, whom one distinguishes,

whom the word <hi>Homo</hi> alone expresses; an <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> and yet no <hi>Monster.</hi> By a fruitful error, to men in Love, as well as to men in Drink, all objects ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>double</hi>: yet no otherwise than the eyes themselves are double, which have one and the same motion, one and the same sight. Here you see a kind of <hi>pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration</hi> of <hi>Dimensions,</hi> two persons so closely embracing, as to fill up the same space, as to become one, as to destroy their embraces; for, embraces imply a difference. While, like <hi>ovids</hi> He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ah, <hi>Cupid,</hi> thy very bounty is mockery; thy favour, like that of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees in Court, hypocritical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while thou hidest within my breast, what I require to be in my arms. Thou art too propitious in making us one: rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us, that we may feel our selves to be what we would be, different in sex, one in will and desire. <hi>Obstat cupienti, nimium frui.</hi> To have her made the same with my self, whom I covet only as a Partner of my joys, is to prevent

them. This excess of kindness, this assimilation of another to my self, makes me think, I do not embrace my Friend, but a shadow; which always treads in my footsteps, and imitates all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Stand farther from me, O my dearest, who art nearer to me than I am to my self; that I may enjoy that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which consisteth in the knowledge of a Distinction.</p>
                     <p>But, alas! I forget my self, and wish a Contradiction. The same power that makes one of two, makes also two of one. The Arithmetick of Love is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed aswel by <hi>substraction,</hi> as by <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication</hi>: nor do we think that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction a loss, but a <hi>Compendium</hi>; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be more advantage to have our strengths <hi>collected,</hi> than <hi>extended.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing (you know) is so much the more <hi>perfect,</hi> by how much the more <hi>simple.</hi> To be comprehended within no space or number, is the prerogative of the <hi>Deity</hi>: and what is <hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Highest,</hi> can be but <hi>one.</hi> Love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it hath this Divine perfection of <hi>Unity</hi>; so hath it likewise that other of <hi>Self-communication.</hi> For, what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is uncapable of addition or encrease otherwise than by Diffusion or Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution

This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of conferring ones self upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is the only good Mankind can justly call his own, and the first Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Heaven. Other things are the gifts of Fortune, which we can no more give, than the light of the Sun, or the common aer; nay, which we have scarcely right enough to appropriate to our selves. Whoever loves, then, comes neere to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi>; as placing his chief delight in doing good, in making another happy. Hence it is, that as Men of youthful and strong Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are naturally desirou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mankind, since she hath been so indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and bountiful in instituting this ingenious <hi>commerce,</hi> whereby every one both communicates himself, and receives another (for, by Love we do not sell, but <hi>exchange</hi> ourselves) yea transferrs into his own treasury whatever is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and divine in another; being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted heir to anothers riches, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more accomplished by endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in another supplies his own defects. This <hi>Munificence</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> in communicating whatever it thinks good and delectable, is evident even in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of <hi>sensual Fruition,</hi> which being a pleasure consisting in a conjunction not only of two Persons of different sexes, but also of two different Appetites in each Person; <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>please,</hi> and to be <hi>pleased</hi>; and the former of these two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites being an Affection of the Mind consisting in the Imagination of power to please: it necessarily follows, that each p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
