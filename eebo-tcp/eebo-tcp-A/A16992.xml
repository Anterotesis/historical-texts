            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>This doctrine is badde.</hi> Euery man is borne the
Foale of a wild Aſſe, and conceaued in ſinne, and

<hi>Kain, Habel,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> were all three borne after
the image of the earthly: <hi>Kain</hi> continued therein;
<hi>Habel</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> were borne againe. The menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

conſequentes; as how the Lord is the God of
<hi>Abraham, Iſaak, &amp; Iacob;</hi> and not of the dead, but
of the liuing: whereby they muſt be holden to
liue. So Life in his Law, ſignifieth often Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall:
and Death, Death eternall. So by this
place, <hi>Deut. 32. 39. I kill, and I make aliue; Aben
Ezra</hi> noteth, that Death, and life after it, is cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught. And this reaſon is rendred of many
<hi>Rabbines,</hi> why <hi>Moſes</hi> neuer nameth Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
though all his doctrine tendeth thyther;
euen becauſe the world then all prophane, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15222:6"/>
skant heard of one God, and hardly beleeued the
Creation, was to be allured by open and plaine
thinges, firſt vnto the worſhip of the one God:
and that being done for Earthly bleſsinges, they
might afterwardes be drawen eaſily vnto the
Eternall: Vnto which, if directly they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the ſtrangeneſſe would make them reiect all.
So, <hi>Moſes</hi> hideth his minde in the Paradox of
<hi>Adams</hi> preſent fall, with manifold turnings of the

<hi>Huchal</hi> may be taken for a Beginnig, or for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
But the matter telleth, that God was
called vpon long before that, in the firſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
and therefore, Beginning could not be
then: wherefore, Corruption muſt be meant
there, by <hi>Huchal.</hi> So <hi>Dauid Kymchi</hi> the King of
Grammarians, doth take it in his Rootes, for
Corruption. So in <hi>Breſhith Rabba,</hi> the fallinges
away from God, are reckoned in the dayes of
<hi>Enoſh,</hi> of the Deluge, and of <hi>Babel.</hi> The <hi>Zoar,</hi> and
others, the moſt of <hi>Iudahs</hi> name, hold the ſame:
<hi>Arias Montanus</hi> hath both. The Greek-He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15222:6"/>
knowing why <hi>Moſes</hi> hid his minde, they
turned it fit for Heathen, <hi>Then men hoped to call
vpon Gods name.</hi> All who incline that way, haue
great defence by Grammer, and much authority;
ſome of Hebrewes, more of others. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will require Corruption; not a Beginning of
Religion, to be meant there: As in the ſpeach
continuing the Narration (after the Catalogue
of the Fathers) it is manifeſt; how the Sonnes of
God, ſaw the Daughters of <hi>Adams</hi> Sonnes, and
ſo choſe Wiues of a ſtrange God: Otherwiſe,
<hi>Moſes</hi> telleth not when apoſtacie from Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould fall.</p>
            <p>11 If at <hi>Enoſh</hi> birth, men began to call vpon
God; <hi>Seth</hi> vpon that occaſion, would not euer
haue named his ſonne Sorrowfull <hi>Enoſh;</hi> nor
<hi>Moſes</hi> haue ioyned preſently thereupon (after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Fathers) the falling away. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
likewiſe name Life. My digreſsion would
be too long, if I tooke examples of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the minde, from the Prophets, and from
the Greeke tranſlaters. I will now proceed vnto
the next.</p>
            <p>12 <hi>Kenan</hi> is hee: Konen, To Lament, might
be the roote, for his name. Twiſe ſpeaking of one
thing is vſuall, for vehemencie; as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.
<hi>Mene, Mene:</hi> So theſe two names, <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and
<hi>Lamentation,</hi> teach, that they lamented the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of their Workes, and of the Earth, which
God hath curſed.</p>
            <p>13 Ma-hahal-El, <hi>a</hi> prayſer of God; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15222:7"/>
what comfort ought to be in ſorrow; the
ſeeking of Gods prayſe, and glory for the world
to come. An other Notation, Mahal-Le-El,
God bringeth a Confuſion (by water,) is well
agreeable to the Argument. So, thy Wine, is
Mahul, Confuſed (with water.) That is fitteſt
for the continuall threatning of the Flood; to
ſhew the curſe vpon the Flood. So that this
name comprehendeth the drift of all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>14 <hi>Iared,</hi> is in the playnneſſe (caſting away
no letter) <hi>Deſcending:</hi> as betokening a downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
in the behauiour of men, without hope of
goodneſſe to any bettering. Such as deriue this
name from Radah, to Rule, go twiſe further then
they neede: The Argument calleth for no ſuch
matter; and, that <hi>Etymologie</hi> ſhould firſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
which hath beſt agreement in the Letters,
when nothing for the matter diſagreeth; and not
any farre off ſought out, when one at home is fit
onely.</p>
            <p>15 <hi>Enoch</hi> ſignifieth, <hi>Dedicated, Appoynted
vnto.</hi> If <hi>Kain</hi> had called him ſo, the name had
been of no praiſe; but as in one appoynted for the
wicked world; now it is the beſt as in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
vnto God. Hee is in number, the ſeuenth
(as any may reckon) from <hi>Adam:</hi> and alſo,
as the Holy ghoſt noteth, for an higher purpoſe.
The prouidence of God may be ſweetly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
in continuall calling of vs to conſider the
Sabbath, by his diſpoſing of great matter graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15222:7"/>
moſt often by ſeauens. So <hi>Moſes</hi> was from
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſeuenth. The time of his life is
wonderfull, matching in yeares the dayes of the
Sunnes yere. 365. A matter moſt pleaſaut to teach,
what recompence commeth by walking with
God. If his aſſumption had not been recorded; yet
the number of his yeares would haue cauſed cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
admiration, what kind of man he ſhould be.
Hee walking with God, was doubleſſe a moſt
zealous Preacher of righteouſneſſe, and told of
the Flood to come. S. <hi>Iude</hi> eloquently frameth
an Oration for him, by the matter, as Oratours
may lawfully doe: thus it ſtandeth, <hi>Iude 14. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Lord commeth with his holy thouſandes,
to execute iudgement againſt all men, and to reproue
all the wicked of them, for all their workes which they
haue committed; and for all their hard words which
wicked ſinners ſpake againſt him.</hi> This is a moſt
ſweete Oration, framed from <hi>Moſes,</hi> for this our
holy Father. In the Flood God ſhewed iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and as on <hi>Sinai</hi> hee came with thouſandes
of his Holy-ones; ſo doubtleſſe at the Deluge,
againſt men that caſt oft, and ſcorned trueth of
Religion, and holy Patriarchs admonitions, and
liued wallowing in all badneſſe. Alſo, the tearme
<hi>Behold,</hi> may haue a cloſe glaunce at the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Methuſelah:</hi> Then firſt, <hi>Enoch</hi> walked
with God, as a Prophet and holy Teacher.</p>
            <p>16 <hi>Meth, <hi>He dying,</hi> V, <hi>then;</hi> Shelah, <hi>He
(God) ſendeth:</hi>
               </hi> what? the matter ſpoken of,
iudgement vpon the wicked. The Scripture is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15222:8"/>
full of cloſe glaunſes: And well might <hi>Enoch</hi>
name his Sonne ſo, as <hi>Iared</hi> gaue him a name fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his euent. While <hi>Methuselah</hi> liued, the
Flood came not; few dayes after his death it
came, when he had skant begun his laſt yeare of
969. For memory of the phraſe, the Iewes ſay,
that he lay vpon the Arke: For, being iuſt, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
not; onely eight were in the Arke; and he
could not haue his full yeares 187. to <hi>Lameches</hi>
birth, &amp; 182. thence to <hi>Noahs,</hi> &amp; his 600. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
but as vpon the Arke. This is the meaning
of their fable, the ſhewing how his age reached
into the Flood. And I thinke that the mockers
which S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of, skoffed the prophecie
conteined vnder his name, when they ſaid, <hi>Where
is the appearance of his comming? For ſince the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dyed, the world continueth in the ſame ſtate.</hi>
Now the Fathers all, and his Sonne, dyed before
the Flood: and for the ſadneſſe of that, hee gaue
to his Sonne the name <hi>Lamech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17 <hi>La-Mech,</hi> of <hi>Mach, <hi>Striking. Tubalcayns</hi>
               </hi>
father, that would kill a man in his wounde, had
the ſame name, as a Striker: but this man was
ſtroken with all calamities: Hee ſaw <hi>Adam</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to duſt, <hi>Seth</hi> ſet in his reſt, <hi>Enoſh</hi> taken with
ſorrowes of death, <hi>Kenan</hi> lamented by mourners
in the ſtreete, <hi>Mahalaleel</hi> depart thyther where
Angels prayſe God, <hi>Iared</hi> deſcend to the low
partes of the earth, <hi>Enoch</hi> taken vp; and knew
that he ſhould die before his Father, when he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Noah, the Comforter.</hi> Whereas ſeeing his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15222:8"/>
Father liued vnto the Flood, without propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
knowledge, that he ſhould die before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hee, not <hi>Noah,</hi> ſhould haue been thought
the Comforter. And the ſaddeſt Oration that
could proceed from a broken heart, is that which
hee maketh at <hi>Noahs</hi> birth, ſaying: <hi>This is hee
that ſhall comfort vs, concerning our workes, and
concerning the ſorrowes of our handes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the earth which GOD hath curſed.</hi> So
<hi>Lamech</hi> giueth ſadneſſe; as his Sonne, a remedie
to ſorrow.</p>
            <p>18 <hi>Noah,</hi> the tenth, hath his name arguing
that <hi>Lamech</hi> ſpake Hebrew; as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the
Notation, <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Naham.</hi> Great matters are
to be conſidered in him: Hee was long a ſingle
man. When hee was 480. the ſpirit of Chriſt,
not recorded euer ſince the firſt day of man, to
haue ſpoken to any (ſauing to the curſed <hi>Kain,</hi>)
neuer to any for effectuall Saluation, ſpeaketh
to <hi>Noah.</hi> Therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> talking of Chriſt
his Diuinitie, had not an auncienter open record
ſince the ſpeach to <hi>Adam,</hi> to talke of, for Chriſt
his open full ſpeach ſpeaking vnto men, though
the other nine were illuminated with prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
knowledge. <hi>Noah</hi> is 500. before he was a
Father, or maried; as we may gather: That ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
his great feare of Gods iudgementes;
farre vnlike his ſonnes now adayes, giuen as
Horſes, to all voluptuouſneſſe, and not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for their owne moſt certaine deſtruction.
Twentie yeares before hee was maried, hee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15222:9"/>
had a warrant, that his houſe ſhould not periſh.
His breathren and ſiſters yet would not take that
warning, for all that <hi>Lamech</hi> and <hi>Methuſelah</hi> both
could doe, beholders of the Arke, and witneſſes
doubtleſſe of the wtath no come. <hi>Lamech</hi> lyued
not out the whole to 120. yeares, as <hi>Methuſelah;</hi>
but dying before his Father, gaue a further war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that he ſpake as a Prophet, touching the
Flood. The three witneſſes, were a full condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the wicked world. The further Stories
of <hi>Noah,</hi> may better be fetched from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> then abridged by any mans wit.
This much I thought good to ſpeake ſeuerally
of theſe ten Fathers: ſome thinges common to
them all, may well heere be ioyned; as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp; long life: and neare the ſame, commeth
the compariſion of their ages togeather.</p>
            <p>Their Religion was perfect and ſinceere.
They knew the Creator to be<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. ver. 1, 3.</note> one GOD; and
that the Sonne ſhould bruſe Satans power; and
that the Spirit was a perſon coequall and coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
All that <hi>Moſes</hi> recordeth for vs, touching
thoſe times, wee may know that they knew, by
the ſpeaches vttered in <hi>Iob</hi> before the Law:
<hi>Eliphaz, Zohar, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Elthu,</hi> ſpake no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then the Fathers:<note n="*" place="margin">For they had not the Law to reach them, but were taught from the fathers, as they had bin.</note> For they ſpake ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all Religion; whereby wee may be ſure,
that the firſt, came not ſhort of them, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<hi>Adam</hi> knew the natures of all thinges,
the creation of the viſible thinges, and the vnui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
the fall of Angels, and their eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15222:9"/>
the corruption of mankind, being
the ſeed of the Serpent, and a generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
And as <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth, that <hi>Elohim</hi> ſayd;
<hi>Let Vs make man:</hi> So hee knew that, and why
<hi>Elohim</hi> was a forme plurall, for GOD. It were
groſſe to thinke that the <hi>Cabaliſtes</hi> (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<hi>Elo him, El-hem, They be one God,</hi> in
<hi>Bachai</hi> vpon <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.) ſhould know more then
<hi>Adam,</hi> for names. And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> vpon <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras
Tillim,</hi> bring in God talking with <hi>Adam</hi>
as he gaue names, &amp; asking; What is my name?
To whom <hi>Adam</hi> ſayd: Thou art <hi>Elohim,</hi> and
<hi>Iehouah.</hi> Whether God by expreſſed word na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
himſelfe <hi>Iehouah</hi> and <hi>Elohim,</hi> or gaue <hi>Adam</hi>
wiſedome ſo to doe; we ſee that the names were
knowen from the beginning: For the Serpent
nameth <hi>Elohim</hi> to <hi>Euah,</hi> and turneth preſently
the forme plurall vnto Gods prophanely, ſaying:
<hi>Yee ſhalbe like vnto Gods, that know good and euill.</hi>
Which pluralitie, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah</hi> referred to
the holy Trinitie. There the Greekes in the
Serpents word <hi>Elohim,</hi> the ſecond time tranſlate
very learnedly, Gods. And ſo doe the <hi>Talmudiſtes</hi>
hold it meant, in <hi>Maſſeceth Sopherim, Perk.</hi> 4.
And we may be ſure, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah</hi> were
not ignorant of Satans thoughts, when by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
they found him out. Now when <hi>Euah</hi>
bare a Sonne, ſhe ſpake voyde of all doubt, to the
Vnitie, <hi>I haue poſſeſſed a Sonne by Iehouah, by the
one Eternall:</hi> yet we may be ſure that ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the ſpeach of the Trinitie, <hi>Adam wilbe like
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15222:10"/>
to one of VS now.</hi> The late <hi>Iews</hi> haue Satans
darkneſſe, which will haue that tearme <hi>VS,</hi> to
be ſpoken of Angels. The Angels were not yet
ſpoken of in all <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtyle, and therefore they
could not be meant by any of his tearmes; but as
<hi>Elohim</hi> was vſed for the Creator onely, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
natiue logique would ſtretch it no further
there: and <hi>VS</hi> the plurall, to be as <hi>Boreica,</hi> Thy
Creators in <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12. 1. a miſticall ſpeach, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and cited euen of <hi>Rabbi Bochai</hi> the Iew: a

            <p>
               <hi>Moreouer,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> knew a difference in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
betwixt <hi>Elohim</hi> the tearme of Might,
and <hi>Iehouah</hi> named of Beeing ſimply by him
ſelfe, and giuing a Beeing to all his workes and
wordes; and therefore neuer vſeth the tearme <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi>
before the Creation had his full beeing,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4: So wet may be ſure, that <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Euah</hi> knew the difference betwixt <hi>Iehouah</hi> and
<hi>Elohim.</hi> The Serpent nameth not <hi>Iehouah,</hi> but
onely <hi>Elohim,</hi> as a name of bare Might, and the
forme whereof her might peruert to Gods:
Hee trembled to conſider the eternall trueth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to giue performance of Mercie and Wrath,

            <p>And this ſeemeth to be the reaſon, that Satan

<hi>Adam,</hi> who knew not vpon what Pillers the
Earth could be faſtened in the middeſt of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
Ayre and Water, but by Gods power, knew
him to be <hi>Adonai,</hi> though occaſion was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

not be vnknowen to <hi>Adam,</hi> though in later
times more names to expreſſe Gods nature were
ſeene needfull by the eternall Spirit. The Vnitie
and Trinitie being thus knowen to <hi>Adam,</hi> hee
would deliuer it ouer equally to his Sonnes, to
<hi>Methuſela</hi> and <hi>Lamech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Redemption: Hee confeſſed that
hee was naked, and was afraide; hid himſelfe, as
needing one to bring him into fauour: and knew
that hee who ſhould ouercome Satan, being in
mans nature, was to <hi>die,</hi> as all of <hi>Adam:</hi> and muſt
recouer himſelfe from death, and muſt reuiue
<hi>Adam,</hi> and muſt reſtore all, fallen once to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
and know that none but God, could doe
this much: And this hee beleeued, and therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
named the Woman <hi>Life.</hi> And for the moſt
vnlikely part, of death, hee had Sacrifice to ſeale
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15222:11"/>
aſſurance of that; and requiring an open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that euery Sabbath, that day being ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for that vſe: Whereby wee muſt needes
know, that when that was performed, which in
that day was repreſented, the day muſt be altered.
And as the Skinnes of the Beaſtes couered his
body; ſo the Carkaſes burnt, repreſented whoſe
Death ſhould couer his Soule with Iuſtice, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the giltineſſe of ſinne. <hi>Moſes</hi> was to
ſpeake ſhort or theſe matters, that the prophane
ſhould not trouble them ſelues with that, which
they would neuer beleeue. Doubtleſſe <hi>Adam</hi>
knew that the moſt Holy ſhould annoynt the
Humanitie, with the dwelling of the Godhead
in it, and ſanctifie himſelfe for <hi>Adam</hi> and his
faythfull Sonnes; and muſt be called by the name

courſe of Nature, could not but know, that the
liquor of Spices was the fitteſt to repreſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
thinges by an Oyntment made of it. And
ſeeing it was moſt needfull that hee ſhould be a
great Prophet, wee may ſay well with the <hi>Iewes;</hi>
that hee ſaw the lot of his Sonnes through all
ages: And God would hide nothing good for
the Vineyard; nor would doe any thing, but hee
would reueale it to his Prophets. And although
hee liued not to ſee <hi>Henoch</hi> taken vp, hee might
well know it; and <hi>Iared</hi> might vſe his counſell

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15222:11"/>
in Deuine <hi>Sem:</hi> in <hi>Iapheth,</hi> that the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament

aluſion <hi>Iapheth,</hi> and <hi>Iapheth will perſwade:</hi> So,
Hotte Countries dwelling, by <hi>Chams</hi> houſe, by
his name <hi>Hotte.</hi> And as <hi>Noah</hi> ſaw their whole
ſtate; ſo no doubt <hi>Adam</hi> did as well as hee: and
they all beheld the dayes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and knew that
hee ſhould redeeme them on Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> And
<hi>Rambam</hi> recordeth that, which no reaſon can
denie, how the <hi>Iewes</hi> euer held by tradition, that
<hi>Adam, Habel,</hi> and <hi>Kain,</hi> offered where <hi>Abraham</hi>
offered <hi>Iſaac,</hi> where both Temples were built:
on which Mountaine our Lord taught, and on
that alſo he died.</p>
            <p>All that, <hi>Moſes</hi> figured at large: and that the
new Teſtament openeth in ſubſtaunee they
knew. And ſeeing they be our Fathers, and Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of Wiſedome in their names, fayth, feare
of God, and yeares; wee ſhould in our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bring backe the Ghoſpell vnto them, as they
foreſaw it, and forbade to ſay, Who can goe vp
to Heauen to bring <hi>Chriſt</hi> downe? or who can
goe into the deepe of the Earth, to bring <hi>Chriſt</hi>
from the dead? But they knew (as I touched
both, in the Incarnation) that the Sauiour in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<hi>Ioſhuang,</hi> in Greeke <hi>Ieſus,</hi> was God dwelling
in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and iuſt <hi>Habel</hi> ſhewed his death, and
<hi>Henoch</hi> his aſcenſion. And in theſe few poyntes,
Deuinitie ſtandeth; in the Trinitie, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that all iuſt went hence vp to ioy at Gods
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15222:12"/>
Throne. All this the Heathen heard of, and the
Scribes held it ſure: But, that God was to dwell
in Chriſt; and that hee ſhould by death ouer-him
that had the power of death, they deſpiſed to
hold that in knowledge, bending their mindes
to earthly benefites.</p>
            <p>Theſe meditations I hold profitable for all,
who by ſtudie will of them ſelues multiply them:
and a Child knowing theſe Stories, ſhall paſſe
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in ſound Wiſedome, to feare God, till
the Body returne to the earth, and the Soule to
God that gaue it: To whom with the Sonne,
and Holy ſpirit, be all prayſe, honour, &amp; glory,
both now and henceforth for euermore. Amen.</p>
