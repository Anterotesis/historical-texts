            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Prest by Necessity, they kill for food;</l>
               <l>Man undoes man, to do himself no good.</l>
               <l>With Teeth, and Claws, by Nature arm'd, they Hunt,</l>
               <l>Natures allowance, to supply their want:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49645:3"/>But man with Smiles, Embrances, Friendships, Praise,</l>
               <l>Inhumanly, his fellows life betrayes,</l>
               <l>With voluntary pains, works his distress,</l>
               <l>Not through Necessity, but Wantonness</l>
               <l>For hunger, or for love they bite or tear,</l>
               <l>Whilst wretched man is still in arms for fear.</l>
               <l>For fear he arms, and is of arms afraid:</l>
               <l>From fear, to fear, successively betray'd.</l>
               <l>Base fear, the source, whence his best passions came,</l>
               <l>His boasted Honor, and his dear bought Fame:</l>
               <l>The Lust of Pow'r, to which he's such a slave,</l>
               <l>And for the which alone, he dares be brave:</l>
               <l>To which his various projects are design'd,</l>
               <l>Which makes him Generous, Affable and Kind:</l>
               <l>For which he takes such pains to be thought wise,</l>
               <l>And scrues his actions, in a forc't disguise:</l>
               <l>Leads a most tedious life, in misery,</l>
               <l>Under laborious, mean Hypocrisie,</l>
               <l>Look to the Bottom of his vast design,</l>
               <l>Wherein man's Wisdom, Pow'r and Glory joyn;</l>
               <l>The Good he acts, the Ill he does endure,</l>
               <l>'Tis all from fear, to make himself secure.</l>
               <l>Meerly for safety, after fame they thirst,</l>
               <l>For all men would be Cowards if they durst:</l>
               <l>And honesty's against all common sense,</l>
               <l>Must men be Knaves, 'tis in their own defence,</l>
               <l>Mankind's dishonest; if you think it fair,</l>
               <l>Amongst known Cheats, to play upon the square,</l>
               <l>You'le be undone.â€”</l>
               <l>Nor can weak Truth, your reputation save;</l>
               <l>The Knaves will all agree to call you Knave.</l>
               <l>Wrong'd shall he live, insulted o're, opprest,</l>
               <l>Who dares be lesser Villain, than the rest.</l>
               <l>Thus here you see, what Human Nature craves,</l>
               <l>Most men are Cowards, all men should be Knaves.</l>
               <l>The Difference lyes, as far as I can see,</l>
               <l>Not in the thing it self, but the Degree:</l>
               <l>And all the subject matter of Debate,</l>
               <l>Is only who's a Knave, of the first Rate.</l>
