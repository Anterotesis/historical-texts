         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Booke also, is so necessary for this time, and so excellent a peece of worke, as cannot be spared, nor red too often, nor too much praysed, and shall be such a myrrour to looke in, that euery vnlearned Souldiour, beholding the same with eyes of iudgment, shall at the first sight behold his owne ignoraunce, and become a leader of the ignoraunt multitude, the which before did it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

            <p>And now, to tell you how thys Booke came to my handes, it is to be vnderstood, that a Gentleman called <hi>William Garrard,</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the King of Spayne fourteene yeeres in his warres, drew and made this same Booke, with great iudgement &amp; good leysure, and comming into England, in short time after sickned, and before his death, sent the sayd Booke to Sir <hi>Thomas Garrard</hi> Knight, vnto whom he was a very neere kinseman. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hauing regarde to the seruice of her Maiestie and his Countrey, and seeing the time required the publishing of the same, conferred with mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same: praying me, to correct the faultes of the Booke, the which I haue doone with good consideration. Confessing, though somewhat I haue seene and red, beside my experience in the warres, that neuer to thys day came such a Booke into myne hands: for goodnes, for plainenes, for perfectnes, &amp; true demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, hoping that no man of iudgement, but will yeelde due commendations to the dead deuiser of thys large and worthy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and that the reading of the same shall so please, &amp; content, all that shall behold it, that they shall giue their common consent, that the Booke is worthy the embrasing to be red, to be knowne, and the directions therein to be followed. The worke it selfe is sufficient to winne fauour, and perswade more good matter, then any Booke that euer I sawe touching the arte of warre, to the reach of myne vnderstanding, as knoweth Almighty GOD: who send you all happines. 1590.</p>

But a ready Souldier will alwayes foresee that the toutch-hole be so wide, as the Pouder without in the Pan may haue free concourse to that within the Peece, thereby to hasten more speedy discharge, considering a Souldier can not haue leasure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to proine his Peece at al times, but must of necessity vse a great dexterity.</p>
               <p>But since I am fallen into the speech of a quicke charge, and nimble discharge, I will by the way declare the opinion of certaine Nations therein.</p>
               <p>Experience of late daies hath taught vs, that those Nations which follow the warres, inuent euerie way how they may endomage the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in all their enterprises, but especially in Skirmish, which for the most part consistes in shot, and by such as can with the eye of his minde make an assured leuell, and with a nimble discharge, both choose out and kill his enemie.</p>
               <p>And therefore those Souldiers which in our time haue bene for the most part leuied in the lowe Countries, especiallie those of <hi>Artoyes</hi> and <hi>Henault,</hi> called by the generall name of Wallownes, haue vsed to hange about their neckes, vppon a Baudricke or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or at their girdles certaine Pypes which they call Charges, of Copper and Tyn made with couers, which they thinke in skirmish to be the most readiest way. But the Spaniard dispising that order, doth altogether vse his flaske.</p>
               <p>The French man, both charge and flaske. But some of our English nation, their pocket, which in respect of the danger of the sparkes of their Match, the vncertaine charge, the expence and spoile of Pouder, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity of wette, I account more apt for the show of a triumph and wanton skirmish before Ladyes and Gentlewomen, then fit for the field,

securitie, so some bring in a custome of too much curiositie in arming Hargabusiers, for besides a Peece, flask, Tutch boxe, Rapier and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: they load them with a heauie Shirt of Male, and a Burganet: so that by that time they haue marched in the heat of the Sommer or deepe of the Winter ten or twelue English miles, they are more apt to rest, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> readie to fight, whereby it comes to passe that either the enterprise they go about, which requires celerity, shall become frustrate by reason of the staie they make in refreshing themselues, or else they are in daunger to be repulsed for want of lustines, breath, and agilitie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in mine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, specially a shirt of Male, which is very dangerous for shot, if a number of those small peeces should be driuen into a mans body by a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</p>
               <p>The furniture due to a pikeman besides his pike, rapier and dagger, consisting of a common Corselet, hauing a Coller, Curiat, Tases, backpart, Poldrowes, Wambrases, and Burganets for the head, for that they be sufficiently knowne, because I will not be ouer prolixe vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular point, I will onelie say thus much more touching the pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he ought to haue his Pyke at the point and middest trimmed with handsome tassels, and a handle, not so much for ornament as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Souldiers bodie from water, which in raine doth runne downe alongst the wood.</p>
               <p>Euerie Souldier ought to carrie his Hargabuse, Pike or Halberde, vppon that Shoulder and side, which is outward in rancke, for that side which is discouered inward is more defended by the general order that is kept, then any of the other. Which order of carying Armes, is not onely ready and commodious to vse at all occasions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth make a gallant shew, and a generall forme of good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and true prospect: a thing most necessarie for a man of valour to vse in all his doings.</p>
               <p>Hee ought likewise euer to haue good regard to weare his weapon of like length the other Souldiers vse, which in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6010:9"/>
doth make the rancks to be of one iust line, and in shew of a seemely and streight proportion, causing the whole band to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a braue and singular grace.</p>
               <p>A Souldier ought euer to retaine and keepe his Armes in safetie and foorth comming, for hée is more to be detested then a Coward, that will loose or play away any part thereof, or refuse it for his ease, or to auoid paynes: wherefore such a one is to be dismissed with punishment, or made some abiect Pyoner. Therefore during his seruice and after his returne home, let him still be wedded to his weapons and armour, that when hee is called vpon againe to serue his Prince, he be not enforced to furnish himselfe againe with new Armes, sometimes old, of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value, and lesse goodnes: as some Souldiers now a dayes to their great discommendation do vse. A custome altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the true exercise of Armes, and varying from the rule of other warlike Nations, which make true profession of Armes: amongst the which the Spaniards and Zuitzers at this day are to be commended, the one for obseruing an apt, sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and warlike choise therein, and the other for that they beare all sortes of Armes with great aduantage, both in length &amp; strength, the which vnto them becomes very familiar through the ability of body they possesse.</p>
               <p>Those Souldiers which can not endure the toile and trauaile to beare Armes of defence, namely the Pikeman and Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier are made subiect to receiue both blowes and death by the handes of their Enemies, or through their disaduantage to take a shamefull flight, or at the first encounter to remaine their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners. Therefore it is very necessary for a Souldier to take paines in daily practise, and to acquaint himselfe throughly in the exercise and carryage of Armes, whereof hee ought to vse practise, specially of those that bee offensiue, and in those which ordinarily wée are accustomed to carrie, as the Rapier, and Dagger, Pyke, and Halberd, with such like, without making open and apparant profession of the practise thereof, but secret and seuerall from the wide sight of the world, that afterwardes hee may put the same in practise to his greater aduantage and commendation.</p>
               <p>Finally the Halberdier, who is armed either with Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine or Corslet, ought of dutie to attend with his Halberd when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6010:10"/>

               <p>There bee yet another sort of light armed Pikes, which only haue the forepart of a Corslet and a Headpéece, as is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Riuet, or a good light Iacke, or plate Coate: these some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be sent amongst the forlorne hoope of Hargabusiers, to defend them from the inuasions of Horsemen.</p>
               <p>But touching shot, I would wish our Nation, being men of strong constitution of bodie, to beare a Peece betwixt the boare of a Caliuer and a Musket, the which with smal vse they would be able to wéeld very well at the armes end, which would cary a great aduantage in skirmish: the which like vnto the Harga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, they might (as I said before) exercise, and with a galant and assured raising vp the crooked end of the stocke to his breast, hauing before hand fitted the Coale of his match to giue quick &amp; iust fire, wherof euer he must take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certain measure, must then discharge amidst his modest trauerse, to his greatest aduantage, and to endomage his enemies: which done, he must first fold vp againe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Besides these foresaid weapons I would not thinke it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, to haue in a band certaine Targets of proofe to march in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> front, which were very necessarie to defend a ranck of men in a streit lane, passage, breach, or other place from the enemies shot, they all closely and in a low order marching vnder the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and shade of them: as in askirmish I saw put in practise, when <hi>Cassimire</hi> did march with the States Armie vnder Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1578.</p>

               <p>A Footman that is a Souldier, ought aboue all thinges to bee obedient to his Captaine, and Officers, and neuer abandon his Ensigne, nor bee absent from his companie without leaue or speciall let.

               <p>If wordes of aduertisement do passe ouer from rancke to rancke alongst the marching band, let him deliuer those words plainly and with diligence, which the Captaine giues ouer to be pronounced from mouth to mouth, as to <hi>Passe Parole</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>

               <p>If any enterprise be made in the night, let him not only keepe his match close from open shew, or falling sparkes, but be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and keep silence, to the intent that through his negligence and noise their actions be not discouered.</p>

or else if his suddeine inuasion require not present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement, he may deferre the report thereof vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the next Rounde, vnto whom he must from point to point declare what he hath séene and heard.</p>
               <p>During the time of his <hi>Sentinel,</hi> hee ought to keepe him selfe very close, wakefull, secrete, and without noise or rumour, his match close and sure from seeing, and his péece readie charged, loaden with her Bullet, and proind with tutch pouder.</p>
               <p>If the Round or any other Officer come to search the watch &amp; <hi>Sentinels,</hi> when he doth first heare or sée them approch, let him so soone as he doth perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, demand with a lowd voice, <hi>Qui vala?</hi> Who goes there? to which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> answere is made, Friends, and that they draw néerer, then let him call to them and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that all the whole troupe, but onely one with the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woord, to make present stay, vntill the woord be giuen. And if at the same instant another Round should come an other way, let him cause the one of them to pawse and abide still, vntil he haue receiued the woord of the other, that thereby he may avoyd the inuironing snares of forrayne or priuie enemies, which might by that meanes surprise him.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this respect let him take great care, especially before a Towne besieged, or about the circuit of a Campe, and that he alwayes remember to receiue him that giues the word at the end of his Péece or Pike, and out of danger, hauing his match ready in his Cocke, ready to giue fire, thereby to reward him with a Bullet as an enemie, if hee giue a wrong word, or entertaine him as a friend if hée giue the right: for vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of giuing the word, many <hi>Sentinels</hi> haue lost their liues, and suddaine surprises and <hi>Canuisados</hi> haue bin giuen.</p>
               <p>If in the night Arme be giuen in the Campe, he must make repaire immediatly with his Peece and Furniture so his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, where he shall be emploiedas occasion doth offer.</p>
               <p>That he may be the more ready at any sodaine Arme, lying in a Towne in Garrison, and being furrierd and lodged in a house, hee ought to haue all the night burning in his Chamber by him a Candle or Lampe, or at the least his fire so well raked vp as hee may light a Candle at the Coales with a match of Brimstone, or otherwise: that thereby he may the more spéedily not only find his Armes (which of purpose he ought to lay readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6010:11"/>
in an ordinarie place) but also be better able to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and kindle his match with all spéede.</p>
               <p>Note that a Souldier in garrison being furrierd in a house, is allowed the best bed and chamber saue one, faire shéets, board clothes, plates, napkins, towels, dressing of his meate, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at the Table, oile, vineger, salt, mustard, candle light, fire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whilest a Souldier is in the Campe, hee ought neuer to lye out of his clothes, his Peece ready charged must lye by his side, his furniture at his girdle, which is his Flaske, Match &amp; Tutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxe, his Rapier very ready, and his Poynado likewise at his Girdle, which if they should be so monstrous Daggers, or such a Cutlers shop as our English Fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sers are accustomed to wear, they would be both combrous in cariage, and troublesome to his companions, and to himselfe, specially when they lye in their Cabbines.</p>
               <p>A Souldier in Campe must make choise of two, or thrée, or more <hi>Camerades,</hi> such as for experience, fidelity, and conditions, do best agrée with his nature, that be tryed Souldiers and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie friendes, to the intent that like louing brethren, they may support one another in all aduerse fortune, &amp; supply each others wants. As for example, hauing marched all day, and comming at night to the place where they must encampe, one of them choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out the dryest and warmest plot of ground he can get in the quarter, which is appointed to his band for lodging place, doth kéepe all their Clokes, Armes and Baggage, whilest another makes prouision with one of their boyes, in some adioyning Uillage (if time and safety from the Enemie doth permit) for long straw, both to couer their Cabbin, and make their bedd of: during the time that an other with a litle Hatchet, which with a Lether Bottel for drinke, a litle Kettle to séeth meat in, and a bagge of Salt, which are to be borne of the Boyes amongest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baggage, and are most necessarie things for encamping, doth cut downe forked Bowes and long Poales to frame and reare vp their Cabbin withall, and prouide timber or firewood, if it be in Winter, or when neede requires, whilst an other doth visite <hi>Viuandiers</hi> and Uictualers (if any follow the Campe) for bread, drinke, and other eates, if otherwise they be not prouided by forrage or Picorée, and makes a hole in the earth, wherein
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6010:12"/>
hauing made a fire, stroken two forked stakes at either side, and hanged his Kettle to seath vpon a cudgel of wood vpon the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that for rost meat he makes a spit, woodden Gawberds, &amp;c. And whilst thus euery one is occupied about their necessarie occasions at one instant, they may in due time make prouision for all their wantes, and by meanes of this league of amitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, enioy a sufficient time to rest their wearied bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, which otherwise would be hard to be done.</p>
               <p>Therefore I iudge it very requisite, that the whole number vnder the charge of a Desiner or chiefe of a chamber, should link themselues together in perfect friendship, and aswel in skirmish and fight aide one another, as in all other actions, by which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible knot they should receaue wonderfull commoditie.</p>
               <p>It importes much that a Souldier should bee tractable, for a man cannot imagine a thing either more ingenuqus or better, then due and conuenient ciuility. Therefore let him accustome himselfe rather to be of a Saturnine and seuere condition then a common skoffer, and an ordinarie make sport, that he may continue in friendship with his companions, and continually remaine in their amity.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he is much to be commended, which aptly with facilitie and great dexterity can bee conuersant with euery one: wherein if a man doe not with great iudgement very circumspectly gouerne himselfe, he shall for the most part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the euill will of those in whose company he remaines. The which dealing is of great importance, aswell for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of his life, and proper honor and credite, by which meanes the one and the other doth hang in Balance, as also for that he can not, being drawen away with debates, apply himselfe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to follow the warres and seruice of his Captaine: the which ought to bee his chiefest obiect and end. For discord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men of this Honorable profession, doth hasten, and occasion very much the destruction of their well doing, and altogether hinder whatsoeuer they take in hande, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the suspicions, discordes, despite, and other respectes, which of necessity are commonly accustomed to growe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>
               <p>Besides, he must be so moderate in spending his wages, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e be not constrained before the midst of his pay, either to folow
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6010:12"/>
the spoile, or borrow of others: whereof springeth a naughtie reputation and a great discredite: yet notwithstanding he must not suffer himselfe to be noted for a couetous person, or as some say, the enimie of himselfe: that is, by sparing nigardly, to finde a great want &amp; extremitie in necessarie things appertaining to his apparell and victuals, whose expences ought chiefely to be in galant Armor and Furniture.</p>
               <p>Note that the pay and wages which he receiues of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and Treasurer, must not be taken or thought to serue or supplie for any other vse, but to sustaine life with victuals, kéepe him apparelled, and maintaine his armes. Therefore ought it to be gouerned discréetly and orderly at all times, in what place so euer he shall remaine, either in the campe, ciuile cities, or in his proper house, as well to kéepe himselfe in health, as chiefely to make apparant to his Captain the noble motion of his mind: So that pricked forward by this spurre of honor, and not for any other extraordinarie and base occasion, a good souldier is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually constrained to winne credite, despising all other dealing which ariseth for hope of commoditie and gréedy gaine, the way to make a man estéemed to carrie a base minde, and almost not disagréeing from brute beasts without reason. For these priuate souldiers which séeke by such meanes as be extraordinarie, to aduance themselues aboue their proper pay, without doubt giue an euill presage of themselues, and so euil, that it should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to applie their time in some other sort, as about merchandise and other occupations, rather then follow the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable exercise of Armes, which is altogither grounded vpon a noble mind, valiant courage, and extreame trauell of bodie.</p>
               <p>He must dispose himselfe to be verie diligent in what exercise or enterprise soeuer he shall be put vnto, as to make <hi>Sentinel:</hi> wherein it is conuenient, as I haue touched before, that he be verie vigilant when it is his lot to be commanded thereunto, that in doing the contrarie, there succéede not a most rigorous chastisement by leauing his bodie dead behind him, as it may verie well fall out, and to whom it may be said, I left him as I found him, since sléepe is the image of death.</p>
               <p>A good souldier ought continually to accompanie the Ensigne, and haue speciall regard, that the same fall not in danger of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising by the enimie, and that he endeuour himselfe by all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6010:13"/>
meanes without anie respect of danger to preserue and recouer the same: for the losse thereof is a perpetuall shame to the whole band. And therefore he ought at no time to abandon the same for anie occasion, but lodge himselfe so néere it as he can, to the intent that amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest, if it be possible, he may be one of the first at all rumours of armes, and sodaine alarums, aswel by day as night. And being armed with the weapon he caries, hauing conducted his ensigne to the place appointed, by the head offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, he may in the sight of his captaine (shewing a moderate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse and desire) bréed an opinion of his courage and valor: so that when occasion doth offer, his captaine amongst the rest may make speciall choyse of him.</p>
               <p>He must for no occasion absent himselfe, or go to anie far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant place about anie enterprise or bootie of picorée, without the expresse licence of his captaine: for he that is once become a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is now no more his own man, but his vnder whose gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is paid: who desiring to serue his turne when occasions be ministred in time of warres, not hauing his valiant and best souldiors present and readie about him, shal not onely be made frustrate of that he would performe, but sometimes also suffer and sustaine damage, and onely in respect of those which be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent abroad at their owne pleasure, contrarie to the consent and knowledge of the captaine.</p>
               <p>He ought sufficiently to eate, rest, and sléep, whilest time doth permit, to the end he be not called for vnprouided, and that he may the more readily performe all enterprises néedfull, without anie discommoditie or want of abilitie, which commonly do fall out vnlooked for, and vpon the sodaine, for in ordinarie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed enterprises, it is an easie thing to find euerie soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier prouided, but in sodaine surprises not. Besides, I thinke it appertains and is proper to a good souldior, to follow the wars so long as he possibly can, for the increase of his experience. But being constrained to returne into his countrie, or into any citie, fortresse or other place of defence, by reason of some truce, seconded by peace, or through anie other accident, which doth constraine him to abandon the warres: then it is necessarie he fall to exercise that art, wherein he chiefly hath bene brought vp, either in merchandise, handicraft, or husbandrie, or else whatsoeuer, thereby to supply his necessities, to exercise his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6010:13"/>
bodie and to liue honestly: and by that meanes flie idlenesse, a thing most incident to youth: who being altogither igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in treading the steppes of a stayed life (through the small experience he hath of the world, which by tract of time is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by long practise, specially in the exercise of Armes) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades himselfe he shall win credite and commoditie through the meanes of insolent actions, which altogither ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: through rash and prodigall brauerie, which oftentimes torments innocent families and poore parentes: and through galant garments and sumptuous attyre, whereby they grow banckrout: so that they are brought in time (being intangled in those swéete traps sauest with sharpe showers) to run headlong into a thousand &amp; most miserable ruines. Therefore good souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ought specially to endeuour themselues by some commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable industrie, to gaine the good grace of valorous and valiant Captaines, and mightie Princes, the true possessors and fathers of warre, through whose authoritie and commendation they may be preferred: for the faith and assured credite of all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and worthy souldiers doth depend vpon men of valor, and not of the weake authoritie, small valor, and great abuse of the ignorant &amp; common people, called the beast with many heads. Therefore let them euer obserue the honor of the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: for since that in time of warres euerie souldier of good conditions doth sharpen his wit, &amp; willingly adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture his life, not respecting toyles or trauell, expences or danger, but doth imploy his industrie to preferre his princes profite, by great reason in time of peace he ought to be aduanced and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them: and much the more for himselfe, is to vse all his indeuour to compasse his owne commoditie, and thereby make manifest his proper vertue, the which doth not consist in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of valour and discretion: but in the true acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, agréeable to his honorable profession.</p>
               <p>A souldier must apparell himselfe in the warres with cloth of fresh coulour, profitable and commodious: amongst the rest, red, murrey, tauney, and scarlet makes a galant shew in the fielde, which he must weare to honour the Militarie profession, and for his most fit and apt wearing, and not to hinder the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his members, as doth our great bumbasted and <unclear>bulstered</unclear> hoose, which not many yeares since hath béene vsed: but in stéede

               <p>He must be willing to put in proofe all things commanded, without making replie, or denying any one thing, or deferring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore it is requisite he practise himselfe first of all to be a perfect priuate souldier, before he be drawne to the desire of bearing office, which were to set the cart before the horses, and worke by contraries: For first we must learne to guid, and then is it lawfull to gouerne. But it is no new thing, nor to be maruelled at, that some men are accustomed to obtaine charges by vnlawfull and indirect meanes, I will not say, that they vse them accordingly. Therefore to merite a charge, it is alwayes farre more excellent and more conuenient to winne them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, then to enter thereinto by intrusion: for those that doe not beg them do feele in themselues their proper sufficiencie: where contrariwise they are a heauie burthen to those that know them not, although with great instance they haue procured &amp; sought for them. Which want and vnwarie dealing in this our age, peraduenture procéeds of the small néede the world séemes to haue of good souldiers at this day, and of the little experience most men in our time haue of the art of warre, or at least wise our superiours are blinded with the sweete baites of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, chiefe cause of such elections. Yet this notwithstanding we ought to retaine with al reuerence, the honour &amp; credite due to an expert and good souldier, who with diligence being sought for &amp; selected, as neere as is possible, ought to haue the most chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charges, and expeditions giuen to their gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. To the end those affaires may fal out happily, to the honor of their nation &amp; profite of their Prince, whilest he doth follow the wars, or is in Campe: let him carrie as little baggage with him as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6010:14"/>
that he may be the more nimble and light of bodie, spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in his iourney or marching, and the more apt for all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises.</p>
               <p>During the warres (or else not) he ought to weare in some conuenient place of his garments, that is most apparant to the view of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> band, a token, red crosse, or scarfe, whereby in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes and other attemps he is to be knowne of what part he is.

But if otherwise they carrie the said token and marke loose at their necke, brest, armes, or any other place, it giues matter and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of doubt touching their sidelitie: specially being but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, since that not being made fast, they may easily cast away or hide the same in time of perill or doubtfull fight: which suspicion ought diligently to be remoued by him which carrieth an entire desire and full intent to deale truly &amp; loyally.</p>
               <p>He ought likewise to beware, vnder paine of great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for running from one campe to another, for what occasion soeuer shal vrge him to it, but is bound to serue that partie with which he doth first place himselfe, euen vntill the ende of the warres.</p>
               <p>I haue séene it likewise not lawfull, that a captaine should receiue into his seruice a souldier that is departed from another Captaine of the same faction, and this was obserued, to the end that souldiers should be kept obedient and stedfast vnder their Ensigne, where first they haue placed themselues. Prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that their Captaines intreate them honestly and well, which is to be decided by the Marshall of the field. Neuertheles, so often as a souldier is forced of necessity to leaue the warres, he ought not to depart out of his seruice, but by the speciall ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his captain, accompanied with an autentike pasport of his good seruice, so shal he shun many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusions which are great occasions of sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dals &amp; infinite troubles, by means wherof he may
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6010:15"/>
fréely make relation of the good seruice he hath done, and boldly shew himselfe before any mans face.</p>
               <p>He ought to take special care, that he be not the beginner and occasion of any discordes and mutinies, neither consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, what reason soeuer should lead him thereunto, since that such peruerse proceeding doth not agrée with the worthie, noble, and famous art of war, which is a dangerous discredite to such malefactors, and for the most part without any recouerie doth procure the generall ruine of many valiant Captaines &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie armies. And therfore ruffians and common hackers that liue idle in the stréetes at home, and follow the wars onely for spoile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are most vnfit to make souldiers, for experience makes manifest, that they are the onely cause of mutin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s, so that one such is able to corrupt and disorder a whole band. Wherefore a good souldier ought rather to applie himselfe to suffer things impossible, then commit so great an error, for by the one great honour and praise shall redound vnto him, and by the other vile act, he shall gaine manifest blame and assured death: for such notable errors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remission, or any pity (as in part I haue before touched, and her easter in the marshal Lawes shal set downe) are seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be chastised.</p>
               <p>When the companie doth disband, and euerie souldier is to go to his lodging or cabbin, it is verie requisite he stay vntill such time as he see the Ensigne lapt vp and lodged, to the intent, if he be of the gard about the same, that night he may attend to do his dutie, otherwise he may lawfully depart, &amp; thereby shun the shamful name of a stubborne, licentious &amp; disobedient perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>He must learne to vnderstand the assured sound of the drum, thereby to know alwayes whereunto he is appointed, and what thing is to be done and obeyed, which of duetie is accustomed to be done, since that with this instrument souldiers are giuen to vnderstand, during the warres, what things be necessarie to be executed. One thing besides is most necessarie for a souldier, which is, that he learne perfitly to swim, both for that waters ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not alwayes be passed with wading, neither at al times boats &amp; bridges can be conueyed with the campe, by reason of naughty passages, as also in diuers enterprises a man is both more safe and more bold, knowing what he can do: whereof young <hi>Shelley</hi> made a most famous proofe, who at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victualing of <hi>Midleborow,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:6010:15"/>
when their nanie was assaulted by the Flushingers, hauing all his companie slaine, swam a shore with his armes, being the last man left aliue a shipbord: and as the Spaniards at the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the arme of the sea, when they went to besiege Siricke seas. Besides the notable attempt made at the great riuer of <hi>Alba</hi> in <hi>Saxonie,</hi> the yeare 1547. where the Imperialists had so famous and glorious a victorie.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let no man perswade himselfe, that the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and particular experience which belongs to a perfect good souldier, can be perfectly and duely obtained by anie other way, but by a continuall delight, exercise, and obseruation: for no man doth bring any worke to perfection, whereof he hath not the art: euerie art doth spring of experience and knowledge, and knowledge doth arise by meanes of studie and continuall practise. Militarie profession being then more perfect and aboue all other arts, consequently it is necessarie we vse in the same greater studie, and more continuall exercise then is to be vsed in any other art: for somuch as it is a most ancient and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sentence: All arts do consist in exercise: and therfore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at idle times it is verie fit and necessarie for a souldier, to practise and exercise himselfe amongst his companions in the campe, in running, leaping, throwing the barre, or such like, to make him actiue, and to auoid such idle pastimes as souldiers commonly now a daies vse, contrarie to all good order.</p>
               <p>Besides which, as I haue partly touched before, euery priuate souldier ought not only to be well able to vse the weapon he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth withall, but also sodainly to vnderstand all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of his gouernors, whether it be by voice or sound of drum or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and to know how to maintein himselfe in order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking aray, not onely marching, but also turning in a troupe or retyring. For that souldier which knoweth his dutie how to behaue himselfe in the campe, in watch, scout, &amp;c. and likewise in marching, turning, retyring, and fighting or skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing to obserue the order prescribed by his captaine, may be called a trained and old souldier: whereof if he be ignorant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he haue bene twentie yeares in the warres, he is not to be estéemed a souldier. But in these exercises the sergeants and officers are daily &amp; duely to instruct generally and priuately ech souldier, which officers ought of necessitie to haue knowledge

               <p>To knit vp this our first discourse, he that findes himselfe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and well inclined to exercise this most excellent professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, ought with all modest humilitie, &amp; good intention, frame himselfe to a perfect obedience, aswel to obserue order, a thing so conuement and necessary in this exercise, as also to execute that which shalbe commanded him by his captaine.</p>
               <p>Before a souldier bind himselfe to serue in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>and, he ought aduisedly to consider, and expresly to perswade himself, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnder an expert, valorous, and worthy captaine, seldome or neuer our trauaile in well doing is forgotten or lost: when as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth chance vnder those that be vain, vitious, and of small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, who through want of perfection and practise, dee not know the merit of the valiant and valorous acts of a good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: so that consequently they neglect all toyle &amp; trauaile done in any honourable enterprise. Therefore it behoues a souldier to make a good choyse at the first, for after whatsoeuer hée be, he must still obey him: and likewise alwaies haue respect, and carrie a reuerence to the iustice of martiall lawe, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the same, though they be of base condition, since both by the law of nature and nations, they ought to be obeyed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, and particularly knowne, and had in memory of euerie priuate souldier: for thereby both horesmen and footemen are kept in perfect order.</p>
               <p>But aboue all things a souldier ought not to forget his dutie and deuotion toward the goodnes of our Lord God, and towards the holy catholicke Church and our sacred christian religion, by which the true gift of vertue, valor and fortitude, and all good things beside, we most certainly receiue, and are assured to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whilest our determinations be lawfull and honest. And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6010:16"/>
for that a souldier being subiect to a thousand dayly dangers, it behoues him continually to liue as he dare die, and oftentimes to reconcile himselfe to God by confession, penance and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and receiue the benefite of the other heauenly and moste blessed sacrament.</p>
               <p>I haue bene somwhat more copious in this first discourse tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a souldier, then perchance I meane to be in any of the rest, by reason this is the first step and degree a man ought to set his feete vpon, before he mount the throne of perfect gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in martiall affaires: for if a souldier can obtaine tried experience in this first point, he may with more ease ascend the other, since this is onely the ground-worke of all the rest.</p>

                  <p>Now then a corporall with his squadron of 25. or more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the discretion of the captaine, lodging togither with his companie, must prouide generally for all their reasonable wants of wages, match, powder, and other munition, and must instruct them how to handle their weapons.

And if it happen that any fault is committed, his part is not violently to punish the souldier himselfe, as heereafter is touched: but to make it knowne to his captaine, who must not neyther, as some rashly do, reuenge himselfe, but communicate the same with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall or his prouost, who onely haue vnder the generall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to punish: and this due course of iustice shal be more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the souldier, and bréed lesse cuill will in them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and officers: generally in these respects, the corporal must touching the foresayd causes or such like, or if any souldier be sicke, hurt or absent, by way of imprisonment or death, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly make report thereof, finding any thing worthy rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and spare no man, but deliuer ouer the trueth to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, the sergeant from hym, or togither with the corporall to the lieutenant, &amp; he or they all ioyntly to the captaine, who is to take order in the cause.

Likewise he must prouide for oyle, for candles for the night time, for lanterns and such like at the sergeant maiors handes, or of some others, who haue charge to prouide for those things, &amp; are accustomed to distribute the same. If he kéep his <hi>corps de gard</hi> in an open and plain place or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: he must conform the company of his squadron, according to the order appointed by his betters: and with the most spéedy &amp; artificial maner that he can, must arme and fortify with ditches, trenches, and <hi>Sentinels,</hi> the place where he must make his abode with this his small band and troup of souldiers, the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies furie, or any surprise he might assault him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, considering that sometimes, yea and that very often, being set vpon, the <hi>Sentinels</hi> and <hi>corps de garde</hi> be repulsed and haue their throats cut, to the great disturbance &amp; vniuersall domage of the whole campe.

In such cases he ought therefore to imploy the best men he hath, that he neuer rest deceiued in a matter of so great

importance, since that of those which be but meane souldiers, or as I may well terme them, negligent persons, nothing else is to be looked for at their handes, but error, losse, and danger.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, he must at the least cause the third part of his squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron to remayne &amp; stand continually armed at all poynts, both night and day, consisting of greater or lesse quantitie of people, according as the suspition doth argue the neede of them to be small or great: the Hargabusiers hauing their flaskes and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture tied to their girdles, and their peeces readie charged, that vpon a sodaine they may contend by skirmish, according to needfull occasion, and readily resist the enemy without slacking or any remission of time, vntill all the squadron be put in order.</p>
                  <p>He must be very circumspect, that the rest of the souldiers weapons, and principally his owne, be laid vp and placed in such order, one kinde being deuided from another, that in one instant they may be speedily and readily armed: the which hée must daily put in practise, and inure them withall, by fained alarmes, by speciall commandement and of set purpose, which be most necessarie to be practised before-hand for diuers hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and important respectes, worthie to be had in good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let him haue and carie a continual care, that their armes neuer remaine in any confused order, the which if hée should suffer, he should find no doubt to be a great want: but the same may be preuented, and made easie, by accomodating the Hargabusies in ranck one by one, vpon a boord or banck: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pikes and corslets, in order reared and hanged vpon some wall or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apt place in the <hi>corps de gard,</hi> and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ech particular wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon and péece, euery souldier should haue a proper and speciall mark before-hand made whereby to know the same.

valorous act vnrewarded: by which meanes he becomes scared, fauoured, obeyed, and beloued of all the armie: euen so on the other side, the good natured souldier must euer haue respect to keepe the bondes of modestie towards his superiour, and yéeld many thankes to God, that he hath giuen him so iust and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Captaine and General, towards whom he must alwayes yeeld like obedience, that the sonne doth to the father, being bound so to do by the diuine law, without shewing himselfe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the order of generall iustice, nor ingratefull for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued benefites, but continually by his good guiding in the one and the other, giue his Captaine iust cause to loue and like wel of him.</p>
                  <p>Souldiers be euer bound to obey the iustice and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their superiours: and the superiours likewise to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the obedience of their souldiers, whilest he doth sée him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe honoured and obeyed of them, either in déeds or words, in earnest or dissembling.</p>
                  <p>Although the general or captaine were a right <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> so that his lawes be obeyed all things fall out well: wherefore a souldier ought with al his indeuour to be obedient to the law, with his whole heart loue his Captaine, and feare him with al his force.</p>

                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> being cruell, couetous, miserable, and an cracter of taxes, through iustice was beloued and obeyed.</p>

if he be wise, wil restraine him from doing any thing pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marshal law, or to the misliking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Captain, and so ought to rest in continuall doubt, lest his euill deeds come to light, and to the cares of the superiour officers, that with the sword of iustice, the rod of reuenge, and the scepter of rule, may and will chastice him. If he remember this, no doubt he will liue modestly, in obseruing those lawes which are commanded by the Captaine and Generall: for it behooues a souldier stil to liue in suspect, that spials and intelligencers be euer present at his elbow, which no doubt will accuse him for his euill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: of which sort a Captaine and Generall haue great store to kéepe the Campe and souldiers in continuall suspicion and feare.</p>
                  <p>A souldier must euer show himselfe grateful to his Captaine in words and déeds, by remaining patient in his actions, and not to vse complaints in his spéeches, suffering with quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation the penurie of victuals, if the Campe should want, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through fault of the Generall, barenesse of the countrie, or otherwise by his negligence, or through the malignitie of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that neither by water nor land corne and victuals can be brought to them in safetie: wherefore he must weare out this want patiently, &amp; not with a melancholike countenance, make apparance of a wrathfull and furious person, by charging of the chiefetaine openly with those wants: for which procéeding, let him assure himselfe that he shalbe estéemed of euerie man an insolent, seditious, and impatient souldier.</p>

                  <p>Disobey not the Captaines or Generals precepts, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the martial lawes: neither affirme that any thing is euil wrought which is done, for it appertaines not to a souldier to reprehend: but to a counsellour to admonish.</p>

be gouerned and commanded of a Captaine, which is perchance of no ancient house, as an infinite number of fond and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous fellowes do now adayes: who being rude and rusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call clownes, disdaine to be guided by captaines, whose valour and vertue, and not whose ancient stocke, hath giuen them that degrée, being ascended to so hye honour by the steppes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: for I haue seene some that but lately haue left their needles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their hammers, and their spades, hauing scarce séene a small skirmish, but that they presume themselues to be expert soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and will say, what is my captaines valour more then mine? Is not he of base degrée as well as I? Not considering that we be all sprung out of one stocke, but that our valour and vertue hath made vs noble, as hath béene verified in diuers Princes, kings and Emperours, as <hi>Caius Marius, Lucius Quintus Cincinatus, Attilius Collatinus, Valentinianus, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianus, Francisco Carmognuolo, Iulian Romero, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon,</hi> besides diuers others moe, which at this day doe liue, being exalted by the degrees and way of vertue, to the tippe of such praise as is most conuenient to worthy Captaines: and therefore no souldier ought to disdaine to be gouerned by such, whose vertue hath made noble their minds.</p>
                  <p>And moreouer, if anie such a one that is become Captaine, either by meanes of fauour or vertue, be blotted with some vice or defect, yet we ought not to disobey him: for <hi>Caesar</hi> was ambitions, great <hi>Alexander</hi> a drunkard, <hi>Hanniball</hi> vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, cruell, and without Religion, <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> by linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring estéemed a coward, <hi>Marcellus</hi> rash and vnaduised. And therefore although thy Captaine be accounted most vicious, yet if he know how to gouerne and guide his charge, a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier must obey him, and neither calumniously reprehend him, nor corruptly imitate and obserue his vices, but duely and directly fulfill his precepts: so that no souldier or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of what great house soeuer, ought to disdaine to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of such as haue risen by vertue, to the height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, neither any man, how great of linage soeuer he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6010:23"/>
come to superiour, whereof the great Emperour <hi>Caius Iulius Caesar</hi> may be example: who being borne of a noble house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Romans, was first chosen <hi>Pretor in Spaine</hi> (a base office in respect of his worthy parentage) as being reputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any greater office, he did beare the same with a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind, accepting it as a meane and beginning to make him ascend to the highest of Fortunes whéele, vnto the which the valor of his worthy minde did aspire.

                  <p>TO knit vp this first discourse of Militarie directions, and martiall lawes, special care must be had to prouide one man amongst the many scores of souldiers, that may gouerne and direct in spiritual causes, who ought to be wise, learned, honest, sober, patient, and of exemplare life: who must offer vp dayly sacrifice of thankes for his whole companie, must instruct them to be penitent, confessant, and restore to euerie man his right: to communicate in Catholike and Christian manner, so often as they can, chiefly at speciall times appointed by the Church, and before any dangerous attempt, to feede them with holesome foode of learned instructions, wherein they may learne how to liue, and so consequently to teach their companies their dueties towards God and their Prince, and to giue ghostly counsel and spirituall reliefe vnto the sicke, wounded, weake in bodie or in conscience, and that such be well armed with spirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that is, with good knowledge and good liuing, readie to perswade them manfully to withstand their enimies, the flesh, the diuel, the world and desperation, putting them in sure hope through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> equitie of their cause, their conformitie to the church, and their firme faith in our sauiour Iesus Christ, to enter into the campe of euerlasting life, where they shall ride amongst the souldiers on white horses, clothed in white and pure silke, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with bright triumphant garlands, as the scriptures do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

                  <p>THose that are appointed to carrie pikes in aray of rankes or battell, must know that pikes amongst all other weapons that belongs to souldiers, is of greatest honor and credite: and truely, whosoeuer doth carie and manage the same weapon wel and with good grace, doth make a verie beautifull and pleasant shew to the beholders, and chiefly when it is caried vpon the shoulder, sustained and supported with a good grace, and the hand that doth sustaine it be on that side the shoulder where it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and with <hi>il Gombedo alto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They must likewise be aduertised which march in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ranckes, if they be vpon the right side, to hold their pikes continually in marching in the right hand, and vpon the right shoulder without euer changing it: and so likewise being vpon the left side of the ranck, to hold it alwayes vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> left shoulder: those that be in the midst of the ranckes haue libertie to vse that side y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is best for their commoditie, either vpon the right or left hand, and to moue their pikes from shoulder to shoulder at their choise and pleasure: It is true that the iust carying of the pike of those that march in the midst of the ranckes, is to hold it vpon the left shoulder, &amp; to carie their right hand behind vpon their dagger, or vpon their side, and so generally all, as well they that be in the midst, as those that be in the head of the ranckes are to obserue this order, to carie that hand which is at libertie behind them, or vpon their sides. Let him march then with a good grace, holding vp his head galantly, his pace full of graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and state, and such as is fit for his person, and let his bodie be straight and as much vpright as is possible, and that which most imports, is that they haue alwayes their eyes vpon their companions which are in rancke with them, and before them, going iust one with the other, &amp; kéeping perfite distance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing error in the least pace or step, and euerie pace and motion with one accord and consent, they ought to make at one instant time. And in this sort all the ranckes entyrely are

to go, sometimes softly, sometimes fast, according to the stroke of the drum. The héele and tippe of their pikes would be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holden, both of length and height, as néere as is possible, to auoid that they fall not out to be by bearing them otherwise, like vnto Organ pipes, some long, some short. The measure &amp; proportion thereof, to hold the héele of the pike is this. It is necessarie for him to haue an eye to the rancke that doth march before him, and so carrie the butte end or héele of his pike, that it may be iust ouer against the ioynt of the ham of the souldier, that in march shall be straight before him: and so euerie one from hand to hand must obserue the proportion of that height, that is right behind vpon the ioynt of the knée, for by doing so they cannot commit errour, carying in their march that legge that is vnder that arme that sustaines and carries the pike of iust and euen proportion, by mouing their pace right vnder the staffe of the pike, going in their march, as I haue said before, iust and euen, with a galant, stately, and sumpteous pace: for by doing so, they shalbe estéemed, honored, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince euerie officer through his continuall exercise and dayly diligence in executing his charge, doth attaine vnto perfite experience by dayly practise, which is as it were conuerted into nature: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he which determines with himselfe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted sufficient and of abilitie, to discharge the place of a good Sergeant of a band, with a forward intent to learne and bée thorowly instructed, ought first to be a souldier that hath séene much, and a Corporall of good experience, according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of my first booke: In which two roomes it is verie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that he haue tasted and bene present at great diuersitie of seruice, &amp; warlike enterprises, and to carrie a resolute mind to delight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exercise of this office, to the end he be not found therin irresolute and ignorant: and that likewise he faile not in the readie performing of any enterprise, when martiall affaires do call him forth to put the same in execution.</p>
               <p>First of all it is verie requisite that he haue most perfitely in memorie, the number of all the souldiers of the band, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly with what weapons they are armed, what quantitie of Cors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He must euer plant the best armed in places most necessarie, as at the front and backe, the right and left side of a square. The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6010:33"/>
first ranck in ordinarie long marching, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> targets of proofe must go in as a readie rouer and bulwarke against the enimies shot: next to them the musketyres, then the hargabuziers, and after them the armed &amp; light armed pykes: amidst whose ranckes he must at al times place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ensigne, garded with halberds or bils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; then againe the light armed and armed pikes, hargabuse and musket-eares, and last of all targets of proofe: by this equalitie of deuision, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole band at one instant shalbe readie to receiue any suddain surprise of the enimy. The sergeant carrying these things in his mind, hauing laid a distinct plat, he may verie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily varie their forme and order as he shall be appointed, and as the situation of the place doth require, or the accidents of warre do constraine.</p>
               <p>He must neuer worke vnwarily, or at al aduentures, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to no determined purpose, as those that doe not remember the perfite rules and reckonings of their office, whereof there be now adayes ouer many, for when it is necessarie for them to alter their order, and that perforce they must quite change the forme and fashion that then they obserue, they know not which way to begin. Therefore to the end his order and ranckes may be to the purpose duely and directly changed, and with facilitie disposed: let him euer disseuer and deuide one part of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons from another, causing euery one to turne and enter into their ranckes and order by themselues, so shall he procéed in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away, setting forward, and intermixing one sort of rancks within another very orderly. And thereby the ful proportion of his ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shalbe framed, as he hath determined, or as it is deuised by him that commands, either in marching forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or in turning without disorder, by 3. 5. 7. or 9. in a ranck, as the Lieutenant, Captaine, or Sergeant Maior appoints.</p>
               <p>He ought euer to beware that in ordering the rancks, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the souldiers their places, that they begin not to make debate or stomake one another for dignitie of place, the which doth oftentimes fal out to their great anoy and domage, and the officers tedious toile, for in enterprises of great importance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the presence of the inuading enimy, some vaine glorious fellowes are accustomed to striue for the chiefest places: the which roomes by all reason &amp; of duetie appertaine to the best ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and not to any others, whose vnrewly rashnes may be the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6010:34"/>
ruine of the whole band. Therefore fit and conuenient places are to be obserued with humilitie, the naked in their places, and the armed in theirs: but to touch one point which we haue alredie spoken of, I iudge it most conuenient that the armed (those for skirmish excepted) must remaine in <hi>Maine</hi> stands and battailes, as some say, so abide by the stake, who ought to be so wel armed as they may beare and support the blowes of their enimies, and resist any furious charge, either of horsemen or sootemen. Whereas besides their well ordered ranckes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they be armed they make a more galant shew: giuing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to thy owne people, and discourage to the enimie, and in proofe are more profitable then the disarmed, who remaining in their roomes, the contrarie succéeds.</p>
               <p>The Sergeant of the companie must haue speciall regard when victuals cannot be had for money, by forage or otherwise, to make repaire togither with the clarke of the band, to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal munitions, that his companie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The like ought he to vse, touching powder for the Hargabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syres and Musketyres, lead for bullets, match for them to burne, and ech thing else whereof they haue néede, to the end they may alwayes remaine in order, and be verie well prouided and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as néere as is possible, &amp; as is most conuenient and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the souldier that to gaine a place of more account, he will spare his pay to arme himselfe the more brauely. He must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise haue diligent eye, that the said munition of match &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be conserued warily from wetting, and kept with a speciall spare from vntimely spending: for this prouident precept doth import verie much in all enterprises, by reason that the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Sergeant, touching this necessarie foresight &amp; care, hath bene the cause that the shot haue not bene able readily to performe their duties according to the appointed determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or as necessitie did require, by reason of their vnwarie kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their munition in wet weather, or their generall want through vain mispence, by which meanes many &amp; most notable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6010:34"/>
shame, and totall ruine of a whole companie or campe. Therfore it is most expedient that the Sergeant, togither with the seuerall corporals, do diligently and narrowly examine, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, search, and view the proper flaskes, tutch-boxes, pockets, &amp; other places where the souldiers are accustomed to carie &amp; kéepe their powder and match, and peruse diligently all those things without negligence, faining, or fauouring: diuers haue receiued great ignomie &amp; shame in their office, for want of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thereof: wheras by carying a contrary care, they haue bene vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally wel thought of, and commended of al good souldiers and valiant Captaines. Therefore as occasion doth serue and offer, he may admonish, put in minde, and reprehend with dexteritie the souldiers vnder his charge and guiding. To him it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to lay his helping hand about al things necessarie for his companie, as well in prouiding for them, as dispencing, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring necessarie charges, except for the prouision and deuiding of lodgings, which is the office of the Furrier or Harbinger, who ought to be very tractable, diligent, &amp; altogither officious, not being partial to any one for peculiar profite or pleasure, and therfore it is necessarie a Sergeant should know how to write, for it is hard by memorie to discharge his charge.</p>
               <p>The Sergeant must be careful to accompanie, at the houre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the guard to the place of the watch, in going vp and downe alongst their stanckes when he hath placed them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to sée them kéepe due distance, make the <hi>Laumband,</hi> march in straight line, with their ranckes carrie their armes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable proportion: and if vpon pleasure they giue a volée of shot in passing, to aduertise them to doe it orderly with due forme, one rancke after another, as they passe ouer against the Generall, or other great officer or personage, and not in a confused sort altogither, or by péeces.</p>
               <p>When he is arriued at the Corps of gard, and hath placed euery one in order, and prouided for all things necessarie for the watch of that night, he must then giue his aduise and counsell to the Corporals, that they kéepe good order in their <hi>Sentinels,</hi> yea sometimes and verie often, it is good that he himselfe aide them to choose out the most fit places for them to stand in, to the end that the circuit of ground, which for all their safties is to be kept, may be conueniently garded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:6010:35"/>At the ioyning of the day &amp; the night, or somwhat later, he shal secretly giue the Corporals the watchword, with the which they are to gouerne the gard as wel by night as day: the which word by the commandement of his Captaine, he must procure the Sergeant maior to giue him, or of some other that shall haue the charge to giue the same for want of his presence, or in place of this great officer.</p>
               <p>He must arme himselfe in such sort, that he be no lesse apt then any other souldier to be able at time of néed, both to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and offend the enimie: touching which effect, Duke <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Besides, it is necessarie to haue neere vnto him a couple of assistantes at the least, that be practised and good Souldiers, which may be of the number of the Halbardyres that go next his Ensigne, to the end that when hee is constrained to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe from the same, through some vrgent and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie occasion (for otherwise it is not to be permitted) hée may cause one of them take care and charge of his Ensigne, in what accident soeuer might fall out during that time.

For Captaines are accustomed to shew notable and singular fauor to that souldier which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to an enterprise of perill and danger: so that it be capeable of issue and altogither desperate.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this to be accounted for a maruell, for as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is altogither different from others, so likewise the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ceremonies are diuersly managed: if a man may terme those things ceremonies, which of necessitie ought with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be gouerned with great care, art, and industrie: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooues the <hi>Alfierus,</hi> whilest he doth march in ordinance amidst the band, to go with a graue and stately pace, aduisedly and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously ioyned with modesty, and without affectation or vain brauerie: neither eught he to bew or decline his bodie at any time to anie person, that thereby he may represent and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the reputation and excellencie of armes, and the ensigne before his Prince, chiefe ruler, Lord Generall, Coronell, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Gouernour, &amp;c.

                  <p>Let him remember when hée hath bin at any exploite, to bring backe againe into his Quarter, those souldiers hee hath led foorth to any enterprise, vnited and in rancke, marching together behind him, and neuer suffer them to returne disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one by one out of order, which is an occasion of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and brings but small reputation to the Captaine and conductor of them.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is verie necessarie hée knowe how to make a roade and distroie the enemies countrie, the which likewise doth oftentimes appertaine to him to performe: in which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploite hee must beware aboue all thinges, that no souldier in those enterprises disperse or disband themselues, but with an assured good order, for the most part conformable to my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, wherein I set downe directions, how to conduct Souldiers to the skirmish. And particularlie where I declare that he ought to kéepe and maintaine for his people the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest place of situation, wherein he must skirmish, for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly souldiers being in disorder, wearied and loaden with spoile, may bée easilie put to flight, broken and oppressed of the enemies, vnlesse they bée seconded or shaded by some force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able succour.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it likewise most necessarie, that hée indeuour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee apt and sufficient at all times, and in all places to sollicite and negociate for his Prince or Chieftaine, any cause of what weight or moment soeuer, considering that most men are not fit to attempt the performance of such doubtfull and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile causes: for although manie make great estimation of them selues, and presume much by their dailie reading and Theoricke of those weightie affaires, yet do they want and come farre short of that bold and readie practise, which plainly appeares, that the worthy professors of Armes possesse: and

specially in the presence of great Princes, whose Maiestie and reuerence for the most part, doth make cold and bring out of countenance the hoatest and most resolute determination. As <hi>Demosthenes</hi> before <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedone</hi> made apparent, when he was not able to pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thrée woords of a long premeditate Oration, in behalfe of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>

                  <p>This worthie gentleman of a band, this <hi>Caualliere</hi> of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> squadre, and likewise all other professors of warlike armes, ought to carie in mind, that of him and his equals the exercise of Armes is to be applied, and diligentlie to practise the same, to the intent he bée not for want of knowledge dispised of others: and not ignorantlie to dispise them that deserue due commendations, but rather to carie and vse the countenance of authoritie to those persons that merite not to beare swaie and gouernement, then towards forward souldiers.

                  <p>This <hi>Caualliere</hi> must be able also to traine souldiers, to make them march in orderly proporcions, to cast them in Ringes, Esses, Snailes, Hearses, Squadres, to receiue and giue charge, to faine skirmishes, onsets, retraites, and how to order any number of Souldiers, from a hundreth to fiue hundreth, for so manie may be in a band, and vnder one Ensigne, as the <hi>Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Let this worthie <hi>Caualliere</hi> of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> squadre haue then before his eyes such like precepts, and manage of martiall affaires, that he may encrease his owne credite, win his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie fame, fauor of his Prince, &amp; honor of his house and friends,

                  <head>The order of skirmish, how it is to bee gouerned, when it is to bee accepted, and when to bee auoided.</head>
                  <p>IT béeing necessary for euery Sergeant, Lieutenant and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual liere</hi> of the band, to know when, where, and in what order a skirmish is to bee gouerned, when to bee auoided, and when to bée accepted to the benefite of the whole band, regiment, or Armie, I thought good to ioine to those proportions of training, somewhat touching the same: wherein for that there bée sundrie occasions which moue and constraine men to enter into skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, I wil amongst the rest choose out thrée which I iudge most principall and of greatest importance.</p>
                  <p>The first is, when wee will giue the enimie experience and triall of our valour and force, and cunningly to perswade him (by a souldier that yéelds of purpose, or alter sides) to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to some thing which may arise to our commoditie and his domage. Likewise by taking some of his souldiers prisoners, to vnderstand the state of our enemies, the which may bée more aptly termed the winning of aduertisements, the which things is most expedient wée put in practise.</p>
                  <p>The second is, when wée determine to gaine any passage, or any fortresse or strength, which is in the enemies possession, or like to fall into his hands if preuention bee not vsed, and hauing occupied and gained the same, to retaine it for the seruice of our Campe.</p>
                  <p>The third is, when wée are of mind to kéepe the enimie so occupied as hée march not at his pleasure, or that when wée do march our selues he become not domageable to our own people, or to the bagage, or any thing that is ours being of importance.</p>
                  <p>When therfore wée will giue trial or experience of our selues to the enemie, &amp; gaine intelligences, or win aduertisements of him: it is requisite there be election made of a leader, some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <hi>Caualliere,</hi> that is indued with prudent pollicie and noble valour, who must gouerne this skirmish: which leader, must take with him a quantitie of chosen souldiers, &amp; according as the accustomed vse is, must haue culled out of euery band so many as wil amount to the number of 10. out of ech hundreth, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, or some such like reasonable portion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:6010:62"/>When the leader of the skirmish hath made choise of the place and ground (fit for his purpose) wherein hée meanes to méete with the enimies (the which will not be difficile for that he is the chooser, inuentor, and author thereof,) he must then conduct thither a quantitie of good souldiers, with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red array and order.

                        </gap>,</hi> both valiant gentlemen, the one of them perswading the other to retyre from a skirmish, begin to the purpose before mentioned, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their superiours, but by reason the one would not obey, it was the cause of great disorder. He must likewise haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident foresight and be verie circumspect, that like a good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier he go verie warily &amp; considerately into the fight and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, euer watching &amp; attending for his continuall aduantage, to the end that retyring himselfe vpon a sodaine, the enimy may remaine &amp; rest repulsed, amazed, and oppressed, that the whole armie may conceiue and be kept in a good impression, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of victorie.</p>
                  <p>Now this foresaid leader being arriued with the people in the sight of the enimie, he must immediatly with his souldiers, occupie and take possession of the ground, which doth best please him, which is most apt for his purpose, &amp; in effect is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strongest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He must take order y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these hargabussers be accompanied with armed pikes and corselets, without whose fellowship hargab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6010:63"/>
as well all the parts togither, as the number of the souldiers of euer to part by themselues, be like in proportion to the qualitie and force of the enimy, and equal to the quantitie of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the which may be knowne verie well, there by view and discouered by meanes of spies, or by manifest and assured fame. To euerie which part he must appoint a sufficient head &amp; guid, a noble <hi>Cauallier</hi> of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> squadre.</p>
                  <p>Then must he send out certaine souldiers that be most nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and readie to prouoke the enimie, and when they be ioyned in skirmish, he must sodainely increase the fight with sending forth the second part: and then rest a little to behold, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the skirmish may begin to grow whotter: at which time he must likewise send the third troope for a new supplie, and so consequently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ne after another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continue on the incounter.</p>
                  <p>The most fit and apt time when the souldiers must enter the skirmish, make retyre, &amp; giue a fresh onset, ought to be shewed and made manifest by the sound of trumpets to horsemen, and stroke or batterie of drummes to the footemen, from the maine stand, which is placed in some plot of ground, resting vigilant in a forceable squadron, for the sure defence and retrait of those that skirmish: to the end they may both couragiously fight, and the enimie rest confounded &amp; despaire of his victorie, when hée doth perceiue so perfect and pollitike an order. The which for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part makes euerie hard difficultie to be performed with great facilitie, specially in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> discréet &amp; famous exercise of armes.</p>
                  <p>To giue more light to some new inuentions of skirmish, I cannot omit to declare in what sort I haue séene skirmish a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of horsemen Rutters, who comming to the fight in their accustomed squadres, and from thence pricking forward some of the first rankes and threds prouoke the enimie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and when these of the first ranks haue discharged their Pistolets, making <hi>Carier</hi> &amp; being charged, they place the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues againe at the backe of their owne squadre, from whence at the same instant time others of the first ranks do disband themselues, and giue charge vpon the enimie: but being charged themselues of the enimie, retyring, they conuey themselues behind their owne people, which already before them are ranged for their saftie in their square, so that as many more immediatly giuing a fresh onset, by breaking out of the squadre, which is maintained and renued
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6010:63"/>
by this speciall order, doe with maruellous furie force the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, &amp; in this order skirmishing in a winding ring, in round, as is before set downe by figure, do still maintaine themselues lusty and fresh, the which forme of fight may in some respectes serue in this place for an example.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to my former matter, I say, when the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish and fight hath bene maintained valiantly in the front and face of the enimie an houre and a halfe, or else two houres, and that he hath taken some of his enimies prisoners, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof he must very couragiously and whotly procéede, which is to be vnderstood, the winning of aduertisements and intelligences from the enimie: since by that meanes he may haue of them choise and contentation, he may then at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure make retraite and take vp the skirmish.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, to the intent he may retyre with aduantage and with safetie, he must send to sustaine the fight, a fresh band of souldiers that with greater facilitie he may front the surie of the enimie, if there rise desire in them to vrge or pursue him in his retyre.</p>
                  <p>There is one note most necessarie to be obserued in an army, regiment or band, that neither any famous Generall or prince, any pollitike personage, or worthy souldier of estimation, enter into the faction of a skirmish, but rather that the same be guided and gouerned prudently by others of meaner calling. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the enterprise did fall out to the aduantage of the same partie, yet if there should follow the losse of any famous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table person, the same hath not onely bene of great domage, but also hath bene oftentimes of such force, that it hath stroken a terror and feare in the minds of the souldiers, specially amongst those that were not at the enterprise, neither in like cases will it satisfie or suffice them to declare or solemnely expresse vnto them the truth, but that vpon such special losse, they will grow into vnaduised iudgementes and timerous dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>If in case the enimie take the charge and malte retyre, it is good to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order with the <hi>Caualliers,</hi> heads &amp; guids of the skirmish, that as néere as possible they can, they force their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make stay, and that they follow the enimie no further, since that in this point they do not contend to any other end,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6010:64"/>
then to bréede a certaine impression and good opinion in the minds of our owne souldiers, to the confusion of the contrarie part, and to winne aduertisements, if it be possible, the which is all the effect they haue to performe, the which was the onely motion that moued them to attempt this enterprise.</p>
                  <p>Now when he determines to gaine a passage, or any other strong place against the enimie, which will arise to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profite and our owne commoditie, and hauing wonne it, to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine and defend the same: first choise must be made of a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and valiant leader, although it hath often fallen out that without entring into skirmish a diligent captaine or leader, hath with his people taken possession of such passages or strong places. And by this prouidence, it ariseth to be neither difficile nor hard to be defended against the enimie, considering that all such suspected extremities &amp; bands, be accustomed to be strong by nature, whereunto afterwards ioyning some little Art, for the most part they become expugnable. But neuerthelesse if by incountring with the enimie it is requisite he should skirmish, I iudge it verie good that he should rashly go no further, then so farre as the souldiers which he hath sent to the skirmish haue gained.</p>
                  <p>To obserue perfite gouernement, it is neuer good to depart from the order before rehersed, saue onely when he doth sée the enimie bend and shrinke away, in place of aduised stay &amp; polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike retention in procéeding, I the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudge it worthie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to follow the victorie, but for al that, with such consideration and so aduisedly, that their ouer-great courage and carelesse ioy be not the occasion of disorder and confusion, togither with the which prosperitie, he must diligently procure his people to gaine the passage or strong place, to the end if the enimy should go about to succour his flying and broken people, he become not a let and hinderance to his determination.</p>
                  <p>It is verie requisite he likewise note, that when the enimie is so fresh and of such force, that it is impossible to ouerthrow or repulse him face to face: then shall it be to the purpose to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the same euen vntill night, at which time he must vse al the pollicies and stratagems he can possible to performe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: for the onely marke whereat this leader must shoote, must onely be to worke such meanes as he may gaine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6010:64"/>
the passage, and take possession of the strong place, and not to passe the time in skirmish and fight: hauing wonne the same, he must indeuour himselfe to defend and repaire it, that they may be able to resist all the furie and force that the enimie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make, vntill such time as succours come to him from his campe.</p>
                  <p>When he is of minde to entertaine and kéepe the enimie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, to the intent he march nor iourney not at his pleasure, or that if your armie doe march, he worke not any domage to your people, to your baggage, to your munitions &amp; other things of importance: It is verie expedient that the leader of this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish be valiant and wise: who must determine to keepe occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the enimie, that by the practise thereof it may arise to bee profitable to the performance of some other his purposed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
                  <p>After he hath made choise amongst his souldiers of those which must skirmish, he must deuide them as is before rehersed: and he with the rest of the people to him vnited, as néere as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, must march alongst the strongest situation of the ground, &amp; then must send those that are deputed and appointed to the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, one after another to the taile of the enimies battel, against whom they must skirmish and fight, euen as an old beaten dog about some Bul or furious beast doth here and there snatch, bite and turne about him, that in the end he doth kéepe him occupied &amp; wearie him, if not ouercome. When he hath put these things in execution, he must gather togither his people in the best sort he can, in the aforesaid order.</p>
                  <p>If in marching his owne campe doe feare to be assaulted at the backe, or that he hath suspicion of his baggage, or doubts some impediments on the flankes: then must the leader of the skirmish make repaire with his people to that place, where hee suspects the enimie will take aduantage: and march farre off, and with such distance from his campe and his battailes, as he shall thinke conuenient, and as the nature of the place doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to the intent he may bring to effect his determination, and prosecute the same to a good end, the which is to auoid the inconuenience, that the enimy neither hurt nor hinder his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and munition. And in this sort with good order he must follow and accompany his owne people, and with those that be
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6010:65"/>
appointed for the fight, must kéepe occupied and intertaine the enimy stil skirmishing, retyring, and marching as it alwayes fals out and chanceth to him that valiantly defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>Concluding then, I say, that it séemes good and verie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that the skirmish for the most part should be fled and shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, except it be in respect of some of the thrée foresaid occasions, or some such like, which thereunto may be adioyned, procéeding of a practised and aduised iudgement, for it is a verie rash and vnaduised thing to loose men of valour to no purpose, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie in skirmishes doth succéede. And besides the losse of such persons of estimation, which ariseth by reason of rash disorder: Moreouer it hath bene oftentimes séene, that whilest he goeth about to succour one band presently enclosed by the enimie and put to flight (by reason it hath bene negligently gouerned, as for the most part it fals out, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men go to skirmish moued by a fantastical rage, vain ambition, and to smal purpose without a sufficient appointed chiefe or head, or rather without speciall commission from the captaine Generall, the which aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is principally to be noted) there hath such inconuenience succéeded, that an armie hath sometimes bene constrained to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and come to the fight of a maine battell vpon a suddaine, a thing maruellous perillous, and that ought of necessitie to be fled, without manifest aduantage of a perfite and a well practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Generall.</p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:6010:66"/>I am of opinion likewise, that that souldier or worthy <hi>Cauallier</hi> ought to be no lesse then the foresaid, of a practised and pregnant wit, to whom charge is giuen to discouer the qualitie and condition of the situation of the enimies countrie, or the place where he remaines: who after he hath considered of the same, although he that sent him hath not expresly declared him his meaning and intention touching the same, or his ful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yet being conducted to the place, he must with the least shew, rumour or noise possible, cause the people that go with him to enter into ambush, to the intent he be not discouered or disturbed by the enimie, which done, he must warily and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créetly view and ouerview, search and go through euery place, noting out the quantitie of the waters which run through the countrie, the capacitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plains, if therein be marish grounds or not, the depth and bredth of the vales, the roughnesse of the mountaines, their height and capacitie, if they be naked, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with hye or lowe wood, or else plowed and pasture ground: and if there be townes and habitations, whether they be placed vpon plaines, mountaines, or néere the water, whether they be inclosed with wals and fortified or not, and of what bignesse and qualitie of forme they be: and so consequently he shal make note of euerie particular point, as I haue written in a speciall discourse hereunto adioyned, considering that some of these and like particulars, may verie often helpe and do good seruice, and arise to be of great importance. In this selfe sort &amp; order he may very well discouer all the passages and wayes from the time he doth depart, euen vntill he ariue againe, alwayes marking and making aduised choise of the best and shortest: so that he may giue to his prince or Generall a true information and full rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euerie thing, to the intent his Generall may with great reason and to his most aduantage, determine of that which shall arise to his greatest profite, and to the enimies disaduantage: as was by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift obserued at the riuer <hi>Alba,</hi> by the Spaniards at <hi>Sirick</hi> sea, and by that famous Prince <hi>Don Iohn D'austria</hi> at sundrie times, specially when in person the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he returned from <hi>Luxemburge</hi> to <hi>Namures,</hi> he made discouerie of the ground about the prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and States Campe, lying at <hi>Templo,</hi> where by the commaundement of my Collonell the Baron of <hi>Cherau,</hi> I amongst the rest of his owne

                  <p>Now lastlie when it is requisite to disclose and discouer the order and maner which the enimie obserues, either béeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped or in marching, it behooues a good souldier aduisedly to take the view and knowledge thereof, in as good order as time and occasion wil permit. And if in case the enimie remaine firme and encamped, I iudge it verie requisite if it bée possible, to take view of the Campe round about, at leastwise as much as hée can well, taking notice how many <hi>Corps de garde</hi> they kéepe without their Campe, and so likewise what part of the situation thereof doth make it most weake, what part is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, and which part is betwixt both, béeing able to render ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt with good reason of all these things in discourse like a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike and practised souldier: The performance whereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is with more assurance and better brought to passe in the night then in the day.</p>
                  <p>If in case the enimie bée in his iourney and do march, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it verie necessary to discouer in what order they march, and in what manner and forme they haue planted their squadrons, set in order and armed the Rereward, the battaile &amp; vantgard, and both the one flanke and the other, if they haue Artillarie, or that they bée without, and together with this he must discouer the condition and situation of the ground where they march, and which way they bend their course to encamp, where they make <hi>alta</hi> and stay. Hée must likewise search out and diligently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher, whether they march with feare, whether they kéepe good order, whether they make hast: all this as néere as is possible hée must discerne, and with spéede indeuour himselfe to giue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ech particular thing vnto his Prince or Generall, to the intent when the first occasion doth offer, (which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they make stay at their lodging) hée may determine to molest them by suddaine <hi>Alarums, Canuasados,</hi> and other such like surprises or attemptes.

                  <p>First the Pikes must bee drawen by themselues on one side together with the Ensignes, and vpon the other side all the Hargabuziers, somewhat aloofe off distant from the pikes, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to make the hargabuziers march, so many in a ranke as you list, parting them neuerthelesse according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: You may put them from 3. to 12. in a ranke, for it is not often séene that more then a leuen is put in a ranke, how great soeuer the number of the footmen bée, neither in troath ought they to bee more then a leuen, for when they passe a leuen or twelue they are not to bée accompted an aray, but rather a battaile.</p>
                  <p>Hauing then placed the number of the Hargabuziers you shal thinke good of, to bee in a ranke, you shall cause them to march in good proportion, sending foorth one ranke after another, the Sergeant standing still on one side, causing them to passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, iudging by eye-sight from ranke to ranke of all the Souldiers one by one, whether they bee right in lyne, obserue distance, and whether they doe moue foorth of their order and aray, for this is the beautie and importance of an aray.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, the Sergeant hauing speciall respect to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and place at the head of the aray, all the Corporals or <hi>Lancia Spezzata</hi> which carie Calliuers, placing next vnto them the best and the best furnished Souldiers, putting a Drumme behinde the second ranke, that is to say, before the third, placing at the taile of the aray the best and best armed, to the intent the aray may shew the better, forasmuch as when they are deuided into aray, the hargabuziers from the Pikes, and that they turne their faces, then the backe part is made the

front, therefore the backe ought to bée as well furnished as the front, or the head of the aray, as you will please to tearme it: The which if you desire to doe, it is necessarie you put in the midst of the rankes the weakest and worst furnished, aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Sergeant that the souldiers are best furnished, when they haue all sortes of armes and furniments that bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for them, and appertaines to a Hargabuzier, good match, fyer, coall, pouder and bullet, and moreouer <hi>L'az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zino:</hi> And this is to bee obserued with that spéede and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the time or occasion doth carie, and the suspition of the enimie doth import.</p>
                  <p>And in one present time, if the Sergeant haue commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, hee must distribute munition to the Hargabuziers, as bullet, match, or pouder, and to haue a man about him to carrie the munition, and hee afterwardes goe about disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it, and in giuing the pouder, hee must haue a Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell with a small and narrowe pipe, to the intent it may enter into the pipe of euery one of their flaskes, and with a measure that doth holde so much pouder, as hee will giue vnto euerie Hargabuzier at one time, or at twice: and so to euery ranke one by one as they goe passing forwardes, the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant causing to march forward his aray before him, faire and softlie ranke by ranke, by which meanes hée shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them.</p>
                  <p>If it chaunce that hée do not distribute munition at one selfe time, hee shall cause the Pikes on an other side to put themselues in aray, as manie in a ranke as the Hargabuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers shall bee, deuiding the best armed with Corselets, the one halfe to the head, and the other halfe to the backe, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed pikes in the midst, and in the midst of them place the Ensignes with their garde of Halberdes, with certaine Drummes about the said Ensignes, that is, in the <hi>Piazza</hi> or void place, where the Ensigne is to bée managed: those Drummes and Fiftes that you haue, shall march before the Standerd bearers:</p>

                  <p>When they bee well set in order, it is necessarie to cause the Pikes to stay and stand, and the Sergeant hauing staied them, hée shall then go where hée hath first accommodated the Harga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers, and shall cause them to march forward, néere where the Pikes are in order of aray. And the Sergeant hauing first numbred likewise the rankes of the Hargabuziers, and béeing staied where the Pikes, after the one halfe of the Hargabuziers is past, that is, if they bée in all 50. rankes, when 25. bée past, the Sergeant shall enter with his Halberd ouerthwart them, and staying and pressing backe the other 25. rankes, hée shall cause to enter after a goodlie and readie manner, all the Pikes and Ensignes, causing them euer to march forward, and when they bée all past away, vpon the approching of the last rankes of Pikes, hée shall cause the rest of the Hargabuziers to enter into aray, the which béeing done, the aray shall bée faire and perfect, and it will bée good that hée cause them to march and turne thrée or sower times, to the intent they may settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the better, and that they may enter into their pace, their aray, and the vnderstanding of the Drumme, for that makes them more apt to go iust, learning one of an other a stately and conuenient pace, and to beare their weapons of all sorts with a good grace, and specially the Pikes.</p>
                  <p>A good Sergeant must take care to make stay in euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious place, or streit passage, as when they go downe or discend from some Mountaine, at the passage of a foarde or streit bridge, or at a ditch, or a water, or some such other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie and streit passage, that hée iudgeth would breake the aray, as oftentimes is found in marching.

                  <p>SInce there be sundry souldiers and persons, which presuppose they know much more then others, who discommend the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Bissa</hi> or <hi>Caraguolo,</hi> as a thing not necessary amongst the orders of aray: saying that the same is superfluous and of small moment.

               <p>Now the order for him to punish his souldiers in cases wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not guiltie of death, I thinke the most important punishment which appertaines to the Captaine to giue them,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6010:79"/>
is openly amidst the whole companie &amp; band, shamefully to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme them, to take away their money &amp; chiefest garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; so to banish them &amp; send them packing: for to put them to death, or furiously to beate them, belonges to the office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Master of the camp &amp; Marshal of the field, &amp; not to the Captain, for if hée should beate his souldiers, hée should make himself hated &amp; embase him self, &amp; bring his souldiers either to become mutinous or abiects.</p>
               <p>Note, that it is not sufficient only for a Captaine to haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained his companie discréetely, &amp; therin to haue great numbers of good men, which is to say, in warlike affaires valiant men, but aboue all thnigs it is very necessary when hée shall come to blowes &amp; fight, hée should aduenture &amp; performe the same to his manifest aduantage, or else constrained therunto by pure neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, although hée ought to flie the last so much as hée is able, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing this for a generall rule, not to fight either by chance, either for pleasure or for ambition, as many times wée sée done by rash &amp; ambitious chiefes and Captaines.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, hée must worke in such sort, that his souldiers haue very good occasion &amp; apt meanes to win the victorie, &amp; that they be fresh &amp; lusty, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that in fighting they may ouercome: for without these and like aduertisements by tempting fortune, men for the most part both loose, and are ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>It is very conuenient hée procure the hauing of an ample and autentike Patent of his Collonel, with as large woords of fauor as may be, wherein must bée declared at the instance &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what Prince the expedition is made, &amp; so with modestie and prudence hée shall vse the aucthority that is giuen him, but neuerthelesse there, as it behooues him so to doe.</p>

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:6010:79"/>A Captain that must leauy a band, is to make his election and choise of his officers &amp; souldiers, not only approued &amp; sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, but also vse such spéedy march in his expedition &amp; iourney, that hée may ioyne his company to the rest of the armie, at or before the appointed day and place.</p>
               <p>When hée may march by land with his company, let him neuer haue desire to go by sea, hoping to spare cost &amp; shorten time, for by becomming subiect to the indiscretion of the wind, either through long aboad, or some accident by shipwracke or tempestes, there hath risen many times great disturbance &amp; ruine without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, since by this defect many good occasions and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath bin lost and made frustrate.</p>
               <p>Hée ought neuer to take iourney in hand without a guide, the which he must procure to bee giuen him by the chiefe that doth command him, to the intent he may alwaies remain execused &amp; faultles from those errors, that by such defects may or do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arise, which diligence is not only particularly to be vsed, when any iourney of smal length is to be guided: but if any long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to bée made (not being able to do better) hée must circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly haue him alwaies by his side, neither ought to haue him slip away from him or absent, since that euery smal error or going out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way in a iourney &amp; marching, doth displease soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers &amp; warlik persons, &amp; yéelds lesse reputation to the Captain, who ought alwaies to march with them, &amp; to prouide &amp; procure through his aucthority all things necessarie, with the greatest fauor &amp; aduantage possible.

And sometimes he must cause his souldiers to shoot vollées of shot, sometimes all at once, sometimes by ranks, &amp; sometimes mixed. The which vollées vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe or sound of drum or word of mouth by the Captain must be accomplished with celeritie, &amp; closely together &amp; cunningly, &amp; not out of disorder or by péeces, a great while one after another, but vpon their discharge, iointly together, without rumor, noise or tumult they must all charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, &amp; vpon a signe giuen by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>A Captaine may at all times accompanie his band with the sound of Drum &amp; Fift, which must giue order to their continual March and directes: all their other enterprises, vnlesse to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany prisoner, to entrench, make plain the way, to make &amp; carie fagots, baskets, or gabions from the wood, &amp; such like seruile and peasantly seruice, hardly digested of honorable souldiers.</p>

               <p>A Captaine ought to vse all art and industrie to inuade, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domage, and ouerthrow the enimy, specially infidels: and aboue all things to bée franke of minde, and to feare nothing but disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest fame.

               <p>A Captaine must euer take care that his whole charge be still furnished with men, armour, weapons and munitions, with all things néedfull, and distributed at conuenient times.</p>
               <p>He must suffer none through idlenesse to neglect his armour, weapons, and other furniture, whereby he shall grow vnready to seruice at néede, but giue his officers commandement cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly to looke to the same.</p>
               <p>Souldiers should be prohibited from ouermuch libertie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vse whoorehunting, drunkennes, common swearing, quarelling, feighting, cosining, or such like, but that spéedie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is to be vsed.</p>

Besides a band being made of a small number, the treasurers consume much more money amongst the great store of officers, the which ought to be by al meanes possible auoyded of a polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Generall, and of a prudent Prince, to auoyd extraordinarie expence and confusion, which doth easily arise amongst the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of officers.</p>

                  <p>It is requisite he equally depart to euerie one, the quantitie of that prest money he hath receiued, to the intent the Captaine and the officers arise not to be burdened, taxed, and consumed by ordinarie and extraordinarie meanes, and other manifest wayes in spending about those affaires. And to the intent the souldiers may tast of the beneuolence of their <hi>Collonel,</hi> for by that meanes credite is sustained, and his traine augmented, a thing most necessarie to personages that supply so great a place. For it is requisite that men in the beginning be not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for want of necessarie prouision, yea rather to lend of his owne (considering he is to be paid againe) then his souldiers should be brought to any extremitie.</p>
                  <p>The distribution of thè prest money ought to be preferred

with great prudence, for afterwards at the bancke, the same otherwise may be retained, and substraction made of all the whole money, either in the first pay or those that follow, more or lesse as it séemes expedient, principally for the vse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the souldiers, considering (that according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe) A man can hardly at any time serue two masters, and therefore he must stand vpon this speciall point, to be more carefull not to doe any thing preiudiciall to the honorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Armes, then to please the couetous and insatiable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of some Captaines, whom in effect it pleasures but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in respect their gréedie desire is neuer satisfied: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it fals out to be a maruellous losse and hinderance to the enterprise, specially to men of valour and souldiers, without whose aid a Collonel is but of smal force and value: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, money must alwayes be procured, dispersed, and spent with great discretion, order, and consideration, since the same is so necessarie to man, as it is called the sine wes of warres.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing most requisite that he carrie with him at the least, one Minister, a man of good life, who exemplarly attende about the care of Ecclesiasticall matters, wherin aboue al other things we ought thorowly to be staid and instructed.</p>

And for that in his office it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for him to varie and change purpose, with infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements and considerations, as the shortnesse of time now and then requires, the discommoditie of the place and seat ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth inforce, the order of the enimies doth constraine, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne proper pollicie, or the prouident prudence of his Collonel: but for that this place doth not permit to speak particularly of euerie point, I will passe ouer the same, and onely referre all to the prouidence of his long and approoued experience, which of necessitie is required vnto him, which I further referre to my following discourse of the Sergeant Maior generall.</p>
                  <p>He ought to make a Marshall of his lodgings, who must bée his principall Furrier and Harbinger, that must attend with great diligence, to procure lodging for all, without pleasing any
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6010:82"/>
one particular person for any priuate commoditie whatsoeuer, but must equally distribute, and depart the quarters &amp; lodgings according as néede requires: neither is it to be borne withall, that he do make frée any houses or lodgings, neither go about any such like gaine, a most dishonest and vnlawfull robberie, which oftentimes doth cause great losse and discommoditie to men of warre, small reputation to their conductour, and great vexation and disturbance to the poore people, who for the most part are innocent. The Collonels harbinger hauing allotted out lodgings to euery band, he must prefer the particular distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the vnder harbingers.</p>
                  <p>A general Drummer ought likewise to be created and appoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who may take charge and care ouer al the rest of the Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, whose office &amp; custome amongst them is to conserue and keepe orders, to the intent they may bée obeyed, and that euerie one performe his duty appertaining to his office, as to strike the batterie in marching in battaile, or disseuered, to make ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall bands and cries, to strike the <hi>Diana</hi> in the morning, and the <hi>Salue</hi> or <hi>Aue maria</hi> in the euining at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> closing of the night, and in sounding the march, the call, the charge, the battell, the retrait, with such other like obseruations and necessarie things to be done.</p>
                  <p>He must procure to haue part of euerie munition for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, out of the principal and generall munition, as Corstets, Pikes, Halberds, Hargabuses with their furniture, match, lead, powder, of all sort of victual, and ech thing else as occasion and necessitie requires, which he must cause his Sergeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior to distribute amongst his bands, that his souldiers be not exacted on in the prise. The like deuision he must cause him to make by money it selfe, but neuer more then that which rests as due to them, as manie verie maliciously haue accustomed to do, making merchandise thereof to the losse &amp; ruine of their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: towards whom they are bound continually to procure manifest commoditie &amp; profite. The like is to be obserued in all other things necessary &amp; conformable to this before said, without selling of furniture to them of excessiue prise, for nothing is more dishonorable or more miserable, then to extort vpon soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>It is verie requisite that he examine the election and choise,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6010:83"/>
that euerie Captaine hath made of his officers in euery band, and whether they do thorowly possesse or approch verie néere to the perfite experience they ought to do, of whom and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he shall like and allow. Note that these aduertisements, make manifest apparence, and sets forth to the view of the world, the inward valour of the conductour and Collonel: for if he neglect these obseruations, the contrarie doth easily ensue.</p>
                  <p>I iudge it a thing not out of square, but rather most expedient that the one halfe of the <hi>Caualliers</hi> of S. <hi>Georges</hi> squadre should be Hargabusiers on horseback, specially when warres be made in large and open countries, or else howsoeuer it be situate, for being men of valour, they may both on horsebacke and foote doe great seruice, as often hath bene tried by manifest experience in our time, specially in the late warres of <hi>Flanders,</hi> vnder my Collonel the Baron of <hi>Sheuerau,</hi> in seruice of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> where I being of the number of the Gentlemen of his owne band, haue séene dayly excellent good seruice done by them, as well by discouering the enimies ambuscades, as to draw them into the danger of our footemen. And likewise in the spéedie taking and kéeping a passage of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, in winning aduertisements and the watch word from the enimie, in taking prisoners, in breaking the way for frée passage, in clearing and beating the hye wayes, and scowring them frée from the enimie and fléebooters, in making roades, courses and incursions, in discouering the countrie and taking view there of like to light horsemen, specially in the absence of the <hi>Cauallerie</hi> of the Campe. And therfore I conclude that they shall be found to be a knot and kind of necessarie souldiers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that they be practised, and aboue al ful of valour and aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring minds, &amp; not to be common souldiers, taken at vnawares out of ordinarie bands of footemen, neither such as carrie a dull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> base and abiect mind or disposition.</p>
                  <p>If the Collonell had the authoritie to be able to kéepe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a band with a standerd or Guidon, and a trumpet to them, would do singuler good seruice, which neuerthelesse when ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice on foote did call them forth, might deliuer vp their horses, Lances, &amp; Hargabushes with firelocks vnto their seruants, kept and maintained for that purpose, &amp; enter into ranke or battaile amongst the rest of the <hi>Caualliers</hi> squadre, and so should the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6010:83"/>
and common custome of hauing horses amongst priuate souldiers be auoided, saue such as are permitted and granted to some officers, as in my former discourses I haue alredie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. The which obseruation shal bring to passe that the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in marching and in other enterprises shall go togithers, and be vnited about the Ensigne, which is a thing most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and necessarie, and ought greatly to be shunned, for that horses by ouerthwart trauersing are accustomed to deface th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>He ought to take vigilant care that the Gentlemen of his band and <hi>Caualliers</hi> of his squadre, being continually about his person do diligently performe, that which they are appointed of him to do by commission or otherwise, and that they make faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true relation to him of euerie particular thing, that hée may be euer fully informed of all things, and chiefly of that which doth passe in the watch worthy &amp; necessarie to be noted, as wel by day as by night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since that by going the Round, which doth appertaine principally to these <hi>Caualliers,</hi> many things of moment &amp; importance may verie well be obserued, being able to execute any of the inferiour offices, &amp; both quickly conceiue and sensibly vtter any new accident.</p>
                  <p>The Collonel must most carefully with humble courtisie court his captaine generall, vse great respect towards him, obey him, &amp; giue him faithfull counsell: and to the end he may performe this thorowly well, he must neuer refuse toile or trauell, since that to take pain about matters of like importance, is agréeable and conuenient to honorable personages his equals, whereas easie delicacie &amp; curiositie appertaines to women, or other effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate persons, who estéeme more of belly cheere, gallant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and riches, then of the péerelesse prise of valor &amp; vertue, and that prefer a fraile bodie before an immortall soule.</p>
                  <p>Some hold opinion that a Collonel hauing to allot ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> what number of pikes, short weapons, and shot is to be in euery band, that it is farre better to haue but one sort of weapons, so shall the Captaine euer accompanie his owne souldiers, whereas
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6010:84"/>
otherwise they being disseuered in a stand battaile, he must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loose the companie of his shot or pykes, the one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed to a second, and the short weapons to a third, which doth nothing so much encourage the souldier, as to see his Captaine companion of his perils, and the contrarie no lesse dismaieth him: but for that foughten fields chance seldome in our time, I cease to wade further therein, only aduertising that amongst the rest of his souldiers, the armed pikes must be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed, shewing them a chéerefull and good countenance, who must be chosen men, verie hardie and valiant.</p>
                  <p>He must procure that his officers diligently performe his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, and that faithfully they make relation of euerie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing, that he may be enformed of all, &amp; in specially that which happens in wards, as well in the day as in the night, for they going in circuit as appertaines vnto them, may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue what chanceth of any great importance. So that by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing these aduertisements, the industrie of the Leader doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, wheras not being wel looked vnto great ruine doth arise.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, when his Regiment is discharged, either at the end of the warres or otherwise, he ought to take care that he in any wise procure, that they may be conducted wholly togither, and afterwards disband them in such a place, as from thence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie souldier may easily and without feare transport himselfe into his owne countrie, and if it be possible, hauing his health, his armes, and his apparell entyre: for otherwise if souldiers be disseuered in far countries, they suffer great inconuenience, in hard &amp; difficile passages, in victuals and lodgings, the which doth cause their destruction, the discredite and dishonour of their conductour, and is a great blot in the fame of our nation, as those that haue séene Holland &amp; the Lowcountries can witnes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a thing to be reformed for the increase of our credite and old naturall valour.</p>

                  <p>Hée must take order and command expresly al Collonels, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Officers, that continually they remain firme, &amp; kéep their appointed places, the which places ought to be such as bée feared to bée of greatest danger &amp; importance, as the front, the backe, the flank, &amp; the sléeues, &amp; wings of the Hargabuziers, the like wherof may bée obserued in the other battailes, when it is necessary to forme more then one, as oftentimes it fals out.</p>
                  <p>Let him obserue diligently to procéede in all these respectes, with a modest &amp; low voice, not with rough woords to souldiers, but with swéet &amp; smooth spéech, &amp; if it bée possible with signes and tokens rather then with words, for by that maner of procéeding souldiers remain more attentiue, &amp; better instructed, then with crying &amp; calling, which for the most part procures disobedience, &amp; causeth contempt of aucthority, &amp; moreouer in matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance procures smal effect. And so euery Captain hauing his place, some in the front, some in the rereward, some to lead shot in the winges, others to guide the forlorne hope, ech one must carefully, as I haue said, execute &amp; obey the Sergeant Maiors commandement, whether it be by signe or by voice, by Drum or trumpet, or by any other manifest token &amp; aduertisement.</p>
                  <p>These obseruations bée of great force, wherwithall amongst other his good qualities, in nature &amp; custome requisite for this person to possesse, it is most necessarie that hée bee well giuen to Religion, that hée be charitable, courteous &amp; louing towards the souldiers, &amp; vse exquisite example for their better instruction, which aboue all things must not bee villanously entreated, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther otherwise dispised, but as much as may be corrected with a gentle hand, and alwaies with lenitie fauored.</p>
                  <p>If in the night by reason of <hi>Alarums</hi> he bée to set the armie in order, hee must before hand haue appointed the Captaines, that their lanternes, quarieres, torches or cressets bee in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, vpon any suddaine to bée light vp, the which they must doe: prouided alwaies that it bée necessarie and expedient, and that particularly it hath bin of purpose ordained and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that then they guide behind them, euery band by themselues into the place of Armes, but the Hargabuziers of euery company disseuered from the Pikes and other weapons, which Pikemen shall gather within them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Ensignes in

And to the intent the same may bée more spéedely performed, the fower Corporats, and Sergeant Maiors of the regiments, shall verie aduisedly go to the assigned places &amp; quarters of the lodgings, for this respect if it bée possible, that al the people may arise, may arme themselues, may ioine in one, &amp; ariue at the same instant at the place of armes; where they are of this worthy Officer to bée receiued, and put in squadre in the forme of a halfe Moone or cressant, &amp; within the compasse of the hornes of the said Moone, euery <hi>Alfierus</hi> as hée ariueth, must compasse &amp; plant himselfe in the forme of a crowne, one by one with their Ensignes in their hands, &amp; amongst them those that be armed with rondels &amp; tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets if there bée any; as for a small competent number it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite ther should bée (vnlesse those of proofe which must lead y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shot,) then behind them the armed with halberds, &amp; after these that bée light armed pikes, and about the vtmost compasse of the said circle, &amp; in both the tippes &amp; hornes of the moone the armed pikes are to be planted, and the Sergeants &amp; Lieutenants must attend to apply themselues for the conseruation &amp; kéeping of the order of these last Kinges without: Now the rest of the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels &amp; Captaines; with the person of the Captain general, &amp; the <hi>Cauallieres</hi> of his owne squadre, and a great part of the lightes &amp; Drums, must stand in the void place betwixt both the hornes before the Ensignes, where reseruing the messages &amp; ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of aduertisements that go and come in such cases, they may consult and determin vpon such things as are to bée done. The entrance of this void place ought to bée turned towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest situation of the said ground, &amp; if it bée conuenient, and the ground wil permit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it be garded with certain field péeces and shot.

And to euery troupe of hargabuziers hée shal appoint the other halfe and moity of the Officers, Drums &amp; lights, if it bée conuenient, to the intent that in fight or otherwise in all causes they may readily worke and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6010:88"/>
performe exploits, neither do I thinke it good that in these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the night, Geometricall measures be necessarie, and much lesse Arithmetical numbers: but the carefull diligence of valiant and discréete officers, is most expedient and necessarie, who must euer frame themselues conformable, and be in these actions altogither obedient to the Sergeant Maior, particularly putting in execution his order and pleasure: The proportion of this foresaid Cressant was vsed of <hi>Alexander Vitellus</hi> in the night vpon the toppe of a mountaine, against the mightis Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran League.</p>
                  <p>In the day time the armie rising and setting forward to march and standing in doubt of the enimie, the Sergeant Maior must forme the ordinance and battaile of the armed and disarmed Pikes, of the Halberds and other weapons, in such sort, that hauing to double the rankes to make them greater, the battails may fall out in due proportion, that is to say, that the front and the backe way deuide equally the armed Corslets and. Pikes, alwayes prouided that the flankes be not left disarmed and void of Pikes, so shall he bring to passe that the short weapons shal enclose the Ensignes iust in the midst amongst them, kéeping defended betwixt them and the armed Corslets and Pikes, as well on the front as on the backe, the disarmed Pikes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which to make number and to fill vp roome, ought not to be refused a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a great number of footemen in the field, since it is verie hard for all men to arme themselues, they being armed onely with a brest plate and burganet, or with a coate of plate or iack &amp; a scul, are good to turne on amongst shot. And as the quantitie &amp; number of Pikes, principally togither with other short wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, is the verie strength &amp; force of the armed footemen: So the musketeares &amp; hargabusiers, serue to no other end but to flank, to raise ruine &amp; deface all defences, to make imbuscades, to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish diligently to execute such like enterprises: and finally to pursue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimy, defending or expugning some strong place, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, passage, or breach, or what other condition soeuer. When he hath put the ordenance and march in this foresaid forme and maner, &amp; that he doth carry in mind y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Theorick &amp; Rules which before are mentioned, he may so ingrosse and double the ranks, specially when he aspects and stayes for the enimie, that he may frame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the square battaile of ground or of number a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

both the one and the other, without any difficultie.</p>
                  <p>He may likewise cause euerie particular Sergeant place all the Pikes armed and disarmed, with the other weapons they haue in charge, and also the Ensigne, in so many li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>es &amp; rankes as the people of the other bands likewise armed by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant are formed and fashioned. Besides it would be very good for the Sergeant Maior, first of all, aduisedly to consider with the Sergeants, how many lines or ranks they are to be by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: prouided alwayes that one band be like vnto another in quantitie of lines &amp; rankes, that their proportion may answere and be correspondent. These bodies so ordained, are of many called maniples or scales, as thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
which verie easily may be ingrossed thus,
<figure/>
And in this sort shal he cause one band to march behind another, being annexed and ioyned néere togither, and that euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be guided by an officer into a place &amp; ground able to receiue them, causing the first company and maniple to march somwhat disseuered from the other, &amp; to make space &amp; stay, he may ordaine that the second comming forward it may be placed vpon his flanke: so in like sort shal the third to the second, the 4. to the 3. &amp; the 5. to the 4. and so consequently continuing this order, he shal by &amp; by forme a grosse square and gallant battell, that with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage may be able to contend with the enimie. And it is true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some haue affirmed, that the fewer number of maniples there be, the case is so much better, but in this case it is very hard to obserue the iust order of so many men by rank, &amp; of such number of ranks as the perfect rules of Theorick doth assigne, by reason that many times all the companies and bands are not of equall number, neither are they all armed alike one to another.</p>
                  <p>Marching in this order he may cause al the <hi>Alfieres</hi> of euerie Regiment to march in ranke vnited togither, without mixing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6010:89"/>
themselues with others that pertain to other Collonels, or with other priuate captains, and when the maniple be doubled &amp; the battel is complet &amp; engrossed, euery <hi>Alfierus</hi> may go to his own band, and remain with the same, for the more satisfaction of his company and his greater saftie. And returning with the said or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of maniples to march in long ordinance as before, euery <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fierus</hi> shal turne amongst the other <hi>Alfierus</hi> or Ensigne bearers where he remained first. The Hargabusiers must march disseuered from the battaile, the one halfe in Uantgard, and the other half in reargard, or somwhat distant of, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand, &amp; vpon the left hand, as the way shall serue with most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, or as shall be thought most necessarie, if suspect be had of the enimie, so that according as néede doth require, redoubling the rankes, and causing one to enter into another, or knit and ioyne togither, he may engrosse them and put them in order with good aduisement, to flanke this foresaid principall battaile in as good forme as he possible may.</p>
                  <p>It is a most necessarie note to be had in memorie, that as wel the two wings or sléeues of Hargabusiers, as also the front or backe part of the ordained battaile or generall square, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes recommended, as before I said, to the worthy Collonels and Captaines, and honorable officers and souldiers, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they may alwayes giue remedie, by discourse consider, and by courage determine of al matters, making choise of the chiefest part in those affaires of importance, without attending or aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting for counsell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if in case such counsell be not present and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die at hand.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it to be misliked or out of course, but as I iudge a thing verie necessarie to send for Uantgard and Reargard, and on both sides some what farre off from the battaile, squadrons, troopes or hornes of Hargabusiers out of the forlorne hope: the which without mouing the souldiers of the battaile, the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned square and flankes may verie sufficiently performe all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, discoueries, and do great seruice of maruellous impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and profite, and in effect may assure the way and passage to the squadrons that come behind or go before from surprises, &amp;c. Marching out of danger or suspicion of the enimy, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Maior deuiding euerie armes by themselues, must forme the accustomed ordinance, and marching with this, hée may

accept the companies which ariue, as they come, and send the Hargabusiers of the front of this companie to the Uantgard of the Hargabusiers of the foresaid formed rankes, and those of the backe to the reargard: the Ensignes to the place of the Ensignes and the forepart of the Pikes and Halberds to the front, and the hindermost part to the backe of this square battaile and ordinance: in the midst of the day when the Armie makes <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Some hold opinion, vnlesse the souldiers bee rawe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained men, that it is not good to aduenture the brunt, in one maine square battaile, but rather in diuers squadrons and sundrie battillions, specially if by the continuance of many yeares seruice they be trained in such sort, as in the furie of the fight they can both march forward if they preuaile, or retyre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on disaduantage, and yet maintaine perfectly their arayes: then
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6010:90"/>
by no meanes the battaile is to be committed to one hazard of fortune, but imitating the <hi>Romaines</hi> ancient warlike discipline, to place themselues in thrée or foure seuerall fronts, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient spaces for the first to retire and vnite himselfe with the second, &amp; both these (if occasion néede) to serue with the 3. the shot hauing conuenient issues and lanes, continually during the fight, to discharge their péeces, which will make an incredible spoile of the enimie, so that vpon the charge of horsemen rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring within the squadrons, who ioyning togither may bend and crosse their pikes to receiue the shocke, and repulse them, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose retyre, vnclosing their thorowfares, lanes, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries againe, the shot and musketeares may issue out vpon their backes, and either follow with the heat shore of their bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, or he imployed vpon some other enterprises: but these things cannot be accomplished without long abode in warres &amp; 7. yeares seruice at the least of an armie in sundrie hazards of fights and battailes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is necessarie for the Sergeant Maior, in time of rest when the enimie is absent, to cause the bands to assemble, and to put them in sundrie sorts of standing and marching bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, to reduce them sometimes into small squadrons of 400. 500. 600. 700. 800. 900. 1000. in a battaile, more or lesse at his pleasure, and to cause these battailes to march forwards swiftly or slowly, to sarrie, open, shut, close and disclose their squadrons, some times in sundrie battaillons, reduce themselues vpon a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine into one maine square, and from that againe to haue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages &amp; galleries for the shot through diuers places of the same, marching forwards and backward according to the stroke of the drumme, to stay and retyre in perfite measore, with no lesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie then Gentlemen dance their Measures by a noyse of vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, as hereafter ensueth. When the army can perfitely do this, then cause them sodainly to make any flacke or front, or turne entirely togither, as if it were one bodie without breaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, for it is a cunning point to make a squadre to march vpon one corner, maintaining his square forme. This and such like varietie in marching, brings the souldier to be verie readie, so that although he neuer saw the enimy in the face, yet he may be rather accounted a trained souldier, then he which hath bene 20, yeares in seruice, and in 20. battailes, if this skil be wanting
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6010:91"/>
in him, and merites the name of a raw souldier and <hi>Bisognia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note that there is no battaile apt to march but only the square battaile or the compound of squares, all others as the <hi>Lunule,</hi> the <hi>Triangle,</hi> the <hi>Pentagonall</hi> and the <hi>Hexagonall,</hi> the circular and ouall battailes, and others which easily may be inuented, neuer serue to any vse, but onely in fixed and immoueable bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, for presently and by and by in marching they disorder. Therefore great consideration is to be had betwixt a marching and standing battaile, which kinde of immoueable battailes, though of themselues they are smally seruiceable, considering that in all encounters continuall motion is required, it being vnpossible to train men to that perfection, but that in marching they shall breake their aray, yet for exercise sake, and for some speciall seruice, it is most conuenient for the Sergeant Maior, oftentimes to plant his souldiers into those fashions of imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, that appeare hereafter by figures: sodainely changing them from a triangle to a square, and from one shape to another, and thereby bring them into such perfection in these lesse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and hard cunning toyes, that the other plaine seruiceable formes may séeme most plaine and easie.</p>
                  <p>He must beforehand premeditate, as partly I haue touched, and cast in his minde in what sort with most facilitie he may bring his men to order of battaile, committing to the peculiar Sergeant of euery band, the charge to draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth in sléeues and maniples, and so cause one to march close vp by another till al the battailes be furnished, placing alwaies the Ensignes and drums in the middle rankes of the battaile.</p>
                  <p>There néede no such curious order to be vsed in placing the shot in any forme of battaile, but only to put them into certaine wings and flankes for the battailes, and if he thinke good, euery wing to be deuided into sundrie pettie troopes, of 25. 50. or 100. men a péece, and euerie of these troopes to haue a leader, which is either Corporall, Sergeant, or <hi>Cauallier</hi> of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> squadre: so that to maintaine a skirmish, first one Corporall or leader marcheth forth and bringeth to the face of the enimie his troope, who presently discharging retyre themselues, and in his place another leader with his companie presents himselfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this order of supply, succouring, seconding, shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encreasing the skirmish, continually maintaining the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6010:91"/>
same without any intermission, either inuading, retyring, or in any charge or enterprise, a requisite obseruation for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hope. But the place being large, it shall be requisite to present oftentimes many of these troopes at once to the face of the enimie, who hauing deliuered their volée of shot, may if it be thought good, march about and giue place to those that shall supply their place, &amp; so relieue &amp; succour one another by turnes. And this kind of discharging and supplying, may in the open field be verie well maintained in the ring march, as the rutters do, so that in whéeling about, the head shall be sure alwayes to haue charged before the taile haue discharged: and thus in a circular march the skirmish all day shall continue.</p>
                  <p>In plaine ground he shall neuer turne out any shot to the skirmish, without certaine sléeues of pikes to gard them vpon the retraite from the charge of horses, and also troopes of short weapons, as swords and targets, Halberds or such like to backe them, if at any time they should come to the sword, or ioyne pell mell with the enimie, and such were called of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines <hi>vindices,</hi>
                     </hi> but if euery shot had likewise at his backe a light leather or Uenecian target, to vse with his sword when he saw occasion, they would doe great good seruice. Our English bowes for want of shot and fornecessitie, to gall and disorder a troope of horsemen, drawing néere to them, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>erue to verie good purpose, but they must be garded with Pikes or shadowed with shot &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Sergeant Maior must likewise haue knowledge in Arithmetike, Algebra, &amp; of those proportions which are set out by M. <hi>Digges</hi> in his <hi>Stratioticos,</hi> whereby he may sodainely for all forme of battailes, resolue how many ranks, and how many in a ranke, to frame battailes, what number of Pikes, of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, of Musket and Hargabuse shot is requisite, how manie maniples or sléeues euerie battaile may be resolued into, how many rankes of pikes in the front, backe and flankes, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rankes of Halberds to gard the Ensigne, vpon sight of the ground to iudge whether it be capable of such a multitude, and what forme of imbattelling may best agrée vnto it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When he doth cause any squadron or battaile to turne his face or front, he must take order that the souldiers turne onely their bodie and face, but not their armes and weapons, whose points
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6010:92"/>
they ought to kéepe in their hands, thereby to shunne the noyse that by linking and striking togither they will make, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid confusion, which oftentimes in such cases doth fallow, since that in this sort more readily and with greater silence this act is executed, all the weapons remaine readie and fast in the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hands: the which order makes a verie stately shew, and after brings great commoditie, when they must of new accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themselues, and make large in the flanckes to march at large. Let al that which he determines and appoints to be done, be commanded and ordained from the backe of the rankes and squadron, and not from the front or from any other place: for in marching more attentiuely, and with lesse occasion of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and turning, those things be better vnderstood and are more capable which are spoken and proceede from behind the backe, then from the front and flankes, and with greater facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doth runne all along the rankes, and as they say, according to the word <hi>Passa Parola,</hi> aduan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>When he giues a volée of shot, or makes a <hi>Salua</hi> of Musket &amp; Hargabussers, it is much better for him to begin at the head, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other place, that he may in due order ranke by ranke cause one to follow another, euen to the backe and last ranke, so that how much more it yéelds a gallant &amp; readie grace, so much more makes it shew that those souldiers be practised, and argues the sufficiencie of him that guides them.</p>

                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:6010:105"/>The manner of ordering of battels lately vsed, I cannot greatly command, for the armie being 20. 30 or 40. thousand, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided but into 3. battels, whereby ensueth many perils and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, because the Pike being but fiue yards thrée quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters long, euerie man occupying a yard and halfe a quarter of pike, can occupie but foure or fiue rankes at the most, so that the rest are superfluous and lost: besides, they are easily to bée compassed and to be charged on euerie side: wherefore I haue set downe an order of one of the battels in figure, according to my opinion, the which if it may turne profite to my countrie I would be most glad. The occasion of the prosperous successe of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> was onely through their good orders, by diuiding their Legions into cohorts, the which were bands of 400. and 50. the 50. were shot, the 400. were armed, their weapons, pikes, swords and targets, the which were placed in quadrant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 20. euerie wayes, being 10. battels in front, leauing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine space betwéene euerie battell for their retrait vpon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the next order, which were but sixe battels, and the rereward foure battels, all in like number, kéeping one bredth, the voward were called <hi>Hastatie,</hi> their battels thicke and close, the Maineward were called <hi>Principie,</hi> who had such space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene their rankes as they might receiue the <hi>Hastatie:</hi> the rereward were called <hi>Triarij,</hi> whose spaces betwéene their rankes were such, as they might receiue the <hi>Principie</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statie,</hi> on the wings were placed seauen rankes of Pikes of strangers, which did distend in length from the voward to the rereward: through these good orders they became conquerours of many countries. Now because of the diuersitie of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, hauing 20000. footemen, I would deuide them into tenne battels, to euerie one of the battels shall be according to my proportion set downe 1000. shot, 800. pikes, and 200. Billes, the which placed in twofold wise, according to my proportion set downe in figure, will be in bredth 45. and in length 22. and ten ouerplus, the which are to be placed at the discretion of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Maior, the shot placed in the wings and rereward in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples for the readier seruice, who must be placed a good distance from thy battel, thy men at armes vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wings of the shot, thy Lances as two hornes in the front of the battell, the light horse in the fronts of thy Lances, the hargulaters in the fronts of thy

The second battell not to be placed in the front with the first battell, as the <hi>Romaines</hi> did, but in the rereward of the first so far wide and with such distance, as the horsemen and shot a foote giuing the first charge may retire themselues without disturbance to the battels, hauing thy shot placed as in the voward with the lances and shot on horsebacke: the third battell to be placed in the rereward of the second, with like distance with shot and horse: and so to the fourth, fift, and the tenth, in the rereward of the which, if occasion require, thou maist as in the rereward of the battell, place for the defence certaine of thy carriages. Thy battels being thus ordered, thou shalt be sure no wayes to be compassed by the enimies, whereas thou maist easily compasse in him, not ordered in the like manner, and thy battels being but little, yet as strong as the greater, being strongly fortified euerie way with pikes, and when a signe is giuen, your hargo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateares, pistolateares and lances, may at the sodaine be with the formost, or readie for any other place of seruice. Also your second battell may ioyne with the first, and the third with the second, and so to strengthen your battels at pleasure, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise two or thrée of thy battels to giue the charge to one of his battels, and if it should so happen that thy first and second bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels should be ouerthrowne, thy battel placed in this order, thou maist retire thy selfe and leaue of the field, maugre the head of thy enimie, who in prosecuting thée, disorder themselues, as many times happens, may be easily conquered, vsing thy bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels in this order, I hold to be of greatest force and most auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

Thus there is in the first front of pikes 1680 In the second front 1200. In the impalement 3800.

Thus after the great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance on either side haue discharged, the Forlorne hope is continually to be supplied with new troupes of shot from the flankes and wings, and these troupes of the Forlorne hope that haue discharged, should retire betwéene the battaile and the

But after the battell begins to approch, the forlorne hope must withdrawe themselues: then is your first battell strongly fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and impaled with pikes to abide any charge of horsemen, and after their pikes are broken, are together with the rest of the short weapon, to deale with the enemie, and during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the fight, betwéen these battailons the shot may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually discharge in the face of the enemie. Likewise there may be certaine small carriages, some laden with muskets, some with Calabashes, others with murdering fire balles: and these cariages may during the battell continually spoile the enemies front, being safely garded betwéen the battaillons: but if fortune should abandon them in the first encounter, and that they be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the enemies, yet haue they those ample spaces betwéene the battaillons of the second front to retire vnto, there to make head, and giue the enemie battell againe. And these spaces or lanes betwéene the battaillons, serue not onely to receiue the skirmishers or other that shall retyre, but also for the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which among the Romans were called <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore a band is to learne by it selfe, to kéepe ranke in each kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to say, in marching slowlie, softlie &amp; fast, &amp; to learne all the sounds, all the signes, and all the blasts, voices and cries, wherewith the officers commaund in a battell: and that euery one know perfectly the signification thereof, no lesse then the Mariners the whistle of the maister of the ship, in which soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours must be readie and diligent to obey incontinently &amp; aptly at the stroke &amp; battery of the drums, whether it be to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to stay, or to recoile, or to turne their faces and weapons towards any place. To this end all Collonels must ordaine, that all the drums haue one kind and maner of battery, and that they do vse al one forme of sounding to the field, of sounding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alarme, and to vse one proper sound, to plant themselues in battell, to aduance themselues, to recoyle, to turne in battell themselues from one side to another, to make retraite, and in sum to signifie all other points, that the voice of one person alone cannot make so easily to be vnderstood, as dooth the sound of many drums, the which make themselues to be hard in the greatest tumults and throngs. The souldiors also ought to be so attentiue, to hearken and giue eare to that which is spoken and commanded, that they néed neuer to be deceiued: the drums likewise ought to be ready to batter their caisses according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sound of the collonels trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, by the which they must altogether direct and gouerne their batteries. The Collonels trumpet ought to be expert in all these sounds, &amp; that he be able to vtter them so plainly, that the drums take not one thing for an other, but that he know how to expres the same according to his Collonels commandement, néere vnto whose person he ought to be euer, &amp; not to abandon him: &amp; to yéeld a reason what mooues me to appoint trumpets for footmen, it is in respect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be more cléerly vnderstood then drums can be if any great tumult should arise, &amp; that the drums should alter &amp; change their sound: for they are to be directed by trumpets, the sound wherof is hier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the battery of drums, the which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Zwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers who first inuented drums haue very wel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All these things togither with ech seueral sound, must be taught &amp; shewed from point to point to ech particular band apart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ranged togither in battel, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent they may haue the full art to maintaine their order &amp; ranks, without that any place how difficile soeuer, be able to disband or disseuer them. And also that the sound of the trumpet be so familiar vnto them, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre, neither take one thing for another, but that the Collonels bands be ech one priuatly &amp; fully instructed in all that which the battaillons ought to do, being assembled with the armie. And for that armes are brought to seuerall kinds of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, either in respect of the enimies in sight, or for feare of some sodaine assault, ech band ought to be exercised in such sort and so instructed, that they may with great assurance march through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimies countrie &amp; fight if néed require, the officers instructing &amp; shewing the souldiers, that which they haue to do, if they were assaulted on one side or other at vnawares.</p>
                  <p>And that they be taught the order to resist the enimie in a day of battell, or when the enimie doth approch in sight, they ought to learne how a battel must begin, and how one battaillon doth abord another battaillon of the enimies: and to shew them the place where they ought to retyre if they be repulsed: and who must enter into and supply their places: and to what signes, to what sounds, to what voyces they ought to obey: and that which they must do when they heare these voyces and sounds, and sée those tokens &amp; signes: and to accustome them with the sundrie sorts of battels and fained assaults, in such sort, that afterwards they may not onely dare to abide, but also desire the fight in good earnest: the which assurance shal so much the rather encrease, by how much they sée themselues wel instructed, ordered, &amp; ranged, rather then by their proper hardines, chiefly if these battailons be ranged in such sort that they may easily succour one another, which is of no small importance to encourage &amp; assure the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: For admit that I should be of the first combatants, &amp; that I know into what part I ought to retire my selfe, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched, and likewise who he is that must come in my place, I shall alwayes fight with a better heart, beholding my succours néere at hand, rather then if I neither knew them nor saw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Likewise if I be in the second place (although the first be repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; that I behold them to recoile) yet the same shal not astonish

nor appale me, for that I alredie know what this recoile doth signifie: a thing which beforehand I shal desire to come to passe, to the intent that I may be he that shall gaine the victorie, and that the first do not carrie away the honour of the fielde alone to themselues.</p>
                  <p>These exercises therefore be most necessarie both for young and olde souldiers, for it appeares, that although the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines knew perfitely what were to be accomplished in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular band, and so consequently in a whole armie, and that they did learne all these things in their youth in <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>mpo Martio,</hi> yet neuerthelesse they were afterwards continually exercised, as wel in the time of peace, as when their enimies did front them. <hi>Ioseph</hi> in his historie saith, that the continuall exercise of the <hi>Romaine</hi> armie, did make the common multitude of those that followed the campe, serue in a day of battell as well as the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: for both the one and the other knew how to kéepe their ranks, and in kéeping them how to fight in them. But an armie of new souldiers, whether they be leuied to serue presently, or that an order be taken to haue them in readines to be imployed in time to come, they will arise to proue vnprofitable without these practises and exercises. Therefore order being so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, all Captaines, Collonels, and Sergeant Maiors, must with double industrie and trauell instruct or cause to be instructed, those which be ignorant, and to continue and maintaine the same in those which are perfect, imitating the steps of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Captaines which haue trauelled to maintaine this disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
                  <p>The souldiers therefore in priuate bands being instructed to kéepe their rankes by 3. and 3. fiue and 5. or 8. and 8. without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing respect to the number, euen or odde, for that it is a thing of no importance, but an obseruation brought vp without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; specially <hi>Vegetius</hi> can yéeld no reason therefore, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse. They must then in marching softly or in hast, learne to multiplie, as two ranks of fiue to make 10. &amp; two of 10. to make 20. and by and by at one instant to bring them from the same rankes and to place them in their first and simple order of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray.</p>
                  <p>And to the end they may assure and accustome themselues
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6010:113"/>
the better, it is necessarie they make Lymassons when they are in simple and single aray, and to aduertise them that the second person in ranke, doe kéepe alwayes iust behind the first without loosing him, and the 3. right behind the second, and so of the rest.</p>
                  <p>This done togither with the directions of my second booke, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To performe which the Pikes of the flankes and the Hargabusiers shall come out of aray, and shall place themselues on the one side and the Corporals of the Pikes shall make head, one of the Corporals and his people first, and another of the Corporals and his people next, the Corporall of the Halberdeares shall follow, hauing the <hi>Alfierus</hi> with his Ensigne in the middest of the Halberds. Then the other Corporals with their Pikes, shal make the reregard with their people.</p>
                  <p>It must be shewed to euerie Corporall the place which he ought to kéepe at all times, who likewise must declare the same plainely and particularly to euerie priuate souldier of his squadre.</p>
                  <p>The Captaine must be at the head of the aray, and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant at the backe, the Sergeant hath no staying place, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Captaine do appoint him one, but must alwayes trot here and there all alongst the rankes, to see good order kept, and to commaunde the performance of his Captaines plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>Let continuall vse accustome the souldiers, to know of themselues, how to range themselues in battell: for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learning whereof, they must be made to march forward and backward, and to passe difficile places without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and breaking their aray, the which if they be not able to doe, they are not to be esteemed old souldiers, although they haue serued twentie yeares.</p>
                  <p>The difficultie likewise is great, to cause them place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon a sodaine in their first aray being broken or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, by reason of vneasie passages, or that the enimies haue disseuered them, for in this it is requisite to haue had good and great exercise of a long continuance. Therefore
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6010:114"/>
that the same may be accomplished, it is necessarie to haue two things obserued &amp; maintained, the one that the Ensignes may be easily knowne by colours and figures of number, and that the chiefe members and officers haue certaine cognisances or markes vpon their armes and apparell: and the other is, that one selfe band be ranged alwayes in one certaine and knowne place of the battaillon, without causing the same to alter roomes: and that the Corporals know the places that they must enter into, without shifting at any time, but if that one Corporall be accustomed to be in the formost ranke, that he remaine there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and the souldiers in the places which hath ben ordained them from the beginning. And if that any one band hath bene taught to be in the right corner of the battell, that the same doe not stirre from thence, and so consequently that which is vsed to the left shall go to the left. By this meanes if the souldiers be accustomed to know their places (put case they should be out of order) yet should they be able to place themselues againe easily. For the Ensignes do know alredie the place where they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to be planted in the battel: and the Corporals know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewise their place, may iudge also by ranke of eye vpon what part it is that they should place themselues: so that those of the front shall steppe forwards to the front, and those of the backe shall in like sort retire to their places.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Corporals knowing in how many and what rankes they haue to arrange themselues, it will follow that the souldiers, not hauing any thing else to do, but to imitate their Leaders and heads, will readily range themselues euerie one in his owne place, without hauing néede of any sergeant of a band, nor any other to place them, prouided that vse and practise hath made them perfect masters. These things are instructed &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned spéedily, so that diligence be vsed, &amp; that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accustome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by little &amp; little and often, the which after they haue once well learned, they shall hardly forget. It is moreouer necessarie to teach them to turne al at one time, for it is somtimes requisite to make of the rereward the front, or of one of the flankes the rereward, according to the enimies face, and according to the place of assault. Now to answere towards the place néedful, you haue no more to do, but to turne your person towards the place appointed, and so shall that part towards which the souldiers
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6010:114"/>
haue turned their faces be the front. But he that would haue a whole battaillon turne all in one péece, &amp; as if it were a massie body, in this it were necessarie to haue great practise &amp; discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for to turne it vpon the left hand, it is requisite to haue the left corner stay, &amp; that those which be néere adioyning vnto the same, do aduance themselues so slowly, that those vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right corner, be not constrained to run: otherwise al wil be confounded, but this may better be made apparant by experience then words.</p>
                  <p>The forlorne hope, &amp; the light armed &amp; armed pikes, are to be ranged in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> front, flanks &amp; rereward, according to the proportion of the battell, or as the seruice requires, for these are to execute particular functions, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uoyes, forrages, inuasions &amp; such like, when it is not requisite to send great numbers of people. The forlorne hope, the pikemen &amp; hargabusiers, are to begin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battel, to fight amongst the horsemen without kéeping any order: and therfore being lightly armed, their office is to fight without sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still or firme, &amp; in running &amp; trauersing here &amp; there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they pursue the enimies, or be followed of them, in which the pikemen wil do good seruice in backing &amp; sustaining the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabusiers, and may be able to make front to these that charge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, whether they be on horseback or foote, or to follow those that be in flight, &amp; to make entrance &amp; to thrust in amongst the enimies, when they begin to stagger or sway. Therfore al soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whether they be in maine battel, in flanke, forlorne hope, in the impale or rereward, haue néede to be well exercised, that being disbanded, they may immediatly finde againe their places &amp; rang themselues in the same aray they kept before, wherein it is necessarie that all officers become more vigilant in execution then heretofore, and the souldiers more obedient and expert in performing, then at this day they be. Our age brings forth Captaines more curious of gaine then of conseruing good order, and troupes of officers rather to supplie number then sufficient to instruct: The Ensignes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues are more in vse for a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant shew, then for any Militarie direction, whereas the ancient Romaines did vse them for a guid: whereby they knew how to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in order, for euery one after the Ensigne did stay, knew incontinently y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where they were to plant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, they knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the same did remoue or stand stil, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they likewise ought to march or stay. Therfore it is necessary that a camp haue diuers bands, &amp; euery band his Ensigne, wherin figures of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6010:115"/>
are to be portraited, to shew what roome and place the same is of in euery regiment or armie, and so consequently where the same is accustomed to be ranged. And also necessarie Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and officers, that the campe may haue diuers soules, and so likewise diuers liues: all souldiers then ought to gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues according to their Ensignes &amp; according to the sounds the which being ordained &amp; set down according as they ought, do command &amp; gouerne a whole regiment and armie. The which, so that it march in such sort as answeres to the batterie of the drums: they shall easily kéepe their order and aray. And to this end were the Flutes and fiffes found out, and sounds of perfect accord: for euen as men that dance by the measures of Musicke do not erre, so likewise a whole battaillon, which in march obeys the sound of the drum cannot breake aray, and therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, when they would change their pace, when they would inflame, appcase, or assure the souldiers they did change sounds, &amp; as the sounds did varie, so likewise vsed they variety of names to them, for they had the <hi>Dorike,</hi> and the <hi>Phrigien</hi> sound: the one did inflame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiers, the other did make méek &amp; appease them. They had likewise other kinds of sounds as the <hi>Aeolien, Iasien, Lydien</hi> &amp; others, the which did al serue to incite or coole the courage of men, which diuersitie of batteries, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards do presently verie well imitate, a thing to be obserued of all good souldiers. An armie that consists of diuers battaillons &amp; two or thrée fronts, when they are constrained to break and are repulsed, must retire one within another into the rankes of the next squadrons, which of purpose are planted more thin, &amp; so the first retyring enters into the 2. and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second into the 3. Note that in the first front of a square vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fal of any wounded or slaine souldier, he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is next behind him in rank, &amp; is his follower must enter and step into his roome, and fill vp the void place, that the front of the battel may still be maintained, and so obseruing the retire of the battaillons, and the renuing of their ranks, we may accomplish both the Romain &amp; Gréeke discipline. Those battail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons which are most necessarie to be had in vse, ought to consist of pikes marching before the Ensigne, behind it and on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flanks, carrying light Uenecian rundels and targets on their backes: and in the midst about the Ensigne the halberdeares must stand, prouided alwayes that the notable personages &amp; good souldiers for seruice be dispersed as well in the flanks &amp; behind as before,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6010:115"/>
and not to put them all to one brunt in the front, as though they were immortall and not able to be ouercome. By this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a battell shall be able to sustaine a charge of horsemen or footmen to repulse them, &amp; after enter into the enimies throng: for experience declares that the pikes are made voide of seruice when the rankes be closed pell mell togither, for then the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are almost one vpon the bodie &amp; backe of another. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the pikemen should haue no other weapons but their pikes and swords, they should remaine naked, which doth moue me to commend the rondell to receiue the blowes: and to fight withall in any presse or throng whatsoeuer. The halberdeares may verie well fight in a presse likewise with their halberds, rather then the pikemen with their pikes: The which halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deares are expresly appointed for execution: and so consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow the said rondels at the héeles, to frée them from the charge of those that be armed, through the great &amp; heauie blowes which they shall giue with their halberds. But touching the rondels, I would haue them alwayes to thrust with the point of their swords, although it were but at the face, the legges and féete, if the enimie be not disarmed in other parts.</p>
                  <p>The ground that euery souldier doth occupie at large in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in simple and single aray, is thrée pace, and being in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell two, and when they fight one. The distance of one ranke from another, in simple and single ordinance and aray, is foure, and being ranged in battell two, and in fight one.</p>
                  <p>The first sound of the Collonels trumpet is to enter into the ranke and march, the second to alter the single aray into forme of battell, and the thirde is to aduance and plant the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. The Collonel being in such a place as from thence he may sée his whole Regiment, hauing the <hi>Caualliers</hi> of his squadre of S. <hi>George</hi> about him, being such expert souldiers as I haue set downe in my second booke of directions, togither with the Sergeant Maior and such as can execute any commission of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, his drum and trumpet maior about him to sound and cause his pleasure to be sodainly and spéedily vnderstood. The Collonel must commande the sound to be made of his trumpet, which is appointed for the ordinarie march, and soone after to sounde that which is to trot, and then at the selfe time that which commands and appoints the fight and combat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:6010:116"/>When a battell doth consist of diuers battaillons, he must not forget to exercise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first to retire within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaillons of the second, &amp; the second to retire within the battaillons of the third. And to accomplish the same without breaking or disordering the squadrons. The pikes in the flankes must retire as the battail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons retire, the first into the second, the 3. within the 4. the fourth within the 5. the fift into the 6. of the ranks, and so consequently to the end. The forlorne hope and horsmen shal likewise do their dutie. These things done, the retrait must sound, and euery En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe must recoile his people apart, to put them again in a new and single ordinance of aray for the march.</p>
                  <p>The enimie aduancing to fight in triangular battel with the point forward, frame the battell of sheares to receiue, enuiron and fight with the said pointed battaillon. If the enimie march with a front stretched out in length, make a triangle or pointed battel to pearce the same. The baggage of an armie ought either to be in a place strong by nature, or well defended by art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, togither with the followers of the campe, pages and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chachos, who must be chosen able to fight in a day of seruice, for the defence of themselues and their masters baggage.</p>
                  <p>The spaces, interualles, galeries and passages, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the ranks, amongst the bands, and amongst the battail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, do serue not onely to receiue one another, either in retire, or when the first ranke doth retire through the midst of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the 2. 3. 4. and 5. &amp;c. following him like a Laborinthus mase, going forward to the last ranks and turning backe again, or that his next follower steps a side and lets him passe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ranke againe, but also those spaces betwixt the battail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons serue the <hi>Caualliers</hi> &amp; such like that come &amp; go, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie &amp; bring directions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chieftaines, Collonels or Generals.</p>
                  <p>The forlorne hope and extraordinarie pikes must inuade the enimie with continuall &amp; great cries, the battaillons or maine battell likewise at the first must giue a chearefull shout, when encounter is giuen in the beginning and ioyning of the battels, but afterward maintain a solemne silence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better vnderstand what commandements and directions procéeds from their chieftain, either for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altering of order or otherwise, which cannot be heard or vnderstood, if they continue a barbarous crie. Squadrons &amp; battaillons must sometimes assault in great hast, chiefly if the enimies artillery doe endomage them verie much,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6010:116"/>
and sometimes must abide the charge without remoouing, when the place is vneasie, &amp; that they shall be in danger to dismember, specially if they be such as be not accustomed to the march &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of battels. Therefore in conclusion, these 4 things ought to be obserued of all armies: first that all soldiors &amp; priuate bands be exercised a part in all things belonging to the wars: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they know how to range themselues in battell, how to varie, exercise, and march in the same, softly, apace, and in full course, kéeping their araic. Thirdly to learne that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the exercise which they must accomplish in a day of battell, and how to drawe forward and retire the artillarie, to giue way and cause the Hargabuziers to issue out of the flanks, hauing shot sixe or 7 Hargabusades a péece in running héere and there, and without kéeping order, so that they know how to ioyne and agrée with the pikemen and horsemen, to whom the care ouer their safety belongs. They shall retire by the flankes and by the interuals and passages, each one into his place: that is to say, the hargabuziers of the flankes into the flanks, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hope to the reregard, there to range themselues according to the Collonels appointment, &amp; as the day of seruice requires, for if they should remaine and continue before the squadre or battel, they shall hinder the maine battaillons in their fight, and bring confusion. The light armed pikes &amp; horsemen must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise retire to their places vpon the ioyning of the battels. The fourth exercise is, as partly I haue touched before, that euery one apply himselfe to vnderstand the commaundement of the Chéeftains, the signification of the sounds and trumpets, and the batterie of the drums: by which be signified all that which is generally to be vnderstood: that is to say, when it shall be time to plant themselues in battell, when they ought to march, when to stay or go forward, when to turne visage to one part or other, to crosse the ground, sarrie close, &amp; fight. In like sort the sound of the said trumpets shall signifie, when it is time for the artillary to discharge, when to retire, when the Musket &amp; Hargabusiers, the forlorne hope, and others, are to set forward, and when they are to retire, and also when the first battels ought to retire to the second fronts and battaillons, and when both together they are to arange themselues with those of the third, &amp; finally at what time they must all retire from the battel, the which things must in a plaine &amp; knowne vulgar sort, be al set downe by the collonel
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6010:117"/>
and Chieftaine, and suddenlye be signified by his trumpet, the noise whereof shall giue sufficient intelligence to the other trumpets, which are néerest him, that it may so go from hand to hand, to the furthest trumpet of the armie. It should be good to vse a Cornet or a hunts mans horne, for the retraite, &amp;c. and a trumpet to begin the battell, or contrariwise: for it is a most difficile thing, that the trumpetor should signifie so many diuers things with one instrument, considering that the sound of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite, dooth approch very néere vnto the sounding to the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, in such sort that then when as all men be troubled, and as it were besides themselues, they shall very hardly be able to discerne whether of these two things the trumpet sounds.</p>

                  <p>A Pike ought neuer to want in length any thing of fiftéene foot, for this respect, when the footemen are streightned and setled in order of battell, they may for the aduantage and profite of the said armie, in respect that the assaults of the enemie is to giue to the said battell, couching &amp; bending their pikes against them, worke so that the greatest number of rankes that is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the defence of the battell, may endamage and offend the said enemies, and therefore their pikes being shorter then fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene foote, it prooues that no more of the ranks can fight, but the first, second and third, standing all in order in their places, and yet can the third ranke fight but discommodiously, &amp; not aduance forward his pike to succor and defend the first ranke, forsomuch as the distance of the ground, from one ranke to another, in any battell, how straight and close soeuer it be, would be neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse so much, that men may manage and handle their weapons and sturre themselues, without being a hinderance or trouble one to another. Therefore it is to be considered, that the distance of the ground, which is betwixt one ranke and an other, dooth take away a good portion of length, in such sort that by reason we may sée, that a pike ought to be in length fiftéene foot, and no lesse, for being so long, footemen standing in order of battell in their places, the third and fourth ranke may commodiouslye abasing themselues, come in aright to succour with their pikes, the first and formost rankes, &amp; this is as much as I can imagine

                  <p>I Will not omit to put those in memorie, that know not of the particular of those things that is required in making a battell of footmen. Therefore those which would make a battell of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, must be aduertised, that in shutting vp of the said battell, the rankes of the pikes, aswell armed as vnarmed, must not raise them vp confusedly, but with order, that is, when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, Captaine, or Sergeant Maior shall say, raise or right vp your pikes, then it is requisite that the first and formost ranke must begin to raise vp it selfe, and that the second do not mooue to raise vp it selfe, vntill the first be all raised vp, &amp; so the third, and fourth. And finally the same order is to be obserued in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rankes, not to raise vp their pikes vntill such time that the rankes that are before them haue raised them vp: and so from one to another, all the rankes of the footmen must obserue this order, aswell in battell as in araye.

Since I haue spoken of the first maner of fight, I will speake of the second, which is, when the enemie dooth assault at vnawares, it is necessarie then couragiouslie not to loose any point of courage, to place his people in square battell, for that it is the most ready and most sure way, that is, making himselfe good flanks with the Hargabuziers of the band, afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the assault, cause his battell to shut and close it selfe wel, causing them to couche and abase, 4 or 5 or somtimes 6 ranks of pikes in that case, round about all the sides of the battel, and the others to stand vpright vntill time of néede: and the Hargabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers are to hold their pikes vpon their thighes, with their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

                  <head>What distance is vsed in Battell betwixt man and man, ranke and ranke.</head>
                  <p>IN this present chapter, you shall perceiue the order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is to be obserued in the distance and space of ground betwixt ranke and ranke of souldiours in battell, and how much space the souldiours do occupie, from shoulder to shoulder, aswell armed with Corslet as vnarmed. Note that it is to be vnderstood of a pikeman, I will first aduertise all Sergeant Maiors, and all good Captaines and Sergeants, and others, that delight in profession of battels, that there be two reasons, wherefore the vnderstanding of these distances, be of importance: the one is to know how much ground is necessary to manage a battell, &amp; how much space the circumference of the battell will take round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, according to the quantitie of the souldiours, that are to be in the said battel. And the other is, that it is néedful to know, how much space is limited to a souldior from shoulder to shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and from one ranke to another. And this proportion hath bin found out and limited, of great practised and cunning men, to the intent that the said distance from one ranke to another, may in a certaine space of time be accomodated, that the souldiours may comodiously manage their pikes, may fight, and in such sort that one ranke of souldiours may succour an other that stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and deale in such sort that all the battell may worke good effect, forasmuch as when they do accommodate themselues ouerstraite and narrowe, they can neither fight nor yet hardlye mooue themselues. And the same inconuenience would chance, if souldiors were placed in battell one ouer farre from another, or one ranke too much distant from an other. Therefore it is a most conuenient thing, to vse in this case those limited rules, that the auncient and moderne souldiours haue set downe, and such as our Captaines haue obserued. The space therefore of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6010:119"/>
grounde, that one Souldiour with his necessaries dooth holde from shoulder to shoulder shall be of thrée foote, and nothing lesse, in such sort, that when any battell is to bee made, let vs put this example, that if there be a ranke of 25 souldiours in a battell, it is néedfull to imagine, that the length of the said 25. footemen shall containe the space of 75. foote, which is fiftéene pace.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of the <hi>Venetian</hi> pace, which is fiue foote for the pace, whereof I meane alwaies to speake. The space moreouer of the ground that is to be obserued for the ouerthwart of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that is, from one ranke to another, that they may be able to manage themselues with their pikes aswell in marching as in fighting in maine battell, no lesse then seauen foote is obserued from one ranke to another. Moreouer to the intent he may more commodiously march with his pike on his shoulder, the ground would be no lesse then of ten foote, which is two pace, but after when they are to close and ioyne more straite, as I haue said before, of 7. foote: in such sort, that a man in ranke with his space before him, will amount to held vnto the other ranke, ten foote, which is two pace, accounting thrée foote of ground which he holds with his person, and the other 7 foote, the space vnto the other ranke, make 10 foote. Let vs then presuppose this figure or example: That he is to make a battell that is a perfect square of twentie euery way, we must count how much ground the said battell will take in circuite, and sée if the same be capable of the number of Souldiours, which are appointed to be put and set in battell.</p>
                  <p>Our rule therefore shall holde vpon two fides, that is, vpon the fronte and the backe, and taile of the battell, where the Souldiours stand shoulder to shoulder, in 60. foote, which is 12. pace, for both sides and both the foresaid sides be 24. pace. The other two sides which be the flankes of the said battell, where the space is left betwixt one ranke and an other of seauen foote, and therefore the person of the souldier which is séene one with an other, in such sorte that the battell which is to be made of 20 Souldiours for euery side, a perfect square of people, but not a perfect square of ground: forasmuch as two sides will be 12. pace on a side, which in both comes to 24. pace: the other two will be for euery side 40. pace, which is 80 pace, and so hauing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6010:119"/>
ioyned vnto the same 24. pace, it will bee round about the said battell of 20 Souldiours on a side 104. pace, which is 520. foote of circumference of ground, and so alwaies this order is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, not that you are to take a corde or a rod, or pace, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the distance of the said battell, but by racke of eye by your witte and discretion consider this measure, for whether it be more or lesse, it little imports. It dooth suffice that you obserue a certaine discretion, that may come to the marke I haue written, if it doe not light iust at leastwise néere the bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure I haue set downe. Now since we haue put this figure and example of a perfect square battel of people, but not of ground for 20. souldiers, we wil speak of an other forme or figure, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing or disagréeing from such like battels, and yet for all that of the same number of twentie Souldiours, for euery side in perfect square, the which is square of people &amp; of ground, as some doe vse to make, as may appeare in a battell of 400. Souldiours, square in ground and people: the which being in this forme, hath for space of ground about in circumference 800. foote, which is 160. pace. This is sufficient to remember you of the manner that is obserued in the distance and measure in the circumference of the battell.</p>
                  <p>And now returning to my discourse of one ranke from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, when the Souldiours are ioined &amp; closed in battell with their pikes, &amp; when they stand in terme to fight, to me it séemes, that then in that accident, the battell is to close and ioyne as straight together as is possible, in such sort as they may manage and bestir themselues with their weapons, without being an impediment one to another, to the intent that the rankes being straite in fighting, or that the souldiors be inuaded by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or that they recoile by force of an onset, they néed not to fal to the ground, but rather that they may by those ranks that bee behinde their backes receiue helpe, that vndersetting them with their brests, they may hold them straight vp vpon their féete. And this is not onely my opinion, but of diuers other mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6010:120"/>
the soldiors may receiue exercise &amp; discipline in the said battell, in the which alwaies the foresaid order of measure &amp; distance is to be obserued, to the intent that the Sergeant &amp; the other heads which do gouerne them, may the more comodiously manage and enter in and out through the space of the said ranks.</p>

                  <head>How battels of euery number of footmen are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and placed together in order.</head>
                  <p>MAny &amp; sundry be the waies which be obserued in compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding together the battels of footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but I verely thinke that the most expedient &amp; short way amongst practised soldiors is in these two sorts: that is the one to ioyne together the battel with diuided maniples, and the other to double the ranks of the aray. The sergeant Maior, Captaine, or other Sergeant, hauing first determined in his minde of how many men in a ranke he will make his battell, knowing first the number of the pikes that are to be had: so making of one company, as he may do of many one onely battell: &amp; procéeding to make the battell in which of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> waies he list, either by parting it into maniples, or by doubling the ranks. It is therefore first requisite, to set the footmen in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray that are to be found there present, numbring all the pikes, and accomodating the araye in such sort that the battell may afterwards be made withall spéed, and that it may serue the turne, for either of those two waies, as I haue said. It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie therefore to know the place where the battell is to be set, and to take care that there be so much space as may be capable thereof, knowing the rules of distance, which is vsed in warfare that is, how much ground the Souldiours hold from shoulder to shoulder, and how much distance is left betwixt ranke and ranke of pikes. But touching the measure I néed to speake no more, for that the officer may measure the ground by pases: yet I would commend a Souldiour that is of such discretion, that of himselfe can accomodate those things by racke of eye, without such precise trouble in measuring the grounde. And if a battell require 300. paces in circumference, hee by racke of his eye maye sée whether the place bee capable or no, noting that the rules to put the distance of ranckes, is made for this other respect, which is of much more importance, that the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6010:120"/>
rankes of the battell may fight without any impediment of the Souldiers, foreséeing that euerie third ranke may succour the first with their pikes: and speaking of battels you must euer thinke that I speake of pikes, for battels are neuer made of hargabusiers: it is verie true that hauing made the battels of pikes, you may accommodate them afterwards as you list about the battels, by the flankes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corners &amp; hornes, or betwixt one pike and another of the formost rankes of the battell, or in such other sundry wayes as may best aid and helpe the battell: let i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> suffice that of Hargabusiers there is neuer any certaine rule set downe, but euer is to be vnderstood of the order of pikes in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: of the which two wayes, where I speake how a battell must be made wel and spéedily, I will endeuour my selfe to let you vnderstand the way the best I can. Desiring therefore to worke by the first way I haue spoken of: that is, to make any battell by maniples, if it be to be made of any one company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, let it be of what number soeuer of footmen, it is first requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to set the aray with intent to diuide it into thrée parts, that is to say, into 3. maniples, which may be iust of as many rankes one as another, in the which maniples, you ought by numbring the rankes of the pikes, cause the Ensignes of the said aray to kéepe one ranke like vnto the pikes, and this is obserued when the thrée maniples be vneuen: that is to say, that two of them should chance to be of 20. ranks, and the 3. of 19. or 18. rankes, and then the Ensignes shalbe numbred for one ranke: but alwayes the other two maniples are to be of iust number, as for example. There is a company of 300. pikes, the which if you desire to put in aray before you make your battell, consider how many ranks they will be 5. in a rank, and you shal finde them to be 60. ranks: diuide the aray into 3. parts, cutting them off at euery 20. ranks, and after draw vp to the first ranke the second part, that is, the maniple of the middest, and ioyne in order the first ranke to the head of the first maniple, the which being on the right hand of the maniple with the Ensignes, you shal draw then the 3. maniple to the left side, ioyning the first rankes to the head of the other two maniples: so that the aray hauing bene of fiue for a ranke, the battel shalbe one way 15. and the other way of 20. pikes. Now desiring to haue the battell to be more large in the front, then in the flankes, the which I commend, of what number soeuer the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:6010:121"/>
pikes are of, he shall cause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sergeant to go to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flank where he would make the front, and standing still a little distance forth of the battel, he shal crie aloud, <hi>Turne your faces this way,</hi> the which being heard of the souldiers, sodainly they shall turne them selues towards that side which he shall giue them notice of. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue then this order at all times: when you haue made a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, let the pikes be of what number soeuer, let it suffice y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at al times when you list to make the front where the flanke is, so that the place where you would make it be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and commodious, that you may frame and make the battell according to your determination, you must cause them to turne their faces towards that side where you would haue the front of the battell to be. I iudge it good likewise to aduertise you, that desiring to make any battell with maniples, for that it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fals out, that some rankes in the aray do remaine vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, which are called broken rankes: these are taken out &amp; are accommodated about at the sides of the Ensignes, so diuided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse that they may remaine in good order. The which Ensignes, alwayes when you make any battell, you must haue respect that they may haue a large roome and space, that they may accommodate themselues with the souldiers, which make the broken number, as for example in aray of fiue and fiue in a ranke, in the last ranks there remaines 3. or 4. souldiers, which do not furnish out the full ranke. And the like is to be obserued when you are to part your aray into 3. maniples, and that they haue some rankes more then the entire and full aray. As would fall out hauing to make an aray of 500. pikes, and put the case that you would place them 7. and 7. in a ranke, they would fall out to be 71. rankes, and 3. pikes more: and diuiding into thrée parts these 71. pikes and 3. pikes, they amount to 23. rankes, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the 3. maniples, as I haue said, so that 3. times 23. makes 69. rankes, and there is ouer and besides two rankes of the aray and 3. pikes, which is in all the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> number 17. pikes, which in making of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battell, must be set aside by themselues, vntil the 3. maniples be ioyned in battell, the which on one side will be 23. pikes, &amp; on the other 21. The 17. pikes then that are taken out, shal be accommodated, diuided here &amp; there where the Ensignes stand. And when it fals out that there doth arise to be pikes or broken rankes, that are so many as were able to make a whole
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6010:121"/>
ranke in the battel, then it is to be made, ioyning it either before or behind the Ensignes, or at the flankes of the battell, or where it shal fal out to be best, for it imports not much: and so you work by this rule of maniples, in one companie alone as well as with many. And hauing to make a battell of sundrie companies, the true rule is to work by these maniples, and you must procéed in this sort. First take order with all the heads of the companies, that they frame all their order of aray in one manner and sort, &amp; if any of the said heads haue any greater number of pikes then his commission doth allow, let him take them forth &amp; giue them in supplie to those Captaines that are found to haue lesse then he hath appointed for their aray. Let vs then vse this example in this sort, that is, that if there be found in companie or in any other place, vnder the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ten Captaines, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 3. thousand souldiers in aray, that is to say, only pikes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rate of thrée hundred vnder euerie Captaine, being iust 3000. of which the Sergeant Maior hauing to make a battaillon must do in this sort. He must giue order to all the Sergeants of the bands, that they make all their araies after one sort, &amp; after one number, and the one head or front being distant from the other a little, he shall cause their arayes to march, and let vs put the case that the Sergeant Maior haue giuen them order, that they place themselues sixe and sixe, there will be in euerie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie 50. rankes, and so it is néedfull that euerie one haue put their aray 6. and 6. in 50. rankes, and desiring to ioyne and close these battels, he shal cause these companies to march one after an other, &amp; shall close them togither, ioyning the first rankes to the head of the aray one of another, knitting the maniples to their portion: and this battell will fall out to be on one side 50. pikes, which wil be flanks, and the other which wil be the front, wil be of 60. pikes, for so much as being 10. maniples, 6. in a rank, it wil fal out to be iust, as I haue said before: to make it a right square, it wil be of 54. on euery side remaining out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battel 84, which at pleasure may be put in ranke, &amp; so taking 54. out of 84, there remaines 30. pikes, which being not able to make a ranke, are to be placed about the Ensignes, as I haue said before.</p>
                  <p>There be othersome, that hold this other manner in making of battels, to double the ranks, that is, hauing set his araie, and marching with them, they begin at the head of the aray, where
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6010:122"/>
the Sergeant staying, doth cause them to march forward, and the first beginning to passe, doth appoint the second that it ioyne it selfe with the first, and so the third with the fourth. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ray going forward, doth cause the rankes to double two by two: so that if first the ranke were 9. and 9. they arise to be 18. in a ranke. And desiring to make them more large, he may put 3. rankes in one, which will be 27. in a ranke, and so he may double them to what number he wil, and of as many ranks as he will, but it is requisite before he make his aray, to consider well how many pikes he hath, and afterward accommodating his aray to his appointed number, that by doubling it by two or thrée rankes, it may become as square as is possible, neither is he to do it without this consideration, for otherwise working by haphazard, it fals out to be euill fauoured, to be by halfe more long then large, and sometimes double: But it is first necessarie for him to number the rankes of the aray, and consider if dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling two rankes at a time, it will fall out to be well, or better to double it thrée at a time. And this must be well considered, for otherwise he shall make and vnmake to his great disgrace. Therefore now I conclude, that the first way is euer best &amp; most readie without toile or trouble in doubling and redoubling: So that helping your memorie with certain <hi>Tablei</hi> or <hi>Tariffas</hi> made of purpose to know the numbers of the souldiers that are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ranke, and what number of rankes will performe the iust square, you can neuer erre, but vpon any sodaine, set in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell any number of souldiers whatsoeuer.</p>

For the better performance whereof, immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he enters into his charge, let him kéepe a booke and roll of al the bands committed to his gouernement, with the names of their Captaines &amp; officers, and to examine and peruse whether they containe their full number of men, and be sufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with horse, armour, cassocks, péeces, lances, with their Pennons of their Captaines colours, guidons, trumpets, &amp; such like necessaries as appertaines to their warlike profession, otherwise to procure supply.

In the morning he must giue notice &amp; warning to such horsmen as he entendeth shal watch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night ensuing, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent they may féed &amp; spare their horses y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, &amp; likewise rest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, that they may the better be able to do such seruice, as they shal the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing be enioyned. When the high marshal goeth to view the ground to encampe vpon, it is this Lieutenants dutie to select a conuenient band to attend vpon his person, and to appoint such a company as may afterward take their rest, and féede their horses til such time as he shal deliuer them to the scout master at night, who then shal enioyne them what to do all the night after, &amp; shal also deliuer them the watchword. This Lieutenant, as a coadiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to the lord Marshall and Sergeant maior, ought all the day whiles the battels march, diligently to note the orders of euerie band, &amp; if he sée any disorder, forth with to send for the Captaine, &amp; cause him immediatly to sée it redressed. At night when the army entreth into the campe, the Litutenant shall still cause the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to kéepe the field, vntil al the footmen be encamped, then may he enter with his bands of horse orderly, causing first one band to enter &amp; all the rest to kéepe the fielde, &amp; when they haue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient place, then another band to enter, and so orderly to place themselues, wherin the Lieutenant is to foresee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the last bands be not worst lodged, but such conuenient place left, as they haue no iust cause to complaine: and this is to be obserued in places of suspect, otherwise they may lodge abrode amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Uillages for their greater ease. Let him giue order that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Couriers &amp; scourers come not out of the field, till y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trumpet sound to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> watch at night, nor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither, vntil such time as they shall perceiue the scout &amp; Sentinel, to be come from the camp, &amp; to haue taken their places in the field: then may they returne into the Campe. It is his part likewise to assigne a sufficient number of horse to attend on the forrage master, to gard &amp; defend the forragiers, which horsemen must not come out of the field vntil al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forragers be returned to the camp with the forrage master. Then shal these horsemen rest &amp; not watch, neither that night, nor go forth for vauntcourrier al the next day. He must appoint a reasonable conuoy of horsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the saftie of such as bring victuals to the campe, to sée that no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or iniurie be offered them, &amp; so order the change of his horse in these seuerall seruices, that some be not ouer burthened, and others spared ouermuch, but the matter so indifferently vsed, that men haue no cause to murmure or repine.</p>

The sides of these massie squadrons should haue one rank of Argolateares, a pretie distance off. In this sort if one squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron happen to be broken, yet shal another make head vpon the enimie, while they may retyre &amp; troupe againe, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly safetie as wel of Horsemen as footmen: And albeit in the day of seruice it is the part of the high marshall himselfe, to giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what sort, and with what troupes the charges shalbe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or receiued: it is also the Lieutenants part as well to giue his aduise, as also to be a leader in all these actions.</p>
               <p>He ought therefore to take great regard to the ground where he meaneth to giue the charge, for if he charge in troupe, the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a few horse in the for most rankes may disorder and foile the whole troupe. Before the front of his owne footmen let him neuer giue charge, for it hath bin séene that horsemen being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed, haue bene foreed in vpon their own footmen, &amp; disordered them. Let the horse therefore charge vpon the flanke of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and diligently attend if by any accident they can perceiue any breaking or opening in the side of his enimies battell, and then sodainly to charge that breach: for as horsemen are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to wel ordered footmen, so vpon any smal disorder, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with them victory. And for that in our age there hath arisen diuers &amp; fodaine effects not looked for, wrought by the good and well guiding of horsemen, I thinke it good somewhat more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to delate vpon this point: specially, as I said before, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing out a place, apart from the battel &amp; ranks, wherin the <hi>Cauallarie</hi> may be ranged: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent they may with good scope fréely and fitly turne and run with their squadrons and ranks in charging the enimy, in taking charge likewise of them, and in all other enterprises, considering that the troopes of horsemen in retyring or turning round, do often disorder and break their own infanterie, either through the discommoditie of the place, or through the want of the good and warie guiding of them.</p>

But yet are they not able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a well ordered &amp; square battell of pikes, if their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and well ranged rankes keepe their araie, and when the horsemen charge doe clinge and sarrie verie néere together in the fore rancke, and set shoulder to shoulder with their pikes well couched and crossed, bending them in both their handes straight before them, and their followers at their backes, laying theyr pikes ouer their foregoers shouldiers, and so stand at the push, besides the shouldering of the foreranks together, hauing pitched their pikes vnder one of their feete in the ground, they stoope and bow downe so loe with their bodies, that their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers may easilie come to seruice behinde their backes, where some doe vse to place the light armed pikes, who amongst some nations for want of brest plates of Iron, vse tand lether, paper, platecoates, iackets, &amp;c. For a gorget, thicke folded kerchefes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neck, a scull of Iron for a head péece, and a Uenetian or lether Shéeld and Target at their backes, to vse with their short Swordes at the close of a battaile, and in a throng. The squadron of pikemen, hauing couched and crossed their pikes brest high, closely sarred together, are as hard to be pearst with horsemen, as an angrie Porcapine or Hedgehog with the end of a bare finger. Wherefore to ouerthrowe a maine square battaile planted in that order, it is good to vse the aide of Hargolateares, who must first scale the fronte and ranks of the battels, and then being seconded by the lances &amp; men at armes, breake their araie and whole battaile. In the erecution whereof it is good to vse the Rutters order, which somewhat differs from the French mans fight, for he encountring the enemie cannot indure any troope to be néere his long stretched ranckes, because of breaking his course; but the retire fighteth in this sort.</p>

Then the third followeth the second, to giue the charge as soone as euer he séeth him departed that stood before him: all the rankes following one another in such maner, euen vnto the last, the hindermost runneth, (they fighting with Pistolets one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) for to come vnto their foreriders, they standing all along one at anothers backe. And for so much as it is impossible, but that when they do present themselues, some of them or else their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be slaine: Therefore so soone as euer one of the formost ranke is séene to fall downe, he that is in the second ranke, directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him that is departed, or else disabled, must take his place, and the next behind him in the third ranke, must furnish the same voide ranke wherein he was in the second, and so the rest in like order, so that they alwaies make their formost rankes of the most assured: for in all things, namely in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Some others hold an opinion, that the maner of the Germans is best, who kéepe alwaies their maine troopes standing, &amp; cause only one ranke from the front to charge, &amp; the same being repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to retire to the taile and backe of the standing troope, &amp; then an other to charge and retire to the taile &amp; backe, as the former, whereby they maintaine the whole troope in full strength, vntil they sée the footmen sway or breake, &amp; that their horsemen enter. Then presently they back them with an other ranke, &amp; those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with an other, vntill they sée cause either to follow with the whole troope, or to staie: &amp; this is thought to be the surest and most orderly forme of charging of all others: notwithstanding the accustomed whéeling about of the rutters, which they vse with their whole troopes, euery one after an other, giuing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie a volée of their Pistolets.</p>

maintained within &amp; about the ordinance, but because that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not to the scoutmaster, I let it passe. It is requisite in the long cold winter nights to change and relieue the watch at euerie houres end, in autumne &amp; the spring, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of an houre and a halfe: and in the hoate season of summer at two houres end, but these things must be ordered more or lesse as the scoute maister and other principall officers shall thinke méete, for the better preseruation of the people, and the accomplishment of the seruice, sending forth rounds euerie houre. In the morning so soone as the trumpet soundeth to the reléefe of the watch, he must repaire to the sayd Liuetenants tent, there to receiue by his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signement, a conuenient number of horsemen to scoure that day, and then shal he giue order vnto some, to ride to the highest hils to view round about what they can espie, and others to the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and other obscure passages, woods, or such like, and to ride one from another a good distance: so as if one chance to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by the enemie, yet the rest may escape, and bring intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence therof: &amp; so soone as the scoutmaister shall receiue any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisment by the Courriers, he shall forthwith repaire to the high Marshall, and informe him of euery particularitie.</p>
                  <p>In the placing of his night watches &amp; sentinels, he must vse great consideration, first in setting his little troopes or bodies of the watch, in some places of strength, so as they may be able, when the enemie shall approach, to make resistance, and defend themselues, vntill such time as the campe may put themselues in armes: and besides these troopes, he shall giue order that two or thrée shall walke foorth one waie, and as many another way, and if they happen to sée any matches light, or heare any noyse, foorthwith one to repaire to the body of the watch, and so to the scoutemaister, and the other to stay till they can more plainely perceiue what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter is. And it shalbe alwaies good to match some Hargabuse or Musketeare, together with pikemen, as well that they may be the better able to defend themselues, as also by the discharge of their hargabuze, to giue warning to the rest, if any of them should happen to be surprised by the enemie.</p>
                  <p>This officer ought to be both diligent &amp; painefull, considering how great a charge dependeth vpon these scouts, no lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preseruation or destruction of the whole campe, and therefore he ought continually both day &amp; night, either himselfe in person, or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:6010:127"/>
by some other of great trust in his absence, from time to time, to peruse and examine the order and demeanour of these Scoutes and courriers, giuing order for reformation of all that he shall finde amisse, and so soone as he shall receiue any intelligence, forthwith to aduertise the Lord High Marshall. This officer in the auncient Romaine warres was neuer in vse, for they would neuer admit any watch without the trenches of their campe, but obserued this order, that euery night one third part of the armie remained armed, the other two thirds tooke their rest: and this armed part they deuided into 4 quarters, and appointed to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie watch of the night one quarter, which went and walked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually about the trenches of the Campe, to heare and sée if they could discerne any noise or stirring néere the Campe: the other thrée quarters resting in the meane time returned to the place of assemblie. And when the first watch of the night was ended, then departed an other quarter to the reléefe of the watch, and the quarter that had watched returned to the place of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie. And thus they continued reléeuing the watch vntill day: so that the enemie could neuer approch their campe, but they found one third part in armes, who were able to kéepe them play, vntil the rest had put themselues in order. But after that Militarie discipline grew to corruption, &amp; that souldiors neglecting honor and securitie, would no longer abide the hardnesse and the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the auncient discipline, they inuented this kind of forren scoute, that the paines of a few might leaue the rest at ease. But what mischiefe hath and may thereby ensue, histories will shew vs, and common reason may soone teach vs. Therefore in time of danger and suspect of the enemie, I would notwithstanding the forren scoutes and left sentinels, vse this Romaine diuision and strong order of watch.</p>

                  <p>In most manner of encampings, he must so diuide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarters as euery nation may be placed by it selfe, and euery Collonel by himself, &amp; dispose the horsmen &amp; footmen distinctly in sunder, that euery quarter may haue his place of armes, &amp; market place for victuals: touching which, he ought to take great care of equall distribution, that he may entertaine &amp; gratifie with special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, euery nation that serues in the army.

                  <p>Let him prouide that the Pioners accommodate &amp; make easie, euerie foule way, strait passage &amp; encombrance, and to cleare the wayes before the great ordenance: whereupon one partie must attend, and therein to performe so much as is conuenient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing respect to the commoditie or losse of any particular person, or to the preiudice or discommoditie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you march: which things do lesse import, then the perill, the hinderance &amp; reputation of an army being an assembly of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so great valour &amp; importance, for whom the Marshall ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to procure with al possible diligence, al commodities and aduantage to kéepe the armie in reputation, and to maintaine it sound &amp; lusty, to the intent that with an vndoubted presage the Generall may promise himselfe victorie in due time and place.</p>
                  <p>Togither with the other aduertisements, for the commodity &amp; enioying of victuals &amp; merchandise, he must yet further care to lodge his armie in such a place, that as néere as is possible, it may be an impediment to the enimies prouision or commodity.</p>
                  <p>He must ordaine that the footmen and horsemen of euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be placed &amp; diuided in such sort, that by their orderly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the seat of the campe may be well garded, easily and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, it is necessarie to dispose and plant the <hi>Corps de gard,</hi> and the bodie of the watch about the Camp in places most suspected, and best for the purpose, which in the day must consist of horsemen, &amp; in the night of footmen, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent the army may at all times remaine without feare of sodaine surprises, or be assaulted vnprouided: which thing as it is of maruellous mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, so sometimes it may be incrediblie preiudiciall.</p>

                     </gap>rme with a certaine diligent mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, thereby not to displease any person, that either particularly or principally, either is or hath bin inuested with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like charge, as the Sergeant Maior, the general of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Artillerie, or the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the whole armie, besides other priuate Collonels and Captaines, &amp;c. which aduertisement I only giue by the way, for that he may endeuour himselfe to please euerie one, although the authority of his office doth expresly extend resolutely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in things pertaining to the saftie of the field and campe.</p>
                  <p>Let him moreouer call continually to memory, that the art of warre doth require a sharpe and exemplar manner and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chastisement, therby to remaine the better obeyed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which thing is of principall &amp; great importance: for since that in that place his Prince doth not only fight for the dearest thing he hath, but also for the health of his proper person, and all his subiects, it behooues him to be readie and perfite in such causes.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is a most necessarie thing for him to note, that there is gathered togither in the Armie, great numbers of people of diuers customes, of sundrie ages, and of minde and disposition not alwayes correspondent. Therefore he that through insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy wil not obserue the lawes of armes, so important as nothing more in the honorable exercise of Militarie profession, let him be constrained to obserue due obedience, through horrour &amp; feare of punishment.</p>
                  <p>To the Marshal of the fielde, it appertaines to take order eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, soone after the <hi>Diana,</hi> that the Conuoyes, Ascoltes, and safegards do appeare before and come to his lodging to receiue their Commission, not only for the safegard and assurance of the merchants and victuallers, which come and go from the campe, but also as wel for the baggage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> footmen, as the horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who

These connoyes, safgards &amp; Ascoltes ought to be of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and guided by a Captaine of great discretion &amp; experience.</p>
                  <p>When the armie shall remoue, the high marshall must first giue order to the master of the Ordinance, that he set forth the Artillerie, with all the carriages, munition, &amp;c. then the master of the victuals and cariages afterwards.</p>
                  <p>He must after giue order to the Sergeant Maior, in what sort he will haue the battell to march that day: and to the scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master which way he will send his vauntcurrours to discouer if all be cleare, who must from time to time giue intelligence what occurrence he discouereth. The high Marshall when he goeth to view the ground where he intendeth to incampe, may by his authoritie take such number of horsmen, as he shal think conuenient, and then is he to consider that there be nigh at hand, as I said before, wood, water, and forrage enough for the Army: and if he intend long to lodge in that place, then must he make his campe the larger, and prouidently consider, that euery Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue his conuenient place, that the tents and cabbins be not pitched and made nigh the ring of the campe: that there bée large places of assemblie within the campe: that it be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched and fortified, for which respectes it is requisite that the Martial haue knowledge in Geometrie &amp; Arithmetike, and that he haue in a readinesse sundrie plats, models &amp; formes, as partly I haue annexed hereunto, whereby he may be able to resolue for any number or situation, what forme or quantitie of Campe is most conuenient, and presently stake it out, assigning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that sort in a field of two or thrée acres, I haue séene a guydon of Rutters very well lodged &amp; commodiously, with railes or poles betwéene their horses, and bowes about them for the winde or heat, some with hales ouer them to kéepe them from the raine: their saddels, bridels, and al other their furniture, hanging vpon poles readie by them, neatly kept &amp; blacked, their mangers also before them: for all such necessaries the Ruiters carrie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their wagons and carriages, besides little whéele barrowes to carrie away their doung, so that their campe is no lesse cleane &amp; orderly, then a princes stable. A faire stréete they alwayes leaue betwéene their owne cabbines &amp; their horses: They haue certain troopes of their seruants, whom they cal their knights, and these troupes alwayes attend, that so soone as the Marshall hath limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their quarters, they depart immediatly to the next woods, for poles, bowes, stakes and other necessaries to build their campe, stables, and cabbines: other go for forrage, that before the army approch, the lodgings alwayes are in a readines. To euerie 12. Ruiters commonly there is allowed a wagon with 4 horses, or to sixe a cart with two horses, and their knights are about one third part of the number of their horsemen. The Lance knights also encampe alwayes in the field verie strongly, two or thrée to a cabinet, their pikes &amp; armour standing vp by them in a redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; so orderly placed with stréets, so conuenient &amp; cleanly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that their campe is no lesse holesome then strong: I haue séene sixe thousand of them lodge in sixe or seuen acre of ground, which proportion differeth not much from that of the old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
                  <p>The high Marshall, as well for the ordering of sconts, as all other matters of importance in the campe, is to giue order, and at the setting of the watch his trumpets ought first to sound, and then all the residue of the trumpets in order to answere euerie one to his seueral quarter, and in the morning al the trumpets should assemble before the Lord Lieutenants tent, and there to sound the reliefe of the watch, but no man must vpon paine of death remoue from his charge, vntill the warders be come out, then may euerie man depart to his rest.</p>
                  <p>In the fielde at a day of seruice, though there be a Generall of the horsemen, yet is it the place of the high Marshall to serue there as chiefe, &amp; to appoint in how manie troopes the horsemen
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6010:131"/>
shall diuide themselues, and which shall charge, &amp; which stand for their rescue, and to prohibite, that vpon euerie crie amongst the footemen, of march <hi>Cauallarie,</hi> or forward horsemen, they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> not remoue, disband or giue charge, but onely by knowne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter signes and watch words from the Generall, that inuasions may be made at due times and when necessitie requires, &amp; not for euerie trifle or priuate danger of some persons, for otherwise their disbanding out of time may arise to be ruine and losse of an armie in a day of battell.</p>
                  <p>If any prisoners be taken in the fielde, they ought forthwith to be enrold in the Marshals booke, and then if any make claime to any other mans prisoner, the Marshal as iudge to determine who shall haue him, and for euerie prisoner brought into the Marshall sea and enrolled in the Marshals booke, his fée is eight pence: he is also to haue of al booties taken in the field &amp; brought into the campe the third part: but as well for this as other his fées, they are by the General to be limited at the beginning, as shall be thought reasonable. Finally the high Marshal ought to be a man of such perfection, that he know the duetie of euerie inferiour officer, and be able to reforme their misdéeds, and that of his owne knowledge. The handling of small matters must be committed to his Prouost, who ought to be a chosen person, alwayes retaining the greater causes, and such as concerne life to be heard by himselfe, who for his greater reputation, and to be knowne from other officers, he should haue a Cornet or gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don borne before him in the fielde, as I haue séene the pages, seruants, wiues and women in <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> his campe, attend in no lesse good order, then any well gouerned band.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as it appertaineth chiefly to the high Mashal to gouerne the execution of the Militarie lawes, I therein refer him to my first booke, wherein I thought it more necessary to be set downe then in this place, to the intent the souldiers may dayly heare their dueties, and not to offend through ignorance: vnto which lawes some thinke it necessarie, that not onely eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Captaine and Collonel should be sworne, but also after the old Romaine manner, euery particular souldier at his entring into pay, or at the consecration of the Ensigne, to make his oath ioyntly vnto them both, for which cause the Romaine warfare was termed <hi>Militia Sacrata.</hi>

                  <head>Directions for the marching of an armie, whether it be inferiour or equall to the enemie.</head>
                  <p>VVHen an armie dooth march néere vnto the enemies bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, the high marshall, Sergeant Maior, and Collonels, ought to vse diuers considerations. First a Prince or his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, not being of like force to the enemie, or that he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to giue battell, because he will not hazard all his state and armie in one day into the hands of fortune, he must prouide (specially if he be inferior in Caualarie) that he march through a countrie that is rough, full of hils, and where the situation of the ground is of such aduautage, that the enemie haue not any motion to assault him. But when he cannot shun the same, then must he prouide at leastwise, to enter into the action thereof, to his great aduantage, and almost with a certaine hope of victory, the which will not arise to be difficile, if he can apply the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of situations to serue his turne.</p>
                  <p>In marching, I would wish him to haue one part of his light horsemen so neere the enemie, that euery houre he may haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what way he dooth march, notwithstanding in a countrie where mounts and hils be not fauourable, but that of necessitie you must march through plaines and champaine countries, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6010:133"/>
that the enemie is néere at hand, and that it is very hard to shun the battell, I iudge it not farre amisse, to accept the battell, so that you be of greater strength in horsemen, for being the stronger, the iourney in no respect is to be fled, for so much as horsemen yéeld the greatest part of the victorie, when they bee well guided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the fift in Germany against the protestants armie, by reason of the commoditie of the ground, for the most part, did not lodge his army further off from his enemies, then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the shot of a Coluerine, although he was far inferior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Neuerthelesse that order cannot be alwaies vsed when an armie is in the champaine countrie, for he that is in plaines and is not desirous to fight, he must march from the enemie 9 or 10 miles, and must determine to fortifie himselfe at each lodging, in such sort that neither the enemies <hi>Cauallarie</hi> or infanterie, may be able in battell to enter into his campe, if not with great difficultie.</p>
                  <p>A meane fortification is sufficient in a champaine countrie, chiefely when it is to be made with spéede, which beginning of fortification, when you meane to continue, may encrease and be made as strong as you sée the case doth require. When an armie dooth march inplaines and champaine countries, &amp; that it comes to that point, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it is able to haue any little riuer or wood which may couer one flanke of the said armie, you must go about with all diligence to take this aduantage, for that the same will arise to be of great importance. Prouide euer that the bagage and the artillarie go continually on the contrarie side to the enemie, or at leastwise in the midst of the armie. The squadrons of men at armes must as appertaineth, flanke the battels and rankes of footmen towards the enemie.</p>
                  <p>It is a laudable custome to deuide an armie into thrée squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, that is to say, into the auantgard battell, and arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and that euery day they do exchange, making of the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the battell, and of the battell the reargard, &amp; it is requisite, that euery one of them haue his necessary number of horsmen &amp; Hargaloteares, &amp; that each one be disposed and placed in his due ranke. Order must be carefully taken, that amongst the ranks of the footmen, vnprofitable people be not intermedled, but that all the baggage be in a place deputed for the same, vnder the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uosts
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6010:133"/>
guidon. Also that amongst the squadrons of the horsemen, there be no vnprofitable horses nor other impediments. The Rutters <hi>Cauallaries</hi> vse héerein a meruailous strict order, and extreame diligence, which verily dooth merit to be imitated. It is a commendable thing also, when the light horsmen be in such sort deuided and dispersed for discouerie of the countrie, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying the actions of the enemies armie, as that they may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually returne and giue intelligences of the enemies demeanor, whereby if néede require, commoditie and leasure may be had to prouide for fight.</p>
                  <p>If the marshall of the field haue no experience of the countrie himselfe, it is requisite that he carrie such a personage, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <hi>Cauallier</hi> with him, as he knowes to haue experience, that with them he may consider well of the situation and place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is to march with his armie through plaines, by or néere hils, or in valleys that haue hils ou both sides, or by or néere to woods, or alongst or néere a riuer. It is also requisite y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the light horse, aswell for the discouerie of the enemie, as otherwise to take the bredth of the straits &amp; passages go before, and to make certificate, that according to the bredth the hoast may march.</p>
                  <p>And put case that one part of the way be 15. foot broode, the hoast shall be made to march by fiue in a ranke, because euery footman will haue thrée foote in breadth from shoulder to shoulder, and sixe foote in ranke betwixt ranke and ranke, and one foote for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie person, so that 21 foote in breadth and 2 myles in length, will containe an armie of ten thousand. After the same reason, whether there be 20 or 30 thousand footemen, according to the measuring of ground by the foote, they may be set in order very easily, neither can the leader be deceiued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knoweth how many armed men euery place can containe: and after the same order as the place dooth enlarge, he must enlarge the rankes, causing part of the shot to goe before the aray, and part behind, and others to go in succoures of the horsemen, that go in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the passages, and the ambushments, with the whole dooings of the enemie: and let an other part be for vantgard &amp; retrogard to the aray, to be able to serue them at néed, and an other part to go alwaies at the flankes of the raie, the which if there be dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, shal serue as a countermure against the enemies horsmen. And if they be men at armes, they must march on both the sides
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6010:134"/>
of the battell, and also of the Hargabuzies that do march by the flankes of the battell, and the light horsemen to serue for scoutes both before and behind the aray.</p>
                  <p>There must be likewise abundance of Pyoners and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to make places plaine, and to cast downe ditches &amp; bridges, and to make defences and other necessarie things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in marching, the which must be garded by your light horse and shot, and when you depart to faine to go to some other place, then that you go so, and if there be no men at armes to appoint to euery regiment certaine Hargabuziers to serue on horsebacke, the which may serue in stéed of men at armes, and when occasion serues to serue on foote againe, wherein the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualiers</hi> of S. <hi>Georges</hi> squadre, may very well be imployed. It is requisite that all souldiers follow their leaders, and carrie a great care and diligence in marching, to the intent that by sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den assaults they be not at euerie step to arise in a rumor, and confusedly to runne héere and there, and the one to go contrarie to the other, and finally comming about them, not to be able to do any thing of any profit.</p>
                  <p>For which cause thou oughtest to march with thine armie through euery place in battell ray, whereby the souldiers may be made more apt and spéedie to make a voyage, and quicke and ready to resist if néed shall be. The Souldiers according to my former directions, being trained to follow the Ensignes, &amp; apt to obey commaundements, and to behaue themselues valiantly according to their place and order, if thou march in a plaine countrie, it is requisite that thy pikes march in battell ray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring thine armie into a little space, so that by the straightnes and facilitie of inlarging, thou be not constrained to extend thy selfe into too much length, which fashion of marching séemes to giue occasion and power to the enemie, to assault commodiously their aduersaries, &amp; according to the occasion to endomage them, he beholding the commoditie to defend themselues to be taken away, forasmuch either with more largenesse comming against thée, the which is woont to happen both the hornes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, it is like that he shall easily disorder thée, and put thée to flight, or els giuing charge on the flanke in the midst of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, hauing already broken thine order, sodenly stop thy men from being able to go forward, being closed in the arayes of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6010:134"/>
enemies. Wherefore minding to retire in a maine battell, and to returne to resist, they shall be able to do little good, as those that haue vsed such a maine battell, which for want of thicknes is nothing strong, but altogether weake. Also if the enemie should charge thée on the rearward, thou shalt be brought to the very same necessitie, because thou shalt be so compassed, as thy fronts shall not be able to succour the last, or the last to succour the first. For the which thing it is alwaies better and more sure and easier to gouerne the bands that march close and square, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thin and long: especially, forasmuch as to an army that marcheth long, oftentimes happens that of some thing séeme doubtful and vncertaine, there groweth suddenly feare and terror, because sometimes it hath chaunced, that men discending from high and hillie places into the plaine, to places expedient and open, and the formost séeing the last of the same band by a great distance to come after, supposing themselues to be assaulted of some am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush of enemies, it hath béene séene that they haue suddenly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fight, &amp; afterwards no otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies gone toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the eares with their owne companions. If, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the victuales, carriages, and munition, be not conducted in the midst of the armie, but if otherwise the hindermost part would be garded &amp; defended of the most valiant souldiers, as in the fronts, because that at vnawares may happen many things, thy light horsmen going before, disciphering and espying where they may passe, hauing occasion to passe by mountaines, woodes, places closed with hils, and most great desarts, because the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie many times will lay an ambush priuilie by the passage to assault his aduersarie, who taking little héed thereof, haue béene easily broken and brought to vtter decay. The which ambush, if the conductor by way of exploratoures shall foresée, with a little paine, hauing preuented the suares of the enemie, may win a worthie name of politike prudence, and likewise saue his armie from imminent ruine. And as for the plaines, thou with thine owne eies maist sée a far of, forasmuch as in the day dust mooued and lifted vp into the aire, dooth shew the moouing and stirring of the enemy, and in the night the fires and flames signifieth the campe to be there. When thy men are to be conducted, and not fight, thou oughtest to remooue by day, if peraduenture some thing do not constraine thée, for the which thou thinkest it good
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6010:135"/>
to go in hast to come before thine enemie, where in déed for such occasion thou must remooue in the night, so that thou know it may safely be doone to fight with the enemie. Lead th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Forsomuch as there are diuers formes of marching, according to the ground and diuersities of mens minds, I haue onely thought it good to set downe this figure ensuing, as very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and of great force for an armie, with his whole carriages to

Let there be an armie of 40000. footemen, and 14000. horsemen, according to the proportion set downe, there is allowed to euerie 100 footmen 40. pikes, 50 shot, and 10 halberds, the which falles out to be 20000 shot, 16000 pikes, and 4000 halberds, the which with the horsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to be deuided into thrée battels. The voward, the mainward and the rearward battell: In the voward shall be placed 10000 footemen, whereof 4000 pikes, 1000 halberds, and 5000 shot: In the front of the voward battel are to be placed 2000 argolateares on horsebacke, 1000 launces: Then there are to be placed the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, who are to be garded with 500 shot of each wing. The Sergeaat Maior must giue in charge, that these pioners beate downe and make plaine the ground before them in their march, in such bredth as occasion shall serue to make your battels, or necessity procure, or the straightnes of the place permit. Also the Sergeant hath to appoint these pioners, that if they be charged by the enemies, hauing their weapons to defend themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the shot, or otherwise to retire themselues by the wings of the battell, and to be placed at the discretion of the Sergeant Maior in the battell: Next after these Pioners shall follow 2000 shot, next vnto the shot the carriages of the first battell, with all the impediments: Then followeth 2000 pikes, and 1000 halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deares, with the Chiefetaine in the midst, then followeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 2000 pikes, after the pikes the carriages of the merchants and purueyours, who must by the appointment of the Generall march armed, for the defence of their charge: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> follow the other 2000 shot, and if you passe through any dangerous places, it is requisite so to march, as you may suddenly bring them to a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant battell, sending alwayes before 100 Hargaloteares on horsebacke, and 100 lighthorsmen, for vauntcurriers, to discouer and view the straights and passages, as otherwise to take their bredth, and to giue certificate to the officers, whereby they may make their march thereafter, and to view that all places be frée from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If this order cannot please the march withall, through a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected place, you may practise that which is thought of the Generall and his wise counsellours and Captaines to be most expedient: neuerthelesse I thought it not amisse to set downe this order in figure, with the diuision of the weapons, for that being well considered, and with aduise well ordered, you may make presently as many battels as you will, and in what order you please, euen by hand without any great trouble or toile.</p>

First touching the situation, I say, that being in a plaine farre from hils, it is necessarie to haue a riuer or such quantitie of water, as the same may commodiously nourish a whole armie, and the <hi>Cauallarie:</hi> and prouide that from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning woods, if there be any, you may fetch al sort of wood and fewell for the necessitie of the armie: and that likewise proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he had of hay and straw for the horsemen, for these be the things that an armie cannot carrie about with it. When proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is made of these necessaries, the armie must be so well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified as the enimy cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aise the same.</p>
                  <p>The greatnes and circuite of the lodgings must not be so great, that the same may be an impediment, that a man cannot at all times vse succour and defence when néede doth require: n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ither ought it to be so little that the armie cannot haue al his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities &amp; necessarie places for victuals, and for merchants which follow the armie. Touching the forme &amp; fashion of the campe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same must be such as these portratures following make shew, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modating y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same neuerthelesse to the situation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground.</p>
                  <p>In the portrature is described and drawne all the quarters, with their places, the lodgings for the Generall, and the wayes to issue out, where in for further instruction, I will somewhat delate, but he that is more curious, let him reade <hi>Ieronemo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneo</hi> his example, out of whom I tooke this.</p>
                  <p>If it chance that an armie must lodge amongst mountaines in a ground full of hils, &amp; diuersly situated, as in vales, croupes of mountaines, riuers, woods, caues, &amp; such inequalities: If the Marshal be a man of experience in the wars, and know how to lodge an army, he may serue his turne therwith greatly, &amp; with smal labor fortifie his camp &amp; lodgings. But aboue all things he must be careful y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he do not pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t himself in such a place, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the same
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:6010:139"/>
be subiect to any hils or other height of ground that doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer him, from whence the enimie might looke into his lodgings, and so batter the cortines of his rempares: For if the enimies armie occupie this mountaine or hill, the Generall of the campe shall be constrained to dislodge his armie, and so be forced to fight to his great disaduantage.</p>
                  <p>To lodge an armie in the fielde, with his due measures being of good proportion, according to the situation of the ground, you must know how much space of ground must be had for the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Cauallarie,</hi> and how much for the Infanterie, with their places of armes, stréetes, and other necessaries for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of their lodgings.</p>
                  <p>For example, suppose there is a campe of 60000 fighting men, that is to say, 2000 men at armes, 10000 light horsemen, &amp; 48000 hargabusiers, Corslets, light armed pikes and halberds. To eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man of armes I giue 7 lodgings, and to euerie light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man 4, and euerie lodging as well of men at armes, as light horsemen, shall containe 50 foote of earth, that is to say, fiue foote large, and 10 foote long, as this figure declares.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>To euerie souldier on foote, with a seruant or a page, I will giue 64 foote of earth for his lodging, which shall be 8 foote in square, as this figure declares.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>This done, you must accommodate the place for the General, from 200 to 250 foot, euen in the midst of the campe, and from that place shall be drawne two straight stréetes, which shal crosse ouerthwart with two straight angles, right in the midst of the place for the Generall, which two stréetes shalbe called the principall stréetes, and shall serue for a <hi>Corps de gard</hi> towards the enimie.</p>
                  <p>Suppose that next of all I will lodge 500 braue souldiers, or gallant warlike <hi>Caualliers</hi> next to the Generals lodging, to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6010:139"/>
euerie one of these I will giue two lodgings, that shalbe of the same circuit that the men at armes are.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, about the Generals plot, I wil draw two plots, the one for the market and the other for victuals, which two shall containe as much ground as the lodging of the volentarie <hi>Caualliers</hi> of the Generals traine, or <hi>Caualliers</hi> of S. <hi>Georges</hi> squadre to the General, which termes doth best fit all such Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as volentarily follow the campe, to sée seruice &amp; to court the Generall.</p>
                  <p>About the plots and lodgings of these <hi>Caualliers,</hi> I will draw out a stréete of 25. foote, about the which shall be the quarters of men at Armes and light horsemen, with their stréetes and voide places in the midst.</p>
                  <p>About the horsemens quarters shalbe drawne a stréete of 50. foote large, round about which is to be compast out the quarters for the footemen, with their stréetes and void places.</p>
                  <p>At the end of one of the principall streetes towards the enimy, you must draw out the generall place of armes, which must containe as much at the least, as halfe the lodgings for the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do containe. In one of my figures I haue not drawne this void place, for that I haue set the trench so farre from the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that going about the campe within the circuit of the said trench, you may easily make a generall place for armes.</p>
                  <p>At one corner of the campe towards the enimie, must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a place for the munition of the Artillarie, and at the backe of the campe must be drawne out the lodgings for the pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and for the cattell that is killed for the nourishment of the campe, with other necessarie things.</p>
                  <p>The victuallers must lodge in the void places of the quarters, and all along the streetes. The trench must be made far distant from the lodging, from 200 to 250 foote.</p>
                  <p>The place of Artillerie is comprehended in the Calcull of the footmens quarters, and would be distant from the trenches that enuirons the lodgings, from 200 pace to 250 at the least, as in my discription it is drawne 250 foote distant. The places necessarie to be accommodated for quarters for souldiers to do their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall businesse in, and to lodge other persons which are lodged in the said quarters, may be taken in that which is supersl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:6010:140"/>
I haue allotted out sufficient substance of ground.</p>
                  <p>In my draughts I haue set downe 50 foote for the largenesse of the stréets, by reason this largenes ought not to passe the boord of the largenes of the place of armes. This 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not so much to forme and frame the largenes of the stréetes, as to make large by the said 50 fóote, the length and largenes of the place of armes for the quarters, whereby they be enlarged. The cattel for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the campe, the pioners and other vnprofitable things shal lodge at the backe of the campe, as I said before.</p>
                  <p>The victuallers lodge in the place of Armes in the Quarters, and all along the principall stréetes.</p>

                  <p>TO encampe an armie strongly and commodiously: The Lord high Marshall is first to finde such a place to encampe vpon, as may be conueniently woodded and watred, not subiect to any hill within Cul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>erine shot, and to apply the forme of his campe to the nature of the situation. But this plat following I haue drawne out of M. <hi>Digges <hi>Stratioticos,</hi>
                     </hi> which he hath prescribed, where the naturall helpes faile, and that the generall is to trust onely to his owne order and artificiall strength. When any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is therefore in such place to be encamped, you shall first in the most commodious place about the midst of the ground, where you meane to encampe, set vp the generall standard or Guidon, and about the same, stake out a square plot of ground 40 pace square for the Generals pauillion. Directly from this towards the North, runneth one maine stréete 40 pace brode, that deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the horse campe from the foot campe: &amp; on either side of the Generals tent runneth two other crosse waies, 30 pace in bredth, which deuide the armed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnarmed, as héerafter appeares. These two waies embrace two long squares of ground 40 pace brode, and 550 pace long a péece. These may be either of them deuided into 5 lodgings of 100 pace in length, and 40 in bredth, leauing betwéene them certaine passages of ten pace in bredth, that souldiers vpon euery sodaine may the more readily repaire to the place of assemblie. One of these lodgings next the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals tent, may serue for the high marshall himselfe and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, &amp; the other on the other side for the treasurer: the rest may be assigned at the marshals discretion to the other officers of the field, and for Ambassadors, and such Noblemen and Gentlemen as follow the wars on their owne charge, and such like. In the Northeast quarter of the campe are the horsemen lodged, in the northwest the footemen, either of these campes are deuided into thrée parts by stréetes running East and West. These stréetes are 20 pace in bredth, and 580 pace in length. In euerie one of these thrée spaces of the foote campe, there are lodged a regiment of 10000 men: &amp; in the horsecampe the middlemost of them shall serue for 1500 men at armes: the northen space may serue for the 2500 light horsemen, &amp; the other for 2000 launces. On the other
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6010:142"/>
side of this maine stréete are the lodgings assigned for the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or gouernors of euery regiment, and their officers: euery space being 30 pace brode and 170 long. <hi>A</hi> is for the Captaine of the launces, <hi>B</hi> for the Captaine of men at armes, and <hi>C</hi> for the Captaine of the lighthorsmen. Likewise <hi>D E F</hi> for the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the thrée principall regiments of footmen, the which you may distinguish with the vsuall names, vaward, battel, &amp; rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, calling the vaward that which lieth next the Generals tent, and aunswereth to the Launces: the battell that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to the men at armes: &amp; the rereward the other against the light horsemen.</p>
                  <p>Euerie of these principall Regiments you may againe diuide into fiue smaller Regiments by stréetes of ten pace brode, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning North and South, so haue you 15 lesse Regiments in the foote Campe, and 5 a péece in euery of the horse Campe, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of these Regiments are 100 pace brode, &amp; 170 pace in length, and shall containe euerie of them of footemen 2000. of men at Armes 300. of Lances 400. of light horsemen 500. with their Collonels, Captaines, Officers, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>These Collonels &amp; Captaines of men at armes, may be lodged at the head of their Regiments, as you may behold in the camp: These marked with <hi>G</hi> are for the Collonel of footemen, <hi>H</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Captain of light horsemen, <hi>I</hi> for the Captaine of men at armes, and <hi>K</hi> for the Captaine of the Lances. So remaine their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of 100 pace brode, and 150 pace long for lodging of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which may by small stréetes of fiue pace brode, be diuided into as many spaces as there are seuerall bands in euerie Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then the harbinger of euerie band must set downe the officers and souldiers of their bands.</p>
                  <p>These last diuision of bonds I haue omitted, because in so smal a plat it would bréede but confusion, and the thing being of it self most plaine, it should be tedious to rest longer thereupon This only I would wish the Marshal or campemaster to obserue, that his shot be lodged toward the outside of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> camp, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ring of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> camp vpon any alarme, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he may do by diuiding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermost seuen regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts into halfe, as you sée by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pricked lines, leauing the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spaces marked with <hi>L</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 7000 shot, &amp; the other noted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:6010:143"/>
Thus in the north moity of your campe, are al your armed, both horsemen &amp; footmen lodged. Now the other moity must serue for the lodgings of the vnarmed, as Pioners, Carters, Carpenters, Smithes, Butchers, Uictuallers, &amp; all other sorts of Mecanicall artificers, togither with a large place of assembly for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiers to retire vnto, to put themselues in order vpon any alarme, and also to exercise themselues in sundry sorts of actiuitie. You shall therefore from the southside of the Generals pauilion 600 pace southward, extend out your first maine stréete of 40. pace broade, and crosse him againe with an other stréet, running east &amp; weast 360 pace distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the southside of the Generals pauilion. This streete néede to be but 300 pace in breadth. Againe extend out the second narrow stréets, that run parallel to the first maine stréete, till you come to the crosse stréete last made: so haue you <hi>O</hi> your place of assemblie 330 pace brode, and 540 pace long. <hi>P</hi> shalbe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the munition, and officers attendant on the artilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Q</hi> the market place: round about this market place may be lodged the Butchers, Bakers, Cookes, and victualers of all sorts. About the munition quarter, besides the officers and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, may the Smithes, Carpenters, Whéele wrights, &amp; labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, attendant on the ordinance be placed. About the place of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly may be the tents of all such as furnish the campe with things néedfull for the souldiers, as Armorers, Taylers, Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and all such like artificers. Yet remaine there two long swares of earth, either of them 540 pace long, &amp; 190 pace brode: héere you may settle the Carters &amp; Wagoners with their horse and Oxen, for the carriages themselues must alwaies impale that part of the campe, that is not otherwise by nature and arte fortified. In these two quarters also may be lodged the pioners and all other sort of labourers, that aptly cannot or ought not be placed in or about the former courtes or quarters of assemblie. Last of all, you shall discribe 60 pace distant, from all those regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their quarters already set downe. The ring of the campe, causing some prettie trenche and vaumure to be throwne vp, placing your ordinance vpon the same, as in this figure is described, and betwéene the ordinance your carriages: and this may suffice, if the enemie be not very puissant, or néere at hand: but if you suspect the ariual of the enemy, or that you know him stronger in the field then your selfe, &amp; would therefore encampe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:6010:143"/>
surely, vntill further aid come vnto you: then shall you without this ring 100 pace distant, cause your pioners and souldiers (for vpon such an occasion he is not worthie to beare the name of a souldier that will not set his hand to the Spade) you shall cause them, I say, throw vp another rampire with certaine bulwarks at euery corner, and likewise in the middle of the Curtaine, that Musket shot may play betwéene them, or if time would permit, it were conuenient euerie 12 score to haue of these circular plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes with a Uamure to defend the small shot, for in so short time it is impossible to make any sufficient rampire to abide a batterie, neither can a campe be furnished of victuals to abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long time, and that is the cause why I haue discribed those plaine circular formes, which in fortification of a fowne or for were more ridiculous, and in a campe to make them more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, were no lesse foolish curious.</p>

                  <p>HAuing, as I suppose, sufficiently declared what an Armie ought to obserue, as well in marching as in camping, I haue thought good in briefe sort to shew what is to be done in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodging of an armie, presupposing that the two armies being enimies, are lodged in the view one of another, or at the least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise but small distance betwixt them. And for that it is a thing which imports the high Marshall verie much, to know how he ought to gouerne himselfe in such an affaire, he must therein haue speciall considerations.</p>
                  <p>To retire in the night and so to get away from the enimie, séemes to be the onely &amp; most assured way that can be chosen, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse that way is not sufficient to accomplish his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, if he which meanes to retire, be not aided by the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ground, and other qualities of the place and countrie, whether he meanes to retire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>To touch particulars I say, when you dislodge in the night, it behoones you to vse the greatest diligence you can, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, as I said, is no wayes sufficient, vnlesse you be ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> situation of the ground: for he that is to march through plaines and open places, without hauing any wood or vallie to retire his armie vnto: when the enimie doth perceiue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, verie hardly (as I haue said) shal he be able to procure his saftie. For when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimies <hi>Cauallarie</hi> haue attained him, they will easily constraine him to stay, and force him to fight against his will with great disorder, and specially if he conduct Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and other impediments appertaining to an armie, which no reason would that he should leaue in pray and spoile to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Moreouer an army must not be made to march faster then his ordinarie pace: for if it should be hastned with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie spéedie pace, the same would augment the euill opinion the souldier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To this Officer therefore appertaynes a Cunstable or Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, as I sayd before, and certayne Clarkes in wages, who are to haue regard vnto the foresayde causes, and to attend vppon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior matters, rendering account of all their dooings to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Ordenance.

               <p>So likewise he must cause certaine boates or barks to be made, somwhat massiue, with fitte and apt peeces of plancks and boords in square forme, for a bridge to be fastned and nayled vpon the said Barke, in such sorte, that being ioyned peece to péece, with a great Rope or Cable, thrust through and turned double, through certain ringes of yron, which are fastened vppon the extreame partes of the poyntes or corners of euerie peece of the bridge, and for euerie peece foure Kinges, one at euery corner, which beeing prepared, the bridge may be put together entyre and whole. Upon that side the Riuer your Armie doth remayne, where two stakes, two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, or two Trées stifly planted, one ende of the bridge must bee tyed and accommodated, with ropes of sufficient strength: the which ende being already turned towards the fall of the Water, and the other towards the running of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> streame, must afterwards be sette frée &amp; loose, and thrust forth and disseuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bancke, by certaine of the foresaid men practised in sayling, who ought at due time cast Anckers into the Riuer, which are of force to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine the bridge, from béeing carried downe further then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed and limitted bonds of the other bancke, by the violent course of the running of the water. The which bounds &amp; marks ought to be fore-seene, and the largenes of the Riuer artificially measured, if the same be desired to be doone exactly: that iustly &amp; at the same instant when néede doth require he may serue his turne, neyther with more nor lesse number of barkes or boates, then so manie as is necessary for the breadth of the Riuer: for if there shoulde bee more or lesse, there would arise great confusion or disturbance.</p>
               <p>Thys arteficiall brydge, is an instrument very much vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst great Armies in the warres at these dayes, as was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the preparation of one made at <hi>Namures,</hi> for <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> and this figure following is the forme thereof.</p>

               <p>It shall be sometimes good to plant Souldiours vppon this bridge, who may be able to withstande, and repulse the enemies vpon the other shore, that they doo not displant the same, but that you may be able to recouer the shore, and sustaine the bridge. The Anckers béeing cast, and Cables ready to let at large, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to let the head of the bridge slyppe downe slackly, and be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered from the banckside where it was ioyned together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; which you are determined to leaue, and to aspect the running of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, carry the bridge to the otherside of the Riuer, ayded by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of those men that be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, to make the passage more easie.</p>
               <p>The Armie béeing passed the Riuer, &amp; the bridge being disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered péece from péece, &amp; drawne on lande, the boords nayled to the boates euen as they bee, must be layde vppon a broade Waine or Wagon, made of purpose for the carriage of them after the

               <p>Prouision of Horses and Oxen, will easily conduct these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines after the Campe, whilst the boate and the boords be nailed together, and layde vppon a carriage prepared of purpose for the same, as before appeareth.</p>

               <p>Besides this he must haue a band of Pyoners, of conuenient and sufficient quantitie, who ought to haue a carefull and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Captayn, that may alwayes guide them vnder an Ensigne, that they may be the more vnited together, and the better conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and gouerned.

               <p>Not onely the great Maister, and his other Officers, but also these worthy <hi>Caualieres,</hi> ought to be of sufficient vnderstanding and experience, to know howe to charge euery Péece, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes be able to perceiue (as néere as is possible) what effects the shotte of euery Cannon will worke, the shotte of euery Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerine, the demie of them both, and likewise what euery Peece is able to performe, to the intent he be not alwaies ouer-ruled by the iudgement of euery Gunner: which his experience, is both profitable to his Prince, and commendable to his proper credite and reputation.</p>

               <p>Hée must take assured order, that the Péeces of Artillarie, be well planted vpon theyr cariages, forceablie &amp; substantially, and in respect of the performance of this seruice, hee must carrie with him more then the ordinarie store of Spades, Shouels, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, Salt, Spokes, Plates, Naues, Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Therefore it is most necessarie, and altogether requisite, that in batterie, or in any other naturall forme of assault, not only the breach be sufficient, large, and easie, to mount vppon and ascend, but also that hee vse dilligence to dismount the enemies defences, that is to say, such Péeces as annoy the Campe, and that the flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers be cut off before any assault be giuen, as I shal more at large héereafter declare, to the intent the meaning of theyr assault take effect, which is, to enter the Towne, that the slaughter and great destruction of many notable Captaines and souldiours may bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded.</p>

must carry with him necessary instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the same, as Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, pestles, troughes, Cribles to sift, tables to dry vpon, yron work to refyne saltpeter, Cawdrons, Coullanders, or strayners, and such like.</p>
               <p>Hée ought to be learned in auncient and moderne hystories, and to consider and compare the manifold stratagems that other notable Souldiers haue héeretofore vsed. To deuise sundry En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines for assaults defences, and to be cunning in framing sundrie sorts of bridges for passage of waters, to diuert the course of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or to drowne any Country or Fort subiect therunto, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey great Ordenaunce ouer Marishes, and other ingenious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions.</p>
               <p>Hée must likewise haue exquisite knowledge in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticals, considering thereby he shall be able, certainly to shoote at all randons, to conuey Mynes vnder earth, to any Curtine, Bulwarke, or other place, that hee determines by violence of powder to rent in péeces. To make a coniecture &amp; forecast, what quantitie of shotte, powder, &amp;c. shall be requisite to serue the Campe, to suffise a battery, myne, or any other exployt. To sette out in due proportion euery particuler fortification, of Campe, Towne or Fort, where Ordenaunce is to be vsed, which cannot possibly without knowledge in these Sciences be sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. And that Maister of the Ordenaunce that is ignoraunt héerein himselfe, and trusteth to the skyll of others, shal be abused by audacious presumptuous persons, that taking vpon them the knowledge they vtterly want, will shame themselues, dishonour him, and foyle the enterprise.</p>
               <p>In the fielde, when soeuer any day of seruice is, it is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the great Maister of the Orednaunce, to select a conuenient place to plant his Ordenaunce, as well to annoy the enemie, as also to be in such sort garded and fortified, that it be not surprised of the enemie.</p>
               <p>In the Campe he onely ought to giue order for the planting of the Artillarie, and fortification of the flankes. And that the Ordenaunce be planted to the best aduantage, and also to fore-see that the Maister Gunner, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Gunners doo their duties, which doo appertaine to theyr office.</p>
               <p>Finally, thys office is of great reputation in the fielde, vppon the execution whereof great seruice dependeth. And therefore the

great Maister of the Ordenance, ought to be a man of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and experience: whereby he may bee able to conceiue &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme many particuler actions.

But because it is neither possible nor conuenient, that the Maister of the Ordenaunce, shoulde attend vppon all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses himselfe, hee may commit (as I haue sayd) inferiour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the execution of his Lieuetenant or Constable, and to the Gentlemen of the Artillarie, <hi>Caualieres</hi> of the Canon, or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Lieuetenants, reseruing alwaies to himselfe the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great and most important.</p>

                  <p>ALthough many Authours haue in long discourses written of fortifications, neuerthelesse, for that it seemes vnto me a thing necessary to be vnderstood of a Souldiour, at leastwise of hym, which by way of merite, meanes to obtaine recompence of such Captaine Generals, as be famous professors of thys honourable discipline, I therefore resolue with my selfe, to declare my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely in generall and not in particuler, which I leaue to those that be Maisters of this warlike <hi>Architecture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thys arte for the most part, is grounded vppon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to accomodate all things with a requisite forme, agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the situation of the ground where one determines to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. The which ought to be made with Trenches, and conuenient workmanshyp, well flanked, and the circute of the ground wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as néere as is possible, large on euery side, and so towards the manifest oppositions of the enemies, there ought to be planted and made round and sharpe corners. The meanes howe to doe the same, is to leaue them beneath in the Ditch as they bee, and from the midst vpwarde rounded or pared, for aboue where they be most easily battered, they be round, to the intent they may be the stronger, and beneath sharpe, which may be very well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the shotte, which the enemie cannot lay so low, as if the angle were round beneath, and thys is the best order that may be vsed touching the sharp corners of Bulwarks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:6010:153"/>Towards the opposition of the enemie, these foresaid angles, or corners, curtines, couers, or other such like workes of bulwarks ought to be turned, with theyr defence of <hi>Casamatte,</hi> with theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tercouers, that is to say, shadowed in such sort as they cannot be battered or choked, of the foresaide platformes placed opposite by the enemy, and much lesse be séene or discerned if it be possible.</p>
                  <p>Neyther let him put his confidence in counterscarpes, or els in adioyned platformes, bulwarks, or <hi>Caualieres,</hi> sholdered and arteficially made, which doo couer or shadow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither in déepe Ditches that doo incompasse them: for that the oppositions bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifest, the one may be scaled and the other broken downe with Pickaxe &amp; Spade, for by the fauourable couer of close and crooked Ditches and Trenches, Pyoners may very easily be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with those and such like instruments vnto them, beeing euer accompanied with a good garde of Souldiours.</p>
                  <p>Note that the <hi>Bastillions</hi> be massiue, the <hi>Parapettes</hi> grosse, the Gabions strong and stifly radled, and full of good matter of earth, purged from stones, apt to be incorporated, and cleaue together: and aboue all, it is requisite, the Fortresse be compassed wyth strong Ditches, that is to say, cutte out of firme and naturall grounde, and not forced vppe of heaped earth, which is remooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that they be large, profound and deepe, in the which the fortification may remaine couered, and closely hid, euen to the height of the Scarpe, and edge of the same, to the intent the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes</hi> be onely seene and no other.</p>
                  <p>Take speciall care that the Scarpe of the wall or the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doo not so much decline, that by theyr ouer-much declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the circuit of the Forte, the which is in making, be not deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made straighter then was determined, and the worke did require: the want of the obseruation wherof, hath brought many fortifications to great defects.</p>
                  <p>When these fortifications be redused, into a reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition &amp; perfect forme: it is an easie thing for a Mason to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the same with a wall of stone, sande, and chalke, being a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more firme and stable, doone by the ayde neuerthelesse, of those that haue knowledge in <hi>Architecture.</hi> For that in the greatest part of thys worke it is not necessarie, that the wall therof cause any other effect, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely to sustaine, wyth his counterforts and other arteficiall deuises, the weight of the earth, and to prouide
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:6010:153"/>
in the one and in the other of them, as neere as it is possible, Countermines, lyghtes, breathings, hoales or windowes, and pittes, wrought in theyr right places, and in due sorte: therby to auoyde and make frustrate, the Mynes, hoales and Ouens, that the enimy shall cause to be made. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comoditie of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, is vnderstoode and known very comodiously, when the enemy dooth secretly labour vnderneath the earth, to annoy the besieged.</p>
                  <p>To bee aduertised therof, place within these Caues vpon the playne ground, a Drum, on the one end, and lay certaine dice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the skinne, which dice, the enemy labouring vnder the earth, neere vnto the wall, cannot lye still and quiet: but by reason of theyr worke vnder the earth, (although not séene of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants) doe remoue and leape. Otherwise placing within the sayd Countermynes, and vpon the playne ground, a bason of Copper, Tinne, or Brasse, or of such like mettall, full of Water, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie labouring vnder the earth, neere vnto the wall, by reason of the sayd strokes and working, although the same remayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séene of the eye, neuerthelesse the water shall be séene to remooue and tremble, a manifest shewe of their myning, which may sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynly be preuented, by meanes of these Countermynes, or such like preparation as dooth serue for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>Some vse to lay a sacke of Wooll in the Countermines, and vpon the same a bason of Copper wherein is put thrée or 4. round harde pease, the which will mooue and ring against the side of the bottome of the bason, at the strokes of the Miners of the enemie.</p>
                  <p>These walled Countermines, séeme to be sufficient to finde out any other hidden or secrete deceite of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie, neither ought they in my iudgement, to be dispraysed, as some doe, which cause them not to be made in their fortifications, alledging for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, the auoyding of expence, which presumption, perchance in the ende, will become the cause of theyr ruine.</p>
                  <p>Note that the firme and reall deefnce, consistes more in the thicke and grosse platformes of earth, béeing well compounded and made of good matter, rather then in stone walles, although they be meruailous massiue, and of extreame thicknes, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that against the force and violent furie of Artillarie, that substaunce dooth most resist, and receiue lesse domage by theyr blowes, giuing place with an arteficiall yeelding, rather then by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:6010:154"/>
the force of stubborne resistaunce.</p>
                  <p>It is manifest, that to ruinate or make that wall to fal, which dooth lightly giue place to the blowes of the Artillarie, and suffers the bullets to enter and pearse the same with smal difficultie, that the same be shaken, cut and loosed with the often blowes of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie, and by the often reiterating of vollées of shot, (as of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie you must) to breake and beate downe the same: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there followes very small effect, for that sometimes the same is battered lesse, and with lesse furie then is requisite. But the massiue wall of stone, greater ruine is made by the enemy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sometimes he desires, and with small labour, which onely comes to passe by the stubborne resistance of the firme and massiue deade wall: the which the Artillarie for the most part, as well farre of the battery, as néere it, only by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forceable shaking therof, brings great confusion to the defenders.</p>
                  <p>Therefore besides these foresaid aduertisements, it is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient a good Souldiour, haue long practise of the effects, &amp; extreme force of the Artillarie, and of the diligent arte and infinite polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, vsed of souldiours of valour, the which is farre more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witte of small practise can imagine, since that he is not capable of any thing, but that his simple iudgement doth behold.</p>
                  <p>And for thys respect, besides a particuler profession in this art, it behoues hym of necessity to be able to draw proportions. That he haue knowledge in the art prospectiue, in numbers, in measure, in making of <hi>Gabions,</hi> in making of Lotte, compounde &amp; simple, to nayle them dispearse and sowe them, to compounde Fagote of good boughes, to know how to ioyne and mayle with wood, these kynde of workes, to dispearse and distribute the earth with suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and that it be well deuided or sifted amongst the Fagots and cliftes, to the ende that they may be easyly endomaged with fyre, and thereby to make them stedfast.</p>
                  <p>To beate well downe and fasten the labour with maules of wood, to giue reasonable and easie issue to the course of water, that might chaunce to make corruption, and to make cloach large and walled, and not otherwise: for that by meanes of water, such lyke workes are accustomed to receiue great ruines and hinderance. And it is necessary moreouer for him to knowe: howe with due measures to forme Bulwarkes, <hi>Caualieres,</hi> Platformes, straight and crooked, Casemates, Couers, Canoneres, Merlones, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
<pb facs="tcp:6010:154"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:6010:155"/>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:6010:155"/>
Scarpes, false Portes, secrete issues for footemen and horse men, Counterditches, Ditches, Sholders and Counterscarpes, and he must beware that in hys parapettes, he make no windows nor loope holes neyther small nor great, to the intent they be not choked, neyther strooken by leuill, nor displanted of the Enimye, with hys Artillarie. But he must prouyde that the sayd Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes be so placed, that very commodiously the Artillarie, the Muskets, the Hargabuziers, and all other sortes of offensiue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, may play and trouble the Enimy, without being (as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayde) manifestly disturbed and displanted by the enimy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the entryes or Gates which bee made to enter into Fortresses: they ought to bee made in the midst of the Curtine, or rather neere adioyning to the flanke of the Bulwarke: with a bridge of wood, to the intent that in time of siege, the same may be cut downe or burnt. The Porte ought to be so lowe, that being on the Counterscarpe without, the same remayne discouerd. It is requisite also, that at the entrie of the sayd Porte, there be a safe place for diuers respects: and specially to keepe assured the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours <hi>Armes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the bottome of the Merlone, or rather néere adioyning to the flancke of the Bulwarke, an issue must be made, which may serue for the Souldiours (whilst the batterie is in making) to issue foorth: to the intent also they may defende the Dytch, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ruines of the batterie, because they would hinder the Cannoniers, and be a meanes that the enemie myght approch the néerer.</p>
                  <p>There be many which require that the Curtines shold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, or be bended inward towardes the Fortresse, with a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme eyther within or without, or a <hi>Caualiere</hi> vpon the brinke of the sayd Curtine. They alledge for theyr reason, that the enemy thereby is much more endomaged, and that his battery is more crooked, and therefore procures lesse danger to the Fortresse then if it were straight. But I am of an opinion, that if a man worke in that sort, the bulwarks cannot haue theyr ample places, and thicke sholders, to be able to sustaine the blowes of the Artillarie, and euen so it should be likewise difficile to make retraites.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I thinke it is not good to haue the Curtines folded compasse wise or crooked, if the situation of the place doo not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same. But I would rather they should be straight from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:6010:156"/>
one Bulwarke to another.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore, it were good that they were of such length, that not only the great Cannons of the first place, but also the smal Peeces may clense the front of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bulwarke. Some perchance wil affirme, that the Curtyne being short, the great Cannons would become hurtfull to the Bulwarks of the Fortresse. For aunswere whereof, I say: That in the first place when the enimie doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Forte, the great Cannons ought not to bee charged with bullets, for defence of the sayd Forte: but rather filde with peeces of yron, or of some other Mettall, or with stones or chaynes, for these thinges worke a marueilous effect, against the assaults and Escalades which the Enimie doth giue.</p>
                  <p>To shoote bullets in great Cannons were good, when the Ditch is full of Rockes and heapes of stones: for the sayd Bullet striking amidst the sayd he apes of stones, dispearsing &amp; sparkeling them, will make a great slaughter of those which giue the assault. Bullets in the great Cannons be good also to break the Trenches and Engines, which the enimies make within the Dith: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the length of the Curtine beeing correspondent to the carying of the small Peeces, is cause that the shot of the sayde Peeces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the dispatch and mortalitie of the Enimies, and the defence and sustentation of the Fortresse: for almost against all Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Enimie worketh vnder the Curtine with Trenches, in cutting through the Counterscarpe, or rather by filling of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ditch, thereby the more commodiously to cut the sayde Curtine or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, and so make steppes or degrees, to ascende to giue assault to the Fortresse: as I sawe performed at the siege of <hi>Limbourgh,</hi> the head Citty of that Dutchie, where the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> being Lieuete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ant of the Armie, in <hi>Don Iohn d'austria</hi> hys absence, betwixt the batterie and the breach in bottome of the dry Ditch, certaine close couerts were made, from whence the Souldiers might ascend vp to giue the assault, by certayne steppes cut out of the hyll and Bulwarke it selfe, by which the towne was entred, although in ende it yeelded.</p>
                  <p>It is profitable to haue water in the ditch, when a Fortresse is situate in such a place, that it borders vppon diuers Enimies: for water brings with it this comodity, that vnawares in the night, it cannot be assaulted by Escalade. Water likewise is profitable to small Fortresses, wherein there is not such great numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:6010:156"/>
as one may be able to make issue for the defence thereof.</p>
                  <p>But for a great Fortresse where it is necessary to make sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, it is requisite the ditch be dry, for that in the same a man hath space to make retraites, and is farre more commodious to make issues and sallies, to defende the sayd Ditch, specially if the bancke descending from the Curtine, bee cutte rounde with couert and close Trenches, euen with the Counterscarpe: as was about the dry Ditch of <hi>Louayne,</hi> vnder the gouernment of my Collonell the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Cheuerau,</hi> when we did dayly attend the siege of 60000. men in Campe by <hi>Machlin,</hi> guided by <hi>Casamire</hi> and the <hi>Counte Bossu. 1578.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lyke wise a Ditch being dry, one may comodiously take away the ruines, which the Enimyes make with theyr batteries: to the intent the sayde ruines, doe not serue the Enimie for a Ladder or steppes, to mount vp to the Fortresse, and for a Trench.</p>
                  <p>A dry Ditch hath likewise thys good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, that when the Enimy would fill it with Fagotes, they may be the more easilie burnt, the which woulde not come to passe, if water were in the same, which doth extinguish fyre, and make the Ditch more easie to be filde.</p>
                  <p>Water is lykewise more daungerous in the time of Frost: for that being frosen, it maketh the walles more apt and easie to bee scaled and surprised. The dry Ditch is in this to be commended, that when the Souldiers sallie out to skirmishe, or do any other action, and would retyre by reason of the violent charge the Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye giues them, they may saue themselues in the dry Ditch, if the draw bridge of the Fortresse were forced to be drawn vp.</p>
                  <p>A drye Ditch is lykewise good, that vpon any suddayne affaire or inuasion in tyme of warre, one may saue the Cattell of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning Country, within the sayd Ditches.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all these deuises for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defending of a Fortres being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, yet am I of a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded opinion, that it is no wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to put such assured repose and trust in a Fortresse, howe strong soeuer it be, and how well victualled and furnished with all necessary thinges, that it is able of it selfe continually or any long tyme, to resist the force of a Royall Armie: For ether the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours become wearie, or by warlike sallies deuoured, wasted, and so by little and little, remayne consumed, or else the munition and the victualles, the which consists of infinite thinges, do fayle, if
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:6010:157"/>
not in all respects, at leastwise in some particulers: the which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it séeme to haue beene very little, yet hath it béene manie times the occasion of a generall losse: so that it dooth much more ensue when the principall things doo want, as water, wood, bread, wine, beare, vineger, salt, dryed flesh, and such like particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, necessary for mans life.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, these things following, may procure the losse and ruine of a Fortresse, fyring of the Munition, the vaine consuming of the same, or by the meanes of Mutinies, secrete treasons, the death of some principall person, or els the deuouring domage which the sundry shots of the Artillary hath made: and cheefelie where somtimes dooth want matter to repaire y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ruine of a breach, and to stop vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battered wall. Sometimes the carelesse dilligence of the Captaines and souldiours defendants, suffer the Towne to be wonne by Mynes. And others haue béen gained by onely spade and pickaxe, as was attempted by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Metz,</hi> and performed by the great Turke before <hi>Famagosta</hi> in <hi>Cypres,</hi> the which they performe in thys sort. With fiue or sixe thousande Pyoners, they begin a rowling Trench, somwhat far from the Ditches, and neuer cease day nor night, vntill they haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med theyr enterprise, wherfore they place their Pyoners by garde and course, that one part workes whilst another rests, and when the earth is at the beginning raised the height of a man, and of the largenes that the same Trenches is to be made, there doe some of the Pyoners stand aloft, to cast vp the earth that those beneath cast vnto them, and so they alwaies continue, euen vntil such time as they haue made a Mountaine, neere to the Ditch. And when they be there, they make Bastillions, to withstand the sallies that those of the Towne might make vpon the Pyoners, &amp; so alwaies wyth great numbers of Pyoners, they cast thys Mountaine into the Ditch, the which consequently béeing as high or higher then the wall, they enter with the same into the Fortresse, and so at their pleasure expugne the same, against which, it séemes that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men nor Artillary can preuaile to vse defence, but that time will eate them out.</p>
                  <p>Yet thys notwithstanding, euery Fortresse in a Frontire, or vpon the border of any Country of importance, ought to be made as strong as is possible, without sparing of any cost, who although they cannot as is aforesaid, resist the reall force of an Armie, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse

                  <p>Therefore all the foresaid aduertisements and many others, which appertaine to like matter, that I heere for breuities sake omit to write, ought to be well vnderstood, searched and disciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and with the practise and right iudgement of a notable Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, not onely conceiue and carrie in minde euery perfect subiect and discourse, but also haue at his fingers ends, all that eyther he hath séene or may be séene, or any thing able to be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching such important affayres.</p>
                  <p>Likewise he must be of profound knowledge, and apt to yéeld ayde and giue counsayle when néede requires, or when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto by his Prince. For by such vertuous meanes, more then by other that be lesse lawfull, idle and vicious, hee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly make himselfe acceptable, and become gratefull to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great personage: to which good disposition and sufficiencie it followes, that of them he shall be very much employed &amp; estéemed, and so consequently shall come to merite the honour, profit, and recompence due for so great trauaile.</p>
                  <p>The which, although it doo not succéede and fall out spéedily, yet time doth bring forth the same, who béeing the father of truth, dooth faithfully in the end, manifest the merite or demerite of the man, to the confusion of the wicked and vicious worldlings, who by vile iniquitie work to blind the excellencie of other mens ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and valour.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore there be that time can not deuoure, although that intirely it discouer the same, neyther can Fortune destroy them, and they be: The vertue of those men which bee written in Bookes: And the knowne truth. The which although

                  <p>WHen a Generall that hath taken the charge of a siege, shall assuredly know, that the Cittie or Fortresse that hee shall besiege, cannot be taken by force in any sort whatsoeuer, but that he must gaine the same by a long siege.

                  </p>
                  <p>That he choose likewise a place that is proper for his purpose, through the commoditie of wood and water, and other necessary things for mans sustenaunce, and couert and safe from danger of the enemies Artillary, as much as is possible. If the place that hée dooth besiege be great, and furnished with great number of Foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Horsemen, which be able to make sallies and come to skyrmish, he must incontinently take order, that hys Campe bee fortifyed in such sort, as he shall thinke most conuenient to fronte the force of the enemie.</p>
                  <p>Thys doone, he must take from the enemies, all the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities he can, as water and all other things, which may yéeld them sustenaunce or reliefe, and to reduse them to the greatest necessity he can.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it hath béene séene by experience, that to deuide an Armie, and to make it ouerweake when it is neere a Cittie, is a very dangerous thing, principally when there is great force of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:6010:158"/>
braue and valiant Souldiours within the Towne. As fell out at the siege of <hi>Florence,</hi> where two Chiefes were elected, the one on thys side the Riuer <hi>Arno</hi> towards the North, which were the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> and the other towards the South, where was the person of the Generall with the greatest force of the Armie. <hi>Florence</hi> therefore to deliuer it selfe from such continuall toyle, did sallie out by night, and assault the <hi>Almaine</hi> Armie with such furie, that had there not béen great disorder amongst the assailants, the <hi>Almaine</hi> Armie had entirely béene ouerthrowne, and <hi>Florence</hi> had béen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from siege on that side.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I thinke the most assured and the easiest way is, to enclose and restraine the besieged Towne by means of Forts, as was practised in the warres at <hi>Mirandell</hi> and <hi>Sienna.</hi>

                  <p>Uisite dilligently all the waies and passages, by the which succours may be giuen to the Towne besieged. At euery such place you ought to make a Forte, and to approoch so néere, as with foure Forts or more you may enuiron all the Cittie. I woulde not haue these Forts for that they be litle, to be feeble, neither that they should be situate in such a place, but that they might ayde one another.

                  <p>Fyrst the Marshall of the fielde must goe with practised soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, and of tryed experience in the warres, well accompanied, to the intent they may safely viewe and consider the circuite and situation of the Towne, and to sée vpon what side Trenches may be made for the planting of the Artillarie.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all he must be careful and prouident, that the earth be of such nature and qualitie, that it will receiue the Spade &amp; Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe, and be apt to make Trenches in, and other necessary thinges to couer themselues against the enemie.</p>
                  <p>To thinke that a man may perfectly discouer &amp; view a Towne or Fortresse eyther in the day or in the nyght, it is impossible: for in the day, the enemie will not giue a man leaue or leysure, at leastwise if they be men of courage. In the night one cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and thorowly, neyther discouer the flankes, Bulwarks and Ditches, neither behold many particularities, which be necessary to him, which will aptly &amp; in good order prepare himselfe to make an assault.</p>
                  <p>But the same discouery may be well and commodiously doone, when the Trenches shall be made, the which may bring him euen to the Ditches. There the Generall himselfe may at his ease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and discerne all that he desires to know.</p>
                  <p>Touching the manner and fashion to make the Trenches, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be diuers opinions, neuerthelesse for the greater sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis-faction
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:6010:159"/>
of the Reader, I haue drawne out diuers fashions, which séeme to be most commodious, most sure, and most easie, as in the sundry portratures of thys Booke dooth appeare.</p>
                  <p>But aboue all he must prouide, that in the Trenches there be places to plant the bodie of the watch assured: and in such sort as they may be able to giue succoure one to another.</p>
                  <p>Likewise there ought to be issues or passages to goe out of them, as you may behold by thys figure.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Thys doone, you must choose a place to plant your Artillarie, with Gabions, Wooll-packs, and other Engines proper to those affayres, and carefully take order and foresee, that the Maister Gunner, and Cunstable of the Artillarie, and other inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, haue experience and good knowledge herein.</p>
                  <p>Accomodate thicke boardes or tymber close together, where the battery is planted, for the Artillarie to run vpon: and foresee that those planckes, yeelde a certaine fall and discending to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cannones, to the intent that after they bee recueled, they may be the more easily brought againe into theyr places. By this meanes the péeces shall remaine assured from running and sincking into the grounde in wette and rainie weather.</p>
                  <p>Diuers are of opinion, that the Artillarie ought not to bee planted any further distance of from the Fortresse, more then one hundred and fyftie pases, if the situation of the grounde will permitte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:6010:160"/>I will omitte to speake of the qualitie of the Artillarie. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I say, that according to the vse in this age, the Cannons ought to bee of thréescore, renforced in such sort, that a man neede not to feare that they shall not remaine firme and iust, although they be shotte from the morning euen vnto the euening.</p>
                  <p>The greater the battery is made, and with the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of péeces, the more shall he astonish the enemie, and make ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie his enterprise: specially if the battarie may be crossed and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed.</p>
                  <p>If you can haue the commoditie to rayse vppe a <hi>Caualier</hi> or Mount, so that thereby the Curtine may be discouered, the same shall remaine of great aduantage.</p>
                  <p>Note that you must continually shoote without ceasing if it be possible, for it imports very much, when ye giue the besieged no leysure to take breath or make repayre. Cease not likewise to shoote in the night, for the performaunce whereof there is manie good meanes, as héereafter (if leysure will permitte) I meane to write of.</p>
                  <p>You shall make your Trenches néere to the Ditch, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on that side where the batterie is made, and there you shall place a good troupe of Hargubuziers, and those of the most expert and brauest Souldiours in the Armie, who likewise must haue theyr <hi>Corpes de garde,</hi> with theyr issue and passage, theyr <hi>Corpes de garde,</hi> may behaue themselues in that order as you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in such sort, as they may likewise serue for the flancks, the enemies Artillary first displanted.</p>
                  <p>These Hargabuziers or rather Musketeares, must haue Pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of two ounces of <hi>Calibre,</hi> for by such like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> besieged are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie troubled, principally when the walles and Bulwarkes begin to ruinate. This figure next following makes my former words more apparant.</p>

                  <p>But touching the filling vp of the Ditches, and to couer and choake them, is a worke both difficile and long, if they within the Fortresse be men of courage and experience, vnlesse it bee a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Trench. If the fortification be of earth, the ruine thereof may be attempted, by entering into the Ditch, and cut it downe, as oftentimes it hath béene experienced.</p>
                  <p>Nowe resteth it to speake somewhat of Mynes and Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>es, for that they be matters of great effect, as hath béene often tryed,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:6010:161"/>
aswell in times past as in these dayes. And although sometymes they haue not fallen out according to mans pretence, the same did aryse rather, because they were not well made, then for any other respect. Heerein diuers reasons may be alleaged. Amongst others it hath béene tryed, that going about to mine walles or Platformes, the fyre hath burst out, and forced that part towards the mouth, which was artificially stopt, rather then to ouerthrow and ruine the Bulwarke as was determined.</p>
                  <p>The same might easily fall out, by reason there was small height giuen to the Caue or vaute, and that by that meanes, shee coulde not take her accustomed force, to ryse vpwarde and worke the effect: but contrariwise she bursteth out, by that parte which is most féeble, without working very little or any domage at all to the Fortresse.</p>
                  <p>To confirme this saying, I will speake that which hath béen seene by experience, that is, hauing put powder not in great quan titie within Caues and Chambers, which haue not béene entyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stopt: but haue diuers issues, as doores and windows, the same hath procured great ruines, and much more then a man woulde thinke.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in mine opinion, the same hath come to passe, for that the fyre hath had both space and height to worke his forces: the which hath beene such, as there hath beene no obstacle or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, which woulde haue béene sufficient to haue repressed the same, and sent it to the open places, but it hath wrought and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his course, according to the effect of his nature. Therfore when these Caues or Uautes are made, as dooth appertaine, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them such forme, as this Element may worke his force and effect, certaynely they bring foorth marueilous effects.</p>
                  <p>But for that these thinges are necessary to be entreated of in particulers, I will beginne a fresh to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>late somewhat more largely thereof. Therefore when an Armie doth march to besiege any Citty: It is necessary before hand, to examine the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of such persons, as perfectly knowe the situation thereof, the strength, and all the wayes and passages vnto the same. And hauing together with the principall Captaynes, made full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course thereof, for theyr perfect instruction: determination must be made, what is to be done vppon theyr approch to the Towne, and what lodgings must be ceased vpon at the first, whether one,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:6010:161"/>
two, or more according to the situation of the place, and as is most conuenient. For it is euer much better, for two reasons, to lodge euen at the first, as neere vnto the Portes and Gates as it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
                  <p>The one is, that the enemy thereby shall be much abashed and discouraged: the other is, that they shall haue no leysure to burne, the adioyning houses, where the Army may lodge, if before it be not already done: neither shall these bee hindered, to take their Lodgings, or mount their Artillarie, to goe to that lodging a fresh vpon an other day. Sometime it hath béene séene, that the Armie hath planted &amp; lodged it selfe, before 3 or 4 gates at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, one part of the Campe as soone as an other, the which hath beene tryed very good, so that there were people enough in the Armie. The Marshall of the hoast must be accompanied, with so forcible and strong a band of horsemen and footemen, that he may ouermatch those of the Town: who, if they chaunce to sallie forth either on foote or on horse-backe, to repulse them as furiously as is possible, euen within the Gates: for sometimes there falles out such disorder and confusion, that either they may enter <hi>Pesle Mesle,</hi> or kill some <hi>Chiestana,</hi> or make such a slaughter of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that the Towne shal be much the sooner taken: at the least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vpon the repulse, the Master Gunner or Ingeniour, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Marshall, may haue commodity to view and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the places and plottes, where the Artillarie is to be planted, &amp;c. Which beeing accomplished, the Marshall is to sound the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite, and to lodge as néere the Towne as is possible, so that it be without the batterie.</p>
                  <p>The approches be made by Trenches, and Maunds, &amp; Wooll sackes, as before I haue declared, and as heereafter may appeare by figures, in the defence of a Town. Neuerthelesse, they must be accommodated according to the situation of the grounde, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and compassed according to the opposite Bulwarkes of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, the which are to bee begun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e in the night, specially the planting of the batterie.</p>
                  <p>The Trenches are to be made, high, great, large, and déepe, for the safety of the Soldiours, and such men of account as vse to come into them: in respect that the Prince himselfe, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goe into them, neuertheles verie seldome.</p>
                  <p>The Trenches beeing begunne where the Artillarie is, they
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6010:162"/>
must be continued on euen to the Gates, thereby to cut of sallies. And against all the Portes, make a Bulwarke of Gabions, one vppon an other, and if it bee possible, néerer the Towne then the Trenches, both to stoppe their battery alongst the Trenches, and to barre theyr sallies.</p>
                  <p>Upon that side towardes the Campe, must be made Ditches &amp; little Trenches, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Corps de Garde,</hi> of those that must guard the Trenches, wherein must remayne such number of Combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as they may be able to repulse the enemie vntil succour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue, which must be vpon great necessity: and then beeing ayded with some mayne squadrone, to repulse them with great furie.</p>
                  <p>For the better prohibiting and knowledg of which issues and sallies, it is not only requisite, to aduaunce the Trenches euen to the Counterscarpe and brincke of the Ditch, but also to haue lost Sentinelles euery night betwixt the Towne and the Trenches, within the sayd Ditch, if it be dry. Wherein lykewise a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniour, may worke many good deuises.</p>
                  <p>The Marshall must if occasion serue, fortifie towardes the Champayne, place the Princes or Generals lodging in the midst of the Campe, that he may giue order to all mutinies, sallies, alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums, and disorders. And if the Towne be well peopled, to make certaine such Fortes as before I haue set downe, gouerned wyth valiant Captaynes, and good bandes of Soldiours, to kéepe shorte the enemy. And those lodgings or Campes so well distributed, that they may remayne safe from inuasion, yet so apt to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that vpon the ariuall of any Armie, they may at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant issue out, and be ranged together in battaile to fight: and therefore if a Riuer passe through the Towne, a bridge must be placed to passe ouer, guarded at both endes with bandes of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, that thereby victualles and succours may be barred from the enemy. It is rather to be placed aboue, then beneath vpon the Riuer, in respect to auoyde burning by artificiall fyre, or else to be planted where they looke chéefely for succours.</p>

                  <p>WHen the batterie of the Cannous haue made sufficient breach, and that the same is saultable, great diligence and celeritie is to be vsed, for that diuers thinges at one instant are to

be done. The Campe must be all in armes, and in battayles: the Assaylants ready in the Trenches to giue assault, &amp; the Pyoners to carry Ladders, or such Engines as are inuented for the safety of the Souldiours. If the Ditch be full of water, and that the same hath neither beene cut down, nor drawne drye by artificiall Milles, and buckets, such as béere Brewers vse. Then must the Pyoners roul forward the artificiall Bridge, made vpon Barrels of purpose for that respect, hauing before cut the Counterscarpe to put the same into the ditch: the which must be done nimblie, and at one instant. During which time, the Artillarie must beate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes that place, to barre the besieged from endomaging the action.</p>
                  <p>Also when the great Master of the Artillarie, shall perceiue the batterie to haue made large, easie, and sufficient breach, &amp; to haue displaced the flankers. He must giue aduertisement, that the Assailants may procéede, if the assault be first determined vpon. Which beeing concluded: the assailants must remayne ready and in order to aduance, when the last blow of the Cannon is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and that they beholde the ruinous fall, of that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to bée battered, &amp; then shall all the Artillarie discharge, great and small. And when the Souldiours begin to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to the assault, each one shal shoote to breake the remparts and other strengthes, which it may be the enemy hath made, and thereby to amaze them the more. But then must the great Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie cease to shoote at the batterie, for feare of hurting your own people: but they shall shoote at the defences which shall be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further of, and the which might aryse to be hurtefull to the sayd Assailantes.</p>
                  <p>But the lesse Péeces shall alwayes shoote at the breach, vntil such time, as they sée their people past the Ditch, and that they be mounted as high as the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>It hath béene vsed of some, to put all the Campe in Armes, (hauing determined in what place they will assault, which is in the greater number the better, but in two at the least) for pollicie to make shew with inuaston, cryes and noyse of Drums, towards that place where hee meanes not to giue the ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:6010:163"/>
where he meanes to make the assault in good earnest, consisting of strong and puissant bandes: all which companies must marche close and sacried together in this order following.</p>
                  <p>First if néede should require, there must bee certayne people ready to carry Ladders and such Engines, to addresse and reare them to the breach. After them must followe, the men at Armes, and other Souldiours well armed, which must goe ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them that carry the Ladders.</p>
                  <p>The shotte, aswell Musket as Hargabuziers, ought to bee within the Trenches, and so euery band which is to assault, is to remayne in order, and must march aflote and in troupe: for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to ascend the breach, or Ladders, the last must thrust the formost forwardes and vpwardes. And from the time they begin to march, the Artillarie must shoote: to the end, the enemies haue no leysure, to shoote at them that march in the Ditches.</p>
                  <p>And when they are within the sayd Ditches, the small Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillarie must alwaies batter at the defences and breach, vntill such time as thy come hande to hande. And likewise the shotte, aswell Musket as Hargabuziers, must be vpon the brincke of the Ditch, alwaies shooting and defending, that not one of the towne do so much as appeare at their defences or loope-holes.</p>
                  <p>The high Marshall of the fielde, must stand with the rest of the Armie ranged in battaile, and placed in such conuenient sort as is néedefull. And this for thrée reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, if the enemies should giue charge vpon the Armie, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the assault: hee must bee of sufficient power to defende the Campe, which must bee so well fortified, that he may resist anie force or inuasion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it bee necessary a fresh supplie, for the assault: hée must culle out such and so manie, as will serue the turne, and send them immediatly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the Assailants shoulde bee repulsed, and that they did retyre, which is to be presupposed, will be in disorder &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, neither is it otherwise possible, and that those of the towne thereupon doe make a sallie, it being not like that those should be brought to make front, that were so lately forced to retyre. The high Marshall must then march in order, with some maine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillion to succour his people, &amp; to repulse the enemies, and so may it appeare, to what ende the order and battailes ranged in the Campe doe serue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:6010:163"/>If as I said before, it chaunce that the Assaylants be repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as great store of shotte as is possible, must be retained vppon the brinckes of the Ditches within the Trenches, to shoote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at the defences. And likewise the Cannoniers ought to be readie at that instant to doo theyr duetie, if it so chaunce. For it is the custome of the besieged, at the repulse of an Assault, the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours more willingly doo show themselues, and appeare carelesly at the breaches then at the beginning, through the hart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they haue taken to sée theyr enemies repulsed, and likewise at the loope holes, and ouer the Rampiers, for they thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that no man can hurt them. So that if the shotte be plyed, it shal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endomage them, benefit the retraite very much, and shall saue many good Souldiours.</p>
                  <p>If the Armie be lodged in three or foure seueral Camps, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefyed lodgings as before I haue touched, euery one in theyr quar ter must thus be guided. And during the assault, the General, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giant Maiors, and other Counsellers of the warre, must haue an eye to all things, and specially to the nature and qualitie of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, ayding them with all artificiall and warlike inuentions. And if there be any that linger behinde at the tayle of the rest, there must be Officers appointed of purpose (without sparing of any) to chase them forwards, with naked swordes, and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>force them with blowes to accompany the Assaylants.</p>
                  <p>The Generall, or the great Maister of the Artillarie, (as I haue already said) must vse dilligence, to cause the Gunners and the other shotte to ayde the assault, but so as they hurte not theyr owne companions. Neyther must the Generall euer rest in any one place, but ryde héere and there, and direct all thinges, vnlesse he haue the commoditie to see all the assaults and affayres of the Campe, from some place or platforme: from whence he must by some worthy <hi>Caualieres</hi> giue order what is to be doone.</p>
                  <p>If any alarum chaunce in the Armie, towardes the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne during the assault, those which be at the assault, must not leaue nor slacke theyr duetie: for the Marshall and those Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels appointed for that purpose, are to resist the same.</p>
                  <p>It hath béene somtimes likewise séene (although very seldom) that a number of Souldiours haue sallied out of the Towne, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the assault, to be an impediment to the Assailants, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them behind. And therefore the Marshall of the Fielde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:6010:164"/>
seuerall Squares by themselues for such like accidents, must sende one of them, that may incontinently marche to gyue them a furious repulse, and to enter pesle-mesle with them if it be possible. It is a thing almost neuer accomplished, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they must doo theyr deuoire.</p>
                  <p>Nowe if it chaunce that the Towne be taken by assaulte, a publique band or cry must be made, that the bootie and sacke, shal be gyuen as well to them that haue stood in battayle, as to those that were at the Assault. Other wise, it were almost impossible to constraine any one to kéepe order, but that euery one woulde be at the spoyle.</p>
                  <p>Immediatly vpon the taking of the Towne, the Prince or Generall, béeing accompanied with 20. or 30. <hi>Caualieres,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Garde, must enter into the Towne, with his sworde naked in his hand, and must goe to the principall Church to giue God thanks for his victorie, and also to defend, that the ornaments which appertaine to the Church be not pylled nor robbed, &amp; must leaue people to garde the same. And if the enemie doo not stand to theyr defence in the Churches, he must prohibite and hinder to his power that no blood be shedde in them, for the house of God ought to be pure and frée from slaughters.</p>
                  <p>And from thence he must goe to other Churches, and by and in the streetes likewise, hinder such euils. Incontinently he must make cry through the Cittie, that none vppon payne of hanging, neither take nor spoyle any Churches.</p>
                  <p>Also that vpon thys paine, none doo violate, nor vse force to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religious woman, and that not any also doo violate Maydes, or married women, or any others against theyr wils, which lawes must be strongly kept, and those seuerely punished that offends therein. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thys doone, he must sende for his Marshall of lodgings, and cause him to deuide the Quarters, for those people he would haue lodged in the Towne: wherein there is alwaies some trouble, and many debates doo arise. For those which haue pilled and taken the houses, will not auoide by theyr good willes, and therefore hée must haue a good eye, that these dissentions and debates doo not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. For oftentimes whole bands doe trouble themselues wyth these particulers.</p>
                  <p>Some to auoyde these dissentions, doo sweare certaine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:6010:164"/>
persons of euery Bande, to make booties for all the rest, and to become accountable that equall distribution may be vsed, it béeing brought to the Ensigne, which thing I iudge impossible to be obserued in our age.</p>
                  <p>It hath béene the vse in some Armies, that after the winning of a Towne, to retyre to the Campe. And of some, that they did all withdrawe themselues within the Towne, and lodge there. Which two contrarieties, I leaue to the discretion of the Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: vnlesse the Campe béeing very well fortefyed and acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, and contrariwise the Towne small and straight of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: in this case I would wish them to retire to the Campe, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if you meane to put a Garison in the Towne, thereby to auoyde the spoyle of victuals, and other confusions.</p>
                  <p>But if the Campe be not well fortefied, and that you doo feare the comming of the Enemie, and that the Towne be wide and great, sufficient to lodge your Armie: then shal it be good to enter the Towne, for it shall be hard vpon occasion when necessitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, to cause all the Souldiours to retyre out of the Towne to the fielde, but that a great part will remaine behind, vnlesse a man will sette the whole Towne on fyre, which is the onely way to cause them abandon the Towne, and otherwise not, but with great labour and length of time.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue I partly touched what is to be doone at the assault of a Towne, at the sacke thereof, and after the spoyle. Onelie I haue omitted, that the great Maister of the Artillary, to procure a spéedie battery, must now and then, to harten and encourage the Gunners, giue them seuerally and vpon occasion, certaine péeces of money or gold, to make them apply a pace the battery.</p>
                  <p>And likewise that the Generall, when the souldiours stande readie to giue the assault, and that they be in order to march, that he cause to be published before the Assailants, that the first which foreseth the breach and enters the Towne, shal haue such a sum of money by him limitted, and the second so much, which is lesse, and the third not so much as the other two. The which shal make them more couragiously to kisse the ground, and to aduance them selues forwarde, to repulse the Enemie valiantly, and to enter tryumphantly.</p>

                  <head>What is to be obserued of those, which haue charge giuen them to keepe and defende a Fortresse, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies they haue to saue themselues at a siege, batterie, and assault.</head>
                  <p>HAuing presently declared, how to besiege and expugne a hold, I will now declare the order of the kéeping of a Fortresse, and the meanes wherewith the besieged are to defend themselues, an action to be performed, as well with the quicknes of the spirit, as the prowesse of the body.</p>
                  <p>Now for that the defence of a Cittie or any Fortresse, is one of the most important affayres, that can in the warres be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any mans charge, it is very necessary for him that is to carrie such a burden, that he be very hardie, of good experience, very vigilant, and excéeding rich in inuentions, to the intent hée may be able, redily to resolue vpon all suddaine chaunces, as well to repayre the ruine the Artillary makes, as to furnish himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst diuers accidents that doo fall out, not onely through the want of courage in the Souldiours, but also by reason of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise and clamours of the people, whereby many inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences doe arise.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore he must with his prudent and haughtie courage, resist and striue against the feare and ignoraunce of hys people, carrying in his countenaunce such a maiestie and grauitie, that his commaundements may be of euery one reuerenced, approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for good and performed.</p>
                  <p>But he cannot enioy these qualities, if hee be not a person of experience, and that in times past hath yéelded good account, and honourable effects of himselfe in his actions.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is necessary that he shew himselfe most forward of all men, each where, as greatest dangers of importaunce doe principally fall out. Hée must likewise be able with his spéech to encourage his people, for in great affaires &amp; dangers, if a Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cannot serue turne by these meanes, feare wil easily slide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the harts of his Souldiours, which afterwards can not bee plucked out but with great paine.</p>
                  <p>It is likewise requisite he be of such a nature, that he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer to speake, and giue eare to those which would giue hym
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:6010:165"/>
aduise and counsaile, yea euen of the simple Souldiours, for often times very profitable things be learned of such persons: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good counsailes haue béene found hid in a man of base conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I doo not meane that he should alwaies followe euery aduise that is giuen him, but serue his turne with those that are for his purpose, and reiect the rest.</p>
                  <p>Let him with dexteritie procure himselfe to be obeyed, as wel by his Souldiours, as by the inhabitants of the place, for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is one of the principall things which is necessary to be had in the warres, without the which, all enterprises are made frustrate and turne to nothing. But as the nature of many people is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, so I thinke it not alwaies conuenient, to vse lenetie &amp; curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, principally towardes souldiours: Neyther also is it alwayes expedient, to vse terrour and threatnings. Wherefore it shall bee very good, yea and most necessary, to mixe seueritie with curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and to change nature according to occurrences, and to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himselfe to the qualitie of the fortune whereinto a man dooth fall.</p>
                  <p>I must not omit to aduertise the Captaine that shall chaunce to be in such a faction, specially to defend, vpon paine of greeuous punishment, that his people make no spéech with others, neyther amongst themselues, of any composition whatsoeuer with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie: for if this opinion should spring vp amongst a multitude, it behooues him to quench the same with as great dilligence as is possible: by reason it is a thing which of ordinary dooth happen in Townes that are battered, and that be redused to an extreame perrill. For if these rumors or opinions should once take roote, it shall be afterwards very difficile to stoppe the Souldiours from Mutintes. Let him therefore foresee, that hee preuent the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these and all other daungerous euents. Wherefore euerie Chiefetaine, ought to haue this poynt in singuler recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that it toucheth him particulerly, and is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce for the conseruation of his credite and honour. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my iudgement, he shall much more content his Prince, if he loose the same intirely, with magnanimitie of courage, rather then he should yeelde the same with most honourable conditions. For in those conditions dooth not consist the entire satis-faction of his Prince, if it be not that hee be thereunto expresly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and in that case must accept the condition appointed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:6010:166"/>Hée must not haue regard to the sauing of his souldiours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to theyr desire: for when the Chiefetaine dooth commit anie fault more then his duetie, the souldiours beare not the blame. It is he vpon whom euery one hath his eyes fixed, and to him it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertaines to yeeld account to his Prince, and to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, both of his owne actions and of his honour, considering that it is a great griefe for a woorthy Captaine, to haue his honour come in doubt and in question.</p>
                  <p>But now, to discend to the particulers of kéeping &amp; defending of a Fortresse. He must haue such number and store of Artilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as is sufficient to garnish the Bulwarks, Platformes, <hi>Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieres,</hi> and other places where néede requires.</p>
                  <p>It shall be hard to giue any special particuler rule touching the places where they are to be planted: for according as occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth offer, men are constrained to change aduise, sometimes planting many, and sometimes very fewe, in respect as well of the small number of the assailants, as of his small store of Munition.</p>
                  <p>It is requisite that euery Péece haue his instruments and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary furnitures, with sufficient store of bullets and powder.</p>
                  <p>Besides, a Fortresse must be stored with all sorts of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are knowne by experience, fit and propper for the defence thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yron worke of all sorts be likewise necessary, coales in great quantitie, with other Munition, which serue for the making of arteficiall fires.</p>
                  <p>Likewise there must be all prouisions and necessary matters to make powder, and chiefly Milnes of all sorts. Furthermore, instruments for the Pyoners, as Pickaxes, Spades, Shouels, Mattocks, Baskets for the hande, Whéelebarrowes, and other such like Instruments, to carrie earth, wood, fagots, &amp; in summe, all other matters propper to make Ramparts, and to repayre the ruine the Artillary makes.</p>
                  <p>That there be likewise great numbers of Gabions, to couer and defend themselues from the Artillary, in the which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it is not good to trust ouer-much, although they be great and very well fild: for experience hath made proofe, that it is not good to put assured confidence in them: but yet they be altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, when a man will vse them to couer his people, when hée begins to repayre or make any other worke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:6010:166"/>Likewise he must haue all sorts of Artificers, as Carpenters, Smithes, Masons, Cutters of stone, and Quarels, &amp; such like.</p>
                  <p>The Fortresse must likewise be well furnished, with all sorts of Armes and weapons, that they may be distributed to the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, people, seruants, prentises, and great <hi>Mnchaches</hi> when occasion doth require: for it is as great a praise to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>serue a place as to conquere it.</p>
                  <p>It behooues him moreouer to be very circumspect and carefull, against Camisades and suddaine surprises, cheefely when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie is so neere, that in one night he may come thither and giue a scalade, as <hi>Alba, Casall,</hi> and diuers other Fortresses haue felt. The <hi>Corpes de gardes</hi> and the Sentinels, be not sufficient, when a man hath to deale with an hardie Enemie, which willingly doth try fortune, and delights in actions of the night, the which when they be well conducted grow to meruailous issue.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the dilligence vsed in the placing of the bodies of the watch and Sentinels, I thinke it very requisite, there should bée sent foorth of the Cittie or Fortresse, eyght or tenne Horsemen, to skoure the way on that side that the Enemie might come to gyue the scalade and assault: for by this meanes you shall remaine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that there can nothing fall out, whereof you shall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised in due time to prepare your selfe for defence.

                  <p>Suffer not often to enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towne the Enemies Drums and Trumpets, for they may be of such craftie and practised qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as might become very hurtfull, and as by experience was séene in the warres of <hi>Parma,</hi> at the taking of <hi>Torchaira,</hi> where, by the practise of a Drummer, which had the commodity to view, discerne, the measure and height of the Ramparts, the Towne was taken, and the Prince of <hi>Macedonia</hi> the Gouernour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of slayne. Therfore to auoyd such inconuenience, some haue vsed to blindfield the Enemies Drum and Trumpetter, with a scarfe, vpon his first comming to the Sentinell without the Gates, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to send a Sergiant or other trustie Officer with him, to the Gouernour, who accompanying hym vntill hys returne, may disband hys eyes, a Hargabuze shot from the walles.</p>
                  <p>I cannot héere passe ouer with silence, one note amongst other great trauels and toyles in warfare, which fals out in the defence of a Fortresse. In that sometimes a Prince or Generall wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thee to goe into a Towne or Castell, which before hande you know by effect, to be of small defence: wherefore considering it is a difficile thing, for a Souldiour of approoued experience, to yeeld account of hys honor, together with the losse of a Fortresse, many haue thought it good to refuse such a charge, by meanes whereof, they haue lost the good grace of theyr Prince, and haue béene diffamed of him &amp; of the people, and accounted as cowards and dastards. Wherefore in my iudgement, a Souldiour of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ought rather to accept such a charge then to refuse it, yea, if it were to runne headlong into manifest danger, dooing his dutie neuerthelesse, with as great dilligence and valour as he can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
                  <p>It is good for all that, he giue his Prince or Generall to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the same place is of no defence, neuerthelesse, to doo hym seruice, he is resolutly determined to hazard his life therein. Now if hys Chiefetaine be of discretion, as it is to be presupposed he is, and one that will not shewe himselfe ingratefull towardes his Souldiours, he wyll honour this Souldiour, and recompence hym for hys valour and loyaltie.</p>
                  <p>To come to the defence of a siege, I woulde first require the Chiefetaine, to reade my generall notes of fortification, wherin
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:6010:167"/>
and in the other parts of this Booke, he shall finde many good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements and obseruations.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, let him aboue all things, victuall hys Fortresse well, for though it be otherwise inuinsible, yet for want of the same it may be lost: for a Towne beeing once besieged, it is hard to victuall the same, or to discharge it of improffitable mouthes, for the one is very hard &amp; vncertaine, the other doth profit smally, touching which, <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Sienna</hi> in the wars of <hi>Italie</hi> may be an example, who going about to vse this remedie, were in the end smally discharged. But alas, with what difficultie and incredible compassion did they obtaine the least part of theyr intent, a thing more miserable then is necessary to be rehearsed, &amp; therfore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the place &amp; persons, requisite prouision ought in due time to be made, and to be kept in Storehouses for the siege time.</p>
                  <p>The number of Souldiours to defende a Fortresse, ought to be greater then those for the ordinary defence of the same when it is not besieged, to the intent there may be store to make sallies and issues: and besides, in the time of a siege many be destroyed and faile, eyther by sworde or sicknes. It is accounted most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the defence of a Cittie or Fortresse, to haue a thousand Souldiours for euery thousand pase, yea and a farre greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber according to the bignesse of the Bulwarks and circuit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
                  <p>When the Enemie hath enuironed the Towne, and begunne hys approches, it is requisite the Souldiours should likewise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiron the walles, and lodge and make theyr Cabbens at the foote of the Curtines and Ramparts, that according to theyr due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Quarter, they may be ready vpon all occasions of seruice, keeping neuerthelesse, sufficient <hi>Corpes de garde</hi> in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, Towne-house, and other strength, to brydle the mutinous mindes of the Townes men.</p>
                  <p>Hée must with all dilligence, vse all possible meanes to garde and kéepe the Ditch, with the way which is made in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarpe, which commonly is called the couert way. The same dooth very much import for his defence, and the better dooth hee trauaile the Enemie, if he can hinder the sayde Enemie from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching: for if he make approch, he may easily enter within the Ditch, and open the Counterscarpe, to batter afterwardes the <hi>Casemates,</hi> and to Myne and dig downe the Ramparts.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6010:168"/>
Hée must not fayle whilst the battery is in making, oftentimes to sende out to discouer and view the Ditch, and to clense the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines which the Artillarie hath made: for these ruines doo hinder the Cannoniers.</p>
                  <p>But if the force of the Enemie be such, that by the meanes of hys Trenches, he take away the vse of the Ditch, make frustrate the flankes and defences, it is then very necessary, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre so much inward, that you haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie to make Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to enuiron the batteries.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, if you haue time, and that the situation be conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, you may make new Ramparts and defences, as Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditches, Flanckes, Caualieres, and other Ramparts, such as shal be necessary to furnish himselfe against the batteries &amp; assaultes the Enemie shall make.</p>
                  <p>Note likewise that in so terrible an accident, being so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and specially when the walles be ruinate, you must not fayle to kéepe your people in battayle, so néere the battery as is possible, with a good number of people Armed on the head.

But if the Fortresse or place be great, and that leysure dooth permit, very good Trauerses may be wrought, to resist the battery of the Enemie, as appeareth by thys figure following.</p>

                  <p>For preparations against the assault, you must not be destitute of all sorts of arteficial fire, as <hi>Trompes, Granades, Bullets</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such like, neither omit to cast <hi>Chausse traps,</hi> and Tables full of nayles which will giue great impediment to the Enemy.

                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:6010:171"/>The orders of antiquity are run so far out of course, specially in the arte of warres, that a Souldiour dooth not knowe howe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue himselfe, whether hee doo well or euill in the affaires of hys Prince, and whether in one sortor another, hee ought to gouerne himselfe in his profession. And that the same is so, I find amongst other things in the arte of war, an order or statute of this tenoure. That whosoeuer dooth giue into the handes of the Enemie, anie Towne in his kéeping, dooth incurre the daunger of death, if by chaunce, he be not more then constrained to yéelde the same, and that it is likely a man of valour woulde haue doone the like. By this ordinaunce therfore is comprehended, that when a man of valour, shall be appointed to the garde of a Cittie, of a Castle, or any other place, he ought neuer to depart and giue ouer his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, for any words spoken, sent, or written vnto him by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, neither for that he dooth enuiron him round about with hys Campe, and procéedes no fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Therefore he ought to haue respect, that when the place it selfe may be defended against an assault, without batterie, that at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he ought to aspect and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But if the defendants did find themselues in such state &amp; termes, that they could not, or did doubt themselues not to be able to resist, neither the one nor the other, I am of opinion, that not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised assured succours, at a certaine limitted time, in yéelding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the defendants doo not merite any punishment, by law of Armes, neyther of their Superiours, nor at the handes of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre <hi>Rocca</hi> writeth, touching the tearmes of yéelding vp a hold, in which Chapter he declares, that certaine souldiours yéelding themselues vpon thys foresaid necessity, vpon conditions to issue and depart without Armes, eyther offensiue or defensiue, the Enemie vpon theyr comming foorth, searching the souldiours

vpon the wordes of thys paction, finding onely theyr hangers and buckles vpon their gyrdles, whereat they did hang theyr Rapiers, tooke occasion vpon the same to hang them vp.

For the sayd earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in forme of Rampart behindthe wall, cannot serue to resist the blowes of the Cannon, but then onely when the saide wall is ruinated: which is quite contrary to the proportion I meane to preferre. For in stéede that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wall dooth couer the earth, and dooth serue for defence vnto the same, I meane to make the earth to supply thys Office, and that it doo not onely hinder the Artillary from béeing able to batter the same wall, but also that it become a couer thereunto, to the intent the sight thereof may bée wholly taken away from the Enemie.</p>
                  <p>To performe which, it is necessary to plant and place the earth before the wall, &amp; not as of ordinary is accustomed, to ioyne it close to the wall, but distant thirtie or thirtie fiue foote, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a dry Ditch without water betwixt them both.</p>
                  <p>Thys earth shall be sustained vpon that side, which doth behold the Fortresse, with a little wall of foure foote thicknes in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, arising to be two foote thicke in the height. Upon that side which dooth looke towards the fieldes, it shall likewise be sustained with a little wall of sixe foote height from the toppe of the water, which is in the great Ditch, and dooth seperate this masse of earth from the Counterscarpe.</p>
                  <p>The plaine of thys earth shall be in thicknesse where it is most narrowe, which towardes the corners of the Flankers and Curtines, or more or lesse large as the proportion requires. And the largest, which is at the Angles, as well of the Curtines as Bulwarks 150. foote thick, which dooth arise to be 25. fadome, and for the gard of the sholders he shall haue 60. foote mounting to ten fadome.

And if the case be thus, what feare is to be had, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Townes being fortified by this meanes, but that they shall be able to defend themselues from any violence or fury of Artillary. For whilst the defences remaine whole and entire, the which serue vnto Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in like case as armes, legs, and other members doo vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, it is certaine that they may assure themselues, from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Enemy. Now this masse of earth, being placed as I haue said, may be named a Countergarde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which may be so placed, that it shal not any thing hinder the flankers or defences of euery Bulwark, but that they shall be able to behold, and fréely to discouer, all that whatsoeuer shal show and present it selfe alongst the same, as may be more plainly iudged, by the view of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> draughts and platforms of this inuention, which I haue set out at the ende of this discourse.</p>
                  <p>But to the end euery thing may be the more plainly vnderstood, I wil particulerly thus set downe all the parts. First, betwixt the Countergard, and the Counterscarpe, the which is the bounds and space of the ditch, the said ditch shal be at the least 80. foote large, and 25. or 30. déepe, as is shewed in this figure following, by the place marked with <hi>A.</hi> In the bothome of the said ditch, must bee made another little ditch, which shall be made 20. foote large, and 20. déepe, made in forme of this letter <hi>V.</hi> &amp; marked with <hi>B.</hi> Thys little ditch shal be distant, and stretched out from the Countergard 10. or 12. foote, which space is marked <hi>C.</hi> At the foote of the sayde

                  <p>Touching the proportion and body of the fortification, as Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, bulwarks, sholders, flanckes, and Caualieres, I presuppose that they are made in such due forme and order as hath béen accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to be vsed, of those y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be perfect Maisters in this arte, saue that I would haue the Curtines from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>But to procéede to my former promise, first the circute of the wall, and the enclosure of this Fortresse, is not needfull to be made so great, and so thicke as hath béene accustomed to fashion them, that is to say, from 12. to 15. foote, but it will suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But if any Ramparts of earth be made, let them not with their massiue heauines thrust downe the standing wall, to auoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if necessity require, to giue it more strength at the foote, to the intent it may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the heauy burden of earth. Moreouer, the space betwixt the one Counterfort and the other, must be made in round, like vnto a vaute, making the Spurres to serue for proppes and stayes.</p>
                  <p>The commodity which thys wall bringes, is, that it is exempt from great charge, from the violent thronging &amp; thrusting of the earth. The stones thereof being battered in by the Cannon, wyll close and knit together with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so make great resistance, besides, they will not very much fill the Ditch when they are aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rather falling toward the Rampart then otherwise. And the sayd Rampart hauing taken the proportion of a renuersed wall, wyll make a strait shape, like vnto the first face of the wall. And for thys respect, although the wall were taken away, &amp; ruinated,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:6010:174"/>
it can neyther fall nor slyde, and wyll make Fronte receiuing anie domage.</p>
                  <p>But to continue on my first discourse, hauing begun with the wall which dooth enuiron the circuit of the Fortresse or Cittie, I wyll goe on, and presuppose that the Ditch, which is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the wall and Countergarde, hath 36. foote in largenes, and is dry without water therby to haue commoditie to goe and come all along. The entrie thereunto, must be by the Cannoniers of the Flancks, which defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, which will serue to be of no small commodity to the Souldiours, hauing the meane to transport themselues easily and without danger, into all places where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie dooth call them.</p>
                  <p>The Countergard must be sustained on that side towardes the Cittie, with a little wall, which must be of lesse height then the earth, by thrée or foure foote, to the intent you may easily discouer, (béeing before the Counterscarpe) fiue or sixe foote of the Wall, which dooth enclose and shut vp the Fortresse.</p>
                  <p>This earth must bee spred vniformally, and couched betwixt the two walles, according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> before prescribed, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that there may be nothing but it may discouer, and defende on all sides, and that no hinderaunce may be giuen to the Flankers and Caualiers to shoote and behold each place.</p>
                  <p>This proportion shal be very little able to be battered, and least before the Angles of the Bulwarks, and the midst of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Curtines, by reason of their thicknesse; and if it should receiue any batterie, it should be onely but vpon the height and top of the same. And in the space betwixt the one wall and the other, certaine hearbes for the nourishment of Cattle may be sowne, amongst which, to ioyne the earth more fast together, it is good to sowe a certaine Hearbe, called <hi>Medica,</hi> for that it was brought from <hi>Mede,</hi> which dooth bring forth a very long roote, specially when the ground hath béene plowed and laboured much before, which will procure it to be able to be defended, against the iniurie of the ayre, and of men, neyther néedes it to be sowne but from ten yéeres to ten. Shéepe that feede héereupon, become more fatte, and more sauerie then others, those that are nourished therwith, bring forth Lambes for the most part twise a yeere, as those of <hi>Brabant, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Lombardie</hi> haue tryed by experience, specially in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where it is vulgarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sainctfoin,</hi> and so it yéeldes two commodities, for the roote doth

                  <p>The little space or Allie, which is at the foote of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, of 4. foote large shall serue, to the intent you may haue the meane to place therein diuers Souldiours, which may come and goe, as well before the Bulwarks, as before the Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the enemy entring into the same, and not finding anie place where to make stay, but in the extremitie of the depth, not being able to proceede, as in an vniforme and flat both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The great ditch, within the which the small one is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, shall containe the foresaid largenes, from the foote of the little wall, which doth sustaine the earth of the Countergarde, vnto the opposite foote of the Counterscarpe, at the which there shall be an Allie of 6. foote large, to receiue the Souldiours which shall passe the great Ditch, to mount vpon the <hi>Corridor</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Counterscarpe, the which Allie shal be nothing séene of the enemy in any siege, but
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:6010:175"/>
contrariwise, it shall be discouered and defended by the defences of the Fortresse, that it shall not be possible for the Enemie to possesse if any long time, although he had employed himselfe to gaine the same.</p>
                  <p>To say something touching the commodious largenes of the ditch, I iudge the meane to be obserued, which in respect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two extreames, of great and narrow, doth carrie these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which in the other be hurtfull &amp; contrary. First it hydes and couers the sight of the foote of the wall: the Counterscarpe therof, doth prohibite the flankes or Cannonieres, which defende the bothome of the ditch, that they cannot be battered. The sayde ditch is frée and secrete, and doth greatly fauour the souldiours in a Fortresse, beeing enuironed with a Campe, for they may enter and issue, without receiuing any domage by the Enemy, during the siege. True it is that it may be the sooner fild vp, but that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection may be succoured, neyther shal the same haue such force in the straite ditch, as in that which is so large and very broade, in the which the Souldiours béeing easily discouered, and not hauing any great libertie to make residence therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without danger, they must alwaies stand vpon the garde of theyr persons. The which will not fall out, if they be within a more straite ditch, exempt from all feare: for béeing couered by the bancks of the ditch, they onelie haue nothing to doo, but to apply themselues to make frustrate the Enemies attempts. The which kind of defence, is one of the best that can be inuented for the besieged, and most endomageable to the assaylants. For the enemy entering resolutely into the Ditch, and marching forward to assault, hee must haue regarde to three sides, the one, to the Front, which is the body of the Fortresse, and the two other, to the souldiours which are within the ditch, and may offend the Enemy by the sides, and specially vpon the banck, if he presume to march farre forward, and to passe further on then the Counterscarpe.</p>
                  <p>Now to giue thys Ditch his competent largenes, to the intent it may accomplish these foresaid good qualities, it ought but to be 100. foote broade at the most, and in depth if it be plaine, but 18. or 20. foote, giuing to the wall of the Counterscarpe such a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient enclyning, (as for 5. or 6. foote 1. foote,) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent it may be strong, &amp; repulse the matter wherwith the Counterscarpe is to be filled. And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Counterscarpe is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most principal parts
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:6010:176"/>
of the ditch, I will finally dilate somewhat therof, therby to make manifest the faults of Counterscarps now in vse. Untill thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent day, this part and member of the Fortresse hath béene made small account of, although it be one of the principal, and the which is as necessary to be valiantly defended, as any other part of the Fort, being the first which is assaulted, and possest by the Enemy. The negligence and sioth vsed héerein, falles out as I take it, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in respect of dispising the same, or through the couetousnesse of the owners, which eyther thinking the same not commodious for defence, or for feare of disbursing ouermuch money in making it substantially, neglect the same. But before I passe any further, I think it necessary to set downe, which are the most defencible and principall parts of thys warlike <hi>Architecture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole body of thys worke, is compounded of diuers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being vnited together, for the particuler seruice and defence one of another, euen as the members of a well proportioned man.</p>
                  <p>Those parts which by the <hi>Architectes</hi> are named principall, be first the Flancks, within the which are made certain Cannonlers, which doo view and beholde the circute round about the Fortresse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the sholders which doo hide &amp; couer the flanks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, from being ruinated and displanted by the Enemie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the Ditch which enuironeth all the Fortresse, bringing safety against suddaine Surprises, Camisades, Escalades. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last is the Counterscarpe, which serues for a Bulwarke and bancke to couer the Ditch.</p>
                  <p>These things considered, the Enemy to expugne such a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, doth procéede by degrées, (not daring to bring theyr Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to the butchery, by a desperate assault at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first,) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they seeke to inuade and occupie the Counterscarpe, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemy, not hauing made his approches before hand, and entr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:6010:176"/>The manner which at this day is vsed of the Assaylants, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they possesse the Counterscarpe, to make it serue their turne, is thus.</p>
                  <p>First they do pearse and breake the Counterscarpe, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom, and to the brincke of the water, to the intent that by this way, they may haue means to batter the Forte of the wal about the Fortresse, with certayne Péeces which are conueyed through the Trenches, vnto that place, the which shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to suffer any domage by the defences of the Fortresse, in so much, as the sides of these opening, serue for sholders and couers to those within the Trenche. This Trench doth likewise bring an other comoditie, which is, that the entrie into the Ditch ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, shall be more easie and lesse painefull for the souldiours, then from the height of the Counterscarpe. And although this pollicie doth not serue to any great purpose, by reason it is impossible in any small time, to make such way in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Counterscarpe, that como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously it maybe capable therin to plant sufficient nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient breach, therby in the end to giue assault: neuerthelesse; it is good to inuent some meanes to hinder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the enemy from lodging there, so speedily as they are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>To accomplish the which, it is not the way to make the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarpe with the earth of the Ditch, mixing among the same one bed of Faggots, &amp; an other of earth and so from rancke to rancke to rayse it vp, neither with logs of wood and great piles of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, that the meane to ruinate the Bulwarke of a Fortresse, and to pearse a Counterscarpe, is not all one: for the one is cut down and mined by the many hundreth hands &amp; force of men, and the other ruinated by the blowes of the Cannon, earth being proper to resist the furie of Artillarie, where it is not able to ayde agaynst the handie worke of man, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is daylie prooued, that a man will make a greater hole and opening in any masse of earth, in two howres, then a Canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in foure. The cause is, that a man by his industrie doth mine the earth, and doth displace the foundation therof, and so makes it to disseuer and dismember: but the blow of the Artillarie, dooth but only pearse it, and makes a hole according to the bignes of the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:6010:177"/>
Bullet, leauing the masse of the earth entyre and whole.</p>
                  <p>These reasons receiued, we may conclude, that all soft matter, which doth suffer it selfe easily to be managed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pyoners, and which doth carry a bodie able to sustaine it selfe, gyuing by thys meanes leysure and time to the enemy, to bee able to execute his enterprise, (as by the nature of the earth doth appeare) such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I say, bee not able to serue for the conseruation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarpe.</p>
                  <p>Being desirous therefore, to exempt and make it frée, from the daungers which the enemie dooth ordinarily vse, by reason he findes it comodious. And beeing willing to haue it firme and stable, and that the more older it growes, the more stronge it shall wexe, and that when the enemy woulde pearse the same hauing wonne it, that he shall suffer infinite paynes and trauails to entrench. That the matter raysed vp for his Trench, in place of defending and sauing his Souldiours, shall become theyr hurte and distruction, being battered and dispearsed with those bulletes which come from the Fortresse.</p>
                  <p>It is necessary to compound and fill the same, with hard and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide matter, the which in tract of time, may incorpora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That the enemy assaying to breake it, it may crumble and fall in to small péeces and powder: the which shall come to passe, if all these matters following be mixed together: as all broken péeces of stones, that matter which is found in the ruine of the walles, all rubbish, sheards of pottes, Tiles, Brick battes, olde Morter, &amp;c. and all the fragments of stones, as well harde as softe, and so accommodating and filling the voyde holes with Morter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stuffe that is hard, as Flint, Pible stones, drosse of Smithes &amp;c. ioining one within another, by the choise and difference of the matter, and powdered with grauell, rubbish, dust, &amp;c. and left to the iniurie of the watrie heauens a certayne time, the matter cannot continue so entyre, but that the worke beeing eaten into, by the falling showers of rayne, and dissolued with frost and heat will intermixe and so incorporate together, that it will be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be seperated without great labour.

                  <head>The Office of the Generall and Lieuetenant of the Armie.</head>
                  <p>THat man which is careful to carry the name of wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when he enters into the execution of any serious affaire, wyll not so wed himselfe to his owne will and fansie, as that he wyl put assured confidence in his owne proper counsel, (which for the most part is fallible, by reason of the infectious humour of selfe willie passion, which oftentimes is cause of great errors, ruines, calamities, and confusions,) but rather will leane to the assured aduise of sound and mature counsell.</p>
                  <p>Therfore a worthy and excellent Captaine Generall, since the greatnesse of his valour dooth not make him capable of so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a charge, in respect that neither high titles, neither fauors of the Prince, can make a man wise that is not: it is very requisite, that he like a prudent person, make election of certaine Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, of great vnderstanding, and long experience in the warres, to follow the Campe, and accompany his owne person, to whom it is néedfull he propound matters of importance, and confer with them such accidents, as are with remedies to be preuented, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to be executed, and gathering and selecting the best por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many good parts, wyth his ripe and aduised iudgement, he must frame and forme, a sound and grounded resolution: with the which he must execute all hys enterprises, expediently and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously.</p>
                  <p>For there was neuer man of so great prudence, and of such singuler experience, that hee was able to discide and discypher all things of himselfe: but it hath béene often séene, that by the help of others, many things haue béene performed, wherin of himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he hath not had ful experience. It is most necessary for him, to be able to determine and take resolution of any thing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that therby he néed not to hinder nor disturbe the execution of any enterprise, neyther to make so many heads and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in an Armie, which would growe to be manifest domage. Neyther can warres of importance without good counsell be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly gouerned: wherein the victorious Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift did prudently procéed in time of warre, specially in <hi>Germany,</hi> where ordinarily hee did serue his turne, with sixe honorable and principall men of experience béeing Italians, with sixe of the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:6010:181"/>
Spanish Nation in like sort, with sixe of the Germaines, and sixe of Flaunders and the Low Countries, by whose aduise, and his owne sound resoultion, there afterward ensued so notable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a victory.</p>
                  <p>He must take good order that the Ministers and Priestes of hys Armie doo apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues exemplarely to the seruice of God, not only at all times by the action of theyr Office, conformable to the vse of the sacred Catholicke Church, and to preach to the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that be in health, but also to communicate &amp; giue good counsell to those that be sick, and bury those that be dead.</p>
                  <p>It seemes likewise very conuenient for the Generall, that as he is supreame heade ouer the rest, that euen so accordingly he take care, that the souldiours honours and Millitary orders be not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded. He therfore must carefully take the custody of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours honour, praysing and rewarding by extraordinary means, those that be good, vertuous ful of valour, and valiant, and dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and depresse those that be vicious, wicked, and naughty persons, thereby to enflame euery one to aspire to vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: since that the hope of recompence and reward, and the feare of reprehension and punishment, both drawes and driues those that be Souldiours, to worke wonderfull things.</p>
                  <p>To the intent the Millitary orders become not diffrauded, let him shew himselfe curious and careful, to take resolute order, that the Treasurers and <hi>Pagaclores Colatorally,</hi> and the Secretaries, publikely at the Bancke, make their pay iust and entirely, to the Officers and those that be of estimation: as to the <hi>Collonell,</hi> and the <hi>Caualieres</hi> of hys <hi>Squadre,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Captaines &amp; they <hi>Caualieres,</hi> to the Lieuetenants, <hi>Alfieres, Sergiants,</hi> and <hi>Corporalles of Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,</hi> &amp;c. Fully so much as is concluded and capitulated to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, and thought requisite of the Common wealth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, or other Potentate or Generall. The which capitulations, and conclusions, ought to be set downe in autentike writing and reall forme, to the intent they may be obserued, being thinges as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be performed as though they were sacred. Since that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, through like wants and defects in the euill obseruing therof, many mighty Nations haue béene confounded, by loosing their souldiours of greatest valour, the most manifest and most mightiest occasion of the ruine of Armes. Considering that men are scarce able to growe perfect and practised within the compasse
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6010:181"/>
of a whole age, or in that time gaine a perfect habite in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Armes, which is a thing of most necessary &amp; great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the safe sustaining of our Christian Religion, against the Turks tiranny, and barbarous Moores, which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age, spring vp like the <hi>Hydraes</hi> against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Militant Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>But to come againe to our former spéech, these payes ought not to be reckoned &amp; placed amongst the aduantages, or <hi>Capi sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> and to giue them afterwards priuatly and in <hi>Groppo,</hi> into the hands of the Captaine, wherby dooth oftentimes proceede incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of great importance, which comes to passe by the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes of some insatiable persons, where otherwise they ought to kéepe the same carefully, and to disburst liberally: since he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to keepe the same safely, and to distribute it discreetly, not as his owne, but as his Princes, not gyuen to hym, but to hys Souldiours. Ouer whom, a Captaine ought to take no lesse care, then a father doth ouer his children, or a brother towards his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or to speake more properly, a faithfull companion towards hys friend, in respect that hee ought to terme those that be his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and are guided by him, hys companions in Armes.</p>
                  <p>It is good the Generall make election of a fat &amp; fréendly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which so néere as is possible is aboundant in all things, large, commodious, and of sound and open ayre, for the respect of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together and making the Amasse of the people, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiance of prouision for the Armie. In which place he must make stay, for the vniting of victuall, Munition, and Artillary, which is before hand ordained and prouided, with all other preparations necessary and expedient for the warres.</p>
                  <p>Hauing by his high Marshall, as well as is possible, deuided the Quarters and lodgings, he must attend to receiue with ioyful chéere the Bands and Companies, which shal arriue from day to day, as well Horsemen as Footmen. He must neuer permit the Captaines to depart from the place, where he made the Amasse and collection of the Companies, with their bands out of order or disseuered, although they should depart to some place neere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, vnlesse he were forced by some occasion of great necessity and importance: but ought rather, hauing placed the Ensignes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to march in Squadrons, and in good order and in perfect forme, both for the respect of his reputation and their exercise, and the better to maintain the whole body of his Campe in assurance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:6010:182"/>It is conuenient for him to make election of an ingenious Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Artillarie: of a Maister or Marshall of the Campe, of great experience: of a Sergiant Maior generall, perfect &amp; readie in that Office of great importance: of Collonels and other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Officers, of entire mindes, and as néere as is possible, such as be exercised in warlike affaires: to the intent they may be better able to execute theyr offices with the more efficacie, such as can performe rather in action, then promise by words. And so consequently, that the election of other Officers and Souldiours, depending vpon their choyse, be of good qualitie, as by all reason they ought to be, for we must perswade our selues, that, that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is far lesse, which truely and exactly knowes, the importaunt and high secrets of the honourable arte of Armes, then those that are reputed meane and common. Therefore wise men affirme, that, that Prince, dooth most worthily merite the rule of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, that can make a good election of wise Counsellers and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Captaines.</p>
                  <p>After this, he must make choyse of a sufficient Comessarie Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who chéefely may haue charge, to giue carefull order, that all the people and Souldiours may be conducted, to the mayne A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse and assembly, with speciall politique spéede, to the ende they may iourney without working domage to the Countrey where they passe: and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiours doo not fall to the spoile, through the ouer great pennury and want of necessary things.</p>
                  <p>Besides, thys great Comessary, obeyed by the particuler Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyours, béeing of accord with the Marshall of the Fielde: must vse his endeuour towards the prouision of ordinary victuals, that it may be well conducted, and better kept, sometimes if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible renuing the same, specially in a Country that is aboundant, and distribute the old amongst the souldiours: but for al that, this must be doone, when as it cannot otherwise be spent or kept good, that he may drawe the money disbursed at the Officers and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels hands. Amongst these sufficient store of victuals, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this Comessarie and his followers, I haue séene it thought very necessary, to conduct with the Armie, flockes and droues of beastes, great and small, the which is of little hinderance or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, because they are not of burden, and for that by themselues they may be kept in good disposition: and the rather béeing ayded by the Princes strong arme of authoritie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:6010:182"/>This Comessary may vsually send out safe-gards or sealed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that there may be respect had vnto Townes and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, aboundant in scraw, Corne, Meale, Beere, Wine, Oyle, Cattle, Powder, Flesh, Salt, Wood, Fruite, and such other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things, specially where such places be taken and comen vpon at vnawares by the Armie.</p>
                  <p>These commodities and Munitions, he must cause to be kept with good order, to the intent they may the longer serue, and with one of the Generals Trumpets, which may accompany the said safegards or patents, or with some small Troupes of souldiours, and nayle them vpon the gates of the Townes, Cattles, or hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: these and the presence of the Trumpet, with a small ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>de of men of war, is of sufficient force to cause the said place to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected so much as it ought or as is necessary: the which Office was very wel executed in the yéeres 1578. 1579. 1580. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Generall of the Armie, ought to examine often and verie narrowly the principall Officers, that good orders may alwaies with great diligence be executed, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually with circumspect care, alwaies kéepe open the vigilant eyes of the minde, and those of the body, warie and still waking, as well in aspecting occasion, as also in accepting and executing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with rare prouidence and valour. It is very requisite, that he alwaies carrie with him a good and faithfull Guide, and to the intent he may not by craft or trechery be deceiued, such Guides ought alwaies to goe vnder a sure gard, giuen in charge and recommended to good Captaines, to good Officers and tryed Souldiours, and sometimes it shall bee good to carry them bound, and specially in a suspected Country, or that they be of a strange language and vnknowne to them. For sometimes, either of peruerse purpose, or fainting hart, in suddaine assaults which at vnawares arise by meanes of the Enemie, and by the suddaine noyse of Allarmes, they doo flée away and saue themselues. Sometimes eyther through the commodious dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the night, or els through the knowledge of the Country, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to those they haue guided.</p>
                  <p>But to satis-fie both Guides and Spyes, instruments so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and profitable to the honourable profession of Armes, a man must neuer appoint or limit any certaine bound to expences, but rather largely and liberally, pay and recompence them, without
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:6010:183"/>
making any spare. For as it is a thing most manifest and cleere, that hauing such as be good and faithful, the victory remaines as it were certaine, so the contrary dooth easily succeede, when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and wakefull eye hath not respect to these substantiall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements.</p>
                  <p>Neyther can any Captaines execute or commaund with more assurance or better to the purpose, then those which are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and led by Guides, and instructed so neere as is possible of all the Enemies determinations, and in what manner and forme he will worke by the intelligences of his Espyals. But hee must beware hee take carefull paynes to examine all things himselfe, without trusting to the indirect endeuor of any other person. And therfore it is a most necessary and excellent quality, to vnderstand and speake many languages by imitating that most famous and victorious Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fist, since that hee himselfe dyd vnderstand the speech of euery Nation accustomed to practise with him, and to the most part of them sententicusly and pithilie coulde aunswer: by reason that not onely for thys respect the beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of diuers Nations and particuler persons is gained, which is a thing that much imports, but also moreouer deceite is auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which through the defect and naturall vice of diuers malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Interpreters might ensue: wherefore it is euer good to be doubtful.</p>
                  <p>Hée must of necessitie haue with him, such persons as be professed in Souldiours <hi>Architecture,</hi> for the most part properlie called by the name of Ingeniors, who must haue knowledge to cause and cast out the proportion of Trenches, to make them of sufficient defence, and to frame massiue Bulwarks, large and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Ditches, Gabions radled round about, to forme great Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and not onely to be good inuentors with iust proportions, but also more studious of the plots and formes, and those things that be therunto correspondent, and how to accomodate himselfe to the reasonable situation which is to be fortefied: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in effect they haue greater knowledge in warlike then in domesticall <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi> of which I haue in a particuler discourse intreated in my fist Booke.</p>
                  <p>Likwise it is very good, he take delight chiefly in cases of suspect (although he haue lodged his Armie, in a place that is of a good &amp; strong situation) to compasse the most weake places thereof, with
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:6010:183"/>
ditches &amp; Trenches of good proportion, &amp; reasonable wel flancked. That he take care to kéepe &amp; repayre those places that be strong by nature, with all dilligent and arteficiall meanes. For so much as from those places that appeare most assured, manie great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The which through this great worke of Trenches, and together with many Carres planted vppon the one side, and vppon the other the great Riuer <hi>Danubie,</hi> and in front with certaine Pondes and Ditches of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and vpon the backe, the town of <hi>Inglistate,</hi> it was altogether compassed and enuironed of sufficient force. But touching these respects, looke in my fourth booke, where I haue particularly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this matter.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is necessary that the Captayne Generall, doe sometimes ryde by night about the Campe, and admonish the watch that they remaine ready and vigilant, since that in the eies and eares of so fewe, the health &amp; sauegarde of all the Campe doth consist. As little as may be, he must suffer alarums to be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to his people, either by daye or by night, or at any tyme whatsoeuer: but if thereunto hee bee constrayned, lette him make it secretly, and without striking vp the Drums, or sounding Trompets, but rather vse Drum stickes and Surdines. Or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in respect and place of those Instruments, which in such
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:6010:184"/>
cases are accustomed to be sounded. It is very conuenient he send some persons of authority, of purpose therunto appoynted, to passe round about and through the Campe, to aduertise &amp; appoint spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, such thinges as are to be performed, hauing before hand, had perfect discouerie of the enimie, and giuen resolute commission to make the alarum. Which quiet kinde of procéeding, shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cause lesse traueyle, and much more reputation to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and to himselfe: and to his enemy great confusion and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, perceiuing that by their pollitike and valiant procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they do smally estéeme or feare them. Which at sundrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larums in the Campe, surprises of Townes, Camisadoes, &amp;c. I haue in the low Countries, vnder <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> seene pollitikely put in practise.</p>
                  <p>Hee ought when any alarum shall chaunce to bee gyuen, to take order with the high Marshall, with as great dilligence as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>anne, to double the <hi>Corps de garde</hi> and watch: which ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hande to be placed with great Iudgement, in places that bée strong by nature, or otherwise fortefied by arte. Besides, he must carry a speciall care, and vse a singuler dilligence, not to giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Mutinies, the which are accustomed for the most parte, to bring foorth extreame ruine: chiefly when they bee of naughtie nature, although the dignitie, authority, and power of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Generall bee very great, for there is almost neuer any remedy vsed agaynst such vprores, without great losse of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authority, so great is the terrible furie of this franticke encounter.</p>
                  <p>He neuer ought to suffer his Collonelles, neither his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to haue any dead payes, or supply their roomes by others, that passe vnder their names in Muster: for in time of important neede, many times the Captayne Generall, shal finde his Forces very much weakened, contrarie to his expectation. A thing verie daungerous for the totall ruine of the whole Armie. Together with this aduertisement, hee ought to be alwayes courteous and liberall towards those that do follow him, to the intent his Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine may courteously entertayne those that be good Souldiours. A thing worthy to be noted.</p>
                  <p>He must search by all meanes possible, to kéepe his Armie continually, couragions and wyth aspiring mindes, by arteficiall functions, to the enemies confusion. Sometimes dispearsing a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:6010:184"/>
rumor, that hee hath intercepted and taken, certayne aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of importance. Somtimes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aigne, that he hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to ayde himselfe, with the succours of many Princes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Princes, although there be no such matter. To make ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Triumphes and shewes with Artillarie, arteficial fyres and bondfyres, in the euenings, and sometimes making shew that he hath a desire to assault and inuade the enemy by night, by Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sado, they beeing vnprouided: as did <hi>Charles</hi> the fift against the <hi>Lantzgraue,</hi> vppon the arriuall of <hi>Counte de Bure</hi> with succours out of Flaunders: or as did <hi>Iulian Romero,</hi> vnder the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was repulsed from before <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in he nault.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides this, hee may vse like functions, artes, or Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes, to aduance his warlike affayres: for, it is a vertue to vse deceit in Militarie actions, thereby to further the procéedings of iustice, against manifest enemies, when it is lawfull to assault, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with crafte or force, either openly or couertly, for that which doth succéede, whether it fall out by deceit or valour, is comenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in warlike actions.

He must alwayes haue in memory, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not by reason he is Superior, in number &amp; multitude of souldiours, he may make assured account of victory: but rather through the good order he doth obserue, in disposing &amp; framing a ready obedience, and the exercise of a true &amp; approued practise in warlike actions, is the only meanes to performe the same, &amp; dooth cause the difference thorowly to bee discerned, betwixt one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Generall and an other. For the art of Militarie profession dooth nourish in the breastes of men which follow this exercise, a valiant and aspiring mind to fight. Therfore as from thence safty
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:6010:185"/>
and victory doth procéede: so contrariwise, by not possessing the same, losse and totall ruine doth follow: Since that practise, doth make a man abound with exquisite qualities, whereby courage is kindled in our harts: and contrariwise quenched in him that is a Nouice and fresh water souldier, in the exercise of these causes, which in euery respect is grounded vppon long experience, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reading, and not by proud and presumptuous rashnes.</p>
                  <p>He must likewise remember, that many times in new begun wars, specially against straunge nations, a new forme of fight is requisite. The election of new armes is necessary, the varying of order, &amp; the studie of a new art. Likewise it is good to Campe and discampe often, when it may be done without manifest perill, and without suspicion or daunger of the enemy: for thereby the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ayre is auoided, and souldiours kéept exercised, who by lying still become flouthfull and negligent. Moreouer, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal of the field hauing at euery lodging, either planted or entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Campe: it is most necessary for the Generall, beeing accompanyed with some <hi>Caualieres</hi> of his owne Courte and guarde, hauing before hym hys generall Trumpet, and his Guidon or Cornet displayde (without which hee ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to goe abroade) to ride vp and downe to visite the quarters, places of armes, Munitions, and Trenches. And to the intent he may kéepe the Souldiours in their Lodgings, and in their proper quarters, when it is expedient that they should not wander about the armie, for some good and speciall purpose. Let him cause some small stampe or countersigne to be giuen or dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>When the Generall cannot in time, readily paye his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, as many times it falles out through want of money, or by reason of some other accident, it is néedefull for him to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, that the Countrey where he remaynes may beare them: or els let him carrie them into a barraine place, smally inhabited, to the intent, that not béeing able to liue but with great spare, through the want of many delicate thinges, they may bee more patient in attending theyr paie.</p>

                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:6010:185"/>He must permit, that the baggage of all sort of people, the victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, the Munitions, with the other impediments, and finally al the disarmed, may haue a seueral Captaine, Chiefe, &amp; Ensigne, euery one apart, if their number will beare the same, for that they must march vnited together, and in order, as shal be most expedient and conuenient, to the intent they doo not cause great disturbance and confusion, through their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Let the Generall, as before I saide, carry a speciall care to the choyse of his principall Officers, and that in the election, he haue more respect to the valour &amp; vertue of the person, then to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer fauour, otherwise he may in time be brought to repent hys choise, and hardly redresse his calamities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therfore let him often and vnlooked for, resort vnto the Captaines &amp; Collonels Tents, to sée what towardly readines they are or may bee in of a suddaine, and that he cause the Captaines make often like resort vnto the souldiours and vnder Officers, to sée if they be in the like orderlie readines for any suddaine seruice: and by degrées discending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to another, to make speciall proofe of euery mans sufficiencie. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better performance wherof, he must receiue into his hands, the order of all Offices in writing, together with all the names of the souldiours in the Band, wherby he may likewise sée whether he haue his iust number. And consequently examine euery Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, whether they haue a sufficient proportion of Armour, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, shot, powder, artillary, fireworks, boates to make bridges to passe Riuers, spades, mattocks, and euery other particularity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Armie march.</p>
                  <p>The Generall hauing receiued his whole Armie entirely, hee must assemble his Counsell, and to ordaine stai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And then cause euery Collonel and Captaine to take his oath, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:6010:186"/>
they likewise to cause euery souldiour at his Ensigne to take hys oath, to obserue, and as much as in them shall lye, to cause to be obserued euery of those lawes and Edicts so agréed vpon.</p>
                  <p>He must not onely cause the foresaid lawes to be written or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in seuerall Bookes, giuen to the Collonels, Captaines, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers and Corporals therby to instruct euery priuate soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour perfectly in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also to prouide, that the Prouost Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doo prosecute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offenders &amp; breakers of these Edicts, who with his followers must be specially respected, as before is set downe.</p>
                  <p>The General is by good, speciall and perfit plots, Maps, &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, to know the situation, nature, and property of the Country, and his parts where he is to passe with his Armie, whether it be plaine &amp; champion, or woody &amp; ful of waters, furnished with strong Townes, or no: and to proportion the Horsemen and Footmen of his Army accordingly. For if it be most part champion and full of forrage, it is meet to haue the more Horsemen: if it stand vppon straits and fortefyed places, he is to haue the more Footmen.</p>
                  <p>Light Horsmen are in all places for discouery, fetching in of boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; pursuing of victory, very seruiceable, and not to be spared.</p>
                  <p>The General ought also to learne by good espial how his enemy is appointed: for against the French, who abound with shot, and haue few pikes, the Launce &amp; Light-horsmans staffe of the North is singuler good, especially in the plaine: but against the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Launce Knights,</hi> the Launce auaileth litle, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Argoleteares</hi> and <hi>Pistoleteares</hi> shall much more anoy them. It shal be likewise very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious to haue some cariages allowed in pay, to attende on euery Band of footmen, as wel as on horsmen, who besides the carriage of necessaries for vse, may also in time of Skirmish, and other encounters, serue to carry hurt men out of the field. They be very good to empale the Armie, specially if the cartages &amp; horses bee arteficially flancked and shadowed with boordes filled wyth quires of paper.</p>
                  <p>Whilst faire wether is, the Generall must acquaint hys Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to sleepe on bare ground, and though the Enemy be far ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet duly to maintaine their Scoutes to watch and ward, and performe all Millitary orders, as curiously as if the Enemy were present, so shall it not séeme gréeuous when necessity requires it.</p>
                  <p>If he haue many horse, he must sée that the Marshall of the field plant his Campe, where good store of forrage is néere, otherwise,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:6010:186"/>
in forraging farre off, he may greatly hazard his companies, if good Conuoyes be not sent with his Forragers, and their iourneyes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly directed. Good regard must also be had, that the Camp be not subiect to any hill, from whence the enemy may beate with great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary, nor so disioyned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> water, as the enemie may easily cut you from it, neither yet so low, as the Enemy cutting the bancks of anie Riuer, may drowne the Campe. If there be no great Riuers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly small Fountaines or Wels to water your Armie, then must good watch be kept, that they be not by the enemy poysoned and infected.</p>
                  <p>The Generall shold not so much séeke to place his Camp in seates strong by nature, as to fortify them by arte, as wel to kéep his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours from idlenes, (the only ruine of Armies) as also that due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Camps may be maintained: let him therfore imitate the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romans,</hi> the very Maisters of the arte of war, who neuer coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> plaine to campe vpon: entrenching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues nightly in as strong &amp; sure manner, as if the enemy had encamped by them, and that euen in places vtterly voide of all suspition, to make these millitary trauails familiar vnto them, and to auoide those idle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dissolute effrenate pastimes, that our Christian Campes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched withal, to the vtter ruine of all good Millitary discipline, and confusion of our Armies.</p>
                  <p>In a running Campe, the readiest fortification is, to impale it round with the cariages chayned together, the sides of the carriages and horses shaded with thin boords, with certain quires of paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, cunningly compacted together, which being accommodated to make sides, bottoms, and doores to the Carts &amp; carriages, will serue wonderfully to empale an Army, to make approches, or to holde out Caliuer &amp; Musket shot. Then let them bend the Artillary that waie where most suspicion is the enemy shall approch, and if time wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to cast some Trench also without the carriages against Artilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. He must kéepe his souldiours in continuall millitary exercise: and by fained allarmes, to sée in what readines his bands would be if necessitie required, to shew them all maner of waies how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie may attempt them, discouering also to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the remedy, and howe they are to aunswer to those attempts: for no man is borne a Souldiour, but by exercise and trayning it is attained, and by discontinuance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is lost, as all other Artes and Sciences be.</p>
                  <p>In setling of a Campe, beside the commodities of wood, water, and forrage, the Generall must also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how victuals may safely come vnto him, and to leaue no Castles at his back to anoy them, but that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:6010:187"/>
he séeke to possesse them ere he march forward, for great is the anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that a little pyle at the back of an Army may doo, as wel against forragers &amp; straglers, as to cut off victuals from the Campe.</p>
                  <p>The Generall is also by good plots to consider, the situation of the Country, how both fréend and enemy Townes lie from the Campe, the hyls and vallies, waies, straits, passages, lakes, riuers &amp; bridges, their number, quantity, distance, and euery particularity, which may be doone by conference with his Discouerers-Guides, Espyals, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons that know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Country, conferring their assertions with his plots. And so to consider whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy may conueniently cut off his victuals, or by Ambush anoy him in his march, and for preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, to send abroad Light-horsemen &amp; Hargabuzers to garde the passages towards the enemies Garisons. Before the Armie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe, all passages and waies for the souldiours and Artillary. &amp;c. to passe; should be discouered, and skilful men appointed to lead them.</p>
                  <p>He ought not to suffer any band to march scattered, but in battails order, or at least in straits &amp; narrow passages inforce to drawe them forth in Herses, and so soone as place serueth, to reduce them again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the order of battaile: and this is to be vsed in places of security for exercise, as in places of suspect for safetie. He ought to haue with him good Guides, that perfecty know all passages, hilles, vallies, &amp;c. for of the Country in generallitie, the Generall himselfe ought perfectly to be informed by Plots &amp; Models, wherby he shal the better conceiue any information that shal be brought him by espiall. If the General haue sundry Nations vnder his gouernment, it is not méete to gyue alwaies to any one Nation the Uaward, considering the same, being in marching towards the enemy the place of greatest honour, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will much repine against it, and not without good cause. The order therfore in marching, should so be framed, that euery Nation haue his turne, without partial fauor to any one. And if the number be great of any one Mercinary Nation, it is not amisse to deuide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both in marching &amp; imbattelling, for sundry respects, which in thys place I omit to show. If any strait be kept by the enemie, it is not méet first to charge them vpon the very front, but to send Light-hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; shot to skyrmish with them on either flancke, and then wyth Targets of proofe to enter vpon them.</p>
                  <p>The Generall shold before he bring his Souldiours to deale with the enemy, first in some champion place, cause them to be ranged in forme of battaile, making of his footmen sundry <hi>Battillions,</hi> &amp; of these <hi>Battillions,</hi> sundry <hi>Fronts,</hi> to deuide his Horsemen also into sundry
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:6010:187"/>
Troupes, placing the men at Armes, Demilances, Light horsemen, and <hi>Argoleteares</hi> euery Fort in seueral Troupes by themselues, to cause the forlorne to issue out, and skirmish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the <hi>Battillions,</hi> as if the enemy were indéed present, and vpon a signe giuen, suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to retire. The horsmen to charge and returne again to their place, vpon their retire, to cause certain sleues of pykes and light Armed, to run out to their reskew, as though the enemy did pursue them. Then the <hi>Battillions</hi> of the first front to march forward, &amp; bend their pikes, and suddainly after the sound of the retrait, to retire themselues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, betwéen the <hi>Battillions</hi> of the second front: then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second front to march forward, and bend their pikes, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other that first retired, to make head again vpon the enemy. Last of all, the Light-horsmen and light Armed footmen again to breake forth, as it were to doo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution vpon the enemy fléeing, which forme of trayning, doth aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Ma. <hi>Digs</hi> his proportion of imbattelling. These things, if in pastime the souldiours be able orderly to performe, there is good hope they wil honorably put it in execution vpon the enemy. Otherwise, to bring them without trayning to deale with the enemy, is nothing els but to leade them to the butcherie.</p>
                  <p>As there is nothing more perrillous in giuing of battaile, then to lay before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiours eyes any place of refuge to flée vnto, but that the Generall should declare vnto them, that there is no hope to escape but only by victory, and heerin to imitate <hi>Hanniball:</hi> so there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dangerous, then to giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy battaile in such a place, where in troth hee hath no refuge or possibility to escape, for that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity maketh men desperate, it vniteth them together, &amp; it hath often béen séene, that very small co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, by such like occasions, beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to desperation, thereupon resoluing to sell their liues déerely, haue contrary to all expectation attained victory vpon their enemies, in number farre greater.</p>
                  <p>The General must haue special care, that the souldiours haue not in their faces, the dust to blind them, the wind to disturbe them, or the sun beames to anoy them, before they enter into any maine encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the which impediments, not only altogether, but each one by him selfe alone, doth bring great toile, trouble, and disaduantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him lead his souldiours to performe any enterprise of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if before hand he haue not had great and manifest experience of them. Note that it is much better to ouercome the enemy, by weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with delaies, then by furious fight put himselfe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hazarde of doubtful fortune, which oftentimes hath in battaile greater puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance

then valour or vertue it selfe, therefore alway procéede in these vncertaine ends of Armes, rather assuredly then perrillously. The order which the enemies hold, ought first of all euer to be discouered.</p>
                  <p>The Generall being a man of iudgment, dooth attend and take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect with prudence and with carefulnes, both to his affaires, and to the enemies, and doth that is good, or that which is pernicious in the one and in the other, and doth preuent his traps and deceits, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffers any thing negligently about himselfe, nor assured about them. In warres, for the most part, the victory comes by nothing els, but the euill counsell and base mind of his aduersary, therefore very hardly can he be ouercome, that can measure and knowe, both hys owne, and his enemies forces and order.</p>
                  <p>When a Prince or his Generall, hath fortefyed himselfe wyth Confederates, with good and experienced Captaines wyth valiant Souldiours, with Municion and weapons, with money and strong places: it followes that he endeuours himselfe to weaken the force, interrupt and breake in sunder the aduersaries determinations, the which thing may be performed spéedily or late, according as occasion shall offer it selfe, which is the fountaine and originall of all graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acts.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the Generall, the high Officers of the Army, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, Captaines, and Souldiours, must daily serue God, for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on causeth good orders, good orders brings good fortune, good fortune makes good successe to arise in all enterprises. The Armie wel paide, discipline must be vsed without respect of persons. Iustice to doo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man right, makes the Generall of great maiestie and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beloued and feared, because hee dooth and is able to aduaunce the vertuous, and correct the wicked. For money is the flesh &amp; sinewes of the warres, and ordeined for the same. That warre is iust, which a Prince commaunds, for to recouer that is lost, or to defende iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and wrongs offered to him by others.</p>
