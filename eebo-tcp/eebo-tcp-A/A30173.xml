            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the morning <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:57648:3"/>
poſſibly have conceived them to be; by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the priſoners we have taken, they that ſay leaſt, ſay Five thouſand. In this poſture we ſtood, when the other Armie advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, the ſtrength of their Horſe were on their right wing oppoſite to our left, In their left wing they had but ten Troopes, but their Foot which appeared to us, divided into five great bodies came up all in Front, and after ſome playing with the Canon on both ſides, that part of it which was on their left, and toward our right Wing, came on very gallantly to the charge, and were as gallantly received, and charged by Sir</hi> Philip Stapletons <hi>and Sir</hi> William Balfores <hi>Regiments of Horſe, aſſiſted with the Lord Roberts and Sir Will. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables Regiments of Foot, in ſuch a manner, that they forced all the Musketeers of two of their beſt Regiments to run in and ſhrowd themſelves within their Pikes, not daring to ſhoot a ſhoote, and ſo ſtood: When our reare came up, and then charging all together, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that aart of our Reare which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the right hand, and ſo next unto them, which was tho Lord Generalls Regiment, and the Lord Brooks, led on by Colonall Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, who commaaded that Brigado, forced that ſtand of Pikes, and wholly broke thoſe two Regiments, and ſlew and tooke almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57648:4"/>The other Regiment of our Rear, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Col. <hi>Ballard,</hi> charged thoſe which were before them, and then the whole body of the Kings foot, except 2. other Regiments, ran away.</p>
            <p>By this time it grew ſo late and dark, where we made good the field, and gave them leave to retire.</p>
            <p>But before we come to this, we will give you an account of what paſſed in the other parts of our army, before our Rear came up to charge. Our battell at the firſt wholly disbanded and ran away, wihtout ever ſtriking ſtroke, or ſo much as being charged by the enemy, though Col. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum</hi> himſelf, and others that commanded thoſe Regiments, did as much as men could do to ſtay them.</p>
            <p>Now for our Kear thus it was, before it towards the out ſide of it ſtood the left wing of horſe, advanced a little forward where they ſtood in a battalio lined with commanded Muſquetiers; but upon the firſt charge of the enemy they wheeled about, fighting pell mell, juſt upon Col.
<pb facs="tcp:57648:4"/>
Hollis his Regiment and brake through it.</p>
            <p>In this fight Sir Wil. Balfour behaved himſelf with moſt noble and diſcreet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, who in the beginning of the Day broke a Regiment of foot which had green Colours, beat them to their Canon where they threw down their Arms and ran away.</p>
            <p>Then he purſued the Cavaleirs halfe a mile upon exceution, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Red Kegiment, where Sir Philip Stapleton was charging of them, and at laſt charged them up to puſh of pike with his ſingle Troop; and they then, with the help of ſome of the Foote of our rear utterly broke it, as you had it before.</p>
            <p>Here is one remarkable and obſervable Paſſage, concerning that heroick ſpirit Sir Phillp Stapleton, who when five Troops of the Enemies horſe returned from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of our left Wing, and paſſed by the outſide of our Rear upon the left hand, went and charged them with his Troope
<pb facs="tcp:57648:5"/>
and made them run: but they finding a by place, got away, and returned to the reſt of their broken Troopes. If wee had time wee could relate unto you many more remarkable paſſages.</p>
            <p>The Kings foot are either ſlain, or moſt of them runne away, and are now very weak, and ſhould have bin purſued by us, but that we muſt of neceſſity refreſh Our men for 3. or 4. dayes, and then wee ſhall God willing, addreſſe our ſelves to finiſh the work, And ſo we reſt,</p>
