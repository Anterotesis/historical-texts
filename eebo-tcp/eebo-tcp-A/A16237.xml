            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that which apparteyneth to euery

augmentacion, state, declynacion,
<pb facs="tcp:4887:5"/>
and ende of a Countrie or Citie,
and of the empire thereof, be not

               <p>Foure things would be dispar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thoroughout the history, that
is to saye, the trade of lyfe, the

the maner of gouernement. By
knowing what trade of lyfe, the
Countrie or Citie in euery tyme
and season hath vsed, we learne
howe to haue lyke in like times.
Agayne, by knovving the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
and what things haue bene
done therwith, we come to know
vvhat the Countrye or Citie is
able to doe. The force consisteth
in Souldiours, in the maner, of

in Munition, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of vvarre. And the vvriter

the souldiours be hyred foreners,
or home Souldiours, for lacke
whereof <hi>Polibius</hi> hath giuen great
cause of woonder vnto thys age,
because all Italie at this present,
is not able to leauie the tenth part

nor <hi>Marcapianarite</hi> And yet as the
foresayde <hi>Polibius</hi> vvryteth, they
vvere able to set forth foure score
thousande footemen, and three
score thousand horsemen. And in
their firste vvarres agaynst Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
being only Lords of Italie,
they dyd sende a nauie to the sea
of three hundred and thirtie great
Gallyes, called <hi>Quinqueremi,</hi> and
novv the Turke for all his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is scant able to sende to the

               <p>The vvriter also muste shevve
vvhat kinde of gouernement the

hovve the same vvas done, and
vvhat good or euill ensued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Hystories bee made of deedes
done by a publique vveale, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
a publique vveale, and
such deedes, be eyther deedes of
vvarre, of peace, or else of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and conspiracie. Agayne, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deede, be it priuate, or publique
must needs be done by some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for some occasion, in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme,
and place, with meanes &amp;
order, and vvith instruments, all
<pb facs="tcp:4887:6"/>
vvhich circumstaunces are not to
be forgotten of the vvriter, and
specially those that haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
and brought the deede to
effect Euery deed that man doth,
springeth eyther of some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarde
cause, as of force, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
(vvhich properlye ought
not to be referred to man:) or else
of some invvard cause belonging
to man: of vvhich causes there be
tvvo, that is, reason and appetite.
Of reason springeth counsell and
election, in affaires of the lyfe,
vvhich not being letted, do cause
deedes to ensue. Of appetite doe
spryng, passions of the mynde,
vvhich also doe cause men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
enterprises. Agayne, of
deeds some haue sometimes such
partes as be also deeds, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
parts that be no deedes.
<pb facs="tcp:4887:7"/>
And bycause that euery deede is
done by some person, for some
cause, in tyme, and place, vvith
meanes and instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: vve vvill
therefore suppose that to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes
true, as vvell in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
deede, as in the meane and
smallest deedes of all. And as the
qualities, offices, and placyng of
the members of a mans body, be
diuers, and yet tende all to one
ende, that is to saye, to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of lyfe, and of the vvhole
body: euen so all meaner deedes
ought to be applyed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyshinge
of the principall
deede. And if there be a principall
deede, vnto the vvhich all other
inferiour deedes ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
as to their finall ende: there
muste needes be also a principall
doer, vvhome all other inferiour
<pb facs="tcp:4887:7"/>
doers must obeye. Agayne, if
there be a principall dooer, there
is also a principall cause, ruling
all other inferiour causes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a principall time, place, meane,
and instrument. And as deedes
haue outvvardly belonging vnto
them all the foresayd circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so invvardly they doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende
three speciall thinges,
vvhich doe runne thoroughout
all the circumstaunces from the
beginning to the ending. And
they be these, possibilitie, occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and successe. VVhich things the
vvriter must declare, euen as they
vvere.</p>
               <p>And as touching the dooer, to
be knovvne vvhat he is, and to be
knovvne as chiefe dooer, is tvvo
things, and requireth tvvo maner
of proceedings. For vvee learne
<pb facs="tcp:4887:8"/>
vvhat hee is, and vvhat maner of
man, by knovving hys name,
the name of his family, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
vvhere hee vvas borne and
bredde, and such like things: but
he is knovvne as chiefe doer, by
his povver, skill, and industrie.
For these three things doe bring
to effect the possibilitie, occasion,
and successe, of the deede. For
the povver &amp; ability of the doer,
causeth the thing vvhich is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to be done in deede. Againe,
his skill, causeth him to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
vvhen it is offered, and to
vse the meetest meanes to bring
it to passe. Finally, hys industrie
&amp; earnest follovving of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
bringeth the successe of the
deede to perfection.</p>
               <p>Povver consisteth chieflye in
three things, that is, in riches, in
<pb facs="tcp:4887:8"/>
publique auctoritie, and in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
estimacion.</p>
               <p>Skyll also consisteth in bodily
force, in the boldnesse of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
courage, in the sodayne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of affectes, and in the sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
habytes of the minde. For
let no man thinke to doe anye
vvoorthie enterprise, or to bring
any notable thing to good effect,
vnlesse he be mooued therevnto
by all or some of the qualities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
sayde, vvhich the vvriter
must declare at the full, if he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
that others shoulde receyue
any good by his vvriting. And as
it is not meete that the vvryter
fayle in describing the deede, and
the doer, togither vvith all those
partes vvhereby the deede vvas
brought to effect: Euen so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth
in any vvise that amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb facs="tcp:4887:9"/>
the reast of the chiefest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarde
partes, he consider well
the cause that mooued the doer
to enterprise the deede, &amp; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the same accordingly. And
note here, that by the cause, I
meane the ende. For the matter
vvheron the doer vvorketh, is the
deede of peace, of vvarre, or of
sedicion. And the shape or forme
thereof, is the meanes and maner
of doing, vvhich the doer vseth
therein. And the cause efficient
is the doer himselfe.</p>
               <p>Affections also haue a fynall
cause, as the ende of vvrath, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge:
of loue, the fruition of the

               <p>Novve as touching the tyme,
the vvriter ought to shevve the

<pb facs="tcp:4887:9"/>
as of the ending of the

of the principall deede, and also
of the inferiour deedes. And for
the better knovvledge of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie

needefull sometyme to note the

togither vvith the differences of

hovv they vvere chastised,
or hovve perhappes they escaped

of vvarre he must shevve in
vvhat sort the same vvas made,
and hovv the Souldiours vvere
leauyed, payd, exercised, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned,
and hovv the hoste vvas
ordered in marching through the
Countries in being incamped, in
skirmuching, in fighting battels,
eyther in playne field, or in place
strongly trenched, or othervvise
fortified, and hovv they passed
Mountaynes, Riuers, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
hovv they conueyed their

all vvhich things, are very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

Of instruments vvhereby mans

And if they vvere publique
personages or gouernours, then
they are to be considered in as
many diuers vvayes, as there be
diuers kindes of gouernement.
VVhereof according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
there be sixe, that is, a kingdome,
a Tyriannye, the rule of many
good men, the rule of few, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
in povver: a common welth,
and the rule of the base sorte of
people, for euery one of these go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernements
hath his excellencie
<pb facs="tcp:4887:12"/>
proper to himselfe, &amp; diuers one
from an other.</p>
               <p>It is meete that the lyues of
Princes should bee chronicled
that it may appeare hovv things
vvere gouerned vnder euerye

               <p>To gouernement belong tvvo
ciuill vertues, Prudence, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and tvvo mylitar vertues,
that is, prudence, and fortitude.
And vvhosoeuer by meanes of
the tvvo mylitar vertues hath
done any notable actes, good, or
euill, is meete to be chronicled:
but the tvvo ciuill vertues are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervvise
to be considered of. For
iniustice the contrarie vice to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
if it be open and manifest, it
is of small force in ciuill actions,
and the greater it is, the lesse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver
<pb facs="tcp:4887:12"/>
it hath to hurt. Againe, on
the other side, mere iustice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prudence and fortitude, doth
fevve things vvorthie of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
but if both the ciuill and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litar
vertues be ioyned togither,
they bee of great force, and doe
bring to passe vvorks of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
&amp; vvorthie of fame and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
and they may be mixt or
compounded three manner of
vvayes, for eyther they are both
in the person of vvhome the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
is made, or else in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of the citie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
vvealth, or else the one in the
one, and the other in the other.
Amongst the ciuill sort are to be
reckened Princes and Lordes of
states, as Kings and Tirants, and
also the Magistrats of common
vveales. And as touching the
<pb facs="tcp:4887:13"/>
vvarryours they be of tvvo sorts
for eyther they bee home Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,
bredde and borne in the
same countrye, or else forryners
that serue for hyer.</p>
               <p>In vvriting the lyfe of anye
man, you ought first to shevv his
proper name, the name of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
and of vvhat countrye he
is, and then to declare his actes
and deedes. And vvhatsoeuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
any man taketh in hand,
he doth it being mooued and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
therevnto, eyther by some
outvvarde principle, or by some
invvarde principle, if outvvarde,
it is eyther by destinie, by force,
or by fortune, if invvarde, then
it is eyther by nature, by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or by choyse and election,
and such electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> springeth eyther
of nature, or of some passion of
<pb facs="tcp:4887:13"/>
the minde, of custome, or else of
the discourse of reason.</p>
               <p>The acts vvhich vve doe, being
forced by outvvarde occasion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
neyther blame nor prayse,
neyther are they to be follovved
or fled sith they proceede not of
our ovvne courage or covvardly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And therefore it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to make mention of these,
so farre as they may eyther fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or hinder those actions that
spring of invvarde causes, vvhich
actions are most vvorthye to bee
vvritten. I meane those actes
vvhich the person of whom you
vvrite, dyd himselfe, and not the
actes of his Auncetours, or that
vvere done parhaps in his tyme,
hee deseruing to haue no parte
thereof: neyther are all his actes
to be vvritten, but those onely
<pb facs="tcp:4887:14"/>
vvhich are notable and may serue
to some good example.</p>
               <p>And as touching the invvarde
causes: I meane here, by nature,
that inclynacion vvhich a man
hath from his cradle &amp; by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
I meane certayne liuelye
motions, as anger, loue, hatred
put in execution. For so they
bring foorth actions, eyther by
sodain motions vvithout electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or else by some passion bred by
custome, and growne to hab te.
Some agayne doe spring of bare
and simple discourse, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
neither vvith passion or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.
And some doe spring of
discourse accustomed, eyther to
vice or vertue. And therefore the
vvriter in tellyng the actes and
deeds, ought to shew of which of
these causes aboue sayde suche
<pb facs="tcp:4887:14"/>
actes proceeded, &amp; specially those
that vvere done vvith choyse and
election.</p>
               <p>And to doe this vvell he ought
to consider, that though the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from whence
the action springeth, proceedeth
for the most parte of nature: yet
they be somtimes greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and augmented, by other
things that are not naturall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by
the educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and nurture vvhich
man hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tender yeres, or
by the studies &amp; exercises here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he is giuen in his ripe age. And
these two things do vvorke three
effectes. First they do confirme a
man in that vvherein hee hath
bene trained, exercised &amp; brought
vp. Secondly, they frame his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
therevnto: And finally
they breede by custome suche a
<pb facs="tcp:4887:15"/>
perfect habite in the minde, as
being once gotten, is vvorthie
eyther of prayse or disprayse.</p>
               <p>To bring therefore into a briefe
summe those things vvhich are
chiefly to bee considered by the
vvryter, vvho hath to chronicle
any mans life: I saye that they
be these. The name of the man,
his familie, his parentes, and his
Countrye, and also his destinie,
fortune, and force or necessitie,
(if they seeme manifestly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne
to the action) his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
affections, and election,
proceeding eyther of vvisedome,
passion, or custome, his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
exercises, deedes, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and also the age, and time,
vvherein euery notable acte was
done, and the qualities of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
vvhither they vvere signes
<pb facs="tcp:4887:15"/>
and tokens of his mynde, or else
helps to the actions. And as the
vvriter is bounde to shevv the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the person chronicled,
and those exercises, and studyes,
vvhereby hee hath formed hys
maners: so also he is bounde to
tell euery deede, vvorde, signe, or
token, that maye signifie eyther
his maners, his nature, his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
thoughts, or any maner of
motion of the mynde.</p>
               <p>For, sith that the minde is the
fountayne and father of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it behooueth vs to knovv
that, as perfectly as is possible, to
the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that in measuring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his deeds, and speaches, both
profitable and hurtfull, vve may
be able to iudge of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or naughtinesse, both by
that, vvhich is honest or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
<pb facs="tcp:4887:16"/>
profitable, or hurtfull in
deede, and also by the apparance
thereof.</p>
               <p>And sith that to profite others
vvee obserue in mans lyfe none
other thing but deeds &amp; speaches:
It is needefull not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the thinges that go before,
vvhich vve haue heretofore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed:
but also those things,
vvhich of necessitie doe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
such deeds or speaches, that
is to save the doer, the causes,
the tyme, the place, the meane,
and instrumentes and such lyke,
in such sort as, the vvriter in due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
obseruing these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
may set foorth a true and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelye
Image of both lyfe and

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth and the accomplishment

to lyue contentedly, or blessedly,

<pb facs="tcp:4887:17"/>
is meete to knovve the vvay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. And then to follovve that
vvaye that vve maye attayne it.
And by this vvord peace, I meane
not onely that vvhich consisteth
in outvvarde actions, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in the mind. For, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace (thanks be vnto God,
&amp; to our most gracious Queene
vvith hir honourable Counsell,)
vve do quietly enioy here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande
at this present, and haue
done manye yeares: But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarde
peace of the heart, and
mynde, hovv small it is, God
knovveth best.</p>
               <p>The vvay to come to that peace
vvherof I speake, is partly taught
by the Philosophers in generall
precepts and rules, but the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers
doe teache it much
more playnlye by perticular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb facs="tcp:4887:17"/>
and experiences, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye
if they be vvritten vvith
that order, diligence, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they ought to be.</p>
               <p>And as the true peace standeth
chiefly vppon the contentment
of the mindes of the Citizins, as
vpon hir proper foundacion: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the ciuill discipline, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
laws, offices and duties,
of euery order and companye in
the Citie. And such peace is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
eyther by some invvarde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
or else by outvvarde
vvarre. If by invvarde sturre:
then the cause thereof is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the lacke of things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for the maintenaunce of lyfe,
as of foode, apparell, and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
or dvvelling, vvherevvith
those that are pinched, doe ryse
<pb facs="tcp:4887:18"/>
eyther agaynst they owne Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
that doe abounde and haue
plentie, or else against theyr nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbours,
and borderers. And
somtime the cause of such sturre
may be for that they be not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to participate of the honors
and dignities of the Citie, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vveale. And sometyme
they rise for excessiue tributes,
&amp; payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts leauied by the chiefe
heads. Agayne, sometime for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries
and vvrongs done by one
to another, all vvhich occasions
being taken avvay, the peace is
easilye preserued, vnto vvhiche
ende, all good lavves, orders &amp;
decrees, ought to tende, so as a
man may rightly say, that peace
vvholy consisteth in lavves vvell
made and vvell kept.</p>
               <p>And as for outvvard vvarre to
<pb facs="tcp:4887:18"/>
be offered by the straunger, it is
eyther open, or by the waye of
treason. The vvaye to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from treason, consisteth in
hauing good espyall, and true
intelligence in vvell revvarding
the discouerers of the treason, &amp;
in sharpely punishing the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
               <p>Open vvarre is eyther made
to defende, or to offende, vvhich
vvee ought alvvayes to flee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in not beginning it one way,
wee shoulde be forced to begin
it a nother waye to our disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage.</p>
               <p>Agayne, in open vvarre vve
haue to deale eyther vvith those
that be stronger, or those that be
weaker then our selues, or else
that be of equall power &amp; force,
to our selues. The weaker we
<pb facs="tcp:4887:19"/>
neede not to feare, nor yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
our equalls, vnlesse some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accidente chaunce. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we haue chiefelye to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
those that are more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
than vve be. Against whome
we haue to worke so as eyther
they may not assayle vs, or else
in assailing vs, that they may not
hurte vs. The first is to be done
eyther by loue, or by feare: by
loue, as when we procure peace,
by payeing some trybute, and
by acknovvledging their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie,
in receyuing such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
as they vvill laye vpon
vs, or by appeasing them vvyth
pleasures, vvith guyftes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardes,
or with graunting traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
and trade of marchaundise,
by marriage, and such like.</p>
               <p>We shall driue them from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayling
<pb facs="tcp:4887:19"/>
vs by feare, in preparing
or in seeming to haue prepared
all thinges necessary as well to
offende, as to defende.</p>
               <p>Againe if the enimie do assayle
vs, he will eyther beate and waste
our frontires, or else enter into
the mayne lande. Against both
vvhich daungers it shal be neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to make the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tires strong,
and to fournish them vvell with
men, and Munition, so as he
shall not be able to enter at all,
or at the least in entring he shall
haue small assuraunce of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
leauing his enimies behinde
at his backe. And being entered
we haue to vvithstande him two
vvays, that is, eyther by famine,
or by fraude, otherwise called
wily pollicie, for by force we can
not, hauing all ready presupposed
<pb facs="tcp:4887:20"/>
his force to be greater than ours.</p>
               <p>The action of vvarre consisteth
in three principall points, that is,
in lodging or incamping, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and in fighting.</p>
               <p>To incamping do belong foure
considerations, that is, that the
place be commodious for vvater,
for victuall, for safetie, and for
health.</p>
               <p>In marching vve haue to passe
eyther through our ovvne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
or through a straunge coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
the inhabitants whereof are
eyther our friendes, our foes, or
suspecte, yea, and sometime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes
hauing our enimyes at
our backes.</p>
               <p>Of fighting, there be also three
kindes, that is, skirmuching, a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
fielde, or the assaulting of
some fortified place, be it campe,
<pb facs="tcp:4887:20"/>
or tovvne: which also are woont
to be defended by some, or by all
of these three vvayes, that is, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by nature, by art, or by force
of men. And as all other things
that haue a beginning haue an
ende, so likevvise hath warre. For
by one of these foure meanes all
vvarres for the most part are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
eyther by victorie, by great
ouerthrovve, by accorde and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
or else by pouertye
and for lacke of povver &amp; force,
chauncing eyther to the one side,
or to both, and so at length warre
resorteth againe to peace, as to his
finall ende.</p>
               <p>Novve as touching sedition, it
is alvvayes mooued eyther by
the inferiour sorte, vvhich seeke
to be made equall to their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
or else by those that being
<pb facs="tcp:4887:21"/>
equall, vvoulde be superiour to
the reast: vvhich sedition is to
bee suppressed, eyther by fayre
meanes, or by fovvle meanes,
by gentlenesse, or by sharpnesse,
as vvhen the faultours, and first
beginners thereof, are sharplye
punished, eyther by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
according to lavve, or else
by the force of the other Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.
Agayne such sedition may
be appeased by gentilenesse tvvo
maner of vvayes, that is, eyther
by the authoritie of some graue
personage, that is beloued, and

                  <pb facs="tcp:4887:22"/>
In hystories things vvoulde be
disposed according to their owne

in euery action there must needs
be a dooer, or vvorker, the hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
muste first make mention of
hym, and then shevve the cause
that mooued him to doe, to what
intent and ende, in vvhat place,
and vvith vvhat meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.
And bycause tyme
doth accompany all maner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and euery action hath his

his devve time accordingly.</p>
               <p>And if the deede or action be
compounded of dyuers partes,
vvhich be also actions, the like
order is to be obserued in euery
such part as ought to be kept in
one simple action, and specially
<pb facs="tcp:4887:23"/>
vvhen the parts follovve one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another. But if many actions
appertayning as partes to one

tyme, sith it is vnpossible to tell
them all at once, they muste
needs be tolde one after another.
And synce they may be declared
eyther broken by peece meale,
or else whole togither, it is best
to tell them vvhole, noting in
euerye one the tyme, vvherein
such deede vvas done. For to tell

               <p>If many actions are to be vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vvhich do belong to one selfe

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho so is desirous to know
hovve hystories are to bee
readde, had neede first to
knovve the endes and purposes
for vvhich they are vvritten.
VVhereof though there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
as some to vvinne fame to
the vvriter and some to delighte
the readers eares that reade only
to passe avvay the time and such
like: yet in my opinion there
are but three chiefe &amp; principall.
First that vve may learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to acknovvledge the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, vvherby all things
are gouerned and directed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that by the examples of
the vvise, vve maye learne vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
vvysely to behaue our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
in all our actions, as vvell
priuate as publique, both in time
of peace and vvarre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4887:24"/>
Thirdly, that vve maye be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by example of the good to
follovve the good, and by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the euill to flee the euill.</p>
               <p>As touching the prouidence of
God, vve haue to note for what
causes and by vvhat meanes hee
ouerthrovveth one kingdome &amp;
setteth vp an other. For though
things many times doe succeede
according to the discourse of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
reason: yet mans vvisedome is
oftentymes greatlye deceyued.
And vvith those accede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which
mans vvisedome reiecteth and
little regardeth: God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
vseth, vvhen he thinketh
good, to vvorke marueylous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
And though he suffreth the
vvicked for the most part to liue
in prosperitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the good in
aduersitie: yet vve maye see by
<pb facs="tcp:4887:25"/>
many notable examples, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
asvvell his vvrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
tovvardes the vvicked, as
also his pittie and clemencie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardes
the good, that nothing
is done by chaunce, but all things
by his foresight, counsell, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prouidence.</p>
               <p>Humane vvisdome hath three
principall partes, the first vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
teacheth vs rightlye to iudge
of all thinges, vvhat is to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and vvhat is to be fled. The
seconde, hovve and by vvhat
meanes vve may best attayne to
the things which vve desire. The
thirde teacheth vs to take occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vvhen it is offered and to foresee
all peril that may hap. And the
first part requireth tvvo conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racions.
First to knovve by the
examples of others, vvhyther
<pb facs="tcp:4887:25"/>
those thinges vvhich vve desire
and seeme to vs good, be good
in deede or not: and secondlye
vvhat the obtayning therof vvill
cost. For manye tymes those
things vvhich seeme good, haue
bene cause of great euil, as riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
honour, and greatnesse, vvhich
euill proceedeth either of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things themselues, or
by euill vsing the same, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
by theyr ovvne nature,
honour, and greatnesse, causeth
enuie. And riches sometyme
causeth both enuie, murder, and
robberie. Againe, riches by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
vsing them, doe cause the
ovvner manye times to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynfull,
prowde, arrogant, &amp; to
leade a dissolute lyfe, hating all
vertuous exercises. Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise,
those thinges that seeme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
<pb facs="tcp:4887:26"/>
are manye tymes causes of
great good, partly by their owne
nature, and partly for being vvell
employed, and turned to good
vse. As pouertie of hir ovvne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
maketh a man industrious.
Agayne, if a man bee defamed or
slaundered by hys foes, hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
occasion thereby, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his ovvne faulte, and so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
theyr slaunder to his great
gayne and commoditie. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideracion of the fyrst
parte of humane vvisedome, is as
I sayde before, to consider hovve
much the thing vvhich vve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
vvill cost. For the cost maye
be such as vve vvere better to be
vvithout our desire, than to haue
it. And therefore in valueing
this cost, vvee haue to consider
our labour, and traueyle, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses,
<pb facs="tcp:4887:26"/>
and losse of tyme, also
vvhat perilles, displeasures and
griefes myght chaunce vnto vs
by hauing it, and vvhat commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
vve may enioye in being
vvithout it. Againe, to vvay the
certaintie of the euills vvheron
vve venter, and the incertayntie
of obtayning the good vvhich
vve seeke, vvhich is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
vnto vs by the examples of
many vvhich haue long sought,
deare bought, and yet obtayned
naught. Moreouer, it shall be
needefull to compare the long
time of our traueyle, and great
charges, vvith the short tyme of
enioying the thing vvhich vvee
are to obtayne. It importeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
not a little to remember that
many tymes, things doe seeme
vnto vs more precious and more
<pb facs="tcp:4887:27"/>
goodly vvhy lest vve seeke them,
than vvhen we haue gotten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And in seeking them by vnlavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, vvee haue to note
what reuenge God is vvoont to
take of such doinges, and hovve
short a tyme &amp; vvith what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
hee suffereth vs to enioye
them. So co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traryvvise, vve haue
to note vvith hovv small trauell,
and vvith hovv little charges, a
most great good benefite, is many
tymes obtayned. As touching
the second part of humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
sith some easily, and some
hardlye, doe attayne the thing
vvhich they seeke. It is needefull
in reading Hystories, to obserue
vvell euery thing that hath bene
done, by vvhom, to vvhat ende,
and vvhat meanes vvere vsed for
the accomplishment thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:4887:27"/>
vvhyther suche endes by suche
meanes, are alvvayes, or for the
most part, or seldome or neuer
obtayned, and vvhither all men
dyd vse therein lyke meanes or
diuers, &amp; if diuers, vvhich tooke
effecte, and vvhich did not, and
vvhat maner of thinges those be,
vvithout the vvhich, the ende
cannot be obtayned. And by
vvhat accidents the same is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and vvhich are vvoont to
chaunce often, and vvhich more
seldome, also vvhich may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
and vvhich cannot. And of
euery meane vve haue to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the qualities and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces
that make to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
&amp; from vvhence euery one
sprange, vvhither of industrie or
of chaunce. In the obseruing of
meanes to attayne the ende, it is
<pb facs="tcp:4887:28"/>
meete to marke vvell the order
of those meanes, and hovve they
are linked togither, vvhich or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may proceede three maner of
vvaies, that is, eyther in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vvyth the verye first thing
that tendeth to any ende, and so
forvvarde from one thing to an
other, vntil you come to the last,
or else contraryvvise in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vvith the last meane, next
to the ende, and so backevvarde
from meane to meane vntill you
come to the first, or leauing both
these vvaies, you maye take the
thirde, which is to deuide all the
meanes into their general kinds,
and to consider of all the meanes
contayned in euery kinde, apart
by themselues, of all which three
vvayes, lo here the examples in
one selfe matter of vvarre, had
<pb facs="tcp:4887:28"/>
vvith some forraine Nation.
VVherin if you do first note the
establishment of truce, and peace
vvith your mightie neighbours,
&amp; vvith those that might harme
you at home, and then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
of mony and of armour,
the choise of chiefetaines, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiyng
of souldiours, the order of
their gouernement in marching,
in incamping, and in fighting,
and so forth from one meane to
an other, euen to the victorie,
you shall follovv the first order,
but if you begin at the victorie,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the next causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as to haue fought vvith more
valiauntnesse, or vvyth greater
force, or vvith more aduauntage
eyther of place, time, or occasion,
&amp; then vvhat vvas the cause or
causes of that, &amp; vvhereof euery
<pb facs="tcp:4887:29"/>
thing proceeded, returning still
backevvard, euen to those things
vvhich in the first order vvere
first to be considered: you shall
obserue the seconde order. But if
you examine euery thing by it
selfe as the establishing of peace,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmacion of leagues, and
truces with neighbours, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
of mony, men, &amp; Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the order of Marching, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping,
and fighting, and so all
the reast of the meanes reducing
euery thing to his generall kind
without obseruing vvhat vvas
first or last done, (so as you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende
in youre diuision no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but those meanes that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne
to the obtayning of the
victorie,) then you shall obserue
the thirde order. The first order
properly belongeth to him that
<pb facs="tcp:4887:29"/>
laboureth to come to some ende
and is meete for the first reading
of any Hystorie, sith all thinges
are vvoont to be tolde in suche
order as they were done. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
order is very necessary to
iudge of euerye thing, vvhat is
vvell or euill done and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
better aftervvarde of those
thinges, vvhich vvere not easye
to be well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered of at the first.
Also vvhen a thing vvas not to
be obtayned by one meane, vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it might be obtayned by an
other meane or not, and vvhere
want is, what meane vvere most
mete to supply eche others place.
But if so much knovvledge were
not to bee gathered oute of that
tale, or Hystorie, then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider
by vvhat meanes the lyke ende
had bene obtayned else vvhere.
<pb facs="tcp:4887:30"/>
VVherby you shall see, that one
hath brought a thing to passe by
one meane vvhiche an other
coulde not doe the like by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meane.</p>
               <p>In vsing this consideration in
many like causes &amp; declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
you shalbe able quicklye to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
vvhich meanes bee good
and vvhich be not, to bring anye
thing to passe. The third order is
good for him that hath obserued
the tvvo first orders, to reduce all
things in to a briefe summe, that
he may the more easily commit
them to memorie, or vvhen he
hath, to put any thing in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as to make diuers prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
or to distribute to diuers persons
diuers charges and offices. But
vvho so euer doth consider and
examine euerye thing, that is
<pb facs="tcp:4887:30"/>
of any moment or importance by
all these three orders aforesayde:
cannot choose but reape of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
great benefite. And bycause
vve finde manye tymes, that like
meanes haue bene vsed to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
of like endes, (as vve sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
&amp; yet not vvith like successe,
we ought therfore diligently to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the diuers natures of thinges,
and the differences of tymes, and
occasions, and such like accidents,
to see if vve can possibly finde out
the cause why mens purposes haue
taken effect at one time, and not at
an other. And by noting all that
hath bene sayde, touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and propertie of anye thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
vve shall learne vvhich accidentes
are vvoont to accompanie togither
and vvhich not. Thus much tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the first and seconde part of
<pb facs="tcp:4887:31"/>
humaine vvisedome.</p>
               <p>Novv to the thirde part, vvherby
we are taught not only to note the
taking and leauing of all occasions
and opportunities, vvhereby anye
good hath bene procured: but also
all the daungers of euills, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in tyme haue beene vvyselye
foreseene, and fled: or into vvhich
for lacke of foresight, men haue
headlong fallen, hauing therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
to euery mannes state, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
facultie, profession, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such like circumstaunces, to
the intent that vve our selues may
learne thereby to doe nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedly.
And as the examples of
prosperous successes, vvhich God
hath gyuen as iuste revvardes to
those, that vvoorke according to
vertue: the great good will and
loue that all men haue tovvardes
<pb facs="tcp:4887:31"/>
them: their fame, glorie, &amp; praise,
sounding in all mens mouthes, and
finally their immortalitie in being
chronycled for their noble actes, do
chiefely serue, to sturre vs, to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
honest, and commendable
doinges: Euen so, nothing is more
meete to dravve vs from vice, and
dishonest dealing, than the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of euill successes, vvhich God
hath giuen to the vvicked, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
for theyr euill deserts:
their shame &amp; infamie: the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
&amp; enmitie, that they procure
to themselues, not onelye vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
they lyue, but also after their
death: the Infamie which they
leaue to their familye, posteritie, &amp;
countrie, vvhose secrete wycked
deeds, are layde open to the world
by vvritten Hystorie, in such sort,
as men vvill not for shame once
<pb facs="tcp:4887:32"/>
name those persons, vvhiche in
their life time, woulde be honored
as Gods. Moreouer, to this thirde
part doe appertayne, all the great
labours, expenses, and perils, that
noble minded men haue sustained,
eyther in following that vvhich is
good and commendable, or in flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that vvhich is euill, &amp; detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And to the intent that in our
reading vve omitte nothing vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be noted: vve maye not
make ouer much haste, but rather
reade ley surely and vvith Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that remembring euerye
thing meete to be obserued: vvee
may fitly applie the same to some
good purpose, and make it to serue
our tourne, vvhen neede is. And
though vve seeke by reading Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
to make our selues more
wyse, asvvell to direct our ovvne
<pb facs="tcp:4887:32"/>
actions, as also to counsell others,
to sturre them to vertue, and to
vvithdravve them from vice, and
to beautyfie our ovvne speache
vvith graue examples, vvhen vve
discourse of anye matters, that
therby it may haue the more auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
waight, and credite: yet
there is some difference of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion
to be had, when by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
wee mynde to profite oure
selues, &amp; when vve minde to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
others. For manye tymes a
thing of small importaunce, maye
eyther quicken, or confirme in our
selues a part of vvisedome of great
importaunce, but in counselling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(if wee woulde haue our
woordes to be of force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie)
vve muste vse those examples
that be of waight and importance.
And therefore vvhen we finde any
<pb facs="tcp:4887:33"/>
such in our reading, vve must not
onely consider of them, but also
note them apart by themselues in
such order, as we may easily finde
them, when soeuer we shall haue
neede to vse them. And the order
of such examples, would not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
according to the names of
the persons, from vvhence they are
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which order some writers do
commonlye vse in the tables of
theyr bookes, but rather according
to the matters &amp; purposes vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they serue. Neyther is it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in this behalfe, to haue onely
common places of vertues and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or of thinges commendable,
and not commendable, but other
places also besydes them, meete to
be applyed to euerye one of those
partes of obseruacion, vvhiche
vvee seeke, vvhich places are to
<pb facs="tcp:4887:33"/>
be founde, ordered, and disposed,
not before vvee begin to reade,
but whylest wee continue in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and in obseruing all kynde
of matters euery day vvith better
iudgement than other. And by
considering vnder what title euery
example is to be placed (for the
ready finding thereof) vvee shall
greatlye helpe our memorie. But
novve to conclude, as he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
these obseruacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in reading
Hystories, shall reape, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that fruite which is proper,
to that kynde of studye, and bee
able therby greatly to profite both
himselfe, and his commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvealth:
So I can not tell vvhyther I may
deryde, or rather pittie the great
follie of those vvhich hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
all theyr lyfe tyme in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
doe knovv nothing in the
<pb facs="tcp:4887:34"/>
ende, but the discents, genealoges,
and petygrees, of noble men, and
vvhen such a King or Emperour
raigned, &amp; such lyke stuffe, vvhich
