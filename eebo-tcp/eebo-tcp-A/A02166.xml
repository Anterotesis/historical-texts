            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, I know you ar not vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the death of <hi>Robert Greene,</hi> whose pen in his life time pleased you as well on the Stage, as in the Stationers shops: And to speake truth, although his loose life was odious to God and offensiue to men, yet forasmuch as at his last end he found it most grieuous to himselfe (as appeareth by this his repentant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) I doubt not but he shall for the same deserue fauour both of God and men. And considering Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that <hi>Venus</hi> hath her charmes to inchaunt; that Fancie is a Sorceresse bewitching the Senses, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the onely enemie to all vertuous actions. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the purest glasse is the most brickle, the finest Lawne the soonest staind, the highest Oake most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the wind, and the quickest wit the more easily woone to folly: I doubt not but you will with regarde forget his follies, and like to the Bee gather hony out of the good counsels of him, who was wise, learned and polliticke, had not his lasciuious life withdrawen him from those studies which had been far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb facs="tcp:20421:3"/>
to him.</p>
            <p>For herein appeareth that he was a man giuen ouer to the lust of his owne heart, forsaking all godlines &amp; one that daily delighted in all manner of wickednes. Since other therefore haue forerun him in the like faults, and haue been forgiuen both of God and men I trust hee shall bee the better accepted, that by the working of Gods holy spirit, returnes with such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued Repentance, being a thing acceptable both to God and men.</p>
            <p>To conclude, forasmuch as I found this discourse very passionate, and of woonderfull effect to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the wicked from their vngodly waies, I thoght good to publish the same: and the rather, for that by his repentance they may as in a glasse see their owne follie, and thereby in time resolue, that it is better to die repentant, than to liue dishonest.</p>

            <head>To all the wanton youths of England: <hi>Robert Greene</hi> wisheth refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of wilfulnes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I consider (kinde Cuntrimen) that youth is like to the spring time of mans age readie in the bloome to be nipped with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie misfortune, and that a yong man is like to a tender plant, apt to be wrested by nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either to good or euill, as his friendes like good Gardeners shall with care indeuour his education, seeing in the prime of our yeares vice is most ready to creepe in, and that want of experience committeth sundrie wanton desires, I thoght good to lay before you a president of such preiudiciall inconueniences, which at the first seeming sweete vnto youth, at the last growe into fruits of bitter repentance: For a yong man led on by selfe will (hauing the raines of libertie in his owne hand) foreseeth not the ruth of follie, but aimeth at present pleasures, for he giues himselfe vp to delight, and thinketh euerie thing good, honest; lawfull and vertuous, that fitteth for the content of his lasciuious humour: hee foreseeth not that such as clime hastely, fall sodainely: that Bees haue stings as well as honie: that vices haue ill endes as well as sweete beginnings: and whereof growes this heedles life, but of
<pb facs="tcp:20421:4"/>
selfe conceit, thinking the good counsell of age is dotage: that the aduice of friends proceeds of enuie, and not of loue: that when their fathers correct them for their faults, they hate them: whereas when the blacke Oxe hath trod on their feete, and the Crowes foote is seene in their eies, then toucht with the feeling of their owne follie, they sigh out had I wist, when repentance commeth too late. Or like as waxe is ready to receiue euerie newe fourme, that is stamped into it, so is youth apt to admit of euery vice that is obiected vnto it, and in young yeares wanton desires is cheefely predominate especiallie the two Ringleaders of all other mischiefes, namely pride and whoredome, these are the Syrens that with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting melodies, drawe them on to vtter confusion, for after a young man hath suckt in that sinne of pride, hee groweth into contempt, and as he increaseth prowde in his attyre, so he is scornfull in his lookes, and disdaines the wholsome admonition of his honest freends, whose aduice he supposeth to be doone of malice, and therefore estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his owne waies best, and had rather hazard his life, than to loose an intch of his credit. Pride is like to fier, that will die and goe out if it bee not maintained with fewell, and yet lay on neuer so bigge logges, it consumes them all to ashes, so pride craues maintenance, or els it will fade: and had a young man neuer so great reuenues, pride at last will reduce it to begger you, for it is such a sinne, as once got into the boane it will step into the flesh, he that once ietteth in his brauerie: if he haue no meanes to maintaine it, it will leaue no bad course of life vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but hee will haue corners to vphold his follie. Heereof growes coossenages, thefts, murthers, and a thousand other pettie mischiefes, and causes many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

persons to bee trust vp at the gallowes, purchasing thereby infamy to themselues, and hart breaking sorrow to their friends and parents for euer.</p>
            <p>Companion to this vice, is lust and lecherie, which is the viper, whose venome is incurable, and the onely sinne that in this life leadeth vnto shame, and after death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire: for he that giueth himselfe ouer to harlots, selleth his soule to destruction, and maketh his bodie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all incurable diseases. These two vices do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie waste a mans substance, but also consumeth his bodie and soule, and maketh him attempt to do any mischiefe for his maintenance therein. If happely the young man hath any grace, and is loth to take any vnlawfull wayes, the ordinary course of his copesmates, is straight to call him coward, and cast him out of their fauour, or els by svveete persvvasions and flattering vvordes, make him forsake God and all good meanes of life vvhatsoeuer: this is the manner, life, and course of such as vvill not listen to the graue aduice of their parents, but seeke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring their graie haires vvith greefe vnto theyr graues.</p>
            <p>This ensuing discourse, gentle Reader, dooth lay open the graceles endeuours of my selfe, vvho although I vvere for a long time giuen ouer to the lust of my ovvn hart, yet in the end, Gods grace did so fauourablie worke in me, that I trust heerein thou shalt perceiue my true and vnfained repentance. Accept it in good part, and if it may profit anie I haue my desire.</p>

            <head>The Repentance of Robert Greene, Maister of Arts.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is no steele so stiffe, but the stamp will pierce; no flint so harde, but the drops of raine will hollowe: so there is no heart so voide of grace, or giuen ouer to wilfull follie, but the mercifull fauour of God can mollifie. An instance of the like chaunced to my selfe, being a man wholy addicted to all gracelesse indeuors, giuen from my youth to wantonnes, brought vp in riot who as I grew in yeares, so I waxed more ripe in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines, that I was the mirrour of mischiefe, and the very patterne of all preiudiciall actions: for I neither had care to take any good course of life, nor yet to listen to the friendly perswasions of my parents. I seemed as one of no religion, but rather as a meere Atheist, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the holy precepts vttered by any learned prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I would smile at such as would frequent the Church, or such place of godly exercise, &amp; would scoffe at any that would checke mee with any wholesome or
<pb facs="tcp:20421:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good admonition: so that herein I seemed a meere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, the child of Sathan, one wipt out of the booke of life, and as an outcast from the face and fauor of God, I was giuen ouer to drunkennes, so that I lightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of that company that would not intertaine my inordinate quaffing. And to this beastly sinne of glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, I added that detestable vice of swearing, taking a felicitie in blaspeming &amp; prophaning the name of God, confirming nothing idlely but with such solemne oths, that it amazed euen my companions to heare mee. And that I might seeme to heape one sinne vpon another, I was so rooted therein, that whatsoeuer I got, I stil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the same in drunkennes.</p>
            <p>Liuing thus a long time, God (who suffereth sinners to heape coles of fire vpon their owne heads, and to bee fed fat with sinne against the day of vengeance) suffered me to go forward in my loose life: many warninges I had to draw me from my detestable kind of life, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers crosses to contrary my actions: but all in vaine, for though I were sundry times afflicted with many foule and greeuous diseases, and thereby scourged with the rod of Gods wrath, yet when by the great labor &amp; frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of sundry honest persons, they had (though to their great charges) sought &amp; procured my recouery, I did with the Dog <hi>Redire in vomitum,</hi> I went again with the Sow to wallow in the mire, and fell to my former follies as frankly, as if I had not tasted any iot of want, or neuer been scourged for them. <hi>Consuetudo peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di tollit sensum peccati</hi>; my daily custome in sinne had cleane taken away the feeling of my sinne: for I was so giuen to these vices aforesaide, that I counted them rather veniall scapes &amp; faults of nature, than any great
<pb facs="tcp:20421:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and greeuous offences: neither did I care for death, but held it onely as the end of life. For comming one day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aldersgate street to a welwillers house of mine, hee with other of his friendes perswaded mee to leaue my bad course of life, which at length would bring mee to vtter destruction, whereupon I scoffingly made them this answer. Tush, what better is he that dies in his bed than he that endes his life at Tyburne, all owe God a death: if I may haue my desire while I liue, I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, let me shift after death as I may. My friends hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these words, greatly greeued at my gracelesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, made this reply: If you feare not death in this world, nor the paines of the body in this life, yet doubt the second death, &amp; the losse of your soule, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearty repentance must rest in hell fire for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>Hell (quoth I) what talke you of hell to me: I know if I once come there, I shal haue the company of better men than my selfe, I shal also meete with some madde knaues in that place, &amp; so long as I shall not sit there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, my care is the lesse. But you are mad folks (quoth I) for if I feared the Iudges of the bench no more than I dread the iudgements of God, I would before I slept diue into one Carles bagges or other, and make merrie with the shelles I found in them so long as they would last. And though some in this company were Fryers of mine owne fraternitie to whom I spake the wordes: yet were they so amazed at my prophane speeches, that they wisht themselues foorth of my company. Whereby appeareth, that my continuall delight was in sinne, and that I made my selfe drunke with the dregges of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. But beeing departed thence vnto my lodging,
<pb facs="tcp:20421:7"/>
and now grown to the full, I was checked by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand of God: for <hi>Sicknes</hi> (the messenger of death) attached me, and tolde me my time was but short, and that I had not long to liue: whereupon I was vexed in mind, and grew very heauy. As thus I sate solempu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinking of my end, and feeling my selfe waxe sicker and sicker, I fell into a great passion, and was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perplexed, yet no way discouered my agony, but sate still calling to mind the lewdnes of my former life: at what time sodainly taking the booke of <hi>Resolution</hi> in my hand, I light vpon a chapter therein, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered vnto mee the miserable state of the reprobate, what Hell was, what the worme of Conscience was, what tormentes there was appointed for the damned soules, what vnspeakable miseries, what vnquenchable flames, what intollerable agonies, what incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible griefs; that there was nothing but feare, horrour, veration of mind, depriuation from the sight and fauour of God, weeping and gnashing of teeth, and that al those tortures were not termined or dated within any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of yeares, but euerlasting world without end; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all in this of the Psalmes: <hi>Ab inferis nulla est redemptio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that I had with deepe consideration pondered vpon these points, such a terrour stroke into my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that for very anguish of minde my teeth did beate in my head, my lookes waxed pale and wan, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great sigh, I cried vnto God, and said: If all this be true, oh what shall become of me: If the rewarde of sinne be death and hell, how many deaths and hels do I deserue, that haue beene a most miserable sinner? If damnation be the meed for wickednes, then am I dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
<pb facs="tcp:20421:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for in all the world there neuer liued a man of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser life. Oh what shall I doe? I cannot call to God for mercie; for my faultes are beyond the compasse of his fauour: the punishment of the body hath an ende by death, but the paines of the soule by death are made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. Then what a miserable case am I in if I die? yet if my death might redeeme my offences, &amp; wash away my sinnes, oh might I suffer euery day twentie deathes while seuen yeares lasteth, it were nothing: but when I shall end a contempt to the world, I shal enioy the disdaine of men, the displeasure of God, &amp; my soule (that immortall creature) shall euerlastingly bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Oh woe is mee, why doe I liue? nay rather why was I borne? Cursed be the day wherein I was born, and haplesse be the brests that gaue me sucke. Why did God create me to bee a vessell of wrath? Why did hee breath life into me, thus to make me a lost sheepe? Oh I feele a hell already in my conscience, the number of my sinnes do muster before my eies, the poore mens plaints that I haue wronged, cries out in mine eares and saith, <hi>Robin Greene</hi> thou art damnd; nay, the iustice of God tels mee I cannot bee saued. Now I do remember (though too late) that I haue read in the Scriptures, how neither adulterers, swearers, theeues, nor murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers shall inherite the kingdome of heauen. What hope then can I haue of any grace, when (giuen ouer from all grace) I exceeded all other in these kinde of sinnes? If thus vppon earth and aliue I feele a hell, oh what a thing is that hell, where my soule shall euerlastingly liue in torments. I am taught by the scripture to pray; but to whom shoulde I pray? to him that I haue blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, to him that I haue contemned and despised,
<pb facs="tcp:20421:8"/>
whose name I haue taken in vaine? No, no, I am in a hell. Oh that my last gaspe were come, that I might be with Iudas or Cain, for their place is better than mine; or that I might haue power with these hands to vnlose my soule from this wretched carcasse, that hath impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned so many wicked villainies within it. Oh I haue sinned, not against the Father, nor against the Sonne, but against the holy Ghost: for I presumed vpon grace, and when the spirit of God cried in my mind &amp; thoght, and said, drunkennes is a vice, whoredome is a vice; I carelesly (in contempt) resisted this motion, and as it were in a brauery, committed these sinnes with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Oh now I shall crie with Diues to haue one drop of water for my tongue, but shall not be heard: I haue sinned against my owne soule, and therefore shalbe cast into vtter darknesse: and further I shall not come till I haue paid the vttermost farthing, which I shal neuer be able to satisfie. O happy are you that feele the sparks of Gods fauour in your hearts, happy are you that haue hope in the passion of Christ, happy are you that beleue that God died for you, happy are you that can pray. Oh why doth not God shew the like mercie vnto mee? The reason is, because in all my life I neuer did any good. I alwaies gloried in sinne, and despised them that imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vertue. God is iust, and cannot pardon my offences; and therefore I would I were out of this earthly hell, so I were in that second hell, that my soule might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer tormentes: for now I am vexed both in soule and bodie.</p>
            <p>In this despairing humor, searching further into the said Booke of <hi>Resolution,</hi> I found a place that greatly did comfort mee, &amp; laid before me the promises of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:20421:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mercie, shewing mee that although the Iustice of God was great to punish sinners, yet his mercie did exceede his works: and though my faults were as red as skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, yet washt with his bloud, they shoulde bee made as white as snow: therein was laid before mine eyes, that Dauid (who was called a man after his owne heart) did both commit adultery, and sealde it with murther: yet when hee did repent, God heard him, and admited him to his fauour. Therin was laid before me the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sinne of Peter, that not onely denied his Maister Christ, but also forswore himselfe: yet so soone as hee shed tears, and did hartily repent him, his offences were pardoned. Therein was laid open the theefe that had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued licentiously, and had scarse in all his life done one good deed, and yet hee was saued by hope in the mercies of God. Therein was also laide open how the seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Law was mittigated with the sweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promises of the Gospell, insomuch that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be somewhat pacified, &amp; a little quieted in mind, taking great ioy and comfort in the pithie perswasions and promises of Gods mercie alleadged in that Booke. And yet I was not presently resolued in my conscience, that God would deale so fauorably with me, for that stil the multitude of my sinnes presented me with his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: and would therefore reason thus with my selfe. Why, those men (before mentioned) were elected and predestinated to be chosen vessels of Gods glory, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they did fal, yet they rose againe, &amp; did shew it in time, with some other fruits of their election. But contrariwise, I (the most wicked of all men) was euen brought vp from my swadling clouts in wickednes, my infancy was sin, &amp; my riper age increast in wickednes; I
<pb facs="tcp:20421:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tooke no pleasure but in ill, neither was my minde sette vpon any thing but vpon the spoyle: then seeing all my life was lead in lewdnes, and I neuer but once felt any remorse of conscience, how can God pardon mee, that repent rather for feare than for loue? Yet calling vnto mind the words of <hi>Esay,</hi> that at what time soeuer a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth repent him from the bottome of his heart, the Lord would wipe away all his wickednes out of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
            <p>Thus beeing at a battaile betweene the spirite and the flesh, I beggane to feele a greater comfort in my mind, so that I did teares confesse and acknowledge, that although I was a most miserable sinner, yet the anguish that Christ suffered on the Crosse, was able to purge and cleanse me from all my offences: so that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold with faith vpon the promises of the Gospell, I waxed strong in spirite, and became able to resist and withstand all the desperate attempts that Sathan had giuen before to my weake and feéble conscience. When thus I had consideratly thought on the wretchednes of my life, and therewithall looked into the vncertainty of death, I thought good to write a short discourse of my the same, which I haue ioyned to this treatise, containing as followeth.</p>

            <head>The life and death of Robert Greene Maister of Artes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Neede not make long discourse of my parentes, who for their grauitie and honest life is well knowne and esteemed amongst their neighbors; namely, in the Cittie of Norwitch, where I was bred and borne. But as out of one selfe same clod of clay there sprouts both stinking weeds and delightfull flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: so from honest parentes often grow most dishonest children; for my Father had care to haue mee in my Non-age brought vp at schoole, that I might through the studie of good letters grow to be a frend to my self, a profitable member to the common-welth, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to him in his age. But as early pricks the tree that will proue a thorne: so euen in my first yeares I began to followe the filthines of mine owne desires, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to listen to the wholesome aduertisements of my parentes, nor bee rulde by the carefull correction of my Maister. For being at the Uniuersitie of Cambridge, I
<pb facs="tcp:20421:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
light amongst wags as lewd as my selfe, with whome I consumed the flower of my youth, who drew mee to trauell into Italy, and Spaine, in which places I sawe and practizde such villaime as is abhominable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Thus by their counsaile I sought to furnish my selfe with coine, which I procured by cunning sleights from my Father and my friends, and my Mother pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered me so long, and secretly helped mee to the oyle of Angels, that I grew thereby proue to all mischiefe: so that beeing then conuersant with notable Braggarts, boon companions and ordinary spend-thrifts, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized sundry superficiall studies, I became as a Sien grafted into the same stocke, whereby I did absolutely participate of their nature and qualities. At my return into England, I ruffeled out in my silks, in the habit of <hi>Malcontent,</hi> and seemed so discontent, that no place would please me to abide in, nor no vocation cause mee to stay my selfe in: but after I had by degrees procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Maister of Arts, I left the Uniuersitie and away to London, where (after I had continued some short time, &amp; driuen my self out of credit with sundry of my frends) I became an Author of Playes, and a pennier of Loue Pamphlets, so that I soone grew famous in that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that who for that trade growne so ordinary about London as <hi>Robin Greene.</hi> Yong yet in yeares, though olde in wickednes, I began to resolue that there was nothing bad, that was profitable: whereupon I grew so rooted in all mischiefe, that I had as great a delight in wickednesse, as sundrie hath in godlinesse: and as much felicitie I tooke in villainy, as others had in honestie.</p>
            <p>Thus was the libertie I got in my youth, the cause
<pb facs="tcp:20421:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of my licentious liuing in my age, and beeing the first steppe to hell, I find it now the first let from heauen.</p>
            <p>But I would wish all my natiue Countrymen, that reade this my repentaunce; First to feare God in their whole life, which I neuer did: Secondly, to obey their Parents, and to listen vnto the wholesome counsaile of their Elders: so shall their dayes be multiplied vppon them heere on earth, and inherite the crowne of glorie in the kingdome of heauen. I exhort them also to leaue the company of lewd and ill liuers: for conuersing with such Copes-mates, drawes them into sundry dangerous inconueniences: nor lette them haunt the company of harlots, whose throates are as smooth as oyle, but their feet lead the steps vnto death and destruction: for they like Syrens with their sweete inchaunting notes, soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed me vp in all kind of vngodlines.</p>
            <p>Oh take heede of Harlots (I wish you the vnbridled youth of England) for they are the Basiliskes that kill with their eyes, they are the Syrens that allure with their sweete lookes; and they leade their fauorers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their destruction, as a sheepe is lead vnto the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>From whordome I grew to drunkennes, from drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes to swearing and blasphemiug the name of God, hereof grew quarrels, frayes, and continual controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, which are now as wormes in my conscience gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incessantly. And did I not through hearty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance take hold of Gods mercies, euen these detestable sinnes woulde drench me downe into the damnable pit of destruction; for <hi>Stipendium peccati mors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh knowe (good Countrymen) that the horrible sins and intollerable blasphemie I haue vsed against the
<pb facs="tcp:20421:11"/>
Maiestie of God, is a blocke in my conscience, and that so heauy that there were no way with me but desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the hope of Christs death and passion did not helpe to ease mee of so intollerable and heauie a burthen.</p>
            <p>I haue long with the deafe Adder stopt mine eares against the voice of Gods Ministers, yea my heart was hardened with Pharao against all the motions that the spirit of God did at any time worke in my mind, to turn me from my detestable kind of liuing.</p>
            <p>Yet let me confesse a trueth, that euen once, and yet but once, I felt a feare and horrour in my conscience, &amp; then the terrour of Gods iudgementes did manifestly teach me that my life was had, that by sinne I deserued damnation, and that such was the greatnes of my sinne, that I deserued no redemption. And this inward moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I receiued in Saint Andrews Church in the Cittie of Norwich, at a Lecture or Sermon then preached by a godly learned man, whose doctrine, and the maner of whose teaching, I liked wonderfull well: yea (in my conscience) such was his singlenes of hart, and zeale in his doctrine, that hee might haue conuerted the most monster of the world.</p>
            <p>Well, at that time, whosoeuer was worst, I knewe my selfe as bad as he: for being new come from Italy, (where I learned all the villanies vnder the heauens) I was drownd in pride, whoredome was my daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and gluttony with drunkennes was my onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p>At this Sermon the terrour of Gods iudgementes did manifestly teach me, that my exercises were damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that I should bee wipte out of the booke of life, if I did not speedily repent my loosenes of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb facs="tcp:20421:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my misdemeanors.</p>
            <p>At this Sermon the said learned man (who doubtles was the child of God) did beate downe sinne in such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and perswasiue manner, that I began to call vnto mind the daunger of my soule, and the preiudice that at length would befall mee for those grosse sinnes which with greedines I daily committed: in so much as sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I said in my selfe, Lord haue mercie vpon mee, and send me grace to amend and become a new man.</p>
            <p>But this good motion lasted not long in mee; for no sooner had I met with my copesmates, but seeing me in such a solemne humour, they demaunded the cause of my sadnes: to whom when I had discouered that I sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my wickednesse of life, and that the Preachers wordes had taken a deepe impression in my conscience, they fell vpon me in ieasting manner, calling me Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane and Presizian, and wished I might haue a Pulpit, with such other scoffing tearmes, that by their foolish perswasion the good and wholesome lesson I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned went quite out of my remembrance: so that I fel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the Dog to my olde vomit, and put my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life in practise, and that so throughly as euer I did before.</p>
            <p>Thus although God sent his holy spirit to call mee, and though I heard him, yet I regarded it no longer than the present time, when sodainly forsaking it, I went forward obstinately in my misse. Neuerthelesse soone after I married a Gentlemans daughter of good account, with whom I liued for a while: but forasmuch as she would perswade me from my wilfull wickednes, after I had a child by her, I cast her off, hauing spent vp the marriage money which I obtained by her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20421:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Then left I her at six or seuen, who went into Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colneshire, and I to London: where in short space I fell into fauor with such as were of honorable and good cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But heere note, that though I knew how to get a friend, yet I had not the gift or reason how to keepe a friend: for hee that was my dearest friend, I would bee sure so to behaue my selfe towards him, that he shoulde euer after professe to bee my vtter enemie, or else vowe neuer after to come in my company.</p>
            <p>Thus my misdemeanors (too many to bee recited) caused the most part of those so much to despise me, that in the end I became friendles, except it were in a fewe Alehouses, who commonly for my inordinate expences would make much of me, vntil I were on the score, far more than euer I meant to pay by twenty nobles thick. After I had wholy betaken me to the penning of plaies (which was my continuall exercise) I was so far from calling vpon God, that I sildome thought on God, but tooke such delight in swearing and blaspheming the name of God, that none could thinke otherwise of mee, than that I was the child of perdition.</p>
            <p>These vanities and other trifling Pamphlets I pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Loue, and vaine fantasies was my chiefest stay of liuing, and for those my vaine discourses, I was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the more vainer sort of people, who beeing my continuall companions, came still to my lodging, and there would continue quaffing, carowsing, and surfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with me all the day long.</p>
            <p>But I thanke God, that hee put it in my head, to lay open the most horrible coosenages of the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-catchers, Cooseners, and Crosse-biters, which I haue indifferently handled in those my seuerall discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:20421:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
already imprinted. And my trust is, that those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses will doe great good, and bee very beneficiall to the Common-wealth of England.</p>
            <p>But oh my deare Wife, whose company and sight I haue refrained these sixe yeares: I aske God and thee forgiuenesse for so greatly wronging thee, of whome I seldome or neuer thought vntill now: Pardon mee (I pray thee) where soeuer thou art, and God forgiue mee all my offences.</p>
            <p>And now to you all that liue and reuell in such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse as I haue done, to you I write, and in Gods name wish you to looke to your selues, and to reforme your selues for the safegard of your owne soules: dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble not with God, but seeke grace at his handes, hee hath promist it, and he will performe it.</p>
            <p>God doth sundry times deferre his puishment vnto those that runne a wicked race; but <hi>Quod defertur non aufertur,</hi> that which is deferde is not quittanst, a day of reckoning will come, when the Lord will say; <hi>Come giue account of thy Stewardship.</hi> What God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, man cannot preuent: he that binds two sinnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, cannot go vnpunisht in the one: so long the Pot goeth to the Pit, that at last it comes broken home.</p>
            <p>Therefore (all my good friends) hope not in money, nor in friends, in fauors, in kindred, they are all vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and they are furthest off, when men thinke them most nigh. Oh were I now to begin the flower of my youth, were I now in the prime of my yeares, how far would I bee from my former follyes? what a reformed course of life would I take: but it is too late; onely now the comfortable mercies of the Lord is left me to hope in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20421:13"/>It is bootlesse for me to make any long discourse to such as are gracelesse as I haue beene, all wholesome warninges are odious vnto them, for they with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sucke poison out of the most pretious flowers, &amp; to such as God hath in his secrete councell elected, fewe words will suffize. But howsoeuer my life hath beene, let my repentant ende be a generall example to all the youth in England to obey their parentes, to flie whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, drunkennes, swearing, blaspheming, contempt of the word, and such greéuous and grosse sinnes, least they bring their parents heads with sorrow to their graues, and least (with mee) they be a blemish to their kindred, and to their posteritie for euer.</p>
            <p>Thus may you see how God hath secrete to himselfe the times of calling, and when hee will haue them into his vineyard, some hee calles in the morning, some at noone, and some in the euening, and yet hath the last his wages aswell as the first: For as his iudgementes are inscrutable, so are his mercies incomprehensible. And therefore let all men learne these two lessons; not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, because God may worke in them through his spirit at the last houre; nor to presume, least God giue them ouer for their presumption, and deny them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and so they die impenitent: which <hi>finalis impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentia</hi> is a manifest sinne against the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>To this doth that golden sentence of. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> allude, which hee speaketh of the theefe hanging on the Crosse. <hi>There was</hi> (saith hee) <hi>one theefe saued and no more, therefore presume not; and there was one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and therefore despaire not.</hi> And to conclude, take these caueats hereafter following.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that he had pend the former discourse (then lying sore sicke of a surfet which hee had taken with drinking) hee continued most patient and penitent; yea, he did with teares forsake the world, renounced swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and desired forgiuenes of God and the worlde for all his offences: so that during all the time of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (which was about a moneths space) hee was neuer heard to sweare, raue, or blaspheme the name of God as he was accustomed to do before that time, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted his welwillers, to see how mightily the grace of God did worke in him.</p>
               <p>He confessed himselfe that he was neuer heart sicke, but said that al his paine was in his belly. And although he continually scowred, yet still his belly sweld, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer left swelling vpward, vntill it sweld him at the hart and in his face.</p>
               <p>During the whole time of his sicknes, he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called vpon God, and recited these sentences follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Lord Iesus Christ my Sauiour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, I humbly beseech thee to looke downe from heauen vpon mee (thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant that am grieued with thy spirite that I may patiently endure to the end thy rod of chastisement: And forasmuch as thou art Lorde of life and death, as also of strength health, age, weakenes, and sicknes, I do therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit my selfe vnto thee, to bee dealt withall accor.+ding to thy holy will and pleasure. And seeing O mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Iesu, that my sinnes are innumerable like vnto the sandes of the sea, and that I haue so often offended thee that I haue worthely deserued death and vtter damnation, I humbly pray thee to deale with me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy gratious mercie and not agreeable to my wicked deserts. And graunt that I may (O Lorde) through thy spirite with patience, suffer and beare this Crosse, which thou hast worthily laid vppon mee: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding how greeuous soeuer the burthen thereof be, that my faith may be found laudable and glorious in thy sight, to the increase of thy glory, &amp; my euerlasting felicitie. For euen thou (O Lord) most sweete Sauior didst first suffer paine before thou wert crucified: Since therefore O meeke Lambe of God that my way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb facs="tcp:20421:16"/>
ioy is to suffer with thee worldly greeuances, graunt that I may be made like vnto thee, by suffering paciently, aduersitie, trouble, and sicknes. And lastly, forasmuch as the multitude of thy mercies doth put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinnes of those which truely repent, so as thou remembrest them no more, open the eye of thy mercie, and behold me a most miserable and wretched sinner, who for the same doth most earnestly desire pardon and forgiuenes. Renew (O Lorde) in mee, whatsoeuer hath beene decayed by the fraudulent mallice of Sathan, or my owne carnall wilfulnes: receiue me (O Lord) into thy fauour, consider of my contrition, and gather vp my teares into thy heauenly habitation: and seeing (O Lorde) my whole trust and confidence is onely in thy mercie, blot out my offences, and tread them vnder feet, so as they may not be a witnesse against me at the day of wrath. Grant this O Lord, I humbly beseech thee, for thy mercies sake. Amen.</p>
