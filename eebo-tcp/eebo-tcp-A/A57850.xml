            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Nay stay a little! what are you angry! I only <hi>frangebam jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oum</hi> did but break a jest, which with us in both is instead &amp; ought to be done although on a mans life; and you take it <hi>in bono serio,</hi>

                  <p>But are you <hi>in sobria tristitia</hi>; speak you this in sober sadnesse?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ignor.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diable!</hi> what Fraud, what Covine, what Deceit is this? was there not an Indenture made betwixt you and me, that if I gave you six hundred Crowns, I should marry your Ward <hi>Rosabella</hi>; and was not this <hi>dies appunctatus</hi> the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Day for the payment of it? Is not this true?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Torc.</speaker>
                  <p>It is.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ignor.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, do what you will, I have your Indenture and Obligation safe and sound, signed and dated, and delivered with your own hand? And if you deliver me not <hi>Rosabella,</hi> you will forfeit the Obligation which is no lesse then a thousand Crowns. What say you now, there is but one Law, and but one King, you will find no mediety of language to defend you. What say you?</p>
                  <p>He thinks all things are transacted here as in the Courts of <hi>England,</hi> but if you bring me this day the six hundred Crowns I will not alter my resolution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ignor.</speaker>
                  <p>You do well; it is agreed already, and condiscended to; therefore if possibly I can, I will come my self in my own person this day with the mony; if I cannot, I will send one of my Clerks unto you with it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Torc.</speaker>
                  <p>But I know none of your Clerks.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ignor.</speaker>
                  <p>And none of my Clerks know you, <hi>Sed est totum unum pro eo,</hi> It is all one for that; He shall bring you the six hundred Crowns, and the Instruments, And I will tell him that the better to know you, you have a crooked neck; Do you fear any thing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Torc.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I fear <hi>Antonio,</hi> and the most cunning <hi>Trico,</hi> who everywhere lie in wait to take <hi>Rosabella</hi> from me, I cannot take heed enough, and be so wary of them as I should be when I am most heedful; It is safest therefore to agree upon some private to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for to add a Caution unto a Caution is to be doubly cautious.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ignor.</speaker>
                  <p>Although it be needlesse, yet if my Clerk <hi>Dullman</hi> shall come unto you from me, he shall give you this private token. He shall take you thus by the Nose.</p>

                  <p>I Have shewed the Ring which <hi>Antonio</hi> gave me for a pawn to the Gold-Smith who saith it is but a Brasse Ring poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Guilded over, and the stone in it no better then coloured glass. How handsomly that cunning Knave his servant gull'd me? when I said <hi>Verily how it sparkles</hi>? he presently could speak my words after me, Verily how it sparkles? For a little gain, I then said <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi> but now I swear <hi>plainly</hi> we deceive and are deceived our selves; I am affraid I shall loose my Cloaths and all.</p>

                  <p>Come hither my <hi>Antonio</hi>; you know that Alderman the first wife of my <hi>Dorothea</hi> had two Daughters by her, <hi>Katharine</hi> who is now the wife of <hi>Anthonine</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> whom many years ago we betrothed unto you when you were little ones. For even then when you could hardly speak plain she would call you Hus-and band, you called her Wife. When I was married to <hi>Dorothea</hi> we gave to both of you Medails in which your pictures were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven; And this is that which I then gave to <hi>Isabella.</hi> See— here is the Effigies of a Boy and a Girle, this representeth you, and that <hi>Isabella.</hi> Behold your hands joyned as in wedlock, and your two faces touching one another. See the two birds, that are the symbols of marriage, and the Inscription of these two Letters, A, and <hi>I,</hi> that is <hi>Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Isabella.</hi>

                     <hi>Cupes</hi> I have conveyed this away to drink with thee, we do deserve it, and have carried all things on with delight and mirthe. <hi>Theodorus</hi> hath returned to <hi>Ignoramus</hi> his six hundred Crowns, and hath nobly satisfied <hi>Torcol.</hi> Within there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Feasting, Singing, Laughing, Dancing, Sporting, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceing, and Kisses upon Kisses.</p>

                  <p>Do you misdoubt the Event?

therefore who would avoid so great misfortunes, and do desire that all things may fall out successefully unto you; pray for the health of our most happy, pious, and most Illustrious Lord the King, with the same chearful affection and devotion as our selves, and celebrate it (as it becomes you all) with your loudest <hi>plaudits.</hi>
