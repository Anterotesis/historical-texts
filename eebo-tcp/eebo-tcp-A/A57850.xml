            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The bargain was struck but on this <hi>condition</hi> to pay him the mony within the space of a month.

                  <p>The painter therefore, by <hi>Tricoes</hi> Council, hath painted this Mole on my Cheek, that the better I may pretend my self to be my brother <hi>Anthonine,</hi> and to be newly come from <hi>London</hi> from my mother <hi>Dorothy.</hi>

                  <p>Very well; For at <hi>Fess</hi> I learned it of an English woman that was my servant, and that I might be the more perfect in it both for my love to you, and to the Nation, have been much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to speak it with a familiar friend of mine an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

                  <p>I Have shewed the Ring which <hi>Antonio</hi> gave me for a pawn to the Gold-Smith who saith it is but a Brasse Ring poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Guilded over, and the stone in it no better then coloured glass. How handsomly that cunning Knave his servant gull'd me? when I said <hi>Verily how it sparkles</hi>? he presently could speak my words after me, Verily how it sparkles? For a little gain, I then said <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi> but now I swear <hi>plainly</hi> we deceive and are deceived our selves; I am affraid I shall loose my Cloaths and all.</p>

                  <p>I am so; and I should be mad, if <hi>I</hi> were not mad: VVould you not have me to be mad? would you have me now to be mad? <hi>Rosabella</hi> the delight of my Eys, my Joy and my Safety is killed. <hi>Rosabella</hi> who while she lived excelled all women; Certainly, you turned away your Eyes from her when you did it; for had you beheld her beauty and sweet innocence, <hi>I</hi> know you had never done it. This only favour <hi>I</hi> desire of you that since you would not give us leave being alive to enjoy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you would now suffer us being dead to sleep together, and to be buryed in one grave.</p>

For even then when you could hardly speak plain she would call you Hus-and band, you called her Wife. When I was married to <hi>Dorothea</hi> we gave to both of you Medails in which your pictures were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven; And this is that which I then gave to <hi>Isabella.</hi> Seeâ€” here is the Effigies of a Boy and a Girle, this representeth you, and that <hi>Isabella.</hi> Behold your hands joyned as in wedlock, and your two faces touching one another. See the two birds, that are the symbols of marriage, and the Inscription of these two Letters, A, and <hi>I,</hi> that is <hi>Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Isabella.</hi>

                     <hi>Cupes</hi> I have conveyed this away to drink with thee, we do deserve it, and have carried all things on with delight and mirthe. <hi>Theodorus</hi> hath returned to <hi>Ignoramus</hi> his six hundred Crowns, and hath nobly satisfied <hi>Torcol.</hi> Within there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Feasting, Singing, Laughing, Dancing, Sporting, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceing, and Kisses upon Kisses.</p>

                  <p>But in earnest <hi>Trico</hi> I have cause to triumph; for it was brought all about by my Art and Industry.</p>

                  <speaker>Tric.</speaker>
                  <p>By yours, nay by mine <hi>Cupes,</hi> It was I that brought <hi>Antonio</hi> from Shipboard.</p>

                  <speaker>Cup.</speaker>
                  <p>But it was I who frighted <hi>Ignoramus</hi> away with the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelders horn.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Cupes,</hi> it was I that propounded the case in law unto him, and did delay him with it, and after that I brought <hi>Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> unto you.</p>

                     <hi>Invenit Trico, Sculpsit Cupes, Trico</hi> invented it, but it was <hi>Cupes</hi> that did ingrave it.</p>

                  <p>Wellâ€”let it go so then, but it is the Event, <hi>Cupes,</hi> that stampeth all things.</p>

                  <p>Do you misdoubt the Event? There is no cause why you should dispair of it, for the Clemency and the Candour of my Lord the King here present (in whose power alone the Event con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth) doth promise a happy and a successeful Issue, and let us drink a health to the confirmation of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Tric.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, rather let us begin a health and make it sacred to the great Master, and the Lord of the Event it self; for in his health alone, are all our healths comprehendedâ€”</p>

                  <p>I take the Omen, Spectators I oblige you that this night, and to morrow, at the least, you will both consent unto, and be <hi>supernaculously</hi> punctuall on the solemn observation of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Tric.</speaker>
                  <p>And as for those who willfully will not take it, let them have Wives more raanting, and clamorous then <hi>Polla.</hi>

therefore who would avoid so great misfortunes, and do desire that all things may fall out successefully unto you; pray for the health of our most happy, pious, and most Illustrious Lord the King, with the same chearful affection and devotion as our selves, and celebrate it (as it becomes you all) with your loudest <hi>plaudits.</hi>
