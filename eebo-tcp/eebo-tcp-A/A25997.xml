            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

About Ten, I with my Division engaged the Enemy, which happened to be <hi>Tourvill's</hi> Squadron; we fighting in a Line, still keeping three points from the Wind, often backing our Main Top-Sail to keep the Line, and make it good. About Twelve, the <hi>Lion</hi> and <hi>Expedition</hi> were disabled; and about Four a Clock our Fore Top-Mast was shot by the Board, at which time it fell Calm: And Vice-Admiral <hi>Vandeputt</hi> having lost his Main Top-Mast, (which led our head Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,) put all his Division out of the Line, so that I fell heavy on them, by reason we had not Wind to work our Boats; at which time I saw Nine Sail of the Enemy, that had weathered the Van of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them on both sides. The Vice-Admiral <hi>Putten's</hi> Squadron being disabled, the Admiral Orders them to Anchor, which being done, the Admiral of the Blew drove to Lee-ward of them, and Anchored between them and the Enemy.

               <head>An Account of the late Battle at <hi>Sea,</hi> between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>French-Fleet, June</hi> the 30th, 1690.</head>
               <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> the 29th of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the Evening, our Fleet being at Anchor, <hi>S. E.</hi> about 3 Leagues off <hi>Beachy,</hi> with the Wind at <hi>N. N. E.</hi> and <hi>N. E.</hi> by <hi>N.</hi> The Admiral call'd a Council of Flag Officers, and imparted, to us the Queen's Order for engaging the Enemy, who then lay <hi>S. S. W.</hi> about six Leagues off us. At Ten at Night our Fleet weigh'd, and the Wind inclining to be <hi>Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> we lay by with our Heads unto the Shoar all Night.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 30th. At break of Day, the Wind at <hi>N. N. E.</hi> and <hi>E. Beachy</hi> bearing <hi>N. E.</hi> and by <hi>E.</hi> Three or Four Leagues off, my Lord <hi>Torrington</hi> put out the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for drawing into a Line of Battle; fill'd, and in that Order bore down upon the Enemies Fleet, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sail, standing with their heads by a Wind. At Eight my Lord put out the Signal for a Battle, our Fleet being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66406:4"/>
within three Miles of the Enemy, who immediately braced their Head Sails to the Masts, and lay for us. At Nine the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, leading the Van of our Fleet, began to engage the Enemies Van at a considerable distance; and about half an hour after, the Blew Squadron began with their Rear; but they having formed their Line in a kind of Half Moon, the Red Squadron did not begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their Body till near Ten a Clock. We fought in a reasonable good Line, backing and filling with Top-Sails, as the Enemy did; which I believe they chose, to give their Ships opportunity to stretch out a Head of our Van. We sail'd all day Two Points, and sometimes Four from the Wind; and as we bore down upon the Enemy, they lasked away from us; and at the latter part of the Day, when it fell little Wind, they tow'd round away with their Boats a Head, till we were out of shot, insomuch that I thought we had the better of the Battle; till I saw the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron so much disabled. I can give no account of their Misfortune, by reason of the distance between us, more than that when we left off. I saw them very hotly engag'd, with the Enemy on both sides of them; in which it was impossible to give them any relief, it being then stark Calm, and continued so most part of the Night after.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Torrington</hi> ordered the <hi>Dutch</hi> disabled Ships to come to an Anchor. At Nine at Night we weigh'd, and drove up the Tide of Flood all Night.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 1st of <hi>Iuly.</hi> In the Afternoon my Lord <hi>Torrington</hi> call'd a Council of Flag Officers, where it was resolv'd to retreat to the East-wards, and in case the Enemy pressed us, to destroy the disabled Ships, rather than to hazard another Engagement to protect

               <p>About four in the morning, the Signal was given to draw into a Line of Battle, and in that Order they bore down towards the Enemy. About Eight, on the <hi>30th,</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Admiral put out the Signal for Battle, being then about a Leagues distance from the Enemy, who lay by in Order of Battle to receive him.</p>
               <p>The Wind blew fresh in the morning, the Admiral bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down with his whole Line, he brought to between Eight and Nine, being at the distance of twice Cannon Shot from the Enemy; and about that time he bore away to the <hi>Southward,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi>'s Division doing the like; but soon after Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi> bore again to the <hi>Northward,</hi> to join the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, who lay for him; and to make more haste, he set his Top-sails, his whole Division do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same. The Admiral and his Division stood after with two Top-sails only, whereby there happen'd a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Interval between those two Divisions of the Red.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66406:5"/>
About Nine, The <hi>Dutch</hi> leading the Van, began the Fight at first at a Distance, and presently after the Blew Engag'd; Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby,</hi> with his Divisions kept his Line, and bore in equally with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> not stretching to the Head of the <hi>French</hi> Line at first, gave opportunity to about Nine of the <hi>French</hi> Ships to weather them; Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi> being in Shot of <hi>Tourville,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admiral fired two Guns, the usual sign of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, which he took no Notice of, lying with his Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes aback in order (as was supposed) to fight the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Admiral; Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi> then fired a Broad-side upon him, and continued Fighting for an hour and a half, till he was disabled, by his Fore-top-mast-head being shot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>It was Observed, that the <hi>French,</hi> being press'd by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and Vice-Admiral's Division, gave way, and clapt on more Sail to help them off.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Ralph Delavall,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Blew, being, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Nine, in the Line with the Admiral, finding he brought to at the Distance of twice Gun Shot, he with his Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on edg'd nearer to the Enemy, till he came within Musquet Shot, and then began to Fire; and so continued, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my still edging from him, and he pressing forward, till he came at last almost into their Line; those he engag'd with setting up their Top-gallant Sails, Sprit Sails, and Main Sails for their getting away; and when there was but little Wind, they tow'd from them with their Boats a head. During this Action, there was a great space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Van of the Blew, and the Rear of the Red.</p>
               <p>The Divisions of the Admiral, and the Rear-Admiral of the Red, which were nearer to the middle of the Line, began at Ten to fire, when they were within Cannon Shot
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66406:6"/>
of the Enemy; the Rear-Admiral being somewhat to the <hi>Leeward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Eleven, the Admiral being acquainted some <hi>French</hi> Ships had weathered the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he ordered the Ships should Luff to the <hi>Eastward;</hi> after which there happen'd a Calm, and then he was tow'd down between the Enemy and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were then at Anchor.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it seems to be a general Opinion: That if the Admiral, and the Rear-Admiral of the Red, had bore down, and pressed the Enemy, equally with the rest of the Fleet, the <hi>French</hi> probably would not have had the Success as to be able to keep the Sea; and many of the Officers of these two Divisions wished they might have been nearer to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>As to what relates to that Part of the Commission which concerns the Embezlement of Stores; We finding that the Remains have been taken by the Officers of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> who say, that little more than one third of the Powder has been spent in this Action, we have made no farther enquiry into that matter.</p>

               <head>The Examinations of the Captains.</head>
               <p>CAptain <hi>Carter.</hi> About Four in the Morning, they had sight of the <hi>French Fleet,</hi> about three Leagues off to the <hi>Leeward,</hi> the Signal being given for the Line of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; they stood before the Wind with their Top-sails on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bearing towards the <hi>French.</hi> At Eight, being about Four Miles from the Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> laid his Ships head to the <hi>Southward,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi> did the like; but a little after, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> wore his Ship to the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> as did his Division, in Order to join them the sooner.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> set his Fore-sail, but the Admiral and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision stood after them with two Top-sails only.</p>
               <p>About Nine, he was himself to <hi>Leeward,</hi> of four or five of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships nearer to the Enemy; the <hi>Debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Sandwich,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> following him.</p>
               <p>At that Monsieur <hi>Tourville</hi> lay with his Fore-top-sail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back (as he thought) staying for my Lord <hi>Torrington:</hi> but Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi> being then in reach of him, fired two Guns, which I suppose was a Chalenge; but the other taking no Notice, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> gave him a Broad-side, and engaged him for an hour and half, and in that time lost his Fore-top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast Head.</p>
               <p>The Admiral's Division was at a distance from them, they making no more Sail than with their two Top sails; till between one and two a Clock, he set his Fore-sail, and there being but little Wind, with his Boats a Head, he towed off from the Enemy; and he judges he was a Miles distance from them and rather more from the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> maketh a Breach to the <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> between Eight and Nine, which course he stood half
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66406:7"/>
an hour, occasioning the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, or the greatest part of them, to lay their main Top-sails to the Masts, to stay for them; and he judged that might be the Reason why they could not reach the Van of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet before they Engag'd, and gave the <hi>French</hi> an opportunity to get the Wind of them.</p>
               <p>Being asked, what became of the <hi>French</hi> Ships that were opposite to that left space between those Divisions of the Red.</p>
               <p>He answered, that they fell down (as he supposed) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vice-Admiral and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> endeavouring to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the places of those Ships, that were disabled by Us, and drew out of the Line.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Ker.</hi> That Captain <hi>Carter</hi> led Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi>'s Division, and joined close to the Dutch.</p>
               <p>That he followed in his Station, Captain <hi>Mitchell</hi> being next him.</p>
               <p>When they were so near, that a Shot of the Enemies pass'd through his Ship, he began to Fire.</p>
               <p>The sternmost Ship of the <hi>Dutch</hi> the Captain kept Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, his Sails not hoisted, and they were in no good Order.</p>
               <p>He continued Firing about two Hours and a half, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Nine, and then having his Running Rigging Shot, he was forced to Luff out of his Station, to knot and splice his Rigging, which he had not above two Men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to doe.</p>
               <p>Upon his Luffing out, Captain <hi>Mitchell</hi> fill'd up the Line.</p>
               <p>About Ten, having mended his Rigging, he wore his Ship to get into his Station, but the Vice-Admiral being then disabled, sent his Boat with his Lieutenant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to tow him out, which he did.</p>
               <p>All this while the <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and as he thought to the <hi>Leeward</hi> of some of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66406:7"/>
About two, it was a dead Calm, then the disabled Ships did their best to tow off, and at Tide of Ebb they Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>He thought the <hi>French</hi> gave way, but could not tell whether it were not in Order to weather the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but he is sure they were close pressed.</p>
               <p>He could not judge what distance the Admiral's Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was from them, all their Division was Engag'd, and did well for ought we know.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Mitchell.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> did not sail in their Line as they should have done, they began to Fire at the Distance of Cannon Shot, but came afterwards within half a Gun Shot of the Enemy; the <hi>French</hi> edg'd from the Wind, but he cannot tell whether it were not to give their Ships an Opportunity to weather the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and as the <hi>French</hi> edg'd away, others supplied their places from the Line of Battle.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Carter.</hi> Captain <hi>Kerr,</hi> and himself were joined immediately to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> where the Vice-Admiral was disabled and came aboard him; he told him he had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men wounded, and not having his Complement at first, that he must desire him to send for one hundred or two hundred Men.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby.</hi> The Day they Fought it was a fresh Gale from Seven to Nine in the Morning, and was a sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gale from Nine till towards One, but began to be dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and before Two, there fell a Calm.</p>
               <p>The Signal for Battle was given about Eight in the Morning; both Fleets standing <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Beachy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron began to Engage about Nine, and when they bore down, they left about Nine of the <hi>French</hi> Ships a head of them, which by One he saw had got the Wind of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66406:8"/>
He follow'd Vice-Admiral <hi>Putten,</hi> who was in the Rear of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, and stood in a Line with them till they were Disabled; and about the same time, he lost his Fore-top mast, and his Fire-ship Disabled; thinking to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he went into Captain <hi>Mitchells</hi> Ship the <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but he telling him he would not do any thing unless he could furnish him with one hundred or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Seamen, he return'd to his own Ship; or otherwise, he had born down between the Enemy and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and might in part have prevented their Misfortune.</p>
               <p>About One he espied about Nine Ships of the <hi>French</hi> to the Windward of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron; whereupon he sprang his Luff, and soon after they fell back.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Disabled, they sell into a Confusion, sailing about three deep; so that they were in danger from one another, and they began to Fire at to great a distance.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Torrinton</hi> brought to the first time half an hour after Eight, at the distance of a Cannon and half Shot, and then edgd nearer; he brought to again about Nine, at the distance of a bare Cannon Shot, or about a Mile.</p>
               <p>That he was not himself Engaged till towards Ten in the Morning, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet firing at him near three quarters of an hour, and many Shot flying over him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fired.</p>
               <p>During the Fight he did observe the <hi>French</hi> to edge away.</p>
               <p>The Smoak was so great, that he could not observe what was doing in the Admiral's Division.</p>
               <p>He could not complain that any of the Officers were failing in their Duty.</p>
               <p>Having Monsieur <hi>Tourvill</hi>'s Ship opposite to him, he fired two Guns, to try if he would be a reasonable Enemy; but finding he took no Notice, he bore up to him, and battled him till his Ship was Disabled.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66406:8"/>
Captain <hi>Clements.</hi> He could see little out of his own Squadron, but judged the Headmost Ship of the Admiral's was at a Mile and a halfs distance from the Sternmost of theirs.</p>
               <p>Their Division and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were within half Cannon Shot of the Enemy, but did not come within Musquet Shot of them.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> soon after them came within Cannon Shot.</p>
               <p>He thought the distance between the Divisions was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd by the Admiral's bearing to the <hi>Southward,</hi> and was also the Reason we were forwarder toward the Van.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships fought with their Fore-top-sails to the Mast, which he thought was occasion'd by the stay they made, to let the Vice-Admiral <hi>Cullemburgh,</hi> who had a heavy Ship, to stretch forward, and their fighting thus drove them so far to the <hi>Leeward,</hi> and expos'd them tothat loss.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Fairborne.</hi> We began to Engage about Eight and Nine, and within half an hour after we were within half Cannon Shot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he had some Musquet Shot lodg'd in his Hamocks. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were in disorder.</p>
               <p>Between Twelve and One, the Admiral was towing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, between them and the <hi>Dutch;</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi> was Disabled between Twelve and One, he was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd with <hi>Tourville,</hi> and Shot down his Flag-staff.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Gother.</hi> When We first began firing, we were well within Gun-shot, and continued Firing two hours, bearing down at last within large Musquet Shot; they lay so till between two and three, when it was a dead Calm, and they like a Wreck.</p>
               <p>When they had Fired two or three Broad-sides, he saw the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Flag within a quarter of a Mile's distance between Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:66406:9"/>
Captain <hi>Torpley.</hi> The Admiral's Division was half a Miles distance from us.</p>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Beverley.</hi> He was in the Rear of the Admiral's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and could not see how the <hi>Dutch</hi> were pressed.</p>
               <p>The Admiral and Vice-Admirals Divisions were within a quarter of a Mile one of another, when he observed them.</p>
               <p>The reason why he was out of his Line was, that his ships staff was carried away.</p>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Pomroy,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler.</hi> We bore down to the Enemy in very good Order, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> ingag'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine; half an hour after we engag'd with Mounsieur <hi>Amphrevil</hi>'s Squadron.</p>
               <p>The first thing he observed was, that the <hi>Expedition</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi>'s Ship were disabled.</p>
               <p>He supposes the Admiral's stretching to the <hi>South-ward</hi> was to prevent their being rack'd by the Enemy fore and aft.</p>
               <p>D. of <hi>Grafton.</hi> That he could not tax any one to be of Fault.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Dutch</hi> and Blew Squadron began to Engage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admirals brought to, the <hi>Dutch</hi> firing first; and if they had not begun so soon, the Red had been nearer.</p>
               <p>The Blew began before them, and continued it longer; but he could not say they were much nearer to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>About Ten and Eleven Orders were sent to Sir <hi>Francis Wheeler</hi> to make Sail, and to him to follow, which he supposes was to fill up the space between Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi>'s Division and them; and their Ships began to be foul one of another, and before the distance was fill'd, the Wind fell and it was calm, but they afterwards closed; for when the Ebb came, the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> drove below the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and he did not come to an Anchor till they were to the Windward of him.</p>
               <p>About Twelve or One he saw about Twelve Ships of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66406:9"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> bear up round, which made him lie out of shot.</p>
               <p>At one time the <hi>French</hi> look'd as if they were going, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pressed by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Vice-Admiral of the Red Division.</p>
               <p>The Admiral brought to within Gun-shot, and if the Wind had stood, we should have had more fighting.</p>
               <p>When he left off, the Shot flew over him.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Nevill.</hi> As soon as the Express came with Orders to Fight; on <hi>Sunday</hi> about Four in the Afternoon, a Signal was given for a Council of Flag Officers, to whom they were imparted, some of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Flag Officers said it were to be wish'd they had been stronger; but the Queen's Order must be obeyed; and so went to their Ships to prepare.</p>
               <p>About Two on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, we heard the <hi>French</hi> give the Signal for going to Anchor, which was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Five Guns from each Flag.</p>
               <p>About Three in the Morning we saw the <hi>French</hi> Fleet at Anchor, between three and four Leagues off to the Leeward; whereupon the Admiral order'd him to bear away.</p>
               <p>About Four the Signal was given to our Fleet to draw into a Line of Battle; the <hi>French</hi> likewise weighing, and putting themselves into their Line.</p>
               <p>About Eight we came nearer to the Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> then observing the <hi>French</hi> Admiral had Thirty Four Ships a Head of him, and Forty eight a Stern, and that himself had a head of him Thirty Four Ships, and Twenty Two a Stern; and that if he had taken <hi>Tourville</hi> to engage, his Rear must be over powered; he edg'd away to the Southward, to bring himself to the Center of the Fleet, that every one might have his Share.</p>
               <p>The Admiral going to bear down towards the Enemy, said he would not go sternling, for then they should be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66406:10"/>
rack'd for and aft; but he would being to, and go away looking upon them, imagining they would keep their Wind, which they did not, for they fought Three or Four Points from the Wind, having by that means opportunity to weather the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> had but a weak Squadron, and did not keep up as they might.</p>
               <p>About Nine, Admiral Van <hi>Putten</hi> began to fire at a great distance, and after that we could see no more of them.</p>
               <p>Vice-Admiral <hi>Ashby</hi> began presently after the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Blew soon after that; we did not begin the Fight till about Ten, and the reason we did it no sooner was because the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> order'd there should be no firing till we came near the Enemy.</p>
               <p>About Eleven he saw some <hi>French</hi> Ships had weather'd the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and asked the Admiral whether he would suffer them to weather him also; he answered not if he could help it, and order'd the Fore-tack aboard, and that they should luff to the Eastward, and so we got to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Grafton,</hi> and hardly got clear of the <hi>Albemarle,</hi> at which time the Calm fell, and we got our Boat a Head.</p>
               <p>We saw Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby's</hi> Ship coming out dislabled, and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were shatter'd.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> order'd his Boats to tow him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the Enemy, where he came to Anchor.</p>
               <p>He believes at one time in the Fight, their Squadron was as near the Enemy as any other; about 12 a Clock the Enemy then edg'd off upon a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire-ship bearing towards them, but was accidentally set on Fire.</p>
               <p>He never saw greater Firing than the <hi>French</hi> made that day.</p>
               <p>He is of Opinion that we ought to bless God for that Calm, otherwise the whole Fleet had been in great danger.</p>

               <p>We did not Luff till the <hi>French</hi> raked in fore and aft. The <hi>French</hi> gave way upon a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Captain</hi> Hastings.</p>
               <p>Little account can be given in Fire and Smoak; their Squadron, which was the Admirals, was engaged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nine and Ten. The Calm fell about Twelve, but we continued fighting until Two.</p>
               <p>We hald away Southerly before the Engagement.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Captain</hi> Hobson.</p>
               <p>We of the Rear-Admirals Squadron were rather to the Leeward of the Admiral, being good Gun-shot off the Enemy; and if the Wind had lasted, we had been nearer, which he is sorry they were not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> lay in a half Moon; if we had got in with them, in probability, we had done and received more dammage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captain</hi> Cornwall.</p>
               <p>When they began Fighting, they were long Gun-shot off, about a Mile; however he had then a Shot in his Mast, and his Ship shot through and through.</p>
               <p>He thinks they were at no time nearer than half Gun-shot.</p>
               <p>He cann't tell why the Admiral did not bear nearer, for there was Wind enough for two Hours: he had heard the reason given, was to avoid being racked fore and aft, but he believes if he had done it, it would have been for the better.</p>
               <p>He believes the <hi>Blue</hi> fought nearer than they did in the Rear Admirals Division.</p>
               <p>He never saw the Sea-men so chearful as they were in the Fight.</p>
               <p>He is of Opinion, if the <hi>French</hi> had persued their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and all weighed the next Tide, as we did, and as some of them did, they might have endanger'd our whole Fleet, for he thought them twice as strong as we were, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Dutch</hi> had suffer'd so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captain</hi> Layton.</p>
               <p>We began the Fight about Nine: Some Guns were fired out of distance, but the Rear Admiral did not fire, until he came within shot, and some Shot from the Enemy pass'd as far over their Ships as it was to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:66406:11"/>
We had Wind enough to have gone on Board the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but he cannot dive into the reason why it was not done.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> kept in a row, by which means those in the Center were not so near them. He never in his life-time saw more Courage than was shewed by the Sea-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rear-Admiral</hi> Rook.</p>
               <p>That the Admiral, steering towards the Rear, left a space betwixt his and Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby</hi>'s Division, who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon obliged to bear towards him: that he thought his Intention had been to go and Engage the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, but he did not do it; therefore perhaps it was, that he thought the <hi>French</hi> strongest in the Rear.</p>
               <p>The Admiral brought to about Ten: at about a Miles distance, he was something nearer with his Division, but durst not break his Line, and therefore he brought to more to the Leeward, and Engaged, having the Admiral on his Weather Bow.</p>
               <p>He bare down two or three times, till he had the Rear of the <hi>French</hi> in his Wake a stern; he did not see when the Admiral Luffed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captain</hi> Binge.</p>
               <p>When they were first brought to, they were not within shot, then the <hi>Blue</hi> edged nearer, and the nearest they came, he thought, was about half Cannon shot.</p>
               <p>He don't know why the Admiral brought to no nearer, but he thinks lasking down had been the better way.</p>
               <p>He thought the Fleet had been pretty near a strait Line, yet the rest was distant from the Wings, because the <hi>French</hi> lay in a Bow.</p>
               <p>He did not observe to give way to the <hi>Blue,</hi> but they once seemed to be in a huddle, so they made use of our Boats to tow them into order again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66406:12"/>
He saw a great Ship, whose Poop blew up, sail out of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, but he thought she returned again at Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captain</hi> Botham, <hi>Captain</hi> Tyrrell, <hi>Captain</hi> Hubbard.</p>
               <p>Within two Miles of the Enemy, we brought to, then we edged nearer, and brought to again within a Mile, and we were so near, that the Enemies Shot went through and through.</p>
               <p>We saw the <hi>French</hi> edged away several times from our great Ships, and they had their Top-gallant Sails and Sprit Sails to make more way.</p>
               <p>He was second to the <hi>Anne,</hi> and the Rear of the <hi>Red</hi> were two Miles a head off their Points upon their Weather-Bow: And the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, being drawn into a Bow, made the <hi>Red</hi> at a greater distance from them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Red</hi> had left Shooting an Hour and half before they did.</p>
               <p>He don't know that any small Shot touched his Ship.</p>
               <p>The latter end of the Engagement was the hottest with them in the <hi>Blue,</hi> they not being able to work their Ships.</p>
               <p>His Opinion is, that the <hi>French</hi> were more in number, yet if every one had sought as they should, they might have worsted them, for it was the Enemy at last was very free to leave: then towing off with their Boats, his Ship had six Foot Water in the Hold, and with great difficulty he tow'd her off and stopt her Leaks.</p>
               <p>Acquainting the Admiral next Morning with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Ship, he order'd him twenty good Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of the <hi>Warwick,</hi> which was a good means to preserve him, he getting off, keeping still to Windward of the Fleet.</p>

Captain <hi>Iennifer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Fight began he could make little Observation; The <hi>Dutch</hi> engag'd a quarter of an hour before the <hi>Blew:</hi> It appeared to him, that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet lay in a Bow: Within a quarter of an hour after they were engag'd within Musquet-shot, he had his Rigging cut, and his Tackle and Sheets shot away: Two hours after the Fight began, he saw a Gap between their Division and the <hi>Red.</hi> They were to <hi>Leeward</hi> of the <hi>Red,</hi> but not very much. He saw no great Advantage was had of the <hi>French</hi> in the Fight. Some of his Men say, they saw a <hi>French</hi> Ship sink, but he saw no such thing himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captain</hi> Mees.</p>
               <p>Between Nine and Ten, we began to engage: before Noon we were within Musquet-shot of the Enemy, but I had not Men aboard to ply small shot, and I received none from the Enemy. Capt. <hi>Tyrrel</hi> being disabled, he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval</hi> sent to him about Two a Clock to make Sail to joyn the <hi>Red,</hi> who he thought to be at Two Miles distance from them, and as far (as he judged) from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: So they left off firing.</p>
               <p>He thought that Distance was made by Captain <hi>Tyrrel</hi>'s laying back; and they sailing to fill that place, received Damage from the Enemies Ships that were opposite to it.</p>
               <p>He saw some <hi>French</hi> Ships edge away.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Tenant,</hi> Captain <hi>Dorrel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He thinks that every Ship might have fought, and in case they had fought, and all the Fleet had gone in, we had sent the Enemy home; for those that engag'd their Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66406:13"/>
made Sail from them, not only with the Sails they fought with, but loosed their Top-gallant Sails, Sprit-Sails, and Main-Sails; and when there was little Wind, they tow'd from them with their Boats a-head.</p>
               <p>The latter part of the Fight he was within Pistol-shot of the Enemy, a quarter of a Mile at least, and the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> was within Cables length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern.</p>
               <p>I judg'd, the <hi>Red</hi> Squadron, when they brought to, were out of Cannon-shot; but during the Fight, he could not tell what they did.</p>
               <p>Vice Admiral <hi>Delaval.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Wind was fresh all the morning, but began to be duller towards noon.</p>
               <p>The Signal for Battle was given at Eight in the morning, and about half an hour after, the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> brought to at the Distance of Two Gun-shot from the Enemy; whereupon, with his Division of the <hi>Blew,</hi> he bore down, and did not begin to fire till he was within Musquet-shot of the Enemy, and that he had enough of their Ships before him to deal with.</p>
               <p>He was engaged with <hi>De Estree</hi>'s Squadron, which edg'd off, as he pressed them: Insomuch, that he and his Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were advanc'd almost to range with the rest of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and in his, and the Opinion of others, the <hi>French</hi> bore right away, as if they were running, and ever from the first beginning of his engaging, he found the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my made a jogging Sail.</p>
               <p>He observed the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> brought to again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 9: So that part of the <hi>Red</hi> lying by, and the <hi>Blew</hi> bearing forward, he saw the Fleet formed, as it were, into an Elbow, between Two and Three a Clock, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between him and the <hi>Red</hi> was so great, as that he thought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66406:13"/>
Thirteen or Fourteen of the Enemies Ships had nothing to fire at; and if all the Divisions had bore down equally, which they might have done, he won't say, they should have beaten the <hi>French,</hi> (they out-numbring them, and plyed theirs very well) but he believes the <hi>French</hi> would have had enough, and been glad to have gone home; for the <hi>Red</hi> Squadron being the strongest in the Fleet, if that had press'd, the matter could not have gone better.</p>
               <p>He can't but say, the <hi>Dutch</hi> did not bear down to the Enemy in that Order they might have done, and that he thought the Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> laying the Head of his Ship several ways, might puzzle Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He can't charge any of his Squadron of being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>He did indeed lend his Boat to some of them, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Captain <hi>Iennifer,</hi> in the <hi>Edgar,</hi> whose Answer was, That his Braces and Rigging were shot, and that he did what he could to come up; which he believes was so, for he set his small Sails, and came in, and had his share.</p>
               <p>He sent likewise, and writ to Captain <hi>Dorrel,</hi> but it was rather by way of Advice, That he should set Sail, since the Enemy had stretched away; so that some of the Ships at Stern were not then in a possibility of engaging; upon which he did what was possible.</p>
               <p>And he believes the Gentlemen of the <hi>Red</hi> Squadron, who had the misfortune not to be near enough, would have every one done their parts, if they had had Opportunity to be nearer engag'd.</p>
               <p>He bore right down, to be nearer the Enemy, receiving their Shot fore and aft; and he did not bring to till he was within Musquet-shot; for he that will fight, must hazard.</p>

Captain <hi>Aylmer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We began firing half an hour after the <hi>Dutch:</hi> When we first fired, we were within half Cannon-shot, and come somewhat nearer afterwards, but not much; for as we edg'd towards the Enemy, they edg'd from us.</p>
               <p>We were in so much Smoke, that for an hour we could not see the <hi>Red</hi> Squadron.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>'s Squadron took the most Southermost Ship of the Enemy, and so in order.</p>
               <p>Though he bore too much to keep the Line of Battle, he can't say the <hi>French</hi> were running away, but he is sure some of their Boats were towing them a head.</p>
               <p>If there were any fault committed in the Action, it must be the Officers; for the Seamen did their parts.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Foulks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> began to fire an hour before us, but at such a distance, that their Shot fell short; so they gave off for a while, and then began. He imagin'd they did it, because they were not near enough the first time.</p>
               <p>About Eleven or Twelve a Clock, their Line, which was the <hi>Blue,</hi> was within Musquet-shot of the Enemy, and the Vice-Admiral sent him Word, that the Battle being so fair, he would bear in still. He saw the <hi>French</hi> bear away, with their Boats a head. Some of the <hi>French</hi> Ships set their Top-Sails and Sprit-Sails.</p>
               <p>He mist a great Ship of the Enemies, his Shot ceasing, which he supposes to be a <hi>French</hi> Commander. His Men call'd from the Top-Mast, and said he was sinking; and more saw it, but he did not.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Captain</hi> Martin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> began to fire about Nine: Next Sir <hi>Iohn Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s Division fired, and the <hi>Blew</hi> Four or Five Minutes after them. Some Ship to his Rear fired a Broad side, but the rest of the Squadron kept still towards the Enemy, lasking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they came within Musquet-shot.</p>
               <p>I observed Four of the <hi>French</hi> Ships bore away together, which were opposite to the Vice-Admiral, and one of their Ships in the Rear had the Poop blown up; and before the Battle was done, several of the <hi>French</hi> loosed all their small Sails: and some were on the Run, as he thought. He fought from a quarter after Nine till Three, and then he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled.</p>
               <p>He observed, as any of the <hi>French</hi> Ships gave way, their places were supply'd from their Rear, and their Line fill'd up.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Red</hi> were so far to Windward, that he could see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through the Two Lines, and the <hi>French</hi> appear'd to him to lie in a Bow.</p>
               <p>If the Squadrons had fought equally, he believes the <hi>French</hi> would have receiv'd more Damage, and we might have had better success.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captain</hi> Walthers.</p>
               <p>He being in a small Ship, was oblig'd half a Cables length to the Leeward, to make his Guns reach their Squadrons, beginning to fight between Nine and Ten, being very well within Gun-shot. The Fight lasted for Three hours; but the headmost Ships of the Squadron were longer engag'd.</p>
               <p>In his Judgment, the <hi>French</hi> gave way, some of their Ships being towed about, between Twelve and One a Clock.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Red</hi> were so much to the Weather of them, that he could see through to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Their Squadron was smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engag'd for Three hours, and by what he could perceive, they did not receive so much Damage, when near, as at a distance, though the Shot then flew over too.</p>
               <p>Our Men fired faster then the <hi>French,</hi> after a little time; but before the Conclusion they fell to quick firing again.</p>
               <p>He saw one <hi>French</hi> Ship disabled, his Main-Top-Mast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shot through, whilst he was attempting to set a Fire-Ship on her. He discover'd, by a Glare through the Smoke, about Eight <hi>French</hi> Ships standing almost in a Line with him, near as far to Windward as himself.</p>
               <p>He believes, if they had been all of one Mind, the <hi>French</hi> would have had enough of it, and not have followed us.</p>
               <p>The Vice-Admiral's Ship made a continual Fire.</p>

                  <hi>Captain</hi> Jones.</p>
               <p>After the first firing we came within Musquet-shot of the Enemy; and the nearer we came, we receiv'd the less da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage both in Hull and Rigging, their Shot flying high.</p>
               <p>He took up a Young Man that was blown up with the Poop of the <hi>Terrible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He believes, if all had bore down, and come within Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol-shot of the Enemy, they would have been glad to go home.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66406:16"/>
from us about Three Leagues, the Wind Easterly and a fresh Gale all Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thursday,</hi> 26. At six in the Morning we weigh'd and stood to the Northwards, the Wind at <hi>E. N. E.</hi> a fresh Gale. At eleven we came to Anchor in twenty eight Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom Water, <hi>Dunesse</hi> bearing <hi>W. ½ S.</hi> from us seven Leagues, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet stretching to the Southwards. At four in the Afternoon we weigh'd, and stood away to the Eastwards, the Wind at <hi>N. W.</hi> small Winds, the <hi>French</hi> bearing <hi>S. S. W.</hi> from us about four Leagues, ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after us. At eleven at Night we came to Anchor in thirty four Fathom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday,</hi> 27. At Eight this Morning our Fleet was all under sail, the Wind at <hi>E.</hi> we standing in <hi>N. N. E.</hi> At Twelve we came to Anchor in twenty one Fathom, <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> bearing <hi>N. E. ½ E.</hi> three or four Leagues distant, the Wind all one, but very thick. At Eight at Night we weigh'd, and at Twelve we came to Anchor in twenty eight Fathom, still plying to the Eastwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday,</hi> 28. At Seven in the Morning our Fleet was all under sail, and at Twelve we came to Anchor in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight Fathom, <hi>Beachy</hi> bearing <hi>N. N. W.</hi> from us four Leagues, the Wind between the <hi>N. N. E.</hi> and the <hi>N. E.</hi> This Morning came in one of our Frigats with her Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallant Sheets flying and firing, so that each Admiral put on his Jack-Flag at Mizen Peak for their Divisions to fall in their places. At Seven at Night we weigh'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday,</hi> 29. At Two a Clock in the Morning we came to Anchor in twenty nine Fathom, <hi>Beachy</hi> bearing <hi>W.</hi> by <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>Fairlee N. N.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66406:17"/>
Afternoon came a Sloop from <hi>Rye,</hi> as we suppose, with a Packet. At Nine at Night we weigh'd, and stood to the Eastward all Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday,</hi> 30. At Three a Clock this Morning our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hove out his Jack-Flag at Mizen Peake, as did the rest of the Admirals: and after their Divisions were in their places, they bore away to the Westwards upon the <hi>French,</hi> the Wind at <hi>N. E.</hi> and <hi>N. E. by N.</hi> a very fresh Gale. About Four in the Morning we see the <hi>French</hi> Fleet standing for our Shore, with their Star-board Tacks on board. At Eight in the Morning the Bloody Flag was spread at our General's Fore top-mast-head. The <hi>Dutch</hi> leading the Van, and like Men of undaunted Courage, bore down upon the Van of the <hi>French,</hi> who shew'd no less, for they lay with their head Sails to the Masts (we having the Weather gage) ready to receive us. At Nine in the Morning the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Engaged, and plied them so hotly, that they made the <hi>French</hi> edge away, and some of the head-most Ships stretched a head and tacked upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> never once starting; but there lay and continued the Fight till the very last Guns that were fired, which was about Five in the Afternoon before they parted, although several of their Ships quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, at least Seven or Eight; some having lost all to their Fore-mast; some nothing but smooth Hulls; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what lost Top-masts: They were not above Twenty or Twenty one, as ever I could tell them, but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them is quite spoiled: And since the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment several of them burned, whether by the <hi>French</hi> that pursued us, or by themselves, I know not: never were Ships more batter'd and torn, nor ever did Men behave themselves better than they did.</p>
               <p>'Tis said they lost Seven Captains; and that one of their Ships Flag struck three times to the <hi>French;</hi> but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66406:17"/>
after they see no quarters was like to be had, they took Courage again and saved their Ship. Had the other Two Squadrons gone on with the Courage they did, the <hi>French</hi> would never have followed us up Channel. About Ten a Clock Sir <hi>Iohn Ashby,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Red,</hi> Engaged, and he and some of his Division had a share not much less than the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but fought at a far greater distance, so that our Ships were spoiled before ever they came near them. The <hi>Blue</hi> had some Broad-sides now and then, but not comparable to either of the other, till about Two in the Afternoon it proved little Wind; and withal Veered about to the <hi>S. S. E.</hi> so that the Rear of the <hi>French</hi> was equal with the <hi>Blue,</hi> as to the Wind; and, as I suppose, bore upon the <hi>Blue</hi> Squadron, and continued very hot till about Four in the Afternoon: when the <hi>French</hi> lay their Heads to the Westwards, and ours to the Eastwards, coming to Anchor all hands on the Tide of Ebb, <hi>Beachy</hi> bearing <hi>N.</hi> ½ <hi>W.</hi> distant by judgment Four Leagues. The <hi>French.</hi> coming to Anchor close by us. At Nine at Night we weigh'd and stood to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tuesday, Iuly</hi> 1. At Six in the Morning we came to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in twenty four Fathom, <hi>Beachy</hi> bearing <hi>W. N. W.</hi> three Leagues from us, the Wind at <hi>E. N. E.</hi> where we rid till Eleven a Clock, and then we weigh'd, and in standing off we see a great Smoak to the Westward of us, which we suppose to be a Ship set on fire by the <hi>French,</hi> who are now plying after us. At Five in the Afternoon we came to Anchor in Twenty two Fathom, <hi>Fairlee</hi> bearing <hi>N.</hi> ½ <hi>E. Beachy VV. by N.</hi> This Evening we see about Forty five Sail of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet about two Leagues to the Leeward of us. At eleven at Night we weigh'd; and at twelve a great Ship was on fire, and burnt a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> as we suppose her to be, but whether they or the <hi>French</hi> set her on fire we know not.</p>

                  <hi>VVednesday, Iuly</hi> 2. At two in the Morning she blew up. This Day we see the <hi>French</hi> Fleet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thursday, Iuly</hi> 3. The Wind at <hi>E. N. E.</hi> a fresh Gale. At twelve at Noon a great Ship on fire. At three in the Afternoon more on fire; but whether <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>English</hi> we know not, nor by whom fired, but there was Six or Seven Sail of <hi>French</hi> by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday, Iuly</hi> 4. At three in the Afternoon a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship burnt at <hi>S. W.</hi> end of <hi>Rye-Bay</hi> near <hi>Fairlee;</hi> the <hi>Rye</hi> Men told us the <hi>Dutoh</hi> burnt her themselves: but we see two <hi>French</hi> lie by her till she blew up, almost within reach of our Guns. The whole Fleet at Anchor in <hi>Rye-Bay</hi> and off the <hi>Ness.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, Iuly</hi> 5. This Morning we weigh'd out of <hi>Rye-Bay,</hi> and at Night the Fleet went without the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> and came to Anchor at the <hi>North-sands head.</hi> This Afternoon the <hi>Anne</hi> Frigat was set on fire, we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to keep her any longer after the <hi>French</hi> came up with her. She was ashore the Day before in <hi>Rye-Bay,</hi> and we have saved most of her Trade, except her Guns, which will be taken up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, Iuly</hi> 6. Some of the <hi>Anne's</hi> People was on board here, and told us the <hi>French</hi> landed some Men by <hi>Dungeness</hi> in <hi>Rye-Bay.</hi>
