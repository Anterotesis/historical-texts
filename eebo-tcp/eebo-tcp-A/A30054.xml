         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME
Seaſonable Conſiderations
For the good People of
CONNECTICUT</head>
            <p>I Remember there was Advice given us in the Year
1689. when we were about to make our Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(as 'tis called) and for ought I know it hàd been
good for us thàt we had taken it. But we are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be àdviſed, and ſo ill affected to any that tell
us the Truth, that there is little Encourâgement for
any to expoſe themſelves in that kind for the future.
The Prophet ſayes, <hi>The Prudent shall keep Silence,
for it is an evil time:</hi> And the greateſt of Prophets
hath ſaid, <hi>Caſt not your Pearls before Swine, leſt
they turn again and rent you.</hi> But I would hope the
caſe is not yet ſo deſperate. And I remember it is alſo
ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, thou
ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him, and not ſuffer ſin upon
him.</hi> And methinks no reaſonable Creature should look
upon a Perſwaſion to <hi>Conſideration</hi> as if it were evi

Council, or did proceed from ill Will. Therefore I
will adventure for my Country-men and Brethrens
ſake to make one Eſſay.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid of Old, <hi>Conſider, take Advice, and
ſpeak your Minds. Temerity</hi> is always evil, <hi>Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
is always good, but ſometimes neceſſàry. It is
requiſite that we be always ſober and conſiderate, but
eſpecially when we have to do in things that immediately
and deeply concern not our <hi>ſelves</hi> only, but <hi>GOD</hi>
and the <hi>KING</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With relation to God, it is ſaid,</hi> Be not raſh with
thy Mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter
any thing before God, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Verily, we have cauſe of Conſideration. He is a

have done, and then examine and conſider it.</p>

The laſt Year their Majeſties gave a Commiſſion of
Lieutenancy to his Excellency Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> Kt.
Captain General and Governour in chief of their
ſaid Majeſties Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi>
whereby he was conſtituted their Majeſties
Lieut. and Commander in chief of the Militia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
in <hi>Connecticut.</hi> But upon Notice hereof a General
Aſſembly was càlled, and met, and there it was reſolved,
<hi>Not to ſubmit to it, nor to take any notice of Sir</hi> William
Phips <hi>in that capacity.</hi> Afterward, at another General
Aſſembly we reſolve to addreſs their Majeſties forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and in the mean time requeſt Sir <hi>William Phips</hi>
thereupon to ſuſpend the Execution of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
till we can have an Anſwer from their Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>jeſties:
Yet no Addreſs is made to their Majeſties, as was
pretended. After which, Sir <hi>William Phips</hi> making
ſome further Demands in the Spring, 1693. we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to pay him ſome hundreds of Pounds, and to
take upon us the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Defence of thé upper Towns upon
this River, belonging to the <hi>Maſſachuſets;</hi> as if theſe
things would ſatisfie their Majeſties Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>This Year (1693.) Their Majeſties give a like
Commiſſion to his Excellency <hi>Benjamin Fletcher,</hi>
Captain General and Governour in chief of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39193:3"/>
Province of <hi>New-York, &amp;c.</hi> whereby he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
their Majeſties Lieutenant and Commander in
chief of the Militia, and of all Forces by Seà and
Land in their Majeſties Collony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and of
all Forts and places of Strength within the ſame.</p>
            <p>But upon Notice hereof the Free-men and Souldiers
in the ſeveral Towns are convened, to ſee how they
ſtand affected, and what they will contribute towards
addreſſing their Majeſties in this behalf. A General
Aſſembly alſo is called, and meets, and there it is
reſolved, Forth-with to ſend an Agent to <hi>England</hi> to
intreat their Majeſties favour in this and other reſpècts,
alſo, to levy a Tax of a penny in the Pound (in Mony)
upon all the People in the Collony, to defray the
charge of it, and that whatever more it amounts to,
ſhall be paid out of the publick Treaſury; and <hi>laſtly,</hi>
That if any ſuch Commiſſion do come in the the mean
time, they will not ſubmit to it, but oppoſe it, till
they have an Anſwer from their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>By theſe Methods the Free-men of the Corporation,
and as many of the People as will fall in with them,
are enſnared and ſtrongly pre-engaged to make Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
againſt their Majeſties Commiſſion. Inſomuch
that one Jeers, another will ſpend his Blood to keep
off his Excellency, another will ſcruple no more to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39193:3"/>
ſhoot him than to ſhoot a Deer, and can very well
find in his heart to ſpend a brace of Bullets upon him;
beſide other Flouts. At length the Commiſſion arrives
and comes to his Excellency's hands. In purſuance
thereof he ſpeedily takes a Journey to <hi>Hartford</hi> in
the time of our General Aſſembly held at <hi>Hartford,
October</hi> 12. 1693. and cauſes his Commiſſion to be
publickly reàd in the ſaîd General Aſſembly, and in
their Majeſties Namé requires and preſſes Obedience
to it, and gives us all reaſonable ſatisfaction and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
for that end. In particular, to prevent
Miſtakes, and in order to a good accomodation, his
Excellency leaves his Memorial of his Expectation with
us in Writing, deſiring our Anſwer to it in Writing;
and then further aſſures us, <hi>That he hath neither power
nor intent to invade our civil Liberties: That in caſe
of our Submiſſion he would commiſſionate all that were
in Commiſſion before, and take our advice for the ſupply
of vacant places:</hi> and partiçularly, tenders a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to oûr Governor for the command of all the Militia
in the Collony, only in ſubordination to this Their
Majeſties Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>But what is the Effect of all? Why! the Deputies
(divers of them at leaſt) being ſo prépared, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
are reſolved before hand, and have determined the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39193:4"/>
Queſtion before the Court meets; <hi>God hath given
them ſuch a Priviledge, and therefore if their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
put ſuch things upon them, they muſt oppoſe and
hold their own, they are bound in Conſcience to do it.</hi>
When his Excellency comes to the General Aſſembly,
to publiſh his Commiſſion, Order is given to the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berteérs,
<hi>To admit none but his Excellency and his
Retinue;</hi> as if it were not meet that their Majeſties
Commiſſion ſhould be known to the People, who
therefore were kept back, and not admitted without
hot bickering, nor till after great part of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was read; and no marvel, the General Aſſembly
themſelves not over-willingly give the Commiſſion the
hearing, take no great Notice of his Excellency, wave
the buſineſs, would bring him to compoſition, (as they
had done by Sir <hi>William Phips</hi>) and will not yeild
Obedience to the Commiſſion, but inſtead thereof ſend
Orders to ſuch as command the Forts, to prevent their
Seiſure; and it ſeems (if the common fame be true)
it is their Opinion, <hi>That their Majeſties have nothing
to do with us.</hi> Hereupon ſome will not take Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from his Excellency, others, who otherwiſe
would, are deterred, that they dare not. And for the
more common ſort of People, One maliciouſly ſlanders
and reviles his Excellency, another baſely Libils him,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39193:4"/>
others rudely affront him; yea, ſome riſe in Arms to
oppoſe him, and others are in readineſs, upon Occaſion,
to do the ſame. Such of the Aſſembly as moved for a
Submiſſion, are thought unfit to be Magiſtrates or
Deputies any more: and ſuch of the people as ſhow
their Reſolution to pày their Allegiance to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties,
and yeild Obedience to their Commiſſion, are
traduced as <hi>Rogues,</hi> that would undo the Country, and
accounted ſcarce worthy to live.</p>
            <p>His Excellency ſome-what ſurprized (as well he
might) at this ſtrange carriage of the King's Subjects;
his Country-men and profeſſed <hi>Chriſtians</hi> &amp; <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
and having but ſix or ſeven Perſons attending on him,
thinks it moſt conducive to their Majeſties ſervice to
demur a while, hoping that we will bethink our ſelves,
and withal leaves a Pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clamation purſuant to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
with Coll. <hi>Allen</hi> (in the Governour's àbſence)
requiring him to deliver it to our Governor, in order to
the immediate Publication of it in the ſeveral Counties
And upon our Governour's Return, his Excellency did
demand, whether he had received the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame? which he
owned. And thereupon his Excellency required him
to give due Obedience thereto. But it is now above a
Month ſince, and yet we hear no morê of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:39193:5"/>
Soon after his Return to <hi>York,</hi> his Excellency ſaw
cauſe to iſſue forth a ſecond Pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>çlamation, given at
<hi>Fort William Henry, November</hi> the 8th, 1693. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to the ſame Commiſſion and former Proclamation;
and ſent it (as we are informed) to our Governour,
requiring him forth-with to publiſh it in the chief
Towns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the intent that the People might not
be deluded and kept in ignorance. But it is now above
a Moneth ſince thé date of that alſo, yet we hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ſuch publication of it, only there is a printed
copy or two of it caſually come to the ſight of ſome.</p>
            <p>And whereas by the Publicàtion of this their Majeſties
Commiſſion all former Military Commiſſions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
determined, Hereupon aroſe a Queſtion and
Doubt, <hi>Whether we had beſt to muſter, and call men
to Arms for Military Exerciſe as formerly?</hi> Yet
upon deliberation it is reſolved upon, and in divers
places Souldiers are commanded to muſter, and are
trained as confidęntly às ever; and which is yet more,
it is ſaid, that after all this, we have taken upon us to
create a Major too. Thus we make all the Defiance to
their Majeſties and their Commiſſion, Trample them
into the very Dirt, and Offend with as high an Hand
as is well poſſible for us to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:39193:5"/>
This is the entertainment that their Majeſties Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
finds in <hi>Connecticut;</hi> and thus we ethink we have
neatly and effectually defeated their Majeſties Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
But we have need to conſider it.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of people, (as is ùſual in ſuch
caſes) that are guilty of this Error. Some there are of
Factious and Turbulent Spirits, and ſuch as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
by their Male-feazances, or other perſonal
Intereſts; and theſe two wittingly err themſelves, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd
out of Deſign miſ-lead others. Others again there are,
(and I would hope the moſt) that àre plain honeſt
minded men, who pinning their faith upon other mens
Sleeves, and being deluded by divers Artifices indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
uſed for that purpoſe, do think the matter is
right, <hi>and if it were not ſo, ſurely ſuch and ſuch whom
they take to be godly, wiſe and able men, would never
have had a hand in it;</hi> and therefore think they muſt and
ought to follow them, and do as they do. Thus it was
in <hi>Abſalom's</hi> Rebellion, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 11. With</hi> Abſalom
<hi>went two hundred Men out of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that were
call'd, they went in their ſimplicity, and they knew
not any thing.</hi> They were not at all privy to the Plot,
knew not <hi>Abſaloms</hi> deſign; if they had they would
never have gone with him; but thought it was meet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39193:6"/>
and honourable to âttend upon the Kings Son: No
doubt he had his Father's Warrant, or Liſence at
leàſt, and indeed ſo he had, to go to <hi>Hebron</hi> to pay his
Vow, but not to move Sedition: This they had no
thought or ſuſpicion of; and ſo they went in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and honeſty of their Hearts.</p>
            <p>And to this ſimplicity of the heàrt is too often adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſimplicity of the Head, or Ignorance of the
nature of the things men undertake &amp; engage in: Thus
it was in King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt's time, as we may ſee in
the Regicides, diver, of them ſeem to have been
(of themſelves) honeſt and well meaning men, who
being out-witted, ſeduced and over-driven by others,
engaged in things too high for them, and which they
did not underſtand, and ſo became guilty of that moſt
Helliſh and Execrable Murther and Treaſon; and
when the poor men came upon their Tryal, and hàd
their Eyes open to ſee what they had done, they had
nothing to ſay for themſelves, but to confeſs the Fact,
and acknowledge, <hi>That they underſtood not what they
did, if they had, they would never have done it, but
were deluded, drawn and driven by others beyond the
compaſs of their Sphere, and ſo to beg Mercy.</hi> And a
ſorrowful thing it is, (and ſuch an Example às may
ſerve for the Admonition of preſent and future Ages)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39193:6"/>
that honeſt men ſhould be ſo abuſed, as to ruin and
deſtroy themſelves and Poſtèrity by being made other
mens Tools and Inſtruments for the committing of
ſuch Wickedneſs. It muſt needs go ill with a People
when thoſe who tàke upon them to be their Leaders,
ſhall cauſe them to err.</p>
            <p>The former ſort ſeem to be Deſperate, there is little
hope of bringing them to better thoughts: For the
latter ſort therefore this Eſſay is chiefly intended. He
that is wiſe is wiſe for himſelf, and Wiſdom is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to direct: Some men cannot think, but others
can; and uſually ſecond Thoughts are better than the
firſt. <hi>Peter</hi> wickedly denyed his Lord and Maſter,
and that thrice; but when he thought thereon <hi>he wept
bitterly.</hi> Verily it is high time, and <hi>now is the time,</hi>
if we can, to <hi>bethink</hi> our ſelves: Let us therefore
ſeriouſly conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Conſider we, how by theſe carriages we blemiſh
our Religion, and ſcandalize the Goſpel. We profeſs
Religion, that we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yea, <hi>Proteſtants,
have Chriſt for our Teacher, and his Word for our
Rule.</hi> But what have we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> learned Chriſt, or have
we learned theſe things of him? Doth the <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39193:7"/>
Religion</hi> teach <hi>Diſobedience</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> to <hi>Kings</hi>
and their <hi>Miniſters?</hi> Will not our <hi>Religion</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>good Manners?</hi> Or doth it make <hi>Loyalty to
our Prince</hi> à <hi>Crime</hi> and a <hi>Scandal?</hi> We inſiſt very
much upon our <hi>Religion</hi> and would be thought
to be <hi>Eminent,</hi> and that we do more than others in it:
Therefore give me leave to inſiſt a little upon this
Conſideration.</p>
            <p>I may not undertake to play the Divine, but it concerns
every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to keep a good Conſcience. <hi>Conſcience</hi>
is not a Phantaſy, nor an Affection, but a <hi>Judgment.</hi>
He therefore that will keep a good Conſcience muſt
be furniſhed with good and ſound Principles. <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Nature</hi> and the <hi>Scripture</hi> are the only Magaziens
of good Principles: <hi>Innocent Nature</hi> we cannot now
boaſt of; but (though we may make a good uſe of the
Reliques of the Light of Nature, and indeed better
than we do, yet) we muſt now go to the Scriptures,
and be beholding to them for ſound Principles: There
we ſhall find the beſt Ethicks, and (in my Opinion)
the beſt Politicks too, far better ſure, than either
<hi>Morellius</hi> or <hi>Matchiavell</hi> can teach.</p>
            <p>My Principles, and I think agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
teach me theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:39193:7"/>
               <hi>Iſt.</hi> That Allegiance to our Prince, is a moral and
neceſſary Duty: It is an indiſpenſible Duty, plainly and
frequently commanded there: Prov. 24. 21. <hi>Fear thou
the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that
are given to change.</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 2. <hi>I counſel thee to
keep the Kings command, and that in regard of the
Oath of God.</hi> Thus Chriſt in his own Perſon hath
taught us, (if we be his Diſciples) <hi>Mat. 22. 21.
Render to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ann to</hi>
God <hi>the things that are</hi> God's.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles of Chriſt tread in the ſteps of their
Maſter, and ſtudiouſly vindicate the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi>
from this Scandal, by the diligent and fervent preſſing
of the ſame Doctrine: ſo <hi>Paul, Rom. 13. 1, 2, 5. Let
every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers, for there
is no Power but of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whoſoever therefore
reſiſts the Power, reſiſts the Ordinance of God, and
they that reſiſt receive to themſelves Damnation.
Wherefore you muſt needs be ſubject, not only for
Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi> How is it then
that ſome of our Deputies ſay, <hi>They muſt reſiſt and
oppoſe, they are bound in Conſcience to do it?</hi> 'Tis
true, a falſe God is in truth no God: An Idol is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World, ſo a falſe uſurped pretended
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39193:8"/>
Authority is not of God, ànd ſo is in truth no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
'tis but àn Idol, there is no Obedience due to it;
and if the King be ſuch an one, they ſay ſomething:
But all lawful Authority is of God, and he that reſiſts
reſiſts God: He that diſobeys the King, as King, or
exerciſing his Kingly Office, diſobeys God. Hence
the true <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> and <hi>Conſcience toward God,</hi>
(if we have any) do neceſſitate us to yeild Obedience
to the King and his Miniſters. <hi>We muſt needs be
ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience
ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14, 15. Submit your ſelves to
every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake, whether it
be to the King as Supream, or to Governors, as to thoſe
that are ſent by him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for ſo is the Will of God,
that by well-doing you may put to ſilence the Ignorance
of fooliſh men.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>Fear God, honour the
King.</hi> We muſt do it for the Lords ſake; and <hi>ſuch
as deſpiſe Governments, being preſumptuous and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed,
and are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities,
they are the ſpots and blemiſhes of Religion,</hi> and
reckoned among the worſt of men, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 10, 13.
Jude</hi> 8. 12. The Kings Perſon is <hi>ſacred,</hi> he is a
God upon Earth, and therefore to be feared, and his
Miniſters, as ſuch are Honourable; <hi>Who can ſtretch
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39193:8"/>
forth his Hand againſt the Lords anointed, and be
guiltleſs,</hi> ſays <hi>David?</hi> who when he had but cut off
the lap or ſkirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment, his heart ſmote
him, <hi>I have ſaid, ye are Gods, and Children of the
moſt High,</hi> Pſal. 82. 6.</p>
            <p>Yea, and this is a part of the Doctrine according to
Godlineſs, commanded to be taught by Miniſters of
the Word of God, <hi>Tit. 3. 1. Pút them in mind to be
ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</hi>
And to my knowledge, this Doctrine hath
been preached in <hi>Connecticut</hi> forty Years ago, and
more, and then it was accounted ſound Doctrine; but
now its too much forgotten, and too little practiſed;
yea, now it ſeems this ſound Doctrine will not be
endured, 'tis not a ſeaſon to preach it, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
at leaſt, will not be born. We want <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>
to preach Repentance, and to turn the Diſobedient
to the Wiſdom of the Juſt. It was a Man of Belial
who ſaid, <hi>We have no part in</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>that lift
up his Hand againſt the King,</hi> 2 Sam. 20. 1. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That true Réligion compriſes both Tables of
the Law: Though it doth diſtinguiſh them, yet it
doth not ſeperate them: <hi>Love the Lord thy God with
all thy Heart, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39193:9"/>
ſelf.</hi> Upon theſe two hang all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
So, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear the Lord and the King: Render to</hi>
Caeſar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Render to God, &amp;c. Fear God and
Honour the King.</hi> God hath all along joyned theſe
together, it is not for us to put them aſunder; we
offer Violence to Religion, if we do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So,</hi> James 1. 16, 17. If a Man ſeem to be Religio<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
and bridles not his Tongue, he deceives his own heart,
that Man's Religion is vain: pure Religion and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
before God, is to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widdow,
&amp;c. <hi>That is, true Religion draws Righteouſneſs and
Mercy (the Duties of the ſecond Table) along with
it, and is evidenced by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fifth Commànd is the Command of God as well
as the reſt of the ten, and he that is a Tranſgreſſor
of thàt is a Tranſgreſſor of all: He that ſaid, <hi>Fear
God,</hi> hath alſo ſaid, <hi>Honour the King.</hi> If therefore a
man ſay, he fears God, and yet diſhonours the King,
he deceives his own heart, he ſhould not believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for his fear of God is vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo ſays</hi> Paul, 2 Tim. 3. 4, 5. In the latter days
perilous Times ſhall come, for men ſhall be Traitorous,
Heady, High-minded, <hi>&amp;ç.</hi> having a form of Godlineſs
but denying the Power thereof.</p>
            <p>The fear of God will, without doubt, produce a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39193:9"/>
regard to Man, and bind the hands from unlàwful Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
without other Manacles. When <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s
Brethren, having ſo greatly injured him, as they had
done, were fallen into his hands, that he could eaſily
have revenged himſelf upon them, as he pleaſed; yet
ſays he, <hi>This do and live, for I fear God.</hi> How much
more may any Man, doing nothing but his Duty,
promiſe himſelf Security among thoſe that fear God.
But we have ſeen that of late in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which if
<hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had been here, would have made
him ſay, as once he did to <hi>Abimelech, Becauſe I thought
ſurely the fear of God is not in this place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> That the ſecond Command or Table of the
Lâw is like to the firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 38, 39. Man is the
Image of God, being made in his likeneſs, and the King
is the Image of God by way of Eminency: He is a
created Ray of the divine Majeſty and Soveraignity,
the next and immediate Deputy of God among men;
<hi>to whom God hath lent his own Throne, and put his
Name upon him,</hi> Pſal. 82. So the Duties of the ſecond
Tàble are like to the Duties of the firſt. <hi>Duty to Parents</hi>
is called <hi>Piety,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 4. for its likeneſs to it, and
evidence of it. And (as <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> ſays very
well) <hi>Then will the Power of Kings and Magiſtrates
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39193:10"/>
be ſound and ſafe</hi> [and I may add, then, and not before
will Religion too be ſound and ſafe] <hi>when Obedience
due to Princes ſhall be thought to be a part of piety,
and when the Paſtors of the Church ſhall train up the
people by the Word of God, to perform Obedience to
them.</hi> And ſo, on the other hand, the Sins againſt the
ſecond Table àre like to the ſins againſt the firſt. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is as the ſin of Witchcraft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> That the moral Law is not aboliſhed by Chriſt.
<hi>Do we then make void the Law,</hi> ſays Paul? <hi>nay, we
eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Verily, the fifth Command, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Parents and Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not aboliſhed, but
eſtabliſhed by the Goſpel. The true Church is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
City, nor an Enemy unto Kings. A Godly
Rebel is a Soliciſm, a prodigious Monſter that true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
never brought forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> &amp; <hi>laſtly,</hi> My Principles teach me, That as God
is abſolute Lord and Soveraign, the King of Kings, and
is to be obeyed abſolutely, and without reſerve; ſo the
King is next to God, <hi>Supream upon Earth, chief
Governor in all his Dominions</hi> (1 Chron. 29. 22.) and
to be obeyed, in ſubordination, (not in Oppoſition)
to God. Inferior Governors ſent by the King, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39193:10"/>
deriving their Authority from him, are to be obeyed,
(according to the meaſure of their Authority) in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
not in oppoſition to the King. We are not
to aſk Inferior Governors, whether we ſhall obey the
King, or not: The Son is not to aſk his Mother,
(much leſs his Brethren and Siſters, or Servants of the
Houſe) whether or no he ſhall obey his Father: No,
there is the Law of Nature and expreſs Command
of God for it. <hi>Children, Obey your Parents in the
Lord, for this is Right, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1. ſo 'tis in this caſe.
1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <hi>Be ſubject to the King, as Supream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for ſo is the Will of God, &amp;c.</hi> And the Fathers Authority
is paramount to that of the Mother: So is the Authority
of the King to that of inferiour Rulers; ſee <hi>Joſh. 1.
16, 17, 18. Joſhua</hi> was now made chief Governour
by God; <hi>Moſes</hi> his Succeſſor, who was King in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurun;</hi>
and there you ſee how ſtraitly they bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Obedience to him; ſee àlſo <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 26.
I think theſe points are Orthodox, and may paſs for
a Touch-ſtone, whereby to give a true Judgment of our
Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>If therefore our Religion be over-grown to that paſs,
that it teaches us to deny Kings and Magiſtrates to be
of God, untill we can King it our ſelves, or to deny and
abſolve our ſelves from Obedience to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39193:11"/>
they be of our mind, or will humor us: In a word, if it
either be or do teach or tollera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te Rebellion, it is certain
it cannot be true; it is high time to renounce it and
get a better: Such Religion is a ſcandal to the Goſpel.
We ſhall make the World believe, we have our Religion
to ſeek. It is good for us to read <hi>Rom. 2. verſ.</hi> 17. to 26.
If therefore we deſire to credit our Religion, and adorn
the Goſpel, which we profeſs, let us conſider and
return to our Obedience; get good Principles, and
put them into practice. Let us look upon our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
not as an Arbitrary thing, that we may pay it, or we
may let it alone, or take our time for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bùt let us
look upon it as a matter of Neceſſity. We muſt needs
be ſubject. If others will not be Loyal, yet we muſt;
and if this make us <hi>Vile,</hi> then we muſt be <hi>more Vile.</hi>
If for this we be <hi>Rogues that will <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndo the Country.</hi>
then we muſt be Rogues ſtill.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly all this will eaſily be avoided: It grows
too common an Opinion, <hi>That the King hath nothing
to do with us:</hi> ànd if that be true, I muſt confeſs, I
am beſide the Text. Therefore in the next place,</p>
            <p>2 <hi>dly,</hi> Conſider, That of our own accord, without
any Command ſo to do, we have long ſince proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Majeſties to be our King and Queen. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39193:11"/>
words of which Proclamation do declare their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
to be <hi>King and Queen of</hi> England, France <hi>and</hi>
Ireland, <hi>with all the Dominions and Territories
thereto belonging;</hi> who are accordingly ſo to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
deemed and taken by all the People of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Reàlms and Dominions, who are from hence
forward bound to acknowledge and pay to them all
Faith and true Allegiançé, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have accordingly in our Addreſſes to their
Majeſties, declared, <hi>That we reſumed our Government
till further Order, and profeſſed our ſelves to be
their Majeſties moſt humble and dutiful Subjects;
begged ſuch Directions from their Majeſties, as to
their Princely Wiſdom ſhould ſeem meet:</hi> Very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and zealous we have pretended our ſelves to be
for the Service and Intereſt of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to what end is all this? Did we not hereby
engage Obedience to their Majeſties, as our King and
Queen? but what Truth and Reality is there in it?
for now their Majeſties exert their Authority, iſſue
their Commiſſions, and give us their Directions, they
will not be received nor obeyed; as if <hi>their Majeſties
had nothing to do with us indeed!</hi> Thus in words
we profeſs to acknowledge their Majeſties, but in our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39193:12"/>
works we deny them. What is this but to mock their
Majeſties, and bely our ſelves? Our Actions will
ſignifie more of our Hearts, than our Words: For
ſhàme let us make haſte to pay our Allegiance. It is
a manifeſt thing that this and the other <hi>Hom<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>culus</hi>
hath a thouſand times more Authority, Reſpect and
Obedience in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> than their Majeſties have.
If a Man come in their Majeſties Name, and with
their Commiſſion, he will not be received by us;
but if a man come in his own Name, without
their Majeſties Authority and Commiſſion, him we
will receive: This is not the behaviour of good
Subjects. Have we not given our Hands, or do we
repent of ſo doing? Let us deal well and truly with
their Majeſties. Have we a King, or no King? or,
why halt we between two Opinions? If their Majeſties
be our King and Queen, then let us follow and obey
them; but if this ànd t'other man be indeed Kings,
then let us follow them. Let us not flatter and mock,
and call their Majeſties King and Queen, and pretend
they are <hi>Our Dread Soveraigns, our Soveraign Lord
and Lady, and We their moſt Humble and Obedient
Subjects,</hi> and make uſe of their Names to ſerve our
own purpoſes, and in the mean time refuſe to yeild
them any Obedience, ſcorn their Commiſſions, maligne,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39193:12"/>
contemn and abuſe their Miniſters. This is papable
Hypocriſie. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the
things which I ſay,</hi> Luke 6. 46. <hi>If I be à Father,
where is my Honour? If I be a Maſter, where is my
fear?</hi> Mal. 1. 6. If their Majeſties be our King and
Queén, where is our Obedience to them?</p>
            <p>Yea, let us deal plainly and uprightly with one
another alſo. We aré not willing to be kept in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
deluded and led hood-winked, till we are ſo faſt,
and unawares entangled in the Snare laid for our Life,
that we ſhall not be able to get out of it. There are
many of us that bear a good affection to our Charter-Government,
and for the ſake of that have counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
at leaſt not diſcountenanced (ſo much as ſome
others) the late Revolution, and have been willing to
contribute to the ſupport and continuance of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if it might be. But we always underſtood
it in ſubordination, not in oppoſition to the King, his
Government and Laws, and with a ſalvo, of all their
Majeſties Royal Rights. We never intended to
Invade the Liberties of our Fellow-ſubjects, or to uſe
Rigour towards ſuch as were not altogether of our
mind, but deſired that moderation might be uſed, and
that we might in no ſort exceed the Powers ſometime
granted to us; much leſs did we intend to invade the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39193:13"/>
Throne, and refuſe to render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is
his: and we thought that our Leaders and principal
Actors in this matter had been of the ſame mind. We
thought alſo we had ſpoken as we meant, when at the
Revolution, <hi>May</hi> the 9 <hi>th.</hi> 1689. we declared, <hi>That
we took the Government only till we ſhould receive
further Orders from the King.</hi> And in our Addreſs
to his Majeſty, we ſhewed his Majeſty the ſame thing,
and withal profeſſed our ſelves <hi>his Humble and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Súbjects;</hi> and prayed his Majeſty, in his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<hi>to give us ſuch Directions as to his Princely
Wiſdom ſhould ſeem meet;</hi> and we thought that it was
our ſincere and unanimous purpoſe and reſolution to
follow his Majeſties Directions when given, and not to
put a Trick upon him. But now we are afraid we are
deluded, and not without Reaſon. He is blind that
hath not taken notice of that notorious Falſhood that
hath been uſed, and the innumerable Lyes of all ſorts
that have all along from time to time been and are ſtill
raiſed aud fomented; the advantage that hath been
taken of mens Ignorance, and the Endeavours that have
been and are uſed to keep men in the Dark, as if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to train them up in a blind Obedience to us,
beſide other ill meaſures taken; and now at laſt, ſuch
open and reſolûte Oppoſition and Defiance is made to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39193:13"/>
their Majeſties, and their Royal Commiſſion of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
<hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond.</hi> Theſe things make us jealous.
And therefore if all our Declarations ànd Proteſtations
aforeſaid be but a Cheat, and Rebellion be indeed
coûched and lurk under the ſpecious and enticing
Terms of a <hi>Charter, our Liberties, Priviledges</hi> and
<hi>Government, &amp;c.</hi> pray deal plainly and truly with us,
and let us know it. We hope, that upon good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
the generality of the good People in this
Collony intend no ſuch thing; and therefore let us not
be plunged blind-fold into the Pit of Rebellion:
Some of us remember and conſider, that in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Paſſages we have given our Hand to their
Majeſties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be ſome may think to avoid this alſo,
and ſay,</hi> We are willing with all our hearts to obey
their Majeſties in all lawful things <hi>[good Words]</hi>
but we are not to obey unlawful Commands. <hi>True:</hi>
Therefore yet further,</p>
            <p>3 <hi>dly, Conſider,</hi> Is not this Commiſſion lawful? Is
not the Militia the Kings, and at his diſpoſe? Why
then ſhall we not give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s? If we could ſay the Commiſſion was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it might excuſe our ſuitable Non-ſubmiſſion to it,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39193:14"/>
though not oùr Contempt. For althô the unlawful
Commands of lawful Authority (be they Unlawful
in regard of the Law of God or Man) are not to be
performed; yet in ſuch caſe, our Behaviour ought to
be Humble and Honourable. Let us therefore inform
our ſelves in this point: it is declared by two ſeveral
Acts of Parliament of 13 &amp; 13 &amp; 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. (and of
this their Majeſties were pleaſed to put us in mind by
expreſs mention of the firſt of theſe Statutes in the
Commiſſion to Sir <hi>William Phips) That within all
their Majeſties Realms and Dominions, the ſole and
ſupream Power, Government, Command and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Militia, and of all Forces by Sea and
Land, and of all Forts and Places of Strength, is
and by the Laws of</hi> England <hi>ever was the undoubted
Right of his Majeſty, and his Royal Predeceſſors,
Kings and Queens of</hi> England; <hi>and that both or
either Houſes of Parliament, cannot, nor ought to
pretend to the ſame, nor can, nor lawfully may raiſe
any War, Offeuſive or Defenſive, againſt his Majeſty,
his Heirs or Lawful Succeſſors, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall we then think, that our Corporation may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thô the Parliament may not?</p>
            <p>And that this is indeed ſo, we may ſee (beſide other
Authorities) in that great caſe of Ship-Money, ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39193:14"/>
largely and learnedly argued, <hi>Anno 13 Car.</hi> 1. wherein
it was agreed on all hands,</p>
            <q>
               <p>That the King is raiſed to
the Throne for the <hi>Safeguard of the Law,</hi> and of
<hi>the Bodies and Eſtates of the Subjects;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Defence is the Kings. The Safety of the
People committed to him, is incumbent upon our
Lord the King.</p>
               <p>That the Law hath entruſted the King with the
care of the Defence, both Domeſtick and Forreign.</p>
               <p>That all Juriſdiction legal, is wholly in his Majeſty;
that this is evident even by the Law of Nations.</p>
               <p>That the King is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of his
Country, and therefore bound, both in Honour
and by his Oath, to provide for its ſafety on every
ſide.</p>
               <p>That for this end the Law hath put the armed
Power and means of Defence wholly into his Majeſty's
hands; and when the Enemy is diſcovered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
'tis not in the power of the Subject to order
the way and means of Defence, either by Sea or by
Land, as they think fit; for no man without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
or ſpecial Liſence from his Majeſty, may
ſet forth any Ships to Sea for that purpoſe, nor
without ſuch Commiſſion or Liſence (unleſs upon
ſuddain coming of Enemies) may erect a Fort,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39193:15"/>
Caſtle or Bullwark, though upon his own ground:
Nor (but upon ſome ſuch cauſe) is it lawful for any
Subject, without ſpecial Commiſſion, to arm or
draw together âny Troops or Companies of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
or to make any general Collection of Money
on any of the Kings Subjects, though with their
conſent.</p>
               <p>That the King is <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> ſo that none may
advance toward the Enemy, withoût his Signal, or
in other manner than by his Direction; and thàt he is
armed with all other Powers requiſit for the full
Execution of ſo high a place, as well in time of
eminent Danger, as of actual War.</p>
               <p>That the Law layes the burthen of this Defence
upon all (<hi>Qui ſentit commodum, &amp;c.</hi> He that feels
the benefit, ought to feel the burthen too) and
makes the quantity of each mans Eſtate the Rule
whereby this Burthen is to be equally àpportioned
upon each Perſon.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In this great Càſe therefore the Queſtion was not,
<hi>Whether the ſole and ſupream Power of the Militia,
and of all Forces,</hi> &amp;ç. <hi>belong to the King, or not,</hi>
otherwiſe how ſhould he perform this great Truſt?
Therefore ſays <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cton</hi> (that àntient Author) <hi>There
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39193:15"/>
are two things necessary in a King,</hi> LAWS <hi>and</hi>
ARMS, <hi>whereby he may rightly govern the Times
both of Peace and War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was the Queſtion, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom the burthen of
it ſhould be laid;</hi> for Allegiance binds every Subject
to yeild his beſt Aſſiſtance (both of Counſel and Aid)
for the common Defence.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were, without Controverſy, agreed on
both hands, but the only Queſtion was concerning the
<hi>Manner how the Charge of the Defence ought to be
levyed? Whether by the Kings Writ, or by common
conſent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby therefore we may ſee, that by the Law of
<hi>England</hi> the ſole and ſupream Power, Government
and Diſpoſe of the Militia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, and ever was the
Kings undoubted Right, and that theſe Statutes
(above-mentioned) do but declare the antient Law in
that behalf.</p>
            <p>This Commiſſion therefore is a lawful Commiſſion,
being founded upon the antient and ſtanding Laws of
the Realm; yea, it is not only lawful, but neceſſary,
foraſmuch as it is incumbent upon their Majeſties,
both in Honour and by their Oath, to provide for the
ſafety of their People on every ſide.</p>
            <p>The Deſignation or Appointment of this or that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39193:16"/>
particular Perſon to be their Majeſties Lieutenant,
(being qualified according to Law) is by the Law left
to their Majeſties Wiſdom and Pleaſure. Conſider
we then, that (theſe things being ſo) our Diſobedience
to this Commiſſion is utterly inexcuſable, and much
more our Contempt.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>thly.</hi> It is to be conſidered alſo, That when their
preſent Majeſties came to the Throne, the Militia,
and all Forces by Sea and Land, and all Forts and
places of Strength in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> were in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
hands and poſſeſſion; it is good for us to bethink
us, Who took them out of their Majeſtìes hands? or
how it came to paſs that they are not now in their
Majeſties hands, if it be ſo indeed? or who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to give account of that matter? Is it not
more Wiſdom for us to make ſure of a Pardon for
what is paſt, than to go on to multiply and aggravate
our Preſumptions?</p>
            <p>5 <hi>thly.</hi> Put the caſe that their Majeſties had granted
ſuch a Commiſſion to us, ſhould we not have expected
and compelled Obedience to it? Yea, no doubt; then
it had been a very lawful and good Commiſſion, and
neceſſary to be obeyed We that can make ſo much
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39193:16"/>
of a bare ſilent Permiſſion or Sufferànce of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and make ſo much of the King's làte Letter,
which yet takes not ſo much as the leaſt Notice of any
of us; and can be ſo ſevere and ſharp upon any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledgement
of our diſputable Authority; how
brag &amp; peremptory ſhould we have been, if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
(<hi>in terminis</hi>) had been given to us? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot,</hi> or the <hi>Nooſe of an Halter</hi> had
been good enough for any one that ſhould have offered
to oppoſe it, or refuſe Obedience to it: And how
ſhould we have traduced them as Enemies and Rebels
to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then turn the Scale. We know the Golden
Rule, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do to
you, do you the ſame to them.</hi> It is their Majeſties
Commiſſion no leſs than if it had been directed to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>thly.</hi> How greedily did we catch at the King's
Letter of the 3d of <hi>March</hi> laſt (although their
Majeſty doth therein take no Notice of our Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or any particular Perſon in it, but directs it
only in general, thus, <hi>[To ſuch as for the time being
take care for the preſervation of the Peace, &amp;c.]</hi> in
our Collony of <hi>Connecticut</hi>) And how readily did
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39193:17"/>
we comply with it? And why? <hi>Why</hi> (it will be ſaid)
<hi>it is his Majeſties Command, his Majeſties pleaſure,
we muſt obey the King.</hi> Conſider then, This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
is their Majeſties Command alſo, this is their
Royal Pleaſure: In this caſe, (<hi>Rex praecipit, &amp; Lex
precipit</hi>) The King commands, and the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
is all one.</p>
            <p>And is not this lawful Command as good as
that? Is not the great Seal as effectual às the little
Seal?</p>
            <p>But it may be thought, that Letter put a ſtaff into
our hands, in a ſiniſter manner to ſerve our ſelves of
our fellow Subjects; but this Commiſſion takes it out
again; and therefore we willingly complyed with that,
but will oppoſe this. Poſſibly ſome may have cauſe to
thank their Majeſties for that: But if that be the
caſe, where is our Obedience? Genuine Obedience is
Univerſal.</p>
            <p>7 <hi>thly.</hi> Conſider we the vile Ingratitude of this our
ill behaviour towards their Majeſties, and their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
It is well known to the World what their
Majeſties have done, and how they have expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for the benefit of the whole <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi>
of which we are a part, for the ſecuring of all their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39193:17"/>
               <hi>Rights,</hi> civil and ſacred, their <hi>Religion, Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
and <hi>Property,</hi> and the continual and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Labour and Hazards which his ſacred Majeſty
condeſcends from Year to Year to undergo, for that
end. Whereby their Majeſties have given abundant
Evidence of their good affection to their Subjects,
and that they will take nothing from us which is our
Right, nor deny us any thing which their Royal
Wiſdom ſhall ſee to be good for us, but are willing
to purchaſe it for us at a dear Rate. Yea, and this
very Commiſſion is a ſingular Inſtance of their tender
care for our Defence and Safety in this perilous time
of War, as is manifeſt from the Commiſſion it ſelf:
And do we thus requite their Majeſties? <hi>O fooliſh we,
and unwiſe!</hi> Who hath bewitched us? There is
nothing ſo hateful and provoking as Ingratitude:
Truly, we may do well to remember <hi>Jotham's</hi> Parable
(<hi>Judg.</hi> 9.) and the applicàtion of it, and apply it
to our ſelves; <hi>Hearken to me</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that God
may hearken to you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If you have dealt well with</hi>
Jerubbaal, <hi>&amp;c. and have done to him according to the
deſerving of his Hands; for he fought for you, and
adventured his Life far, and delivered you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
you are riſen up againſt him this day, &amp;c.</hi> Have we
done to their Majeſties according to the deſerving of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39193:18"/>
their Hands? Shall we requite Love with Hatreds
Tender Bowels with Malignity? For what elſe can
our Behaviour ſignifie, but a malignant Spirit and
inveterate Hatred againſt the King, as King, and who
ever comes from him, as ſuch? We have ſufficiently
declared our Affections to the King, and what we
ſhould have done, if we had him ìn our hands; we
ſhould ſoon rid the World of Kings, if we had them
in our Power. Remember <hi>Hazael, Is thy Servant a
Dog</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that he ſhould do this great (i. e.</hi> this
Abominable) <hi>thing;</hi> Yea, but when Temptation and
Opportunity met together, he did it notwithſtanding;
and verily ſo ſhould we.</p>
            <p>8 <hi>thly.</hi> Let us look through all their Majeſties Realms
and Dominions, and ſee where we can find any ſuch
Preſident or Example. We are too apt to admire our
ſelves, <hi>and to bleſs God that we are not as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican!</hi>
But who ſo Ungrateful, who ſo Diſobedient
as we? Their Majaeſties may look upon themſelves
to be very Unhappily and Unequally yoked, as to us:
The beſt of Princes with the worſt of Subjects.</p>
            <p>9 <hi>thly.</hi> Conſider we the Time. Is this a time for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39193:18"/>
us to be Refractory and Diſobedient to our Prince?
Between four and five Years ago, when there was no
War with <hi>France,</hi> we would needs have made the
King and and the World believe, <hi>That we were in
continual danger of our Lives, by reaſon of the Natives
being at War with us, with whom</hi> (we ſaid) <hi>we had
juſt fears of our Neighbouring</hi> French <hi>to joyn; and
therefore not receiving Orders or Directions what
Methods to take for our Security, we were neceſſitated
to put our ſelves into ſome form of Government.</hi>
And yet now there hath been open and ſtrong Wàr
with <hi>France,</hi> and with the <hi>French</hi> in all parts above
this three Years, and that attended with not a few
or ſmall Difficulties ànd Diſappointments, and now
that their Majeſties have given their Orders and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
whàt Methods to take for our Security in
this difficult and hazardous Time, there is yet ſo
little danger, that we will not receive their Majeſties
Directions, but ſpurn at their Commiſſion, ſcorn at
their Lieûtenant, and will yeild no Obedience.</p>
            <p>What: do we indeed intend to fall off to the
French? We had as good fall to the French, as
fall from our King; and if we intend ſo to do, let us
ſpeak out; if not, ſurely this is not a time to be
Diſobedient. For how is it poſſible for any Prince to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39193:19"/>
provide for the ſafety of his Subjects, or to manage
the weighty Affairs of War with effect, (and more
eſpecially at ſuch a Diſtance) if his Subjects will
ſlight ànd diſobey his Commiſſions, or take upon
themſelves to wage War, without or againſt them?</p>
            <p>10 <hi>thly.</hi> We are now addreſſing their Majeſties for
their Favour (ſo we ſay) and to the end that we may
recommend our ſelves to them as (it ſeems) their
<hi>moſt Proud and Diſobedient Subjects,</hi> at this very
time we diſobey their Commiſſion. Can we think
that <hi>Diſobedience</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> âre the moſt likely
way to obtain acceſs and acceptance? Is that the way
to find favour? or do we think that the King is
afraid of us, and we ſhall force him to comply
with us? Verily, I doubt we ſhall tempt him and
prove him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Pride, Supplication</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> do
not ſort well together.</p>
            <p>11 <hi>thly.</hi> Our great Champion in whom we truſted
to vindicate ûs, and defend our Cauſe, yeilds the
Cauſe, and leaves us in the Lurch: Our <hi>Goliah,</hi>
who defied all as Pigmies that durſt appear againſt us,
the ſtone is ſunk in his fore-head, and he is fallen
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39193:19"/>
upon the Earth, he is convinced in his Conſcience,
and tells us with all the honeſty and plainneſs that he
can, <hi>That he will not ruin himſelf and his Poſterity;
That he will not Hang for any of us.</hi> No doubt but
(whatever he hath don<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet) now he ſpeaks as he
thinks; and ſhall we yet harden our ſelves? ſhall we
ruin our ſelves and our Poſterity? Believe it, <hi>we
ſhall find it hard kicking againſt the Pricks.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us conſider ſeriouſly the end and
event of theſe things, and what may reaſonably follow
thereupon. <hi>The fools Eyes are in his Heels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

it is ſaid, <hi>That the Wiſe Man begins at the end;</hi>
and it were good for us to begin there too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us
conſider it then. What do we think will be the end of
theſe ſtrange Behaviours? What good can we promiſe
our ſelves?</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:39193:20"/>
1 <hi>ſt.</hi> Where the Word of a King is, there is Power,
and (in the Execution of his Regal Authority) <hi>who
may ſay to him, what doſt thou?</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 4. What
Aſpect then will theſe things have abroad in the world,
among thoſe who know what a King is? Such
carriage would hardly have been expected from any part
of <hi>New-England:</hi> Friends will be aſhamed, Enemies
will inſult.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>dly.</hi> What aſpect do we think they will have at
Home with the King and Council? Surely their
Majeſties promiſed themſelves better things from their
Subjects in <hi>Connecticut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 <hi>dly.</hi> The Defence and ſafety of the Subject in all
parts, is their Majeſties great Intereſt and Care; and
it is not eaſie for us to conceive how we prejudice their
Majeſties Intereſt, fruſtrate their Intentions, break
their Deſigns, defeat their Councils and obſtruct their
Service for the Defence of their People, both here and
elſe-where (the very end of this Commiſſion) by our
<hi>Diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commiſſion takes no Notice of àny <hi>former
Military Commiſſions</hi> but that which was the laſt year
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39193:20"/>
given to Sir <hi>William Phips,</hi> and that is expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Publication of this. So that by our
<hi>Diſobedience</hi> we are <hi>without Defence our ſelves,</hi> and
incapable of <hi>helping others.</hi> And who knows whàt a
Day, much more a Quarter or Half a Year may bring
forth?</p>
            <p>We may deſire that this <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to our Prince
<hi>ſhould not be told in</hi> Gath, <hi>nor ſpoken of in the Streets
of</hi> Aſkelon; but our deſire is vain. Thé <hi>Hittites</hi>
dwell in the Land, and obſerve our Actions. The
Report of it will ſooner fly to <hi>Canada</hi> (and it may
be to <hi>France</hi> too) than ſome of us could wiſh; and
what Inferences will there be made, and Reſolutions
taken thereupon, is not impoſſible to gueſs. They
may conclude, they have <hi>Connecticut</hi> to Friend, at leaſt
in a poſture of Neutrality, which will animate them not
a little.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mohaques</hi> alſo, and other Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi>
will ſoon have the News of it (if they have it not
already) and who knows but it may give them occaſion
to go over to the French, the effects whereof may be
ſuch as are not to be deſired, <hi>unleſs we intend to follow
them.</hi> But if none of theſe ſhould be, yet our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39193:21"/>
Behaviour in this matter renders their Majeſties and
their great Officers <hi>vile &amp; contemptible,</hi> and our ſelves
<hi>baſe</hi> in the ſight of the very <hi>Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 <hi>thly.</hi> Is not <hi>their Majeſties Commiſſion under the
great Seal of England,</hi> ſufficent to authorize their
Majeſties Lieutenant in <hi>Connecticut?</hi> if it be not,
what elſe can do it? The World is at an end; there
is no more to be done in a fair way: But if it be, why
do we not ſubmit to it? Verily, if the <hi>King's Broad
Seal</hi> will not run to be obeyed in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> we
may juſtly expect that <hi>ſomething elſe ſhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are we ſo ignorant that we do not know,</hi> That to
levy War againſt the King is High-Treaſon, both by
the Common &amp; Statute Law; <hi>or,</hi> That an actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
or Inſurrection, is a levying of War againſt the
King: That a gathering of Force for the Removal of
Counſellors, altering of Laws, <hi>or the like, though
with pretence of</hi> Reformation, <hi>yet being without
Warrant from the King, is a</hi> levyiug of War againſt
the King? <hi>or that</hi> the holding of a Fort or Caſtle by
force of Arms againſt the King and his Power, is a
levying of War againſt the King? What Conſtruction
<hi>then do we think it will have, if we ſhall be found
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39193:21"/>
to</hi> riſe in Arms againſt the King's Lieutenant, <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
his Commiſſion, and commanding Obedience

and all Forces by Sea and Land, and all Forts and
places of Strength <hi>in a whole Collony or Province,
from the King, againſt his plain Commiſſion, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the great Seàl?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do we not know,</hi> That an Ambaſſadour from a
Ferreign Prince (though an Enemy) ought to have
ſafe Conduct in all the King's Dominions, and 'tis
againſt the Law of Nations to offer him any Violence
or Indignity? <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>themſelves would abominate
that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or can we be ignorant of this, <hi>That Diſobedience
and Contempt offered to the Kings Miniſters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds,
and is done to the King himſelf?</hi> Is it not a
ſure Rule in Humane, as well as Divine Things,
<hi>He that deſpiſes me, deſpiſes him that ſent me.</hi> What
face then will our Behaviour hàve, when it ſhall
appear, that our own Kings Lieutenant cannot come
among us to execute their Majeſties Command, bût
(beſide other <hi>vile Indignities,</hi> ùnfit to be named) he
is in danger of his <hi>very Life:</hi> Such as aſſert their
Allegiance and declare their Submiſſion, run the ſame
hazard; and others, who are willing to ſerve their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39193:22"/>
Majeſties, dàre not take Commiſſions, for fear of
being deſtroyed. And by this means his Excellency
Returns, without effecting his Buſineſs, and with as
much Diſgrace as we can well caſt upon him. Yea,
if any man adviſe or move another to take a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from their Majeſties Lieutenant, it is accounted
a Wicked thing, and he an henïous Offender.</p>
            <p>Will this be acceptable News to their Majeſties?
Or will they not rather reſent it, as <hi>David</hi> did that
Reproach of his Meſſengers by <hi>Hanun?</hi> Verily, a
Contempt and Abuſe from Subjects, is a thouſand times
worſe than from Aliens.</p>
            <p>Some may imagine they hàve found a neat way to
defeat the Kings Commiſſion: They will not take
Commiſſions from his Lieutenant themſelves, but
will alſo deter others, that they ſhall not dare to do
it, and think it a Project worthy to be gloryed in.
Truly, we have many wayes made it evident enough,
what low thoughts we have of his Majeſty. But
what! do we think he is to be put off in this manner
by our ſcurvey ſilly little Tricks? or do we think
that our Obedience is an Arbitrary thing, and the
King muſt be beholding to us for it? or that he is
made up all of Grace, and hath nothing of Juſtice
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39193:22"/>
in him? If ſo we do, doubtleſs we ſhall find our
ſelves miſtaken; and that he is (like Chriſt whom he
ſerves) both a <hi>Lamb</hi> and a <hi>Lyon.</hi> I believe he will
decide the Controverſie, and make us know who is
King, before he hath done with us. For how can it
conſiſt with his Crown and Dignity, or with the
ſafety of his Government to paſs by ſuch high
handed and miſchievous Offences, without ſuitable
Annimadverſion. We very much forget <hi>Solomon's</hi>
Advice, as if we had never read it: <hi>I counſel thee,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>to keep the Kings Commandment, and that
in regard of the Oath of God. Be not haſty to go
out of his ſight: Stand not in an evil thing; for he
doth whatſoever pleaſes him. Where the Word of a
King is, there is Power, and who may ſay to him,
what doſt thou? Whoſo keeps the Commandment,
ſhall feel no evil thing,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Yea,
but the Kings Wrath is as the roaring of a Lyon,
and as Meſſengers of Death; but his Favour is as
the Dew upon the Graſs,</hi> Prov. 19. 12. <hi>There is Life in
the one, but Death in the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We forget alſo the Parable of the Citizens that hated
their Lord, and woûld not have him to reign over them:
<hi>Thoſe mine Enemies</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that would not that
I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39193:23"/>
them before me.</hi> It is but a Compariſon taken from
things reaſonable among men.</p>
            <p>And how eaſie a thing is it for their Majeſties
more ways than one to make ns weary of our Rebellion.
What if their Majeſties ſhould hereupon fetch over
whom they ſee cauſe to <hi>England,</hi> and there proceed
againſt them according to their Demerits? Shall we
not hereby ruin our ſelves and our Poſterity? Or,
what if they ſhould declare us <hi>Rebels,</hi> and put us
out of their Protection, and prohibit all their Subjects
any Commerce with us? For how can we expect
that their Majeſties ſhould protect us, <hi>who ſcorn to
be governed and protected by them,</hi> but by our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs
break their Meaſures in the very point of
<hi>Protection?</hi> Or, if they ſhould reduce us to our
Obedience by Force, and keep us under the awe of
a ſtrong Garriſon, and lay the Charge of it upon us?
Or, if they ſhould but lay a ſore heavy Fine upon
us: If they ſhould do any of theſe, or the like,
what ſhall we do with our ſelves? Verily, we are in
their Majeſties hands, and it is a new ſort of Grace if
they do nothing.</p>
            <p>Let all good Subjects then conſider, and as they
would deliver themſelves from the common Guilt,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39193:23"/>
ſo let them diſtinguiſh themſelves, and make haſte
to yeild their due Obedience; and as for the reſt,
we may ſay, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what
they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt all this divers things are objected, let us
conſider them alſo.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Objection,</hi> The Militia is very well diſpoſed
of already: King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond (of happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory)
did by his Charter, for himſelf and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
grant it to us and our Succeſſors in the Year
1662.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer divers things:</p>
            <p>1 <hi>ſt.</hi> We overween our Charter in more things than
one, to the no little Prejudice both of King and
Subjects. Modeſty might incline us to think that the
King underſtands our Charter, and how well the
Militia was thereby diſpoſed of, at leaſt as well as we
do; and he knows what is his own Right and our
Right much better than we. Their Majeſties have
given us no cauſe to ſuſpect, that they will take any
thing from us that doth of right belong to us. But to
let other things paſs, let us here conſider, That the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39193:24"/>
Charter never granted us a ſtanding Militia, but only
a Liſence upon occaſion of Invaſion, or the like, to
<hi>array men, &amp;c.</hi> for our ſpecial Defence and ſafety in
ſuch caſe: The Charter never gave us Power to raiſe
and ſend men àbroad for the Defence and Aid of others.
The King's Letter of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>March</hi> laſt gave
more power in that behalf to thoſe to whom it was
directed, than ever we had by the Charter.</p>
            <p>The Power of <hi>Arms</hi> grantéd by the Charter was
not given to the General Court, but only to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
chief Commanders and Officers for the time
being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Charter never granted us the command of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny
Forts or places of Strength. Let us examine the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſee if we can find theſe things there.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>dly.</hi> Suppoſe we that all this had been granted by
the Charter from King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, and his
Succeſſors, to us and our Succeſſors, yet then the
Grant had been void, becauſe the Militia is a Jewel
of the Crown, not to be granted by the King from
his Succeſſors. It is like <hi>Abiſhag the Shunamite:
And why doſt thou aſk</hi> Abiſhag <hi>the</hi> Shunamite <hi>for</hi>
Adonijah? <hi>aſk him for the Kingdom</hi> alſo, ſayes
<hi>Solomon.</hi> Beware of the next words, <hi>God do ſo to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39193:24"/>
me, &amp;c.</hi> If the King give away his Militia, he may
give his Kingdom too. And of the truth of this our
preſent Behaviour is an undeniable Inſtànce.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>dly.</hi> Suppoſe we, That it had been ſo granted, and
that the Grant had been good, yet we ſhould remember
that our Succeſſion was determined in the Year 1688.
So that we cannot talk of our Succeſſion or Succeſſors
without ſome new Grant. And when their Majeſties
came to the Crown, the Militia and all Forces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and all Forts and places of ſtrength were in their
Majeſties hands. And this was either by right or by
wrong: If it were ſo by Right, there is no colour
for this Objection: If by Wrong, we might then have
preferred our Petition of Right for the Recovery of
it. But for us, without their Majeſtïes Notice or
Liſence, either ſurrepetitiouſly or by force, to take
and with hold the Militia from the King, is ſuch
a Preſumption as I know not who will undertàke to
juſtifie or excuſe.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Object.</hi> But we ſuſpect that this Commiſſion is
a Cheat, becauſe the King was in <hi>Flanders</hi> at the date
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:39193:25"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But, 1 <hi>ſt.</hi> Can we prove it to be a Cheat?
otherwiſe this is a very bold Objection.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>dly.</hi> It is only our Ignorance that makes us ſuſpect
it to be a Cheat. For we ſhould know, 1 <hi>ſt,</hi> That
the King is wont, when he goes out of the Reàlm, by
his Letters Patents under the great Seal, to conſtitute
and leave behind him his Proxer (or Deputy) who
is Guardian or Keeper of the Realm, to exerciſe the
Government in his abſence.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>dly,</hi> Bût now there is a Queen Regent; his Majeſty
was pleaſed to commit the Government to the Queen in
his abſence, and accordingly it was by Act of Parliàment
(of <hi>anno 2. W. &amp; M. May</hi> 20. 1690.) provided,
<hi>That as often as his Majeſty ſhall be abſent out of the
Realm of</hi> England, <hi>the Queen ſhall exerciſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the Regal Power and Government of the
Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>Dominion of</hi> Wales, <hi>and Town
of</hi> Berwick <hi>upon</hi> Tweed, <hi>and the Plantations and
Territories thereto belonging, in the Names of both
their Majeſties, &amp;c.</hi> The King's abſence therefore
is no argument that the Commiſſion is a Cheat; for if
the King did not give his Writ of Privy Se<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l before he
went, for the affixing of the great Seal, the Queen might
lawfully do it in his abſence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:39193:25"/>
3 <hi>Object.</hi> But if it be not a Cheat, yet the King
hath given us no command to ſurrender the Militia to
his Excellency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1 ſt.</hi> A poor ſhift! as if their Majeſties
Commiſſion to his Excellency to command, were not a
command for us to obey? or, as if his Excellency's
command, purſuant to his Commiſſion received from
their Majeſties, were not their Majeſties Command.
He commands in their Majeſties Name, and for this
he hath their Majeſties Authority, Warrant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
under the great Seal; and do not their Majeſties
then command us to ſubmit to him?</p>
            <p>His Excellency demands no ſurrender of the Militia
of us, but Obedience to his Commiſſion: The Militia
is the Kings, and he hath conſtituted his Lieutenant
over it, and thereby furniſhed him with all the Powers
that any of their Majeſties Captain Generals do or have
lawfully exerciſed. Now the Kings Lieutenants or
Captain Generals may lawfully aſſemble men, form
Regiments, Troops and Companies, commiſſionate
Officers, muſter, lead and conduct them, or cauſe
them to be muſtered, led and conducted, either for
Military Exerciſe or for actual Service, as occàſion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:39193:26"/>
requires: And the Law not only requires Obedience
of all, but in particular requires all Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to be aiding and aſſiſting to the Kings Captain
Generals in the execution of their Commiſſions. He
hath Power to require aſſiſtance of whom he will, and
they muſt aſſiſt him at their Peril.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Did their Majeſties ever give their Subjects
any command to yeild Obedience to our reſumed
Power? We lately received a Letter from their
Majeſties, Did their Majeſties therein, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
give the People any immediate and expreſs
Command to obey us in what we were thereupon
about to do? Yet we expect Obedience from them,
without any ſuch command. And are not we their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Subjects, as well as the reſt of the People?</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Obj.</hi> But we cannot manage our Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Militia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then we may either go to the King to help
us, or let it alone. The Kings Government is more
General, more Neceſſary, more Worthy and more
Legal than ours; and how ſhall the King manage or
maintain his Government without the Militia? <hi>Laws</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:39193:26"/>
and <hi>Arms</hi> are neceſſary in a King, that he may rightly
govern the Times both of Peace and War, as àforeſaid.
Our Government is but a particular thing, and we may
not ſet our Government in Competition with, much
leſs in Oppoſition to the Kings Government.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Obj.</hi> But we are afraid, that if we let the Militia
go, our Government will go too, and we ſhall be annexed
to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is no neceſſary <hi>conſequence;</hi> but ìf it
ſhould be ſo, what then? Whether we be annexed to
<hi>York,</hi> or <hi>York</hi> annexed to us, 'tis as long as broad:
<hi>York</hi> hath been annexed to us once or twice àlready,
and what hurt did we receive by it? it was in ſome
ſort annexed by our Charter, which extended to the
South Sea, and then it was (I ſuppoſe with our conſent)
ſeperated again. <hi>York</hi> was again annexed to us by the
late King <hi>James,</hi> and I know not any detriment that
enſued upon that.</p>
            <p>We have alſo once in great meaſure annexed our
ſelves to <hi>York,</hi> and without queſtion the King may as
well annex us to <hi>York,</hi> as we annex our ſelves. We
may remember how readily at <hi>Leyſler's</hi> motion, under
the pretence of an Expedition againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39193:27"/>
confederated with him, took Commiſſion from him,
and put their Majeſties Subjects under his command;
ànd have not their Majeſties a better Right to put us
under their own Lieùtenant, commiſſionated by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Will the King take this well at our hands,
that we ſhould obey any man rather than himſelf?
We can willingly ſubmit to <hi>Leyſler's</hi> Authority, but
ſtubbornly reject the Kings Commiſſion, and defie his
Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> If we renounce the King ànd his Government,
we deſtroy our own: We cannot pretend to any thing
but from and under the King: and how can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or expect that others ſhould obey us, if we will
not obey the King? All Loyal Subjects may juſtly
be afraid of having to do with us; for ſuch Obedience
is indeed Unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly</hi> We cannot think that our Government ſhall
always ſhoulder out the Kings Government; and 'tis
not to be doubted but their Majeſties have long had
the ſettlement of the Government of theſe Territories
under conſideration. The Defence of the Dominion
is their Majeſties great Intereſt and care. It is obvious
to every Eye that we are divided from the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:39193:27"/>
at Sea by the ſhoals, and at Land by a great diſtance,
and that <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>York</hi> by their natural ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
lie much fairer than <hi>Connecticut</hi> and the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets,</hi>
for the defence of each other, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of <hi>Albany,</hi> that key of the Country, à Poſt
neceſſary to be defended, and by the defence whereof
we defend our ſelves; and this is laid as the ground of
their Majeſties diſpoſe of the Militia in this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It is not for us to appoint or dictate to their
Majeſties, but to acquieſe in their Majeſties Wiſdom
and Goodneſs in that behalf, on whom we may relie,
being aſſured that they will do that which ſhàll be beſt
for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> We may remember alſo, That whereas their
Majeſties did the laſt year give a Commiſſion to Sir
<hi>William Phips,</hi> their Governour of thé <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi>
we had then the ſame jealoûſie of being annexed to
the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> and would not ſubmit to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
nor take notice of Sir <hi>William</hi> in that
capacity; whereby (to make the faireſt conſtruction
of it that may be) their Majeſties might very well
conclude, that we were not deſirous to be annexed
to the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> but had rather be annexed to
<hi>York,</hi> às being far more convenient. Howbeit we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39193:28"/>
may well look upon this Commiſſion as the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of our Non-ſubmiſſion to Sir <hi>William Phips.</hi>
It is their Majeſties Grace ſo far to over-look that
<hi>Diſobedience;</hi> if now we ſhall fina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lly reject the ſecond,
the <hi>Third</hi> may bring a greater inconvenience than any
we can imagine to follow upon our being annexed to
York.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> The Regal and chief Government doth
not belong to us: The moſt that we can pretend to is
but that of a Corporation. The Regal Government
is the King's, and their Majeſties may commit it
here or there, as pleaſes them, and 'tis our Duty to
ſubmit. And which, I pray, is the moſt likely way
to preſerve our Government, <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 <hi>Object.</hi> But if we be annexed to <hi>York,</hi> we
ſhall have great Rates to pay, and be grievouſly
oppreſſed: The <hi>Long-Iſlanders</hi> complain that they are
intollerably oppreſſed by this Governor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1ſt.</hi> We have a Friend in the Country that
hath told the World, <hi>That this is a Land full of
Lyes:</hi> and I wiſh it were not true. Howbeit,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39193:28"/>
Male-contents will never want Complaints, true or
falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> The Governour neither doth nor can impoſe
any Rates upon them, there is none levyed but what
their Aſſembly of the Free-holders ſee needful for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying
the neceſſary Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> That ſmall Province of <hi>New-York</hi> hath had
(beſide other arrears) the burthen of the Defence of
<hi>Albany</hi> ſo long lying mainly upon them alone, by
which their Rates, no doubt, have been much more
heavy than otherwiſe they would have been. But
have not we great Rates to pay alſo, now as we are
ſtanding alone? And how doth it appear that their
Rates are greater than ours? If that màtter was well
examined, poſſibly it might be found, thàt our Rates
are as great, if not greater than theirs; and yet we have
had no ſuch burden incumbent upon us. How many
Thouſand of Pounds have been raiſed upon this
Collony ſince the Revolution? and who is he that can
give account of a farthing benefit accrewing to this
Collony by it, except that little Skirmiſh at <hi>New-London,</hi>
when two or three French Veſſels put in there?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:39193:29"/>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> If we ſhould be permitted to ſtand as we
are, yet we ſhall have great Rates to pay ſtill, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as long as the War laſts. We volûntarily take
upon us the Defence of the upper Towns belonging
to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> upon this River, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
not to us. The King by his Letter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
aſſiſtance of Men and Money to his Governor
of <hi>York,</hi> and we ſeem willing to comply with that:
but theſe things muſt of neceſſity augment our Rates as
much if not more than our annexion to <hi>York,</hi> if it
ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> If we ſhould be annexed to the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi>
ſhall we not have as great Rates to pay, as
if we be annexed to York, or greater? Do not they
complain as much as the other, or rather more? and
we have ſeen ſomething of it too. So that this is but a
common Objectïon; for look which way we will,
(whether we be annexed to York or to the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi>
or ſtand as we are, yet) the War continuing
will make Rates greater than otherwiſe; yea, without
any War we can find wayes to make great Rates.
And if by any way they may be leſs than other, it
ſeems to be by our annexion to York. Many hands
make light Work; and many Occaſions whereby
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39193:29"/>
much Money is now expended to little purpoſe, will
by that means be taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly. Let us do our Duty, and let the Skey fall.</hi>
Theſe are but empty Scar-crowes, contrived on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to fright men from their Duty: And let us have
their Majeſties Government, Law and Juſtice, and let
it coſt what it muſt.</p>
            <p>7 <hi>Object.</hi> But the Governour of <hi>York</hi> is a Proud,
Moroſe, Stearn and Auſtere Man, we do not deſire
to come under ſuch Governors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who knows when the Devil and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>8 <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome ſay he is a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Verily, if this were true, it were the moſt
legal Objection that I have yet heard; for <hi>Papiſts</hi> are
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>abled by Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:39193:31"/>
But theſe who are bold to ſay ſo, had need make good
Evidence of it, leſt they rank themſelves àmong thoſe
<hi>filthy Dreamers who defile the Fleſh, revile Rulers,
deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> and
make themſelves guilty of all thoſe miſchiefs that follow
thereupon.</p>
            <p>For, 1 <hi>ſt</hi> How doth it appeat that he is a <hi>Papiſt</hi>
He profeſſes that he is an <hi>Epiſcopal Man,</hi> or for the
way of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which is eſtabliſhed by
Law, whereby <hi>Popery</hi> is renounced.</p>
            <p>He makes it his firſt care to provide for an able Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
Miniſtry, and for the due and ſtrict ſanctification
of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>He is a Lover of ſound Doctrine, and of the free and
faithful preaching of Chriſt crucified, and a Friend to
good Men.</p>
            <p>He pays his due Allegiance to their Majeſties, and
vigorouſly maintaìns their Intereſt, and defends their
Subjects againſt <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He improves his Authority for the ſuppreſſion of
Vice, and Reformation of prevailing Evils.</p>
            <p>He is a Peace-maker, and ſtudies the compoſing and
quieting of Differences among their Majeſties Proteſtant
Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:39193:31"/>
He openly declares, That he will never mix his
private Intereſt with the Publick.</p>
            <p>He diligently ſeeks the Wellfare of the People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his Truſt; and is careful to put ſuch into
places of Truſt, as are duely qualified, that Law and
Juſtice may have their free Courſe. Theſe things do
not argue that he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but the contrary.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>dly.</hi> His Excellency is better known to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
than to us: We know how his Majeſty hath
declared againſt the putting of <hi>Papiſts</hi> into place, who
are diſabled by Law, and conſequently àll they do is
void in Law: And therefore we cannot think that
he will do it himſelf: Yet he is a Governour, and
to us a Lieutenant of his Majeſties own chuſing; and
therefore no reaſon to think that he is a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 <hi>dly,</hi> What aſſurance have we that the Objector is
not a Papiſt? Papiſts hold, <hi>That Faith is not to be
kept with Hereticks (i. e.</hi> with Proteſtants) <hi>That the
Oath of Allegiance to Heretical (i. e.</hi> Proteſtant)
<hi>Princes, is not to be taken, or if it be taken, yet it is
null and void, and binds not, or at leaſt may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
with, and made void.</hi> and ſûch like. Let the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39193:32"/>
Objector pay his Allegiance, and ſubmit to the Kings
Commiſſion, if he would not be thought to be a
Papiſt, or would be allowed to make this Objection.</p>
