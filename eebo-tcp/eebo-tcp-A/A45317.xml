            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

concerning OATHS.</head>
            <head type="sub">Dedicated to King CHARLES I. By the
Right Reverend Dr. Joſ. Hall, then Lord
Biſhop of Exon. And Printed in the Year
1639.</head>
            <p>I. NO Man may ſwear, or induce another Man to
<hi>ſwear unlawfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. It is no <hi>lawful Oath</hi> that is not attended
with <hi>Truth, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> Jer. 4. 2.
the <hi>firſt</hi> whereof requires, that the thing ſworn be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
<hi>ſecond,</hi> that it be juſt: The <hi>third,</hi> that it be not undue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
to be ſworn and undertaken.</p>
            <p>III. A <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Oath, which is to the certain <hi>Prejudice</hi> of
another Man's <hi>Right,</hi> cannot be attended with <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. No <hi>Prejudice</hi> of another Man's Right can be ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and ſinful, as that Prejudice which is done to the
right of publick and <hi>Soveraign Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. The right of <hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> is highly prejudiced,
when private Subjects <hi>incroach</hi> upon it; and ſhall, upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of the diſavowed intentions, or actions of their <hi>Princes,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32051:2"/>
combine, and bind themſelves to Enact, Eſtabliſh, or altar any
Matters concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> without (and therefore much more
if againſt) the Authority of their <hi>Lawful Soveraign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. A Man is bound in <hi>Conſcience</hi> to reverſe and diſclaim
that which he was induced <hi>unlawfully</hi> to ingage himſelf by
Oath to <hi>perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. No Oath is, or can be of Force, that is made againſt a
Lawful Oath <hi>formerly taken;</hi> ſo as he that hath ſworn <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to his <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and thereby bound himſelf to maintain
the Right, Power, and Authority of his ſaid Soveraign, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by any <hi>ſecond Oath,</hi> be tyed to do ought that may tend to
the Infringement thereof: and if he have ſo tyed himſelf, the
<hi>Obligation</hi> is, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> void and fruſtrate.</p>

            <head>Queſtions concerning the Validity of the late
Act for the Oath of Abjuration.</head>
            <p>1. WHether an Act of Parliament may not be void, and
of none Effect in whole or in part?</p>
            <p>2. Whither there be not two Originally diſtinct Authorities
in this Kingdom or Nation; a Civil Authority for ordering
of Civil Matters, and a Sacred for Matters of Religion, and
merely Spiritual?</p>
            <p>3. Whither by the Fundamental Principles of the true <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Government, whatever Acts are made contrary to, inconſiſtent
with, or derogatory from the Laws of God, or the Authority
of Chriſt committed to the Miniſters of his Kingdom be not ſo
far void?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:32051:3"/>
4. Whither an Act of Parliament requiring the Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great Penalties to Swear ſuch M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tters, as they are not
competent Judges of, be not to involve them in a Sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to, or inconſiſtent with the Principles of Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>5. Whither this be not ſuch Matter of Religion, as ought
to have been conſider'd in a free National Synod, before it
was paſt in an Act of Parliament?</p>
            <p>6. Whither, for theſe Reaſons, the Injury to the Subject,
the Inconſiſtence with the Principles of Chriſtianity, and the
Irregular and Illegal Proceedings in it, the late Act concerning
the Oath of Abjuration be not a void Act of Parliament, and
the Oath not to be taken by any Members of Parliament or
other Subjects?</p>
            <p>7. Whether there be not a heavy Load of <hi>Guilt,</hi> of <hi>Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and divers other Sins upon the Nation already, and this
likely to fill up the Meaſure, and bring down the Judgments
of God upon it?</p>
            <p>8. Whether to prevent the Judgments of God there ought
not to be a <hi>Solemn Faſt</hi> appointed, and a <hi>Publick Confeſſion</hi> be
made by ſome Act of the State of the Publick National Sins,
which have been committed, within 20 or 30 Years laſt paſt,
and all things done, which are requiſite to a Sincere National
Penitence, and giving Glory to the Majeſty of the Great God
of Heaven?</p>
