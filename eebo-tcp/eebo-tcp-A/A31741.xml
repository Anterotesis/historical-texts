            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CHARACTER OF THE True Blue Proteſtant Poet: OR, THE Pretended Author OF THE CHARACTER OF A Popiſh Succeſſor.</head>
            <p>ONE would believe it almoſt Incredible, that any out of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> ſhould think it poſſible, a yeſterdays <hi>Fool,</hi> an errant <hi>Knave,</hi> a deſpicable <hi>Coward,</hi> and a prophane <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> ſhould be to day by the ſame Perſons, a <hi>Cowley,</hi> a Man of <hi>Honour,</hi> a <hi>Hero,</hi> and a <hi>Zealous</hi> upholder of the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi>; But certainly thoſe that believe this, muſt have as much <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> as the Blindeſt <hi>Bygotted Papiſt</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi>; and confeſs at the ſame time, that <hi>Miracles</hi> are not <hi>ceaſed</hi>; For, like <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> in a Night, there is lately <hi>ſprung up ſuch a Wit,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Hector,</hi> ſuch a <hi>True Proteſtant Poet,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Champion for the Cauſe,</hi> as no Records have ever mention'd; But ſince it has ever been granted, that Three parts of Four of all Mankind, <hi>are Knaves, and Fools</hi>; I wonder which of theſe two his Admirers, and Applauders will ſubmit themſelves to be taken for, for 'tis an Inevitable fate upon them, they will by the underſtanding part of the World, be accounted one of thoſe.</p>
            <p>But now, that this may not appear altogether Malice, and Reflection upon him, and ſome that are pleaſed to be Infamouſly called his Friends; we will a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what our <hi>Heroe</hi> has been, and what <hi>he ſtill is</hi>; and becauſe he may loſe no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that may accrue to him: I will in the firſt place begin with his <hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> He was indeed the Reputed Son of his <hi>Mothers Husband</hi>; a <hi>Barber</hi> in <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> and his good Mother ſold <hi>Ale</hi>; and becauſe his Family would not Degenerate, or they thought themſelves honoured in their Trade; the better half of his Generation are <hi>Barbers,</hi> he was deſigned for one; his <hi>Brother</hi> was a <hi>Barber,</hi> and his <hi>Great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> that bred him up, and gave him all he has, is a <hi>Barber</hi> now living at <hi>Hempſtead,</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> well known by the name of <hi>Old Cana,</hi> or <hi>E. S.</hi> The reſt of his <hi>Allies,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48312:2"/>
Bakers, Fidlers,</hi> and <hi>Shoemakers,</hi> &amp;c. And though this be no extraordinary Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, yet he, like the ill Bird, the Proverb ſpeaks of, <hi>has Bewrayed his own Neſt, and made it worſe</hi>; It happened about four years ago, there came out a Copy of Verſes, of the ſame <hi>Libellous nature</hi> of <hi>Azaria, and Huſhai,</hi> (which by the greateſt part of the Town has been accounted his;) but ſince the <hi>Illegitimate Brat</hi> had not ſtrength to Support it ſelf, and he found its deformity, and weakneſs, gave no credit to the <hi>Vigorous Abilities</hi> of the Father; He (tis ſaid) had laid it at an Impotent, Lame Mans door, who becauſe he never had any of his own, he gladly <hi>Adopted</hi> the <hi>Baſtard</hi>;) But our <hi>Malicious Buzzard</hi> did not in thoſe days Soar ſo high, he only did abuſe the <hi>Poets</hi> then, into whoſe number he would fain have crept, which becauſe they always ſcorn'd, and lookt with Contempt upon him, He endeavours thus to revenge himſelf; but it fell out moſt unluckily, for a diſcovery was ſoon made of our <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>O.</hi> a Man of the Sword, as well as the Pen, finding himſelf moſt courſly dealt withal, immediately call'd him to an account, and required the ſatisfaction of a Gentleman from him: This I muſt confeſs was ſomething unreaſonable, and did by no means agre with our <hi>Scriblers Conſtitution,</hi> who had much rather <hi>Rail</hi> than <hi>Fight</hi>; and being at this news as much ſurprized, and in little better pickle, than <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman Atkins</hi> would have been upon the like occaſion, beg'd he would ſpare his Life, and he would give him any other ſatisfaction he could deſire; and preſently taking, <hi>Pen, Ink,</hi> and <hi>Paper</hi> out of his Pocket, he writ theſe following words, <hi>(viz.) I confeſs I Writ the</hi> Seſſions of the Poets, <hi>and am very ſorry for't, and am the Son of a Whore for doing it; Witneſs my hand</hi> E. S. This he delivered to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> which it ſeems ſaved his Throat for that time; but I am affraid for a worſe hand.</p>
            <p>But yet ſince this we find he can be <hi>Valiant, extreamly Valiant,</hi> as by this late <hi>Heroick Action</hi> will appear; He had ſome years <hi>Courted a Gentlewoman</hi> of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Reputation,</hi> and much better than he could deſerve; And after many <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations</hi> of her <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> of his, at laſt with many <hi>Solemn Proteſtations</hi> they were <hi>Contracted.</hi> But afterwards, meeting with a <hi>Tapſters Daughter,</hi> (a Wench he thought would have a better fortune,) he Premeditated with himſelf, how to break off from his firſt <hi>Engagement</hi>; and one day, being alone with the <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> he on a ſuddain coming behind her, <hi>Struck</hi> her with moſt <hi>Barbarous fury,</hi> ſeveral blows upon the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Neck,</hi> with the <hi>Hilt</hi> of his <hi>Sword</hi>; and, had ſhe not cry'd out <hi>Murther,</hi> and the People of the Houſe come in upon it, he confeſſed, <hi>He ſhould not have given over, till he had beaten her Brains out</hi>; Now how noble this Action is, and how it becomes our <hi>Hero,</hi> I will leave to the Senſure of all Honeſt Men.</p>
            <p>Nay, after all this, he himſelf confeſt, <hi>That he had Sworn Ten Thouſand Oaths to her, and that they were Contracted, but</hi> (he ſaid,) <hi>It was not for his Intereſt to keep thoſe Vows; and therefore, had he Sworn Ten Thouſand more, he would have broken them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She upon this his <hi>Sawcey uſage,</hi> and to take off all cenſure that it in reaſon might produce, ſoon after Sued him at <hi>Common Law</hi>; and in the Tryal at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> laſt Term, (when a <hi>Scandalous proof</hi> might have been <hi>Advantageous</hi> to him,) he ſaid publickly in the <hi>Court, He knew nothing by her contrary to Vertue, and Honour</hi>; and it was likewiſe Sworn, by an Eminent <hi>Citizen of London</hi> at the ſame time, and one to whom <hi>E. S.</hi> had with a great deal of <hi>Inveteracy Rayl'd</hi> againſt her; that even then in the cloſe of his diſcourſe, he vowed, <hi>He knew nothing ſo much as Immodeſt by her, and he believed her as Chaſte as the Virgin</hi> Mary.</p>
            <p>There is beſides, now living at the <hi>Golden Key</hi> in St. <hi>Clements-lane,</hi> two Witneſſes more who were in the Court the Tryal day, and would have taken their Oaths if there had been occaſion, that <hi>E.S.</hi> a little before the Suit began, had Voluntarily, but very Solemnly, Sworn, and bid them bear Witneſs of it, <hi>That whatever Law-Suits ſhe ſhould Commence againſt him, he would never do, or ſay any thing to the Prejudice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48312:2"/>
of her Honour; For if I ſhould,</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>by the Eternal God it would be Falſe, and nothing but Malice; for I know that for me ſhe is a Virtuous Woman; And in my Soul I believe her ſo for all Mankind.</hi> Then Mrs. <hi>J.</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Perhaps you will not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame her your ſelf, but may ſet on ſome Friend of yours to do it; No</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>in the preſence of Almighty God I Swear, I never will; and remember what I now ſay, and if I do, Record me both a Villain, and a Rogue, for ever after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet after all this his aſſerting her <hi>Innocence</hi> with <hi>Vows,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtations,</hi> he now endeavours by all the <hi>Malicious Billingſgate Language</hi> he can invent, to Diſhonour her; But ſince he could Record his own Mother a <hi>Whore,</hi> ſhould we in reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect better from ſuch a Sordid <hi>Animal.</hi> No, it is impoſſible that Mud ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing but <hi>Monſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place he is a Man of ſo much <hi>Religion,</hi> that he has often, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies, declared, <hi>That Intereſt is his God</hi>; and indeed, according to the Dictate of his Intereſt, has he ever acted; As for a freſh Example, for when he had to oblige a party, (Fooliſhly enough, in every <hi>Coffee-houſe, Ale-houſe,</hi> and <hi>Tavern</hi> he came into,) owned <hi>The Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> to be his; But finding his hoped for reward ſtill behind, he has often ſaid, <hi>God Damn that Party, they were ungrateful Raſcals</hi>; he preſently reſolved to change the Scene, and anſwer thoſe two Books, called, <hi>The Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor; and a Popiſh Succeſſor Compleat</hi>; which not two Months before he had (with no ſmall Vanity,) Boaſted to be his; In this how far he proceeded I cannot tell, but he begun the great work; for it has been ſeen by ſeveral, in ſeveral Papers under his own hand: The <hi>Verbatim</hi> words of one that was by accident loſt by him, (but is ſtill in being, and may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,) are theſe: <hi>I confeſs I am ſo proud of Publiſhing the Glories of that never to be forgotten</hi> Hero, <hi>the</hi> Royal J. <hi>That I would not only with no little vanity have ſet my Name to this</hi> Loyal Panegyrick, <hi>but with Triumph have laid both my ſelf and it at his</hi> Highneſſes <hi>Feet; did I not fear the Injuſtice I have done that unexampled Envied Prince, (ſhould I diſcover my ſelf,) would create me ſuch Mortal Enemies, that I might with reaſon expect a</hi> Phanatick Stab, <hi>for the ungrateful Oracles I have declared; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve indeed not only I, but all Men of ſence, would fear to Inſenſe ſo Powerful, ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, and ſo Dangerous a Party againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis true, I could have been more large in deſcribing the Compendious Merits of his worthily famous</hi> Highneſs<hi>'s more then Princely Character; did I not think it as Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent a piece of</hi> Rethorick, <hi>as playing the Oraetour upon the</hi> Courage of Ajax, <hi>and Subtilty of</hi> Uliſſes; <hi>it being no more then the underſtanding Reader, and the Judging, Admiring World, are already ſenſible of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And next, the whole aim of the Subject is to do my King and Country Service: Firſt, in Removing the doubts of a diſtracted People, and delivering them from the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of all Conditions, the living betwixt Hope and Fear, like</hi> Eraſmus<hi>'s</hi> Paradice <hi>hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between</hi> Heaven <hi>and</hi> Hell, <hi>and ſettling them in a true and ſolid underſtanding, both of their own and</hi> Englands <hi>preſent State: And ſecondly, by diſpelling that Cloud that Darkens the face of the Heir of</hi> England, <hi>and rendring the true indiſputable Virtues of the</hi> Royal J. <hi>both Conſpicuous, and Tranſparent; And now ſwell'd with the pride of ſo glorious a deſign,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This was Abruptly left off, and was an unpoliſht part of a Preface to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, ſome of which I am ſure he had writ before, though they were never Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht; And then, to make that Party believe he was growing Honeſt, he viſits all his former Acquaintance that were the <hi>D's.</hi> Friends, and which had, for his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Characters,</hi> deſerted him: The Lady <hi>S</hi>— was one to whom he Confeſt he was much troubled for his Writing thoſe Books, but he was now reſolved to Write himſelf into the <hi>D</hi>'s favour again: and to one Mrs. <hi>M</hi>—, who had been his Landlady five years, he ſaid he was both ſorry and aſham'd that he had Writ
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48312:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt his <hi>Royal H.</hi> but he was now a true Convert, Anſwering his own Books, he had Writ againſt him, with all the Zeal Imaginable; He likewiſe told all the Players, that we was Writing the <hi>Convert Whig.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, to promote that Intereſt which he declared was his God, He wiſely but very Impudently makes bold with two Great Lords Names, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Lord <hi>A</hi>—, and the Lord <hi>H</hi>—, pretending theſe Perſons had ſent to him about this Affair, and had promiſed him three hundred Pounds a year to Write for the Court-Party, and Anſwer his own Books: Which I believe no Man of ſence would give three pence for, and moſt ſweetly for them made himſelf this Complement, that none could Anſwer <hi>S.</hi> but <hi>S.</hi> But this done cunningly, at laſt, to let them know what he expected, or at laſt to ſee which Party would bid moſt for his Pen; but finding that all his Leuring brought not his <hi>Falcons</hi> to his Fiſt, he Sneaks back to his firſt ſtation, and fawns on them he had renounc'd, and Curſt: telling them, that theſe Reports which then flew about, was only the Malice of the <hi>Tories</hi> againſt the <hi>True Blue Proteſtant Poet,</hi> and That Paper, or Preface of his, which is inſerted here, was Writ by the way of <hi>Irony:</hi> hoping they would not believe he could ſo much as think what he had Writ concerning his <hi>R. H.</hi> was truth, and perhaps indeed he did not; but all wiſe Men will alſo believe, a Man of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples never valued that in any caſe, a Man that declares <hi>Intereſt his God,</hi> wou'd no doubt, were it in his Power, Dethrone an Angel, and Crown a Devil for his Advantage.</p>
            <p>After all his Notorious Perjuries; His <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Inhumane Beating</hi> of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>; His Recording his own <hi>Mother a Whore,</hi> rather then prick his own Finger; His declaring <hi>Intereſt to be his God</hi>; His Perfidious Deceitful Actions, even to all Parties; What can with reaſon be expected from ſuch a <hi>Monſter,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Coward,</hi> but that he will at laſt for Fear, or Intereſt, Betray to ruin all thoſe that have ever truſted him.</p>
            <p>All this conſidered, I wonder what any Party can expect from him, if they Deſign to ſerve him as the Monkey ſerved the Cat, make uſe of his Paw to Scratch the Cheſnuts out of the Fire; I am affraid they will be miſtaken, to my certain knowledge, he is very choiſe of his Clumſey Fiſts; and he values not what any Suffers for him, ſo he may Sleep in a whole Skin; For in his moſt <hi>Meritorious</hi> piece of Service for the <hi>Whigs,</hi> his pretending to be the Author of the two Books called <hi>the Characters,</hi> which indeed were not half his; but had they been his own intirely, he never durſt have Publiſht them himſelf, or owned them till he had ſeen the danger over; but then, and when he ſaw the Honour was like to be done the curious <hi>King Elephant,</hi> that firſt forded the River; Was he not, like Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Sidneys Dametus,</hi> creeping out of the Buſh, and Singing with a loud voice,
<q>
                  <l>If the Man ſuch praiſe muſt have,</l>
                  <l>What muſt I, that keep the Knave?</l>
               </q>
And certainly <hi>Dametus,</hi> by his great Wiſdom and Matchleſs Courage, was a type of our <hi>Hero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could enlarge much, and inſtance many more notorious Actions of his, but I am not willing to tire my ſelf and the Reader any longer with ſuch a dirty Subject.</p>
            <p>I think I have ſaid enough, (conſidering how eaſily every one may ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the truth of this Narrative,) to convince all Honeſt Men what a Rogue our <hi>True Blue Proteſtant Poet</hi> is, and how they ought to avoid him.</p>
