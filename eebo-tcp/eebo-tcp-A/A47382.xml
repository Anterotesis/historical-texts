            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>MEthinks I hear some travel'd Gallant say,</l>
            <l>When he was last at <hi>Rome,</hi> he saw this Play:</l>
            <l>That <hi>Zeno</hi> there was Acted; we confess,</l>
            <l>And hope, that here he'l have as good success.</l>
            <l>But we are pester'd with so many Wits,</l>
            <l>And some, like Madmen, have such judging fits,</l>
            <l>That this great Tragedy they may condemn,</l>
            <l>Though, in a humor, they have pardon'd them,</l>
            <l>Who rob the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> of their Bayes;</l>
            <l>And make a fashion of Translating Playes.</l>
            <l>To own his pattern, th' Author's not asham'd.</l>
            <l>That Model, which in <hi>Italy</hi> was fram'd</l>
            <l>He has new Moulded, for our <hi>English</hi> Stage;</l>
            <l>Hoping 'twill fit the temper of this Age:</l>
            <l>And the learn'd Latin Author not offend,</l>
            <l>For alt'ring, what he dares not think to mend.</l>
            <l>Though boldly it be here transformed so,</l>
            <l>That Author cannot his own Issue know:</l>
            <l>Like crafty Beggers, when they Children steal,</l>
            <l>Disguise them; lest they should their Thefts reveal.</l>

               <l>Is't not yet day? This night seems very long:</l>
               <l>That little Lamp does give so faint a Light,</l>
               <l>I cannot well distinguish what I see,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Longinus, Proclus,</hi> do none give attendance?</l>
               <l>Is <hi>Caesar,</hi> by his Servants, no more fear'd?</l>
               <l>Ha! where am I? In Fetters, and alone;</l>
               <l>Either I Dream, or I do dimly see</l>
               <l>A dismal Vault, surrounded with dead Corps.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Euphemian,</hi> thy Prediction is too true.</l>
               <l>Would I had stab'd my self, when I slew thee.</l>
               <l>This is the Tomb, he fatally foretold,</l>
               <l>I should alive be buried in. Horror</l>
               <l>Dazels my eyes, or else, among the dead,</l>
               <l>I see <hi>Longinus</hi> in that next Coffin:</l>
               <l>He's buried too, but not alive, like me.</l>
               <l>How I came hither, is beyond my guess.</l>
               <l>What, ho! who guards this prison of the Dead?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1 <hi>Sould.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>They need no guards, we only wait on you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeno.</speaker>
               <p>Then give me drink, to quench my raging thirst.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2 <hi>Sould.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>So we may keep you company in chains.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeno.</speaker>
               <p>By whose command do you starve me to death?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>By th' Emperors command, He sent you hither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeno.</speaker>
               <p>What, have you any Emperor but <hi>Zeno?.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2 <hi>Sould.</hi>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Anastasius</hi> Reigns, you are in your grave.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeno.</speaker>
               <l>Can these Changes be since yesterday?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99352:28"/>And by him. I least fear'd, of all mankind.</l>
               <l>When died my Empress?</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeno.</speaker>

               <l>No, <hi>Caesar,</hi> no; you were out-witted there:</l>
               <l>To her the Doctor was more merciful.</l>

            <sp>

               <l>To be despis'd, and laugh'd at in my Grave</l>
               <l>Is worse than Death: and to be thus Dethron'd,</l>
               <l>Tortures me more, than Hell it self can do.</l>
