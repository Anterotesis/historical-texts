         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>a Letter to Mr.</hi> Miles Prance <hi>in relation to the Murther of Sir</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury
Godfrey: In which ſaid Libel amongſt other things, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,

particularly the refuſing of the body at their inſtance and requeſt to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened:</hi>
And in another place of the ſame Libel, it is further contained,
as follows, <hi>They ſay, that if a Man or any other Creature, be ſtrangled

needs be if your Evidence be true)</hi> (meaning the Evidence of the ſaid

ſo iſſued out of that wound, that it ran from off the Table upon the Floor,
and from thence into the Cellar;</hi> ſo that they do averr, that that wound that
he received by that Sword muſt of neceſſity be the Cauſe of his Death:
And in another part of the ſame Libel it is further contained as follows,
<hi>They obſerve that</hi> Bedloe's <hi>before the Committee of Lords, and your Evidence
in relation to this Gentleman's Death, are as different as the Eaſt is from the
Weſt; for you dogg him out of St.</hi> Clements, <hi>the other decoys him from</hi>

Stables going to the Water-ſide,</hi> Bedloe <hi>that he was ſmothered with a Pillow

Reign of the ſaid late Lord the King, at the ſaid Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary le Bow
London</hi> aforeſaid, with Force and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> falſly, unlawfully, unjuſtly,

a <hi>ſecond Letter to</hi> Miles Prance, <hi>in reply to the Ghoſt of Sir</hi> Edmondbury
Godfrey. In which laſt mentioned Libel amonſt other things, it is further
contained as follows, <hi>Next whereas my Letter ſaith (and that truly)
that the Coroners Jury were firſt of opinion, and accordingly declared he was</hi>
felo de ſe, <hi>and that much Art and Skill was uſed to procure their Verdict to
the contrary.</hi> And in another place of the ſame laſt mentioned Libel
amongſt other things it is further contained as follows; <hi>And it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
material, if the Coroner would declare what he received for that Job, and of
whom; and what Evidence he had to induce the Jury to find (as the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
imports) that he was ſtrangled with a Linnen cloth, a matter of fact
never ſo much as ſpoken of until you came in with your Evidence, which was
not in ſome weeks after; And I do again averr, that the Body was required
by the Jury to be opened, and was refuſed; and if the Body was in their and
the Coroner's power (as the Ghoſt inſinuates) ſuch power was concealed from
and denied the Jury.</hi> And in another place of the ſame laſt mentioned Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
it is amongſt other things contained as follows: <hi>He is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that Mr.</hi> Brown, <hi>the two Chirurgions, (meaning the ſaid</hi> Zachary
Skillarne <hi>and</hi> Nicholas Cambridge) <hi>and Mrs.</hi> Curtis <hi>are no competent
(nor can be material) Witneſſes in this Caſe.</hi> And in another place of
the ſame laſt mentioned Libel, it is further contained as follows; <hi>But Mr.</hi>
Prance, <hi>it will be fully proved that the Body was full of Blood, and that there was
Cakes or Gobbets of dry Blood found in his Cloaths, which with his Body ſtunk
extreamly: And it will be alſo fully and effectually proved that his Eyes,
Noſtrils and Corners of his Mouth were Fly-blown.</hi> And in another place of
the ſame laſt mentioned Libel amongſt other things it is contained as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
<hi>And as to the ſeventh and laſt Paragraph, which relates only to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt you and Mr.</hi> Bedloe's <hi>Evidence, I muſt take notice that what
you and and he ſwears is very contradictory.:</hi> And in another place of
the ſame laſt mentioned Libel, amongſt other things it is further contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as follows, <hi>But I cannot omit to take further notice of Mr.</hi> Curtis's <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit,
in relation to the Wax found upon the Cloths, in which I cannot ſay,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65424:4"/>
but ſhe may ſwear true; but this I do averr, that if it be ſo, thoſe drops
were put upon the Cloths long after he was found. And after the Jury had ſet
on the body; for there was no ſuch thing then on the Cloths. And, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
this was ſome artifice uſed by thoſe, who either out of intereſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
were deſirous to comfirm his being murthered at Somerſet houſe.</hi> And
the ſaid Attorney General for the ſame Lord the King, gives the Court
here to underſtand and be informed: That the ſaid <hi>Nathaniel Thompſon,

but to prove every Tittle of that Letter, to the ſatisfaction of all mankind;
And beſides, he is very deſirous that the <hi>Courantier</hi> (according to his laſt <hi>Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi>
of Advice to <hi>Rome</hi>) would go on, and uſe his Intereſt, to procure the
Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen and Common Council of <hi>London,</hi> to inſpect
the Truth of that Letter; whereby it will appear inevitably, that there is not
one <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Popiſhly affected</hi> perſon concerned in that Letter, or in the proof

relating to the Murther of Sir <hi>E B Godfrey,</hi> and the <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Blind
put upon the world in relation thereto) will be more fully, plainly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly

                        <p>My Lord and you Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an
Information againſt <hi>Nathaniel Thompſon, William Pain</hi> and <hi>John Farwell,</hi>
and it is for writing and printing ſeveral Scandalous Libels about the
the Death of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey:</hi> In which we ſet forth, that <hi>Green
Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> were indicted for the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmondbury
Godfrey,</hi> and thereof convicted and attained, and that the ſaid <hi>Green,
Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> were executed for it; that upon their Tryal for that
Matter ſeveral Witneſſes were examined, namely Mr. <hi>Prance, Bedloe,
Curtis</hi> and ſeveral others to prove Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> murthered at
<hi>Somerſet-houſe;</hi> and before the Tryal there was an Inqueſt taken by the
Coroner of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> by which it does appear, that Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey</hi> was murthered by ſeveral Perſons unknown, and that the
Defendants to reflect upon the Juſtice of the Nation, and ſcandalize
the Witneſſes produced at that Tryal, and to make it believed that
theſe Perſons died Wrongfully, did write and print ſeveral ſcandalous
Libels and Letters, one of them intituled a Letter to <hi>Miles Prance</hi>
concerning the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and in theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
did ſuggeſt as if he had been <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> and do reflect upon every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65424:5"/>
one of the Witneſſes, as if they had contradicted
themſelves, and alſo do reflect upon the Coroner as
though he had bribed the Jury, and do undertake
by theſe Arguments and ſeveral others (that you will
hear) to prove that Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> murthered
himſelf; And that in another Libel that <hi>Thompſon</hi>
printed called his Loyal, Proteſtant Intelligence, he
ſays he will make it out by a Cloud of Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
This we ſay is againſt the Peace of the King,
and defaming of the Juſtice of the Nation: If we
prove this matter upon them, you are to find them
Guilty.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Maynard.</hi>
                        </speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, The matter which
you have now before you, is as impudent a thing
as ever was done. Gentlemen, Sir <hi>Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
was murthered, and <hi>Green</hi> and the Contrivers of
it have been executed for it; the matter hath paſſed
the Examination of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the King
and Council and all; Now this <hi>Thompſon</hi> is a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
I may as well ſay a Printer of Libels, for he
does conſtantly print Libels againſt the Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and the Juſtice of the Nation; The Jury
that were impannelled upon the Coroners Inqueſt, he
ſays of them that they at firſt did agree that he
murthered himſelf, and afterwards did return and
find that he was murthered by others: Gentlemen
'tis plain that he was murthered by others, and the
particular perſons have been tryed for it and found
guilty. Now this perſon after all this, what does he
do? He takes upon him to write a Letter to <hi>Prance;
(Prance</hi> was one of the Witneſſes in that Caſe) he writes
it by the name of a Letter, but it is a foul and wicked
Libel; and therein ('tis too long for me to mention
the particulars) he ſcandalizes the publick Juſtice of the
Nation, he undertakes to vindicate the Murderers, and
to accuſe the proceedings of the Nation. But Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
we will prove theſe Men guilty of framing and
publiſhing of theſe wicked Libels, and that is all that is
needful to be done upon the point of Evidence. We will
call our Witneſſes.</p>

Then Mr. <hi>Clare</hi> was ſworn, and produced a Copy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

LETTER
TO
Mr. MILES PRANCE, in Relation to
the Murther of Sir EDMOND-B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY

                           <opener>
                              <salute>Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi>
                              </salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>PErceiving by ſome late Pamphlets ſeveral Rumors rais'd, as if there
were endeavours us'd to aſperſe your <hi>Evidence</hi> in Relation to the
Death of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> and to lay that Murther upon Himſelf.
And remembring the <hi>Conſternation</hi> which then was in all peoples minds by
the diſcovery at that time of a Dreadful and moſt Horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi>
which occaſion'd divers to report, and moſt to believe (even ſeveral days
before the dead Body was found) <hi>That he was Murder'd</hi> by <hi>the</hi> Papiſts <hi>at</hi>
Somerſet-houſe. And hearing that the <hi>Coroners Jury</hi> or <hi>Inqueſt</hi> were
firſt of Opinion, and accordinly declar'd he was <hi>Felo de Se;</hi> And that
there was much Art and Skill us'd to procure their <hi>Verdict</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
More particularly, the refuſing of the Body (at their Inſtance
and requeſt) to be opened; and oppoſing the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Coroner</hi>
of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (who is taken notice of to be a Knowing and Impartial
Man in the Execution of his Office;) who was deſir'd to, and did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for that purpoſe, but was diſmiſt with a <hi>Guiney;</hi> telling him, they
had no need of his Service. I made it my buſineſs, partly for Yours,
but chiefly for the Truths ſake, to make a ſtrict Enquiry into the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cauſes of the aforeſaid Rumours, and do find theſe particulars very
much urg'd, and diſcours'd of, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I. In oppſition to the Evidence of his being dog'd up and down,
and lodg'd in a great Houſe at St. <hi>Clements</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 12. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1678. (being the day he was firſt miſſing.) It is affirm'd he went out
of his Houſe that very <hi>Saturday</hi> morning about nine a Clock; (which
is the laſt time he ever returned thither;) And about 10 that Forenoon
was in the Fields walking towards <hi>Marybone,</hi> (in which Pariſh his dead
Corps was afterwards found,) And was there met by a Brewer in St.
<hi>Giles</hi>'s, who diſcourſed with him; And about a 11 of the ſame day he
was ſeen paſſing by the Lady <hi>Cooks</hi> Lodgings near the <hi>Cock-pit;</hi> After
which, he was ſeen in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> went by the Church, and down
<hi>Church-lane</hi> into the <hi>Strand;</hi> About 1 paſſed by the door of one Mr. <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi>
an <hi>Oyl-man</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> And ſoon after was met in the back Court
of <hi>Lincolns-Inne</hi> by two Gentlemen, who obſerved him to make a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
turn, and to go out at the back door; They went out at that door
alſo, and did ſee him turn the corner Wall; between which place and
<hi>Turn Stile,</hi> he was met by a Barriſter at Law; And that a perſon living
near <hi>Primroſe-Hill,</hi> declared before divers perſons, that he ſaw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65424:7"/>
3 that <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon walking in thoſe Fields, his uſual
Walk being that way.</p>
                           <p>II. They ſay, the place where, and the poſture wherein he was found,
are very remarkable. As to the place; It was in a Ditch on the South
ſide of <hi>Primroſe-Hill,</hi> ſurrounded with divers <hi>Cloſes,</hi> Fenced with high
Mounds and Ditches, no Road near, only ſome deep dirty Lanes made
only for the conveniency for driving <hi>Cows</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Cattle</hi> in and out
of the Grounds; And thoſe very Lanes not coming near 500 yards of
the place, and impoſſible for any Man on Horſe-back with a <hi>Dead
Corps</hi> before him at Midnight to approach, unleſs Gaps were made i'th
Mounds, as the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and his Aſſiſtants found by Experience when
they came on Horſeback thither. As to the poſture, his Breaſt was Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buttoned,
his Waſtcoat and Shirt put by, his Sword run in under his left
Pap next his Skin, the Point coming out at his right Shoulder about ſix
Inches, his left Arm doubled under him, (on which his Head ſeemed to
lean,) and his right Arm ſtiff, ſtretcht out upon the Bank, his Belly and
Breaſt being ſupported by the ſide of the Bank, his Knees knit together,
and with his Hips a little bending or doubling under him.</p>
                           <p>And they infer from thence, that he being a tall raw bon'd Man, (after
he had been ſeveral daies dead,) could never be crooked ſo as to be cram'd
into a <hi>Sedan,</hi> (which are very low built, and difficult to be carried with
proper Braces, much more as You Evidenced with <hi>Cords)</hi> then ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and his Legs opened, and mounted on Horſe-back, and then put
into the poſture he was found in, and ſtiffened again.</p>
                           <p>III. Now altho the Matters aforeſaid may be ſaid to be only <hi>circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi>
Yet they produce undeniable Arguments againſt your Evidence, <hi>(viz.)
They ſay, that if a Man, or any other Creature be Strangled, or Hanged,
and his Body cold, and the Blood ſettled in the Veins,</hi> (as he muſt needs be
if Your <hi>Evidence</hi> be true,) <hi>run 20 Swords through ſuch a Body, not one drop
of blood will come out:</hi> But on the contrary, his Body when found, was
full of Blood, inſomuch, that (over and above the <hi>Cakes</hi> or great Goblets
of congealed putrified Blood found afterwards in his <hi>Cloaths)</hi> the <hi>Conſtable</hi>
when he pulled the Sword out of his Body, it craſhed againſt his Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
and Gobbets of Blood and Water guſhed or gubbled out of that
Wound in abundance, not only in that very place where the Sword was
pulled out, but in all his paſſage to the <hi>White-houſe,</hi> eſpecially there where
his Body was lifted over two high Stumps; and alſo when he was laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table, the Blood and Water ſo iſſued out of that wound, that it
ran from off the Table upon the Floor, and from thence into the Cellar;
So that they do aver that that wound that he received by that Sword
muſt of neceſſity be the cauſe of his Death. And they take notice, that ſo
much of the Sword as was in his Body, was diſcoloured and blackiſh; and
that part that came out at his back was of a dulliſh colour, and the Point
thereof was ruſty; Alſo, that the <hi>Cloaths, Belt</hi> and <hi>cabbard</hi> were weather-beaten
to rags; his body ſtunk extremely; his Eyes, Noſtrils, and corners
of his Mouth were Fly-blown; all which muſt naturally be by his being
ſo long in the Air.</p>
                           <p>IV. They ſay, <hi>That when a Man is Strangled or Hanged, his Eyes will
be extorted, his Face will be ſwelled and black;</hi> Whereas his Eyes were
ſhut, his Face was pale, only the left part of his Chin, with his breaſt and
belly being next the Earth, were putrified, and looked of a blue and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
colour, more eſpecially about the wound; For that the blood, when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65424:8"/>
hot, running to the wound, cauſed the greater putrefaction in that place;
whenas, if the wound had been made after he was Dead, and Cold, the
reſt of his body would have putrified as ſoon, and as much as there.</p>
                           <p>V. <hi>They ſay,</hi> That the cleanneſs of his Shoes makes againſt Your Evidence;
For his Shoes were cleaned or rather glazed on the very bottoms of the Soles,
occaſioned by his walking in the Graſs, and Graſs-ſeeds were obſerved to ſtick
in the Seams of his Shoes; And beſides, there was not one ſpeck of Dirt on his
Cloaths, or Legs, not ſo much as a Horſe-hair ſticking thereon; <hi>Whereas,
the</hi> Conſtable, <hi>and thoſe that went with him, were dirty'd and moil'd
up to the very Saddle-skirts, and not eaſily to be cleaned; And Mr.</hi>
Prance, <hi>you know that a tall</hi> Dead Man <hi>on Horſe-back, cannot lift up his
Legs to ſave them from the Dirt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>VI. As to the looſeneſs of his Neck, and the Rim or green Circle about
it, they ſay they are Ridiculous and Impertinent Arguments againſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Demonſtrative ones; eſpecially, when there is not a <hi>Nurſe,</hi> or any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Age, that hath buried any Relations, but will tell you it's very
common for people to die with Necks as looſe as his was. And the Rim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Neck was ſo far from being like one made with a <hi>Cravat</hi> or <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief,</hi>
that it ſeems to be occaſioned by the great height and ſtifneſs of
his <hi>Collar,</hi> which was faſt Buttoned about his Neck, and on which his
Head reſted, and was unbuttoned about 10 of the Clock the next day,
before the <hi>Coroner</hi> or <hi>Jury</hi> came. But if that Rim, or thoſe Bruiſes, that
Your Evidence ſeems to make the cauſe of his Death, were really ſo; Then
they alledge, that in ſuch caſe, the whole Maſs of Blood would have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
there, and his Neck and bruiſes would have ſwelled, and have been
perfect black, which was not in His Caſe.</p>
                           <p>VII. They alſo ſay, That all theſe Matters are Notorious, and will be
proved by divers credible and undeniable Eye and Ear Witneſſes; And
beſides, They obſerve, that <hi>Bedlow's</hi> (before the <hi>Committee of Lords,)</hi>
and Your <hi>Evidence</hi> in Relation to this Gentlemans Death, are as different
as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from the <hi>Weſt;</hi> For you Dogg him out of St. <hi>Clements;</hi> the
other decoys him from <hi>Charing-Croſs:</hi> You Swear he was Strangled with
a Handkerchief near the Stables going to the Water-ſide; <hi>Bedlow,</hi> that he
was Smothered with a <hi>Pillow</hi> in a Room in the great <hi>Court</hi> in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi>
You ſay he took Horſe at <hi>So-ho; Bedlow</hi> ſays he took <hi>Coach</hi> at <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renden-Houſe,</hi>
with many more ſuch like <hi>Contradictions;</hi> And conſidering
the Old Proverb, <hi>fore-warn'd, fore-arm'd.</hi> A further and fuller account
of the whole matter expect, I being loath at preſent to exceed the bounds
of a Letter, I am,</p>

according to the method of my former Letter, I ſhall proceed by
theſe Heads.</p>
                           <p>And firſt, not underſtanding what the Ghoſt means, by arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Juſtice of the Nation, unleſs he would aſſert that all that are
legally, (are likewiſe juſtly hanged;) and ſo conſequently, that the
Mother and her two Sons were juſtly hanged in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> for
the Murder of the Lady Viſcounteſs <hi>Campden</hi>'s Steward, though he
afterwards appeared alive; And I do not find that ever his appearance
arraign'd the Juſtice of the Nation. And remitting the conſideration
of Mr. <hi>Browns,</hi> the Chyrurgions, and Mrs. <hi>Curtis</hi>'s Evidence in relation
to the Blood, to its proper place; and affirming, (as the truth is,) that
Mrs. <hi>celliers,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mary Gibbon,</hi> the <hi>Newgate</hi> Prieſts, <hi>James Magragh,</hi> and
all other <hi>Iriſh</hi> men, or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidences, or other Papiſt or Papiſts, or
Popiſhly affected perſons whatſoever; as alſo thoſe concerned in the
late Sham of his having hang'd himſelf, are ſtrangers to, and had
not the leaſt knowledg or intimation of the Contents of my ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Letter, nor any way concerned therein, or in or with any part
thereof; (as the ſaid Ghoſt moſt falſly and maliciouſly inſinuates.) I
take notice that the ſaid Ghoſt ſeems to admit ſo much of the Truth
of the ſaid Letter, as that it was reported divers dayes before the dead
Body was found, that he was murdered in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and which report was made even the next morning after he was
miſſing, (being Sunday 13 <hi>Octob.</hi> 1678.) Now I would fain have this
Ghoſt to inform the World who firſt raiſed that Report: But as to Mr.
<hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Letter of it, I cannot give it any better Anſwer, than that
as his Evidence hath ſince been disbelieved in matters of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
ſo he not producing any ſuch Letter, you muſt give me
leave alſo to ſuſpect him in this. But as to the other Evidences of
Mr. <hi>Birch</hi> and the reſt. Theirs I believe to be very true; for it's no
miracle that a Report ſo cunningly raiſed, (without any ground) might
as induſtriouſly be promulged to moſt parts of the Kingdom before
the reſpective days they ſpeak of, eſpecially when the Plot had filled
all mens heads with Fears and Jealouſies, without which it had not
been in the power or art of the Ghoſt, or any of his Tribe, to have
ſuggeſted the leaſt Surmiſe to contradict his being <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Next, whereas my Letter ſaith, (and that truly) that the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
Jury were firſt of opinion, and accordingly declared, he was
<hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and that much Art and Skill was uſed to procure their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65424:9"/>
Verdict to the contrary. This Ghoſt, inſtead of contradicting that
Truth, would inſinuate, as if that Letter reflected upon the Reputation
of the Jurors, when as there was no ſuch thing imployed or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they being known to be honeſt men, of good Reputation, and
free from Fraud or Guile, and conſequently the eaſier to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached,
by the Cunning of thoſe and that Party, whoſe intereſt it
was to deceive them, and who never leave any ſtone unturned to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their deſignes. And I cannot but obſerve how skilful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
theſe People ſtill are, to hide and prevent the truth of that
man's Death from clearly appearing and ſhining forth, as without
doubt it would, and muſt do, was not the matter now (as formerly)
puzled with Legends, and long Stories, nothing to the purpoſe. And
as to the Coroner's Warrant for burying the Body, and recited in
the Ghoſt, it's Notorious they are common Tricks, uſed by men of
his Profeſſion, who (if any money is like to come) will uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
the Jury, and then make ſuch Warrants, (they knowing, that
if the Verdict be <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> it's then out of their power to give
leave to bury the Corps.) And it would be very material, if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner
would declare what he received for that Jobb, and of whom,
and what Evidence he had to induce the Jury to find (as the
Inquiſition imports) that he was ſtrangled with a Linen Cloth, a
matter of Fact never ſo much as ſpoken of, until You came in
with your Evidence, which was not in ſome weeks after. And
I do again aver, That the Body was required by the Jurors to be
opened, and was refuſed; and if the Body was in their and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner's
power, (as the Ghoſt inſinuates) ſuch power was concealed
from, and denied the Jury. And it's very probable the Coroner of
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi>'s aſſiſtance was refuſed, for ſome ſuch indirect doings,
for that there was not the leaſt difference betwixt the Coroners in
relation to their Juriſdictions; and the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Coroner came not Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
of himſelf, but was importuned to be there by Mr. <hi>Wigg,</hi> and
divers others of the chief Inhabitants of St. <hi>Martyn</hi>'s Pariſh. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
the Reverend Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> (who Preached the Funeral Sermon)
ſpoken to the Coroner of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> before he went, ſo that it had
been proper to have given the matters mentioned in that Sermon in
evidence before the Jury. And it's obſervable, the Perſon mentioned
to give the Information to the Doctor of the two wounds in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and that two hours before it was found, was never produced;
For if he had, and that Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> had been murthered, ſuch perſon
might have been ſecured, and thereby the Murderers detected. But I
ſuppoſe the Ghoſt will not pretend either that Sermon, or the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
printed by <hi>Nat. Thompſon</hi> to be legal, or (indeed) any Evidence
at all.</p>
                           <p>And now Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> being come to the ſeveral Paragraphs of my
Letter, I ſhall take them in order as they are placed, and give the
Ghoſt particular Anſwers accordingly.</p>
                           <p>I.
As to Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>'s Perambulations therein mentioned to be on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65424:9"/>
the <hi>Saturday</hi> he was firſt miſſing, they are true in every particular;
and will be proved by divers able, credible and undeniable Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And how vain it is for the Ghoſt to ask, Why theſe Witneſſes
did not come in ſooner at the Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> do you
judge, when all the World remembers the great Torrent that carried
all before it in favour of the Plot, and the murder of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>
by the Papiſts, without which (as <hi>T. O.</hi> was heard to ſay) his Plot
had failed; And when it is duly conſidered, that the two perſons
that firſt found the Body, (for no other cauſe) ſuffered much in their
Perſons and Eſtates, by a long and chargeable Impriſonment. And
all others that then ſeemed to doubt of the truth of that mans being
murdered by the Papiſts, were ſtigmatized with the odious Names
of Papiſts, and Diſcouragers (if not promoters) of the Plot; It will
appear no wonder, if people were unwilling to diſcover their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
or to come voluntarily (without proceſs) to give their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And how can it be imagined thoſe three unfortunate men,
being kept cloſe Priſoners, could make enquiry after proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
or (againſt the common Vogue) draw into ſuſpition the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
of his being murdered by the Papiſts.</p>
                           <p>II.
The Ghoſt hath ſo much ingenuity to grant the 2d. Paragraph
of my Letter, as to the place and poſture he was found in, but would
avoid the inacceſſableneſs of the place, pretending a Lane near, when
as that Lane is, in effect, unpaſſable, with two on a Horſe, and
comes not within 500 yards of the place, and the Mounds thither
very high, and the Conſtable and his Aſſiſtants, (though they lived
in the Pariſh, and well knew the way) were forced to break a Gap
in the Mounds, though they were ſingly Hors'd. And whereas the
Ghoſt alledges, That you do not depoſe he was carried to the place
wholly on Horſeback, he hath run himſelf into a worſe Dilemma,
having made no proviſion of men (either as to ſtrength or number)
to carry ſo great and weighty a Corps, in the dead of the Night, over
ſuch Mounds and Fences; but let all inquiſitive People, deſirous of
Truth, take the pains but to go to the Place (and that without any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
on their backs) they will ſoon be convinced of the Aſſertion of the
difficulty (if not impoſſibility) of the bringing a Dead Corps thither,
either on Foot or on Horſeback. And the Pretenſions of the Ghoſt's, as to
the limberneſs of the Body and Joynts, does not anſwer that part of
my Letter which relates to the impoſſibility of his being put into a
<hi>Sedan.</hi> For his Body, when found, was ſtiff; ſo that what limber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
happened or appeared afterwards, hath no relation to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For it's a certain Maxim, a dead limber Body cannot be ſtiff'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And pray Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> give us an account what became of the
<hi>Sedan,</hi> and the Cords? and how you could carry it with Cords;
for the meaneſt Sedan-man in Town will tell you it is impracticable,
or rather impoſſible; And you may, if you pleaſe, make an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with a Cord.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65424:10"/>
III.
As to the Body being full of Blood, when found; the Ghoſt
endeavours to diſprove that Aſſertion, by the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>
the Conſtable, the two Chyrurgeons and Mrs. <hi>Curtiſs,</hi> and produceth
the Evidence given at the Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> and an
extrajudicial Affidavit ſince made by Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> and another by Mrs.
<hi>Curtiſs,</hi> to countenance ſuch his denyal. But, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> (when
you ſee the Ghoſt) tell him the matter of the Blood will (and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you and all the World it will) be proved by divers credible and
undeniable Evidence; And that I may pacifie the Ghoſt in the mean
time, he is to underſtand that Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> the two Chyrurgions, and
Mrs. <hi>Curtiſs,</hi> are no competent (nor can be material) Witneſſes in
this caſe. For Mr. <hi>Brown;</hi> as he did a raſh and unaccountable act
(to give it no worſe name) in removing the Body before the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Jury ſaw it, (which hath occaſion'd all this deſpute); ſo he
muſt not think to help himſelf by Affidavits, or to juſtify one Ill Act
by another; And beſides, as he unadviſedly (and contrary to all Law
and Practice) removed the Body before the Coroner and Jury came;
ſo he did the ſame in the dark, (about Eight a clock at night) when
the Candle was blown out; whereby it was impoſſible for him to look
for any Blood, ſo as to find it; And neither he or the Chyrurgeons (by
any day-light) ſaw the Place where the Body was found, or where the
Sword was pulled out, until after 10 a Clock the next day, before which
time much of the Blood was taken up, and the reſt trampl'd out of ſight
by the great concourſe of the People which came thither. And as for Mrs.
<hi>Curtiſs,</hi> ſhe only ſaw the Body after it was brought home, when as the
Body was ſtript at the <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> and a Blanket borrow'd there to
wrap the Body in. So the World may judge of the Truth of her
Affidavit. (But Mr. <hi>Prance)</hi> it will be fully proved, that the Body was
full of Blood; and that there were Cakes or Gobbets of dry Blood
found in his Cloaths, which (with his Body) ſtunk extremely.
And it will be alſo fully and effectually proved, that his Eyes, Noſtrills,
and Corners of his Mouth, were Fly-blown; tho the Ghoſt (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt colour of reaſon) pretends it to be contrary to Nature
and Reaſon; when as common experience daily evinces the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And I do obſerve, that the Ghoſt omits to take notice of Two
material Circumſtances in this 3 <hi>d.</hi> Paragraph. <hi>(viz.)</hi> The firſt as to
the Swords craſhing againſt the Back-bone: The ſecond, as to that
part of the Sword which was in his Body being diſcoloured. And
pray, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> do You (or the Ghoſt) give the Reaſons thereof,
and of its point being ruſty; As alſo, what was, or could be the
cauſe of the Spots in the Shirt, Waſtcoat and Drawers, of Greeniſh
Colour, mentioned in Mrs. <hi>Curtiſſes</hi> Affidavit.</p>
                           <p>IV.
As to the <hi>4th.</hi> Paragraph of my Letter, I perceive the Ghoſt
admits, that when a man is Strangled or Hanged, his Eyes will be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65424:10"/>
extorted; and admits that Sir. <hi>E. B. Godfrey's</hi> Eyes (when found)
were ſhut; only he ſeems to quarrel with the colour of his Face;
And, ſeeing he admits his Face not black (as all Hanged mens are,
when cold) I care not to conteſt, whether his Face was Pale or Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or a little Swell'd, or not, thoſe being very inconſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
But his denying the putrefaction charged in that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
and the conſequences deduced from thence, is not only a great
untruth, but is directly oppoſite to the evidence given by Mr. <hi>Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard,</hi>
at the Tryal before mentioned. <hi>Page</hi> 37. 38.</p>
                           <p>V.
As to the <hi>5th.</hi> Paragraph; the Ghoſt is ſo far from anſwering
the Aſſertions therein, as that he only quibbles at words; and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Queſtion; deduces thence impertinent and ridiculous Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For it will be proved, that his Shoes were glazed at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Soles, and which muſt of neceſſity be occaſioned by his
walking on the Graſs. And (Mr. <hi>Prance)</hi> if you and the Ghoſt will
walk thither, you will eaſily experience it, and ſo may any body elſe
ſatiſfie himſelf in this ſpeculation; As alſo, as to the graſs-ſeeds that
ſtuck in the ſeams of his Shoes; which is ſo far from being impoſſible
at that time of the year, (as the Ghoſt would argue) as that it will be
proved by undeniable Evidence. But (Mr. <hi>Prance,)</hi> pray ask the
Ghoſt how he came there without a ſpeck of Dirt; and who pick'd
the Horſe-hairs off his cloaths; and let him contrive (if he can) a
probable or rational way for a Dead man on Horſe-back, to hold
up his Legs, or to ſave them or his cloaths from the dirt: For though
a man may walk thither very clean, yet it's impoſſible at that time
of the year to ride, either without being dirtied, and ſome Horſe
hairs ſticking on his Cloaths: But perhaps the next account from the
Ghoſt will be, that he either rid with Gambadoes, or elſe a pair of
Fiſher-mens Boots.</p>
                           <p>VI.
As to the <hi>6th.</hi> Paragraph, Pray Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> tell the Ghoſt, his
railing againſt Popiſh Nurſes, and Popiſh Midwives, is no anſwer to
the Aſſertions in that Paragraph: for all the women in the Town are
competent Judges thereof, and I hope the Ghoſt will not ſay they
are all Papiſts. But pray tell the Ghoſt he takes no notice of the
height of the Collar, and its being faſt button'd about his Neck when
found. Nor the concluſion of that Paragraph; and therefore I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he admits it to be all true.</p>
                           <p>VII.
And as to the <hi>7th.</hi> and laſt Paragraph, which relates only to
the difference betwixt Yours, and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Evidence; I muſt
take notice, that what you and he ſwear, are very contradictory,
and much more than I hinted in my ſaid Letter: And though part
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65424:11"/>
of it be as He and you were informed, yet you and he ſwear the
Informations were received from the Perſons actually concerned in
the Murder, and who had confidence enough in Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> (though
he refuſed <hi>4000l.</hi> to help to kill him, and <hi>2000l.</hi> to help carry him
away,) as to ſhew him the Dead Body, and ſo were under no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of miſ-informing either him or your ſelf. And pray Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi>
will you let the World know what reward you were to have for
that Job: For certainly you deſerved as much as Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more, you having a Wife and Children, and he a Batchelor.</p>
                           <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> having gone through each Paragraph of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and anſwered the Ghoſt to your ſatisfaction; I ſhould leave here,
fearing I have been too tedious already: But I cannot omit to take
further notice of Mrs. <hi>Curtis</hi>'s Affidavit, in relation to the drops of
Wax found upon the Cloaths, in which I cannot ſay but ſhe may
ſwear true; but this I do aver, that if it be ſo, thoſe drops were put
upon the Cloaths long after he was found, and after the Jury had
ſat on the Body; for there was no ſuch thing then on the Cloaths:
And I ſuppoſe this was ſome Artifice uſed by thoſe, who, either out
of Intereſt or Deſign, were deſirous to confirm his being murthered
at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> and to carry on the great lie, and impertinent ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then invented, and given out (amongſt others) that he was laid
under the High-Altar there; And if my Information fail not, there
were other ſuch like tricks uſed, which I ſhall make bold to acquaint
thoſe more nearly concerned therein, than your ſelf; and ſhall give
them to underſtand, that it's no wonder a Man in Sir <hi>E. B. G</hi>'s cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
ſhould kill himſelf, ſuch accidents being no News to that
Family, wherein Melancholly and Diſtraction (that often produces
ſuch effects) hath been predominant, and might occaſion the words
he ſpake to Sir. <hi>Tho. Robinſon,</hi> as to his being the firſt Martyr.</p>
                           <p>And now, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> for a Concluſion, If you were guilty of
the murder of Sir. <hi>E. B. G.</hi> how durſt you (as you did) on the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
after he was found, go to <hi>Primroſe-Hill</hi> to ſee the Body, and not
be afraid it ſhould at your approach have bled afreſh? And how
came you (after <hi>Green, Bury,</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> were hanged,) to declare in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a ſolemn queſtion, that you knew nothing of the death of
Sir. <hi>E. B. G.</hi> Pray remember me to your old Friend and Lodger
Mr. <hi>Renn,</hi> my reſpects alſo to your Wife, not forgetting your
little Daughter, who gave you ſo good advice before you took your
Journey into <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and help'd to take <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> who
was bury'd 14. Months.</p>

it was a raſh unadviſed Act; but not out of any Malice: My Lord,
we will prove that <hi>Paine</hi> was not a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor any of his Family.
My Lord, this cannot juſtify or excuſe them, it will only extenuate
their Fault. We will call ſome Witneſſes.</p>

a day or two before, and I came to get the houſe covered up, and
to take Order with my Partner: and as I went, there was a Report,
that Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi> was found and laid up in the <hi>White-houſe,</hi>
and when I came, the Coroner and the Jury were there, and I got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Room where Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi> lay upon the Table and
took his Hatt off; and I ſaw two Wounds within an Inch and an half
one of another, one went no further then his Bone, and the other
went through his back. And my Lord, immediately there was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
come down from the Coroner, to get him ſtripp'd. They ask'd me
if I would give an hand, and I told them yes. I pull'd off his Shoes and
they were clean, and I pulled off three pair of Stockings and a pair of
Socks, his black Breeches and his Dravvers, and they came off very
well. There was a man in the Company, that deſired to help, ſo I
got upon the Table, and ſet him upright with his breach upon
the Table and his Feet hanging down, we unbuttoned his Coat,
and pull'd it off, I came to his <hi>Flannel</hi>-Shirt, and when I come to his
Back there vvas blood. But I did not ſee any Blood till I came to his
back-part. About his Throat there vvas ſomthing that had girt him.</p>

the right. The other went into the body. I troubled my ſelf
no more at that time, but the nex day I was deſired by Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> that I
would go to his Houſe and ſee the body again, and there <hi>I</hi> found a ſelling
upon the left Eare as if a knot had been tyed, there I found him beaten
from this place to this (pointing to the Neck and Stomack) I never ſaw
any man beaten ſo in my life. Before this buſineſs was broached Mr.

People that are hanged &amp; let down while warme, the blood draines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the Veſſels that are broaken, and their Faces are rather leſs,
and their Faces become very pale; but the thing Wherewith he was
ſtrangled remaining about his Neck, the blood could not draine
away, but it made his Face look bloody. The two <hi>Mr. Chaſes,</hi> the Kings
Apothecary was there when <hi>I</hi> was there, and the blood that was ſome
four Yards from the Ditch, <hi>I</hi> put my finger in it, and ſmelt to it and it
ſmelt like that which comes from a body after a ſortnights time dead,
rather then a weeks; my Lord, it was blood and water. The water will
ſeperate from the blood.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen you hear he hath been able to make
no defence for himſelf, but for the ſatisfaction of the World, my Lord,
hath taken great pains in hearing him. <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeak but very fevv
vvords, and call a Witneſs or tvvo, of ſome nevv matter; that if it be
poſſible to covince him vve vvill do it. We need not do it becauſe his
ovvn Witneſſes tell you of the ſeveral bruiſes and Wounds he had, that
there vvas no fly-blovvs, no putrified matter. Hovv can a man that Stabbs
him ſef, bruiſe and beat himſelf in the manner that you have heard.
There is never a Witneſs that hath ſpoken on his ſide, but hath ſpoken
againſt him, to prove himſelf as malicious a fellovv as can be. What
had he to do vvith this? Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi> vvas murdered, Was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65424:15"/>
found, inquiry made after it, and proſecution thereupon, now comes
this fellow and permits ſeveral Arguments againſt it, every one of them
from matter of fact, that is falſe and yet publiſhes it to the World, that
he will prove it by 500 undeniable Witneſſes. We will now call ſome
Witneſſes to prove him as Wicked a lyer as lives. I ſay what had he
to do with it, only meer malice. He would have me ask him what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he is of. I ſhall not ask him, for I don't think he is of any, none
of any Religion can be ſo Wicked to own ſuch a thing. We ſhall deſire
the favour to call a Witneſs or two, to prove ſomthing more then hath
yet been proved in this Murder tho' there was Evidence enough up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Tryal to prove it.</p>

told ſo many Lies, and hath left the World to make uſe of it. And
hath brought Witneſſes to Colour this matter over, and in hopes to make
you believe the matter is true. But <hi>Mr. Farewell</hi> hath forgot himſelf,
his Paper is quite otherwiſe, for he hath argued upon it, and made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
that therefore Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi> murdered himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is guilty of the higheſt malice in the World. He tells a great
many falſities, and from thoſe falſities, hath inferred others. The Paper
is full of Arguments.</p>

he would in this Caſe, not hat <hi>I</hi> thought it material for if he
could have proved never ſo much, yet his malice had never been the leſs
to have gone and aſperſed the Government. What had he to do to
meddle with it? To what purpoſe ſhould he Write Books, concerning
the matters of Government to Traduce the Juſtice of the Nation?
The people had ſuffered as <hi>Malefactors,</hi> and what had he to do with it?
If they had ſuffered Innocently, he ought to have done no ſuch thing as
this is.</p>

                        <p>Tis nothing to this purpoſe to call any for the King,

have made but ſome probable Evidence that Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi>
killed himſelf, and <hi>I</hi> was deſirous to hear what they vvould ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But you hear vvhat a kind of Evidence it is, not a Witneſs he
hath called, but is as much againſt him as can be, and does evince it
plainly that the man vvas killed, and that he vvas killed by ſtrangling,
and ſo the Evidence vvas upon the Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry, and Hill.</hi> If
he could have raiſed a doubt about it, yet his Offence had not been miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated

                        <p>he was killed by ſtrangling. I muſt leave it with you Gentlemen, they
are all 3 in this miſchief, tis a Combination of them to affront the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Juſtice of the Nation, and what is the end of it, the end of it is to
make people believe there is no Popiſh Plot, but it is plain he was killed
by the Popiſh party; as <hi>Prance,</hi> upon his Evidence againſt <hi>Green,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
atteſted. But if they could have made it out that he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
all of them would have cryed out the Popiſh Plot was a ſham, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a thing raiſed by the Proteſtants againſt the Papiſts, and all
the Plot muſt have gone for nothing. Gentlemen, I do leave it to you,

                  <p>AS it hath been of late by many Learned Pens, made
appear, That the Papiſts do juſtifie and countenance,
nay, eſteem Meritorious, <hi>Rebellions, Murders,</hi> and
<hi>Maſſacres,</hi> againſt any Proteſtant Prince or People (whom
they reckon <hi>Hereticks)</hi> for the Advancement of their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
ſo 'tis as well known, that if thoſe <hi>Rebellions, Murders,</hi>
and <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> be Diſcovered, they can (if they ſhall think
them needful) have Diſpenſations to <hi>Forſwear, Lie, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi>
do any thing to make the world believe that they
are <hi>Innocent,</hi> or make <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves appear Guilty
of them. That there hath been a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> (and a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
one too) in <hi>England,</hi> for the Subverſion of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion,</hi> and <hi>Establiſhed Government,</hi> I think no man
doubts, only ſome perſons whoſe Intereſt it is, may deny.
And amongſt the ſeveral concurring Evidences of this <hi>Popiſh
Conſpiracy,</hi> the Murder of that worthy Gentleman and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
by that Party, hath not been the leaſt. That which
induced the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to this <hi>Murder,</hi> (as well as can be gueſſed
by thoſe who are Strangers to that Wicked Action) was
one or both of theſe Conſiderations; namely, the hopes of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65424:20"/>
finding and ſeizing the Examination of Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> about the
damnable <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> which he had taken, and uſed to carry
about with him, by which they thought to ſtifle the Plot:
Or elſe they thought, by this Murder, to affrighten all active
Magiſtrates from being Vigorous in the future Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and further proſecution of their <hi>Horrid Conſpiracy,</hi>
though (through God's providence) they have been very
much Diſappointed in both theſe Ends.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are ſo ſenſible how much this <hi>Murder</hi>
pinches them, that after the Conviction and Execution of
the perſons for that <hi>Murder,</hi> no diſcouragements or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
they incur (by affronting and arraigning the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Juſtice of the Kingdom) hath been able to Deter
them from impudent Attempts (impudent I may ſay, the
rather, becauſe done under a <hi>Proteſtant-Government)</hi> to
ſham off that <hi>Murder</hi> from themſelves, and making the
whole Proſecution to be only a Deſign and Contrivance
of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt them. Witneſs firſt, that noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sham of <hi>James Magrath</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man, who (being
aſſiſted by the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and
Mrs. <hi>Gibbon,</hi> and others) pretended there were thoſe that
could make it appear, and prove, That Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury-Godfrey</hi>
Hanged himſelf, and that one <hi>Moor,</hi> who was
Clerk to Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury-Godfrey</hi> Cut him down, finding
him Hanging. Which matter being Examined at the
Council Board, and appearing to their Honours to be
a falſe and malicious Contrivance, the ſaid <hi>Magrath</hi> was
diſmiſſed with Security for his Appearance, and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fell to the ground. But for the further Satisfaction
of the world (though I think no body did believe that
Idle Story) I ſhall here inſert Mr. <hi>Moors</hi> Affidavit.</p>

till about <hi>Nine</hi> of the Clock in the Forenoon: when the

Company were gone, he bade me help him on with his
Coat, which I did; and immediately he made me pull
it off again, and give him another Coat, which I did;
and then he girt his Sword about him, and went out from
his Houſe, which was the laſt time I ſaw him, till after
he was found Dead in the Fields, which was the <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following. The Conſtable of St. <hi>Giles in the Fields,</hi> and
ſeveral others with him, came to my Maſter's Houſe,
and told us, that Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury-Godfrey</hi> was found Dead,
and laid in a Ditch at <hi>Primroſe-Hill,</hi> and a Sword thruſt
through him; and ſaid, he had cauſed him to be carried
to the <hi>White-Houſe:</hi> This being late at Night, the next
Day my Maſters two Brothers, and Siſters, and my ſelf,
went thither; and then I ſaw him lye upon a Table in
the Houſe where the Conſtable had laid him, which was
the firſt time that I ſaw him, after he went out of his
own Houſe, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1678. And
then we brought him Home to his own Houſe; And as
I am Informed that there are ſeveral Scandalous <hi>Papers,</hi>

Yet, though this Matter had proved ſo unſucceſsful,
they could not be quiet, but muſt make one Experiment
more, and that is contrary to the former: For now they
Declare, that he <hi>made away</hi> himſelf (ſo far they agree with
<hi>Magrath)</hi> but it was by running his Sword through his
own Body. And <hi>Thompſon, Farewell,</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> are the
Men that are to Manage this <hi>New Invention;</hi> and they
Write and Print the Scandalous Letters and Libels you
find in their Trial: And leſt any one ſhould dare to
Queſtion the Truth of them, they boaſt, they can prove
their Aſſertions by <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Witneſſes. Every Body
thought the Murder ſufficiently proved upon the Trial of
<hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> and were amazed to hear ſuch a
Declaration, thinking it hardly poſſible for Men to be ſo
Impudent, publickly to declare, they had <hi>Five Hundred</hi>
Witneſſes to Prove a Matter, when they had not one,
as may be ſeen by their Trial; for every Witneſs made
againſt them; and further proved, that he was <hi>Murdered,</hi>
and that by <hi>Strangling.</hi> But for theſe Scandalous Libels,
they were brought before His Majeſties moſt Honourable
<hi>Privy Council,</hi> who (upon their owning thoſe Libels) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ordered the <hi>Attorny General</hi>
to Proſecute them; and accordingly you find by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he did; and they were Convicted, and have ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Judgment, and that Judgment hath been Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But though the Murder was clearly proved at the
Trial of <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill;</hi> and though after all theſe
Brags, that <hi>Thompſon, Farewell,</hi> and <hi>Paine,</hi> made, That
they could prove ſo much at their Trial, they could make

of Sir Edmond-berry Godfrey, &amp;c. (with Allowance.)
Printed by N. T. 1678.</head>
                              <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> the Eighteenth of this Inſtant, Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> the
Coroner of <hi>Middleſex impannell'd</hi> a Jury at the <hi>White-Houſe</hi>
to Enquire about the occaſion of the Death of the ſaid
Sir <hi>Edmond-berry:</hi> and two Chirurgions (having been firſt
Sworn) removed the Body in the preſence of the Coroner
and Jury, and found the Wounds about it, which one of the
Chirurgions ſearched with his <hi>Probe,</hi> and found one of them
not above an Inch deep, the <hi>Probe</hi> going againſt one of his
Ribs, but the other being a little below the left Pap, went
quite through the Body, his Face was of a freſh colour, tho' in
his Life time very pale, ſomewhat ſwelled, and a green Circle
about his Neck, as if he had been ſtrangled, his blood being ſetled
about his Throat, and the upper part of his Breaſt, the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions
having reviewed the Body, delivered their Judgments,
That the Wounds they found about him were not the Cauſe of his
Death; but that he was Suffocated before the Wounds were
made. And that which may fully perſuade any perſon of the Truth
hereof is, That there was not one drop of Blood to be found in the
place where he lay, nor the leaſt appearance of any ſuch thing,
tho' the Ditch was dry, and it might have been eaſily ſeen if there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65424:25"/>
had been any. Another thing was, that the very bottom of
the ſoles of his Shoes were as clean as if he had but juſt come
out of his own Chamber, which was an evident ſign that he
was carried thither.</p>
                              <p>A third thing very remarkable is, That one of the Jury Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that a Servant of his Mothers (who is owner of the
ground were the Body lay) with a Butcher and two Boys made
a very ſtrict and narrow ſearch in all parts of that ground for
a Calf that was miſſing upon <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, and at
that time there lay no dead Body, Belt, Gloves, Stick, or
other thing there.</p>
                              <p>And notwithſtanding he gives himſelf the Name of the <hi>Loyal
Proteſtant Printer,</hi> this is not the firſt time he hath been charged
wlth Printing <hi>Popiſh. Books,</hi> (I take ſtill theſe Letters and Libels
to be a Limb of <hi>Popery)</hi> for <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the thirtieth of <hi>October,</hi>
1678. he was Committed to the Gatehouſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by
the Houſe of Lords for that very matter. As for <hi>Mr. Farewell,</hi>
he was mightily afraid he ſhould be taken for a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> Mr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<hi>Maynard</hi> declared he thought he was of no Religion: but
if he be, I know which is moſt like to juſtifie ſuch Practiſes. But
tho' I cannot ſay any thing as to his Religion, yet I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had a great kindneſs for him, for (not

that was Executed, and that I think will appear by the

                                 <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which the ſaid <hi>George Collingwood</hi> Ordered
me to deliver to Capt. <hi>Ralph Widdrington,</hi> upon the payment
of 100 <hi>l.</hi> but the money not being paid, I deſire the Writings
may be reſtored to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Collingwood,</hi> or his Heirs.</p>
                              <p>Theſe ſeveral Sums being paid, the reſt of the money belongs
to the Houſe of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> for which I was employed.</p>
                              <p>I deſire what money is paid in ſatisfaction of the Sums above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
may be paid into the hands of Mr. <hi>John Farwell,</hi> Attorney
at Law of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> who will take care to pay it to the
perſons to whom it belongs.</p>
                              <p>I hope care will be taken to pay my Landlady my Chamber-Rent
ſince my Impriſonment, alſo half a Year or three quarters
of a Years Rent, which I was owing at the time of my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
ſince all is taken from me and I cannot do it my ſelf,
ſhe will tell you exactly the time, for I cannot.</p>

As for Mr. <hi>Pain,</hi> I ſhall only ſay this, that he is brother to
<hi>Nevill</hi> alias <hi>Pain,</hi> a man famous for making the Traytor <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s
Elegy, and for being an Agent and Scribler for Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>
and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet that I may do him right, I muſt tell the
World ſince the proſecution of him for this matter, he hath
declared himſelf ſorry for what he hath done, and not carried
it ſo impudently as the others.</p>
                  <p>Thus I hope by Printing theſe Affidavits, the Murder of
Sir <hi>Edmond-berry Godfrey</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> does appear ſo clear
and unqueſtionable, that no Perſons (for the future) can aſſume
the impudence to attempt any further Shams upon it, but at
the ſame time muſt proclaim their Folly in ſo vain an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
                  <trailer>THE END.</trailer>
