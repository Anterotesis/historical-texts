            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Kings Declaration
DEFENDED.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE you are pleas'd to require my Opinion of
the Kings Declaration, and the Answer to it, which
you write me word was sent you lately, I shall obey
you the more willingly, because I know you are a
lover of the Peace and Quietness of your Country;
which the Author of this seditious Pamphlet, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to disturb. Be pleas'd to understand then,
that before the Declaration was yet published, and
while it was only the common news, that such an one there was intended,
to justifie the Dissolution of the two last Parliaments; it was generally
agreed by the heads of the discontented Party, that this Declaration must
be answer'd, and that with all the ingredients of malice which the ablest
amongst them could squeeze into it. Accordingly, upon the first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it in Print, five several Pens of their <hi>Cabal</hi> were set to work;
and the product of each having been examin'd, a certain person of Quality
appears to have carried the majority of Votes, and to be chosen like a new
<hi>Matthias,</hi> to succeed in the place of their deceas'd <hi>Iudas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He seems to be a man cut out to carry on vigorously the designs of the
Phanatique Party, which are manifestly in this Paper, to hinder the King,
from making any good impression on his Subjects, by giving them all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And the reason of this undertaking is manifest, for if once the goodness
and equity of the Prince comes to be truly understood by the People, the
Authority of the Faction is extinguish'd; and the well meaning crowd
who are misled, will no longer gape after the specious names of Religion
and Liberty; much like the folly of the <hi>Iews,</hi> expecting a <hi>Messiah</hi> still to
come, whose History has been written sixteen hundred years ago.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general: I will now consider the Cavils of my Author
against the Declaration.</p>
            <p>He tells us, in the first place, <hi>That the Declaration seems to him as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of another Parliament to be speedily call'd:</hi> And indeed to any man in
his right sences, it can seem no other; for 'tis the business of its three last
Paragraphs to inform the People, that no irregularities in Parliament can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48938:3"/>
make the King out of love with them: but that he looks upon them as
the best means for healing the distempers of the publick, and for preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Now if this seems clearly to be the Kings intention, I would ask what
need there was of the late Petition from the City, for another Parliament;
unless they had rather seem to extort it from his Majesty, than to have it
pass for his own gracious action? The truth is, there were many of the
Loyal Party absent at that Common Council: and the whole strength of
the other Faction was united; for it is the common failing of honest men
to trust too much in the goodness of their cause; and to manage it too
negligently. But there is a necessity incumbent on such as oppose the
establish'd Government, to make up with diligence, what they want in the
justice of their undertaking. This was the true and only reason why the
majority of Votes was for the Petition: but if the business had not been
carried by this surprise, My Lord Mayor might have only been troubled to
have carried the Addresses of <hi>Southwark,</hi> &amp;c. of another nature: without
his offering them with one hand, and the City Petition with the other; like
the Childrens play of, This Mill grinds Pepper and Spice; that Mill grinds
Ratts and Mice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place he informs us,</hi> That it has been long the practice of the
Popish and Arbitrary Party, that the King should call, frequent, short, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Parliaments, till the Gentry grown weary of the great expences of Elections,
should sit at home, and trouble themselves no more but leave the People
expos'd to the practices of them, and of their Party; who if they carry one
House of Commons for their turn, will make us Slaves and Papists by a Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> are words that sound high amongst the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
and all men are branded by those names, who are not for setting
up Fanaticism and a Common-wealth. To call short and useless Parliaments,
can be no intention of the Government; because from such means the
great end of Settlement cannot be expected. But no Physitian can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Physick to perform the effects for which he has prescrib'd it:
yet if it fail the first or second time, he will not in prudence lay aside his
Art, and despair of his Patient: but reiterate his Medicines till he effect
the cure. For, the King, as he declares himself, is not willing to have too
hard an Opinion of the Representatives of the Commons, but hopes that
time may open their eyes, and that their next meeting may perfect the
Settlement of Church and State. With what impudence can our Author
say, <hi>That an House of Commons can possibly be so pack'd, as to make us Slaves
and Papists by a Law?</hi> for my part I should as soon suspect they would
make themselves Arbitrary, which God forbid that any Englishman in his
right sences should believe. But this supposition of our Author, is to lay
a most scandalous imputation upon the Gentry of <hi>England;</hi> besides, what
it tacitly insinuates, that the House of Peers and his Majesty, (without
whom it could not pass into a Law,) would suffer it. Yet without such Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
as I said before, the Fanatique cause could not possibly subsist: fear
of Popery and Arbitrary power must be kept up; or the St. <hi>Georges</hi> of
their side, would have no Dragon to encounter; yet they will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
a reasonable man, that a King, who in his younger years, when he
had all the Temptations of power to pursue such a Design, yet attempted
it not should now, in the maturity of his Judgment, and when he sees the
manifest aversion of his Subjects to admit of such a change, undertake a
work of so much difficulty, destructive to the Monarchy, and ruinous to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48938:3"/>
Himself, if it succeeded not; and if it succeeded, not capable of making
him so truly Great as he is by Law already. If we add to this, his Majesties
natural love to Peace and Quiet, which increases in every man with his
years, this ridiculous supposition will vanish of it self; which is sufficiently
exploded by daily experiments to the contrary. For let the Reign of any of
our Kings be impartially examin'd, and there will be found in none of them
so many examples of Moderation, and keeping close to the Government
by Law, as in his. And instead of swelling the Regal power to a greater
height, we shall here find many gracious priviledges accorded to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
without any one advancement of Prerogative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing material in the Letter,</hi> is the questioning the legality of
the Declaration; which the Author sayes by the new style of <hi>his Majesty in
Council,</hi> is order'd to be read in all Churches and Chappels throughout <hi>England,</hi>
And which no doubt the blind obedience of our Clergy, will see carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
yet if it be true, that there is no Seal, nor Order of Council, but only
the Clerks hand to it, they may be call'd in question as publishers of false news,
and invectives against a third Estate of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Since he writes this only upon a supposition, it will be time enough to
answer it, when the supposition is made manifest in all its parts: In the
mean time, let him give me leave to suppose too, that in case it be true that
there be no Seal, yet since it is no Proclamation, but only a bare Declaration
of his Majesty, to inform and satisfie his Subjects, of the reasons which
induc'd him to dissolve the two last Parliaments, a Seal in this case, is not of
absolute necessity: for the King speaks not here as commanding any thing,
but the Printing, publishing and reading. And 'tis not denyed the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Englishman, to vindicate himself in Print, when he has any aspersion
cast upon him. This is manifestly the case, that the Enemies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
had endeavour'd to insinuate into the People such Principles,
as this Answerer now publishes: and therefore his Majesty, who is always
tender to preserve the affections of his Subjects, desir'd to lay before them
the necessary reasons, which induc'd him to so unpleasant a thing, as the
parting with two successive Parliaments. And if the Clergy obey him in
so just a Design, is this to be nam'd a blind Obedience! But I wonder why
our Author is so eager for the calling them to account as Accessaries to an
Invective against a third Estate of the Kingdom, while he himself is guilty
in almost every sentence of his discourse of aspersing the King, even in his
own Person, with all the Virulency and Gall imaginable. It appears plainly
that an House of Commons, is that <hi>Leviathan</hi> which he Adores: that is
his Sovereign in effect, and a third Estate is not only greater than the other
two, but than him who is presiding over the three.</p>
            <p>But, though our Author cannot get his own Seditious Pamphlet to be
read in Churches and in Chappels, I dare secure you, he introduces it into
Conventicles, and Coffee-houses of his Faction: besides, his sending it in
Post Letters, to infect the Populace of every County. 'Tis enough, that
this Declaration is evidently the Kings, and the only true exception, which
our Answerer has to it, is that he would deny his Majesty the power of
clearing his intentions to the People: and finds himself aggriev'd, that his
King should satisfie them in spight of himself and of his party.</p>
            <p>The next Paragraph is wholly spent, in giving us to understand, that a King,
of <hi>England</hi> is no other thing than a Duke of <hi>Venice;</hi> take the Parallell all
along: and you will find it true by only changing of the names. A Duke of
<hi>Venice</hi> can do no wrong; in Senate he can make no ill Laws; in Council
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48938:4"/>
no ill Orders, in the Treasury can dispose of no Money, but wisely, and
for the interest of the Government, and according to such proportions as
are every way requisite: if otherwise all Officers are answerable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Which is in effect, to say he can neither do wrong nor right, nor indeed any
thing, <hi>quatenus</hi> a King. This puts me in mind of <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Island of <hi>Barataria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when he was dispos'd to eat or drink,
his Physitian stood up for the People, and snatch'd the dish from him in
their right, because he was a publick person, and therefore the Nation must
be Judges to a dram and scruple what was necessary for the sustenance of
the Head of the Body politique. Oh, but there is a wicked thing call'd
the Militia in their way, and they shew'd they had a moneths mind to it,
at the first breaking out of the Popish Plot. If they could once persuade
his Majesty, to part graciously with that trifle, and with his power of
making War and Peace; and farther, to resign all Offices of Trust, to be
dispos'd by their nomination, their Argument would be an hundred times
more clear: for then it would be evident to all the World, that he could do
nothing. But if they can work him to part with none of these, then they
must content themselves to carry on their new Design beyond Seas: either
of ingaging the <hi>French</hi> King to fall upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> or encouraging the States
General to lay aside, or privately to cut off the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or getting
a War declared against <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> conjoyntly: for by that means,
either the King can be but a weak Enemy, and as they will manage matters,
he shall be kept so bare of Money, that Twelve <hi>Holland</hi> Ships shall block
up the River, or he shall be forc'd to cast himself upon a House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and to take Money upon their Terms, which will sure be as easie, as
those of an Usurer to an Heir in want. These are part of the projects now
afoot: and how Loyal and conscionable they are, let all indifferent persons
judge.</p>
            <p>In the close of this Paragraph, he falls upon the King for appealing to the
People against their own Representatives. But I would ask him in the first
place, if an Appeal be to be made, to whom can the King Appeal, but to
his People? And if he must justifie his own proceedings to their whole
Body, how can he do it but by blaming their Representatives? I believe
every honest man is sorry, that any such Divisions have been betwixt the
King and his House of Commons. But since there have been, how could
the King complain more modestly, or in terms more expressing Grief, than
Indignation? or what way is left him to obviate the causes of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
for the future, but this gentle admonishment for what is past?</p>
            <p>'Tis easily agreed, he says, (and here I joyn issue with him) <hi>That there
were never more occasions for a Parliament, than were at the opening of the
last, which was held at</hi> Westminster. But where he maliciously adds, <hi>never
were our Liberties and Properties more in danger, nor the Protestant Religion
more expos'd to an utter extirpation both at home and abroad,</hi> he shuffles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Truth and Falshood: for from the greatness of <hi>France,</hi> the danger
of the Protestant Religion is evident; But that our Liberty, Religion, and
Property were in danger from the Government, let him produce the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it, that they may be answer'd; what dangers there were and
are from the Antimonarchical Party, is not my present business to enquire.
As for the growing terrour of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, the greater it is, the
more need of a supply to provide against it.</p>
            <p>The Ministers tell us in the Declaration, That they asked of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the supporting the Alliances they had made for the Preservation of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48938:4"/>
general peace in Christendom, and had desir'd their advice and assistance for the
preservation of <hi>Tangier:</hi> had recommended to them, the farther examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Plot; and that his Majesty had offer'd to concurr in any Remedies
for the security of the Protestant Religion, which might consist with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Succession of the Crown, in its due and legal course of descent, but
to all this they met with most unsuitable returns.</p>
            <p>Now mark what the Gentleman infers, <hi>That the Ministers well knew,
that their demands of Money for the ends abovesaid, were not to be complyed
with, till his Majesty were pleas'd to change the hands and Councils by which
his Affairs were managed.—</hi> that is, nothing must be given but to such
men in whom they could confide, as if neither the King, nor those
whom he employed were fit any longer to be Trusted. But the
supream power, and the management of all things, must be wholly in
their Party, as it was in <hi>Watt Tyler,</hi> and <hi>Iack Cade</hi> of famous memory,
when they had got a King into their possession: for this Party, will never
think his Majesty their own, till they have him as safe, as they had his
Father. But if they could compass their Designs, of bringing the same
Gentlemen into play once more, who some years since were at the Helm;
let me ask them, when the Affairs of the Nation were worse manag'd?
who gave the rise to the present greatness of the <hi>French?</hi> or who counsel'd
the dissolution of the Tripple League? 'Tis a miracle to me that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should think them good Patriots, only because they are out of humour
with the Court, and in disgrace. I suppose they are far other principles,
than those of Anger and Revenge, which constitute an honest Statesman.
But let men be what they will before, if they once espouse their Party, let
them be touch'd with that Philosophers stone, and they are turn'd into
Gold immediately. Nay, that will do more for them, than was ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to by Chymistry; for it will raise up the shape of a worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot,
from the ashes of a Knave. 'Tis a pretty juggle to tell the King
they assist him with Money, when indeed they design only to give it to
themselves; that is, to their own Instruments, which is no more, than to
shift it from one hand into another. It will be a favour at the long run,
if they condescend to acquaint the King, how they intend to lay out his
Treasure. But our Author very roundly tells his Majesty, <hi>That at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they will give him no supplyes, because they would be employ'd, to the
destruction of his Person, and of the Protestant Religion, and the inslaving
the whole Nation,</hi> to which I will only add, that of all these matters next
and immediately under God, he and his Party, constitute themselves the
supream Judges,</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Queen. and the two French Dutchesses are the
great support and protectors of the Popish interest in these Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>How comes it to pass that our Author shuffles the two French Dutchesses
together? of which the one is an <hi>Italian,</hi> the other a <hi>French</hi> Woman, and
an <hi>English</hi> Dutchess? Is he grown so purblind, that he cannot distinguish
Friends from Foes? Has he so soon forgotten the memory of past benefits,
that he will not consider one of them as her, to whom all their applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were so lately made? Is she so quickly become an old acquaintance,
that none of the politick assignations at her Lodgings are remembred?
After this, who will trust the gratitude of a Common-wealth? or who
will blame the Conduct of a silly Court, for being over-reach'd by the
whole <hi>French</hi> Council, when the able part of the Nation, the designing
heads, the gray wisdom, and the Beaux Garcons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are all foil'd by a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48938:5"/>
single <hi>French</hi> Woman, at their own Weapon, dissimulation? for the other
<hi>French</hi> Dutchess, since I perceive our Author is unacquainted with her
Character, I will give it him; she is one who loves her ease to that degree,
that no advantages of Fortune can bribe her into business. Let her but
have wherewithall to make Merry adays, and to play at Cards anights,
and I dare answer for her, that she will take as little care to disturb their
business, as she takes in the management of her own. But if you will say that
she only affects idleness, and is a grand Intriguer in her heart, I will only
Answer, that I should shew you just such another as I have describ'd her
Grace, amongst the heads of your own Party: indeed I do not say it is a
Woman, but 'tis one who loves a Woman.</p>
            <p>As for the Dutchess of <hi>M.</hi> either she is a very sincere lover of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
idleness, or she has cousen'd all parts of Christendom, where she has
wandred for these last Ten years. I hope our solid Author will pardon
me this digression; but now we have had our dance, let us to our serious
business.</p>
            <p>While these, and their Creatures are at the Helm, what can we expect for
the security of the Protestant Religion, or what opposition to the ambitious
designs of <hi>France?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I suppose more reasonably on the other side, that no such persons are at
the Helm, and that what he has assum'd is but precarious. But I retort
upon him, that if some of his Party were the Ministers, the Protestant
Religion would receive but very cold assistance from them, who have none
at all themselves. And for the growth of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, I have
already told you, to whose Counsels we are beholden for it.</p>
            <p>He goes on; you will tell me that the supplyes so given may be appropriated,
to these particular ends of supporting our Alliances, and the relief of <hi>Tangier:</hi>
And it may be so limited by Act of Parliament, that it cannot be diverted to
other uses. But he answers that Objection by a Story of <hi>Monsieur de Sully's</hi>
telling of <hi>H. 4th</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> let the States raise the Money, and tye it as
they please; when they are dissolved, you may dispose of it as you please.</p>
            <p>All this is to confirm his first unalterable principle, that the King must
be sure to finger nothing; but be us'd as Fishers do their Cormorant, have
his mouth left open, to swallow the prey for them, but his throat gagg'd
that nothing may go down. Let them bring this to pass, and afterwards
they will not need to take away his Prerogative of making War: He must
do that at his own peril, and be sent to fight his Enemies with his hands
bound behind him. But what if he thinks not their Party fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted,
least they should employ it against his Person? why then, as he
told you <hi>they will give him nothing.</hi> Now whose will be the fault in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason, if the Allyances be not supported, and <hi>Tangier</hi> not relieved?
If they will give him nothing, before they bring him to a necessity of taking
it upon their terms, asmuch as in them lyes they dissolve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and the Interest of the Nation abroad must be left in the Suds,
till they have destroy'd the Monarchy at home. But since God, and the
Laws have put the disposing of the Treasury into his Majesties hands, it
may satisfie any reasonable <hi>Englishman,</hi> that the same Laws have provided
for the mispending of the Treasury, by calling the publick Officers into
question for it before the Parliament. For God be thanked we have a
House of Commons, who will be sure, never to forgoe the least tittle of
their Priviledges, and not be so meal-mouth'd as the States of <hi>France,</hi> of
whom neither Monsieur <hi>Sully,</hi> nor any of his Successors, have never had any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48938:5"/>
cause of apprehension. But since the wisdom of our Ancestors have
thought this Provision sufficient for our security, What has his present
Majesty deserv'd from his Subjects, that he should be made a Minor at no
less than fifty years of age? or that his House of Commons should Fetter
him beyond any of his Predecessors? <hi>where the Interest goes, you will
say, there goes the power.</hi> But the most ingenious of your Authors, I
mean <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> broaches no such principle as that you should force
this Prerogative from the King, by undue courses. The best use which
can be made of all, is rather to support the Monarchy, than to have it fall
upon your Heads. If indeed there were any reasonable fear of an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Government, the adverse Party had somewhat to alledge in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of not supplying it; but it is not only evident, that the Kings
temper is wholly averse from any such Design, but also demonstrable, that
if all his Council, were such as this man most falsely suggests them to be,
yet the notion of an absolute power in the Prince is wholly impracticable,
not only in this Age, but for ought any wise man can foresee, at any time
hereafter. 'Tis plain, that the King has reduc'd himself already to live
more like a private Gentleman than a Prince; and since he can content
himself in that condition, 'tis as plain, that the supplies which he demands
are only for the service of the publick, and not for his own maintenance,
Monsieur <hi>de Sully</hi> might give what Council he thought convenient for
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who was then designing that Arbitrary power, which
his Successors have since compass'd, to the ruine of the Subjects liberty in
<hi>France;</hi> but I appeal to the Consciences of those men, who are most averse
to the present Government, if they think our King would put his Peace
and Quiet at this time of day, upon so desperate an issue. What the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
which they are driving him into, may make him part with on the
other hand, I know not. But how can they answer it to our Posterity, that
for private Picques, self Interest, and causeless jealousies, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the foundation of so excellent a Government, which is the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and envy of all <hi>Europe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of my Authors Paragraph, is only laying more load upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and telling us, that if a sum of Money sufficient for those ends were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
while they were Managers of Affairs, it would be only to set them free
from any apprehensions of account to any future Parliament. <hi>But this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
having only the imaginary fear of an Arbitrary power for its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is already answer'd, he adds in the close of it,</hi> That the Prince has a
cheap bargain, who gives Paper-Laws in exchange of Money and Power.
Bargains, he tells us, there have always been, and always will be, betwixt Prince
and People, because it is in the Constitution of our Government, and the chief
dependance of our Kings is in the love and liberality of their People.</p>
            <p>Our present King, I acknowledge has often found it so; though no
thanks I suppose to this Gentleman and his Party. But though he cry down
Paper and Parchment at this Rate, they are the best Evidence he can have
for his Estate, and his friends the Lawyers will advise him to speak with less
contempt of those Commodities. If Laws avail the Subject nothing,
our Ancestors have made many a bad Bargain for us. Yet I can instance
to him one Paper, namely, that of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> bill; for which the
House of Commons would have been content to have given a Million of
good <hi>English</hi> money, and which they had Gratis from his Majesty. 'Tis
true, they boast they got it by a Trick; but if the Clerk of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48938:6"/>
had been bidden to forget it, their Trick of telling Noses might have
fail'd them. Therefore let us do right on all sides: The Nation is oblig'd
both to the House of Commons for asking it, and more especially to his
Majesty, for granting it so freely.</p>
            <p>But what can we think of his next Axiome, that it was never known that
Laws signified any thing to a People, who had not the sole guard of their own
Prince, Government and Laws?</p>
            <p>Here all our Fore-fathers are Arraign'd at once for trusting the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power of the Laws in their Princes hands. And yet you see the
Government has made a shift to shufflle on for so many hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
under this miserable oppression; and no man so wise in so many
ages to find out, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was to no purpose, while there was a
King. I confess in Countreys, where the Monarck governs absolutely,
and the Law is either his Will, or depending on it, this noble maxim might
take place; But since we are neither <hi>Turks, Russians,</hi> nor <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> to
affirm that in our Countrey, in a Monarchy of so temperate and wholsom
a Constitution, Laws are of no validity, because they are not in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the People, plainly infers that no Government but that of a
Common-wealth can preserve our Liberties and Priviledges: for though
the Title of a Prince be allow'd to continue, yet if the People must have
the sole guard and Government of him and of the Laws, 'tis but facing
an whole hand of Trumps, with an insignificant King of another sute.
And which is worst of all, if this be true, there can be no Rebellion, for
then the People is the supream power. And if the Representatives of
the Commons shall Jarr with the other two Estates, and with the King it</p>
            <p>It would be no Rebellion to adhere to them in that War: to which I
know that every Republican who reads this, must of necessity Answer,
<hi>No more it would not.</hi> Then farewell the Good Act of Parliament, which
makes it Treason to Levy Arms agaist the present King, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
whatsoever. For if this be a Right of Nature, and consequently
never to be Resign'd, there never has been, nor ever can be any pact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
King and People, and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would tell us, <hi>That we are still in
a state of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing our Author would establish, is, That there is nothing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or in Story so ridiculous, as the management of the Ministers, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of the Popish Plot. Which being prov'd by <hi>Coleman</hi>'s and others
Letters, and by both Houses by declaring the King's Life to be in danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Yet they have persuaded the King to believe nothing of this danger; but to
apprehend the Plot to be extreamly improv'd, if not wholly contriv'd by the
Presbyterians. And to think it more his concernment to have an end of all; then
to have it search'd to the bottom: and that this was the true reason, why four
Parliaments, during the Examination of the Plot have been dissolv'd:</p>
            <p>Reasonable People will conclude, that his Majesty and his Ministers
have proceeded, not ridiculously, but with all that caution which became
them. For in the first heat and vehemence of the Plot, the Avenues of
<hi>White-Hall</hi> were more strictly Guarded: His Majesty abstaining from
Places of publick Entertainment, and the Ministers taking all necessary
Care in Council, both to discover Conspiracies and to prevent them. So,
that simply considered, the Popish Plot has nothing to do with the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Four Parliaments. But the Use which has been made of it by
the House of Commons to Dis-inherit the Duke, to deny the King Supplies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48938:6"/>
and to make some Votes, which the King declares to be illegal, are the real
and plain occasions of dissolving those Parliaments. 'Tis only affirm'd, but
never will be prov'd by this Author, that the King or his Ministers have
ever been desirous to stifle the Plot, and not to have it search'd into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
For to what end has his Majesty so often offer'd the Popish Lords to
be brought to their Trial, but that their innocence or guilt, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that of the whole party might be made manifest? Or why, after the
execution of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> did the House of Commons stop at the
other Lords, and not proceed to try them in their turns? Did his Majesty
stifle the Plot when he offered them, or did they refuse to sound the depth
of it, when they would not touch upon them? If it were for want of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
which is all that can be said, the case is deplorable on the part of the
accused; who can neither be bail'd, because impeach'd in Parliament, nor
admitted to be tryed, for fear they should be acquitted for want of evidence.
I do not doubt but his Majesty, after having done what in him lies for the
utmost discovery of the Plot, both by frequent Proclamations of Indemnity,
and Reward, to such as would come in, and discover more, and by several
others too long to repeat, is desirous (for what good man is not?) that his
care and trouble might be over. But I am much deceiv'd, if the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical
Party be of the same opinion; or that they desire the Plot
should be either wholly discover'd, or fully ended. For 'tis evidently their
Interest to keep it on foot, as long as possibly they can; and to give it hot
water, as often as 'tis dying; for while they are in possession of this Jewel,
they make themselves masters of the people. For this very reason I have
often said, even from the beginning of the Discovery, that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
would never let it go out of their hands, but manage it to the last inch
upon a Save-all. And that if ever they had tryed one Lord, they would
value themselves upon that Conquest, as longas ever it would last with the
Populace: but whatever came on't, be sure to leave a Nest Egg in the <hi>Tower:</hi>
And since I doubt not, but what so mean a Judge as I am could so easily
discover, could not possibly escape the vigilancy of those who are at the
Helm; I am apt to think, that his Majesty saw at least as great a danger
arising to him from the discontented spirits of the popular Faction, as from
the Papists. For is it not plain, that ever since the beginning of the Plot,
they have been lopping off from the Crown whatever part of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
they could reach? and incroaching into Soveraignty and Arbitrary
Power themselves, while they seem'd to fear it from the King? How then
could his Majesty be blam'd, if he were forc'd to dissolve those Parliaments,
which instead of giving him relief, made their Advantages upon his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses;
and while they pretended a care of his Person on the one hand,
were plucking at his Scepter with the other?</p>
            <p>After this, the Pamphleteer gives us a long Bead-roll of <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Plot,
Captain <hi>Ely,</hi> young <hi>Tongue, Fitz-Gerard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> rails at some, and
commends others as far as his skill in Hyperbole will carry him. Which
all put together, amounts to no more than only this, that he whom they
called Rogue before, when he comes into their party, pays his Garnish, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
into the name of an honest man. Thus <hi>Ray</hi> was no Villain, when
he accus'd Colonel <hi>Sackvile,</hi> before the House of Commons; but when he
failed of the reward of godliness at their hands, and from a Wig became
a tearing Tory in new Cloaths, our Author puts him upon the File of
Rogues, with this brand, <hi>Than whom a more notorious and known Villian lives
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing he falls upon, is the Succession: which the King declares,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48938:7"/>
               <hi>He will have preserved in its due descent.</hi> Now our Author despairing, it
seems, that an Exclusion should pass by Bill, urges, <hi>That the Right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Nations will impower Subjects to deliver a Protestant Kingdom from
a Popish King.</hi> The Law of Nations, is so undoubtedly, against him, that I
am sure he dares not stick to that Plea: but will be forc'd to reply, that
the Civil Law was made in favour of Monarchy: why then did he appeal to
it? And for the Law of Nature, I know not what it has to do with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
or Papists, except he can prove that the English Nation is naturally
Protestant; and then I would enquire of him what Countrymen our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
were? But if he means by the Law of Nature, self-preservation and
defence; even that neither will look but a squint upon Religion; for a
man of any Religion, and a man of no Religion, are equally bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their lives. But I answer positively to what he would be at; that the
Law of self-preservation impowers not a Subject to rise in Arms against his
Soveraign, of another Religion, upon supposition of what he may do in his
prejudice hereafter: for, since it is impossible that a moral certainty should
be made out of a future contingency, and consequently, that the Soveraign
may not extend his Power to the prejudice of any mans Liberty or Religion:
The probability (which is the worst that they can put it) is not enough to
absolve a Subject who rises in Arms, from Rebellion, <hi>in foro Conscientiae.</hi>
We read of a divine Command to obey Superior Powers; and the Duke
will lawfully be such, no Bill of Exclusion having past against him in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
life: Besides this, we have the Examples of Primitive Christians, even
under Heathen Emperors, always suffering, yet never taking up Arms,
during ten Persecutions. But we have no Text, no Primitive Example en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
us to rebel against a Christian Prince, tho of a different Perswasion.
And to say there were then no Christian Princes when the New Testament
was written, will avail our Author little; for the Argument is a <hi>Fortiori:</hi>
if it be unlawful to rebel against a Heathen Emperor, then much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Christian King. The Corollary is this, and every unbiassed sober
man will subscribe to it, that since we cannot pry into the secret Decrees of
God, for the knowledge of future Events, we ought to rely upon his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for the Succession; without either plunging our present King into
necessities, for what may never happen; or refusing our obedience to one
hereafter, who in the course of nature may succeed him. One, who if he
had the will, could never have the power to settle Popery in <hi>England,</hi> or to
bring in Arbitrary Government.</p>
            <p>But the Monarchy will not be destroyed, and the Protestant Religion will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
if we may have a Protestant Successor.</p>
            <p>If his party had thought, that this had been a true Expedient, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it had been mentioned in the last Parliament at <hi>Westminster.</hi> But
there, <hi>altum silentium,</hi> not one word of it. Was it because the Machine was
not then in readiness to move! and that the Exclusion must first pass? or
more truly was it ever intended to be urged? I am not ashamed to say, that
I particularly honour the Duke of <hi>Monmouth:</hi> but whether his nomination
to succeed, would, at the bottom be pleasing to the Heads of his Cabal, I
somewhat doubt. To keep him fast to them by some remote hopes of it, may
be no ill Policy. To have him in a readiness to head an Army, in case it
should please God the King should die before the Duke, is the design; and then
perhaps he has reason to expect more from a Chance Game, than from the
real desires of his party to exalt him to a Throne. But 'tis neither to be
imagined, that a Prince of his Spirit, after the gaining of a Crown, would
be managed by those who helped him to it, let his ingagements and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48938:7"/>
be never so strong before, neither that he would be confin'd in the narrow
compass of a Curtail'd Mungril Monarchy, half Commonwealth. Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
are not easily to be curbed. And it is yet harder to conceive, that his
pretended Friends, even design him so much as that. At preset, 'tis true,
their mutual necessities keep them fast together; and all the several Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Books fall in, to enlarge the common stream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But suppose the business
compassed, as they design'd it, how many, and how contradicting
Interests are there to be satisfied! Every Sect of High Shooes would then be
uppermost; and not one of them endure the toleration of another. And
amongst them all, what will become of those fine Speculative Wits, who drew
the Plan of this new Government, and who overthrew the old? For their
comfort, the Saints will then account them Atheists, and discard them. Or
they will plead each of them their particular Merits, till they quarrel about
the Dividend. And, the Protestant Successor himself, if he be not wholly
governed by the prevailing party, will first be declared no Protestant; and
next, no Successor. This is dealing sincerely with him, which <hi>Plato Redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
does not: for all the bustle he makes concerning the Duke of <hi>M.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a Commonwealth Principle: he is afraid at the bottom to have
him at the Head of the party, lest he should turn the absolute Republick, now
designing, into an arbitrary Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The next thing he exposes, is the project communicated at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by a
worthy Gentleman since deceased. But since he avowed himself, that it
was but a rough draught, our Author might have paid more respect to his
memory, than to endeavour to render it ridiculous. But let us see how
he mends the matter in his own which follows.</p>
            <p>If the Duke were only banished, during life, and the Administration put
into the hands of Protestants, that would establish an unnatural War of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency,
against an avowed Right and Title. But on the other hand exclude the
Duke, and all other Popish Successors, and put down all those Guards are now so
illegally kept up, and banish the Papists, where can be the danger of a War, in
a Nation unanimous?</p>
            <p>I will not be unreasonable with him; I will expect English no where from
the barrenness of his Country: but if he can make sense of his <hi>Unnatural
War of Expediency,</hi> I will forgive him two false Grammars, and three
Barbarisms, in every Period of his Pamphlet; and yet leave him enow of
each to expose his ignorance, whensoever I design it. But his Expedient it
self is very solid, if you mark it. <hi>Exclude the Duke, take away the Guards,</hi>
and consequently, all manner of defence from the Kings Person; <hi>Banish
every Mothers Son of the Papists, whether guilty or not guilty in particular of
the Plot.</hi> And when Papists are to be banished, I warrant you all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in Masquerade must go for company; and when none but a pack of
Sectaries and Commonwealths-men are left in <hi>England,</hi> where indeed will
be the danger of a War, in a Nation unanimous? After this, why does
not some resenting Friend of <hi>Marvel</hi>'s, put up a Petition to the Soveraigns
of his party, that his Pension of four hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> may be
transferred to some one amongst them, who will not so notoriously betray
their cause by dullness and insufficiency? As for the illegal Guards, let
the Law help them; or let them be disbanded; for I do not think they have
need of any Champion.</p>
            <p>The next twenty Lines are only an Illustration upon his Expedient: for he
is so fond of his darling Notion, that he huggs it to death, as the Ape did
her young one. He gives us his Bill of Tautology once more; for he
threatens, that they would not rest at the Exclusion; but the Papists must
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48938:8"/>
again be banish'd, and the Dukes Creatures put out of Office both Civil and
Military. Now the Dukes Creatures, I hope, are Papists, or little better;
so that this is all the same: as if he had been conning over this ingenious
Epigram;
<q>
                  <l>There was a man who with great labour, and much pain,</l>
                  <l>Did break his neck, and break his neck, and break his neck again.</l>
               </q>
At the last, to shew his hand is not out in the whole Paragraph, when the
Duke is excluded, his Creatures put out of Office, the Papists banished
twice over; and the Church of <hi>England</hi>-men delivered to Satan, yet still
he says the Duke is the great Minister of State; and the Kings Excellent
Qualities give his Brother still opportunities to ruine us and our Religion.
Even excluded, and without Friends and Faction he can do all this; and the
King is endued with most excellent Qualities to suffer it.</p>
            <p>Having found my man, methinks I can scarce afford to be serious with
him any longer; but to treat him as he deserves, like an ill Bouffoon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He defends the sharpness of the Addresses of which his Majesty complains:</hi> but
I suppose it would be better for him, and me, to let our Principals engage,
and to stand by our selves. I confess, I have heard some members of that
House, wish, that all Proceedings had been carried with less vehemence.
But my Author goes further on the other hand; <hi>He affirms, that many wise
and good men thought they had gone too far, in assuring, nay, in mentioning
of money before our safety was fully provided for.</hi> So you see he is still for laying
his hand upon the penny. In the mean time I have him in a Praemunire for
arraigning the House of Commons; for he has tacitely confessed, that the
wise and good men were the fewer; because the House carryed it for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
money in their Address. But it seems they went too far, in speaking
of a Supply; before they had consulted this Gentleman, how far the safety
of the Nation would admit it. I find plainly by his temper, that if matters
had come to an accommodation, and a bargain had been a bargain, the
Knights of the Shire must have been the Protestant Knights no longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for Arbitrary Power of taking men into custody, for matters that had no
relation to Privileges of Parliament, he says they have erred with their Fathers.</hi>
If he confess that they have erred, let it be with all their Generation, still
they have erred: and an error of the first digestion, is seldom mended in the
second. But I find him modest in this point; and knowing too well they
are not a Court of Judicature, he does not defend them from Arbitrary
Proceedings, but only excuses, and palliates the matter, by saying, that it
concern'd the Rights of the People, in suppressing their Petitions to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Justice. So, when it makes for him, he can allow the King to be
the <hi>Fountain of Iustice;</hi> but at other times he is only a <hi>Cistern of the People.</hi>
But he knows sufficiently, however he dissembles it, that there were some
taken into custody, to whom that crime was not objected. Yet since in a
manner he yields up the Cause, I will not press him too far, where he is so
manifestly weak. Tho I must tell him by the way, that he is as justly to be
proceeded against for calling the Kings Proclamation illegal, which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the matter of Petitioning, as some of those, who had pronounced against
them by the House of Commons, that terrible sentence, of <hi>Take him,</hi>
Topham.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The strange illegal Votes declaring several eminent persons to be Enemies to
the King and Kingdom, are not so strange, he says, but very justifiable.</hi> I hope he
does not mean, that illegal Votes are now not strange in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48938:8"/>
But observe the reason which he gives: for the House of Commons
had before address'd for their removal from about the King. It was his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to have prov'd, that an Address of the House of Commons, without
Process, order of Law, hearing any Defence, or offering any proof against
them is sufficient ground to remove any person from the King: But instead
of this he only proves, that former Addresses have been made, <hi>Which no
body can deny.</hi> When he has throughly settled this important point, that
Addresses have certainly been made, instead of an Argument to back it, he
only thinks, that one may affirm by Law, <hi>That the King ought to have no
person about him, who has the misfortune of such a Vote.</hi> But this is too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to require an Answer. They who will have a thing done, and
give no reason for it, assume to themselves a manifest Arbitrary Power.
Now this Power cannot be in the Representatives, if it be not in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
or if it be in them, the People is absolute. But since he wholly thinks
it, let him injoy the privilege of every Free Born Subject, to have the Bell
clinck to him what he imagines.</p>
            <p>Well; all this while he has been in pain about laying his Egg: at the last
we shall have him cackle.</p>
            <p>If the House of Commons declare they have just Reasons to fear, that such
a person puts the King upon Arbitrary Councils, or betrays His and the Nations
Interest, in such a Case, Order and Process of Law is not necessary to remove him;
but the Opinion and Advice of the Nation is enough; because bare removing
neither fines him, nor deprives him of Life, Liberty, or Offices, wherein State
Affairs are not concern'd.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, he has only prov'd, according to his usual Logick, that bare
removing, is but bare removing; and that to deprive a man of a Publick
Office is not so much as it would be to hang him: all that possibly can be
infer'd from this Argument, is only that a Vote may do a less wrong, but not
a greater. Let us see how he proceeds.</p>
            <p>If he be not remov'd upon such Address, you allow him time to act his Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and the Nation runs the hazard.</p>
            <p>I answer, if the House have just Reasons on their side, 'tis but equitable
they should declare them; for an Address in this Case is an Appeal to the
King against such a man: and no Appeal is supposed to be without the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which induc'd it. But when they ask a Removal, and give no reason for
it; they make themselves Judges of the Matter, and consequently they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
not, but command. If they please to give their Reasons, they justifie
their Complaint; for then their Address is almost in the nature of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment:
and in that Case they may procure a hearing when they please:
But barely to declare, that they suspect any man, without charging him with
particular Articles, is almost to confess, they can find none against him. To
suppose a man has time to act his Villanies, must suppose him first to be a
Villain: and if they suspect him to be such, nothing more easie than to
name his Crimes, and to take from him all opportunities of future mischief.
But at this rate of bare addressing, any one who has a publick profitable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
might be remov'd; for upon the private Picque of a Member he
may have a party rais'd for an Address against him. And if his Majesty
can no sooner reward the Services of any one who is not of their party, but
they can vote him out of his Employment; it must at last follow, that none
but their own party must be employ'd, and then a Vote of the House
of Commons, is in effect the Government. Neither can that be call'd the
Advice and Opinion of the whole Nation, by my Author's favour, where
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48938:9"/>
the other two Estates, and the Soveraign are not consenting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis no matter, <hi>says this Gentleman;</hi> there are some things so reasonable,
that they are above any written Law: and will in despite of any Power on Earth
have their effect; whereof this is one.</p>
            <p>I love a man who deals plainly; he explicitly owns this is not Law, and
yet it is reasonable; and will have its effect as if it were. See then, in the
first place the written Law is laid aside: that fence is thrown open to admit
reason in a larger denomination. Now that reason which is not Law,
must be either Enthusiasm, or the head-strong will of a whole Nation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd:
because in depite of any Earthly Power it will have its effect: so
that, which way soever our Author takes it, he must mean Fanaticism, or
Rebellion: Law grounded on reason is resolv'd into the Absolute Power of
the People; and this is <hi>Ratio ultima Reipublicae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore;</hi> The King is a publick Person: in his private capacity, <hi>as
we are told,</hi> he can only eat and drink; and perform some other acts of nature
which shall be nameless. But his actings without himself, <hi>says my grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
are only as a King. In his politick capacity he ought not to marry, love,
hate, make war, or peace, but as a King; and agreeable to the People, and their
Interest he governs.</p>
            <p>In plain terms then, as he is a man he has nothing left to do; for the Actions
which are mention'd, are those only of an Animal, or which are common to
Man and Beast. And as he is a King he has as little Business, for there he is
at the disposing of the People: and the only use that can be made of such a
Monarch, is for an Innkeeper to set upon a Sign-Post to draw custom. But
these Letters of Instruction how he should behave himself in his Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
cannot but call to mind how he was school'd and tutor'd, when the
Covenanters made just such another Prince of him in <hi>Scotland.</hi> When the
terrible fasting day was come, if he were sick in bed, no remedy, he must
up and to Kirk; and that without a mouthful of Bread to stay his Stomach;
for he fasted then in his Politick Capacity. When he was seated, no looking
aside from Mr. <hi>Iohn;</hi> not a whisper to any man, but was a disrepect to the
Divine Ordinance. After the first Thunderer had spent his Lungs, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
the first is reinforc'd by a second and a third: all chosen Vessels,
dieted for Preaching, and the best breath'd of the whole Country. When
the Sun went down, then up went the Candles, and the fourth arises to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the work of the night, when that of the day was at an end.</p>
            <p>'Tis true what he says, that our greatest Princes have often hearkened to the
Addresses of their People, and have remov'd some persons from them; but it
was when they found those Addresses reasonable themselves. But they who
consult the manner of Addresses in former times, will find them to have been
manag'd in the House of Commons, with all the calmness and circumspection
imaginable. The Crimes were first maturely weigh'd, and the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
throughly winnow'd in Debates. After which, if they thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the publick wellfare, that such a person should be remov'd, they
dutifully acquainted the King with their opinion, which was often favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
heard; and their desires granted. But now the Case is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
Either no Debate, or a very slight one precedes Addresses of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But a man is run down with violent Harangues; and 'tis thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
if any member rises up, and offers that he will make out the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
afterwards: when things are carried in this heady manner, I suppose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48938:9"/>
'tis no sign of a Great Prince, to have any of his Servants forc'd from him.
But such Addresses will insensibly grow into Presidents: you see our Author
is nibbling at one already. And we know a House of Commons is always
for giving the Crescent in their Arms. If they gain a point, they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from it, they make sure work of every concession from the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and immediately put it into the Christmass Box: from whence there is no
Redemption.</p>
            <p>In justification of the two Votes against lending or advancing Money to
the King, he falls to railing, like a Sophister in the Schools, when his Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms
are at an end. He arraigns the Kings private manner of living, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering that his not being supplied has forc'd him to it. I do not take
upon me to defend any former ill management of the Treasury; but, if I
am not deceiv'd, the great grievance of the other party at present, is, that it is
well manag'd. And, that notwithstanding nothing has been given for so
many years, yet a competent provision is still made for all expences of the
publick; if not so large as might be wish'd, yet at least as much as is necessary.
And I can tell my Author for his farther mortification, that at present no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is furnish'd to his Majesties Occasions, at such unconscionable Usury as
he mentions. If he would have the Tables set up again, let the King be
put into a condition, and then let eating and drinking flourish, according
to the hearty, honest and greasie Hospitality of our Ancestors. He would
have the King have recourse to Parliaments, as the only proper Supply to a
King of <hi>England,</hi> for those things which the Treasury in this low Ebb cannot
furnish out: but when he comes to the Conditions, on which this money
is to be had, they are such, that perhaps forty in the Hundred to a Jew
Banquer were not more unreasonable. In the mean time, if a Parliament
will not give, and others must not lend, there is a certain story of the Dog
in the Manager, which out of good manners I will not apply.</p>
            <p>The Vote for not prosecuting Protestant Dissenters upon the Penal Laws;
which at this time is thought to be a Grievance to the Subject, a weakning of
the Protestant Religion, and an Incouragement to Popery, is a matter more
tenderly to be handled. But if it be true what has been commonly reported
since the Plot, that Priests, Jesuits, and Friars, mingle amongst Anabaptists,
Quakers, and other Sectaries, and are their Teachers, must not they be
prosecuted neither? Some men would think, that before such an uniting
of Protestants, a winnowing were not much amiss; for after they were
once sent together to the Mill, it would be too late to divide the Grist. His
Majesty is well known to be an indulgent Prince, to the Consciences of his
dissenting Subjects: But whoever has seen a Paper call'd, I think, <hi>An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Bill for uniting,</hi> &amp;c. which lay upon the Table of every Coffee-House,
and was modelling to pass the House of Commons, may have found
things of such dangerous concernment to the Government, as might seem
not so much intended to unit Dissenters in a Protestant Church, as to draw
together all the Forces of the several Fanatick Parties, against the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> And when they were encouraged by such a Vote, which they
value as a Law; (for so high that Coin is now inhaunc'd) perhaps it is not
unreasonable to hold the Rod over them. But for my own part, I heartily
wish, that there may be no occassion for Christians to persecute each other. And
since my Author speaks with some moderation, candor, and submission to
his Mother Church, I shall only desire him and the dissenting Party, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48938:10"/>
make the use they ought, of the King Gracious Disposition to them, in
not yet proceeding with all the violence which the penal Laws require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. But this calm of my Author, was too happy to last long.
You find him immediately transported into a storm about the business of
<hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> which occasion'd the Dissolution of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford:</hi>
and accusing, according to his sawcy Custom, both his Majesty, and the
House of Lords, concerning it. As for the House of Lords, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
vindicated their own right, by throwing out the Impeachment: and
sure the People of <hi>England</hi> ought to own them as the Assertors of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Liberty in so doing; for Process being before ordered against him at
Common Law, and no particular Crime being laid to his Charge by the
House of Commons, if they had admitted his Cause to be tryed before their
Lordships, this would have grown a President in time, that they must have
been forc'd to judge all those whom the House of Commons would thrust
upon them, till at last the number of Impeachments would be so increas'd;
that the Peers would have no time for any other business of the Publick:
and the Highest Court of Judicature would have been reduc'd to be the
Ministers of Revenge to the Commons. What then would become of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Privilege to be tryed <hi>per pares?</hi> Which in process of time would be lost to
us and our posterity: except a proviso were made on purpose, that this judgment
might not be drawn into farther President; and that is never done, but when
there is a manifest necessity of breaking rules, which here there was not.
Otherwise the Commons may make Spaniels of the Lords, throw them a
man, and bid them go judge, as we command a Dog to fetch and carry.
But neither the Lords Reasons, nor the King first having possession of the
Prisoner, signifie any thing with our Author. He will tell you the reason of
the Impeachment was to bring out the Popish Plot. If <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> really
know any thing but what relates to his own Treason, he chuses a fine
time of day to discover it now, when 'tis manifestly to save his Neck, that
he is forc'd to make himself a greater Villain; and to charge himself with
new Crimes to avoid the punishment of the old. Had he not the benefit of
so many Proclamations, to have come in before, if he then knew any thing
worth discovery? And was not his fortune necessitous enough at all times, to
catch at an impunity, which was baited with Rewards to bribe him? 'tis not
for nothing that Party has been all along so favourable to him: they are consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to themselves of some other matters than a Popish Plot. Let him first
be tryed for what he was first accus'd: if he be acquitted, his Party will be
satisfied, and their strength increas'd by the known honesty of another Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
but if he be condemn'd, let us see what truth will come out of him,
when he has <hi>Tyburn</hi> and another World before his Eyes. Then, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
any thing which makes against the Cause, their Excuse is ready; he
died a Papist, and had a dispensation from the Pope to lie. But if they can
bring him silent to the Gallows, all their favour will be, to wish him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
out of his pain, as soon as possibly he may. And in that Case they
have already promis'd they will be good to his Wife, and provide for her,
which would be a strong encouragement, for many a woman, to perswade
her Husband to digest the Halter. This remembers me of a certain Spanish
Duke, who commanding a Sea-Port-Town, set an Officer of his, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to rob the Merchants. His Grace you may be confident was to
have the Booty, and the Fellow was assur'd if he were taken
to be protected. It fell out, after some time, that he was
apprehended: His Master, according to Articles, brought him off.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48938:10"/>
The Rogue went again to his vocation, was the second time taken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
again, and so the third. At last the matter grew so notorious,
that the Duke found, it would be both scandalous and difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
him any longer; But the poor Malefactor sending his Wife to tell
him that if he did not save him he must be hanged to morrow, and that
he must confess who set him on: His Master very civilly sent him this
Message; <hi>Prithee suffer thy self to be hanged this once to do me a Courtesie,
and it shall be the better for thy Wife and Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">But that which makes amends for all, says our Author, is the Kings
resolution to have frequent Parliaments. Yet this, it seems, is no amends
neither: for he says Parliaments are like Terms, if there be Ten in a Year,
and all so short to hear no Causes, they do no good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say on the other hand, If the Courts will resolve beforehand to have
no Causes brought before them, but one which they know they cannot
dispatch; let the Terms be never so long, they make them as insignificant
as a Vacation.</p>
            <p>The King<hi>'s</hi> Prerogative, when and where they should be call'd, and how long
they should sit, is but subservient, as our Friend tells us, to the great design of
Government; and must be accommodated to it, or we are either denyed or delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of that Protection and Iustice we are born to.</p>
            <p>My Author is the happiest in one faculty, I ever knew. He is still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
some new Position, which without proving, he slurs upon us for
an Argument: though he knows, that Doctrines without proofs will edifie
but little. That the Kings Prerogative is subservient, or in order to the
ends of Government is granted him. But what strange kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this, to prove that we are cheated of that Protection to which we
are born. Our Kings have always been indued with the power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Parliaments, nominating the time, appointing of the Place, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
them when they thought it for the publick good: And the People
have wisely consulted their own welfare in it. Suppose, for example, that
there be a Jarring between the three Estates, which renders their sitting at
that time Impracticable; since none of them can pretend to Judge the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the other two, the Judgment of the whole must either reside
in a Superiour power, or the discord must terminate in the ruine of them
all. For if one of the three incroach too far, there is so much lost in the
Balance of the Estates, and so much more Arbitrary power in one; 'Tis as
certain in Politiques, as in Nature; That where the Sea prevails the Land
loses. If no such discord should arise, my Authors Argument is of no
farther use: for where the Soveraign and Parliament agree, there can be no
deluding of the People; So, that in short, his quarrel is to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government.</p>
            <p>And we see what nettles him, That the King has learnt from the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
example of his Father, not to perpetuate a Parliament. But he will tell
you, that they desire only a lasting Parliament, which may dispatch all
causes necessary and proper for the publick: And I Answer him, that it
lyes in themselves to make it so. But who shall Judge when it shall be
proper to put an end to such a Parliament? there is no farther Answer left
him; but only, that the Reason of things is the only Rule: for when all
necessary causes are dispatch'd, then is the proper time of Dissolution.
But if you mark it, this Argumentation is still running in a Circle. For
the Parliament, that is the House of Commons, would constitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Judges of this reason of things; and of what causes were necessary
to be dispatch'd. So that my Author had as good have laid down this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48938:11"/>
bare-fac'd, that a Parliament ought never to be Dissolved, till an
House of Commons would fit no longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Author goes on scoffingly,</hi> That he has nothing to say for those angry
men <hi>(he means of his own Party)</hi> whose particular Designs are disappointed;
only that they might have kept their places; and that he can find no difference
betwixt them who are out, and those who are put in, but that the former could
have ruin'd us, and would not: and these cannot if they would.</p>
            <p>I am willing to let them pass as lightly as he pleases: Angry they are,
and they know the Proverb. I hope I may have leave to observe transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that none but angry men, that is, such as hold themselves disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
at Court, are the Pillars of his Party. And where are then the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Vertue, Honour and Religion, which they would persuade the
World, have animated their endeavours for the publick? What were they
before they were thus Angry? or what would they be, could they make
so firm an Interest in Court, that they might venture themselves in that
bottom? This, the whole Party cannot choose but know; for Knaves
can easily smell out one another. My Author, an experienced man, makes
but very little difference, betwixt those who are out, and those who are
put in. But the Nation begins to be awake: his party is mouldring
away, and as it falls out, in all dishonest Combinations, are suspecting each
other so very fast, that every man is shifting for himself, by a separate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and looking out for a Plank in the common Shipwrack, so that the
point is turn'd upon him; those who are out, would have ruin'd us, and
cou'd not; and those who are in, are endeavouring to save us if they can.</p>
            <p>My Adversary himself, now drawing to a conclusion, seems to be inclining
to good opinions: and as dying men, are much given to repentance, so finding
his cause at the last gasp, he unburthens his Conscience and disclaims the
principles of a Common-wealth, both for himself, and for both Houses of
Parliament, which is indeed to be over-officious: for one of the Houses
will not think they have need of such a Compurgator. But he wisely
fears no change of Government from any, but the Papists. Now I am of a
better heart, for I fear it neither from Papists nor Presbyterians. Whether
Democracy will agree with Jesuitical principles in <hi>England</hi> I am not certain;
but I can easily prove to him, that no Government but a Common-wealth
is accommodated to the Systeme of Church-worship invented by <hi>Iohn
Calvin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Declaration concludes, that the King is resolv'd to govern in all things by the
Laws: And here the Author of the Answer, is for frisking out into a fit of Joy, which
looks as aukward with his gravity, as ever was King <hi>David</hi>'s dancing before the Ark.
This similitude I hope has pleas'd hin; if it does not, <hi>Esop</hi>'s Ass stands ready Sadled at
the door. But a melancholick consideration has already pour'd cold water in his Porredge,
for all promises he says, <hi>are either kept or broken:</hi> well-fare a good old Proverb. I could find
in my heart to cap it with another, <hi>that the old Woman had never look'd for her Daughter in
the Oven, if she had not been there her self before.</hi> But if the King should keep his word, as
all but his Enemies conclude he will, then we shall see Annual Parliaments sit longer I
hope; when they meddle only with their proper business. They will lose their time
no more, in cutting off the Succession, altering the course of Nature, and directing the
providence of God, before they know it. We shall have no uniting of Sects against the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor of Counties against the next Heir of the Crown. The King shall
then be advis'd by his Parliament, when both Houses concur in their advice. There shall
be no more need of Declarations about the dissolving of Parliaments; and no more need
of factious Fools to answer them; But the People shall be happy, the King shall be supply'd
the Alliances shall be supported, and my suppos'd Author be made a Bishop, and renounce
the Covenant. That many of these things may happen, is the wish of every loyal Subject,
