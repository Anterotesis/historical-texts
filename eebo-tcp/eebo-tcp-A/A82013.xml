            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have here given you a Short but Perfect Account of one Father <hi>Andrews</hi> a Jeſuit, ſometimes Inhabiting at a place called <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> in <hi>Monmouth-ſhire,</hi> and ſometimes at his Brothers, <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi>'s Houſe in the Pariſh of <hi>Skenfreth,</hi> about eight Miles diſtant from <hi>Hardwick</hi> in the ſame County. Upon the Diſcovery of the late Plot, Warrants being iſſued out by ſeveral Juſtices of the Peace, for the Apprehending of the ſaid Father <hi>Andrews</hi>; ſo that he was forced to abſcond from thoſe places above mentioned, and fled into an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Wood, where he lay <hi>Incognito,</hi> for the ſpace of Three Months and upwards; his Food being conveyed to him by a Servant Boy, which his Brother ſent daily to him. He finding that place not to agree well with his Conſtitution, one <hi>Hills</hi> a Prieſt and a Viſiter of his, got him a Private Lodging in a poor Widdows Houſe, whoſe name was <hi>Jane Harris. Hills</hi> came often to Viſit him during the ſpace of three or four Days. The poor Woman was imployed by <hi>Hills</hi> to go ſeveral times to a Butchers, (who lived in a ſmall Village about half a Mile diſtant) to buy Meat for Father <hi>Andrews</hi>; ſhe was not to buy much at a time, becauſe he muſt have it Freſh and Freſh; the ſight of a Large Joint was enough to have taken away his Stomack, being a weakly man, and much ſtricken in Years. This Butcher taking notice of this Poor Womans coming ſo often to him to buy Meat, which formerly ſhe did not uſe to do: for ſhe was not in a Condition to buy it for her ſelf; he took an occaſion to ask her who it was for; She ingeniouſly confeſſed, that it was for an Antient Gentleman who was newly come to lodge at her houſe; whereupon the Butcher ſuſpecting that he muſt be either a Prieſt or a Jeſuit, preſently went to one Mr. <hi>Arnal</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, (and a great Proſecutor of the Papiſts) and gave him Information what the Woman had ſaid, upon which Mr. <hi>Arnal</hi> went himſelf with ſeveral of his Servants, and ſome Neighbours to ſearch the Houſe; but old Father <hi>Andrews,</hi> having ſome private notice of it,

made his Eſcape before they came. The Widdow Woman was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined what became of the Old Gentleman which Lodged at her Houſe; ſhe ſaid he was newly gone, but whither ſhe did not know, he was a Stranger to her, and had been there but four days. The Juſtice Committed the Woman to the Common Goal of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske,</hi> for the ſaid County, where ſhe now remains. After this Eſcape Mr. <hi>Arnal</hi> could hear no more of him, till about the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> laſt; and then a Farmer living at <hi>Wengothan</hi> near <hi>Abergaveny</hi>; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion to lay ſome Hay in a Barn of his, which was formerly a Chappel belonging to ſome Abby or Priory; and there clearing away ſome old Stubble-Straw to make room for the Hay, under which he found a place digg'd like a Grave, and newly filled up; whereupon he was at firſt ſurpriſed, and could not tell what to do, at laſt he thought it his beſt way to go to a Juſtice of the Peace, and Inform him of it, ſuppoſing ſomebody might have been Murthered and Buried there. The Juſtice preſently Ordered the place to be ſearched; and there they found the Corps of a Man who had been newly Buried; he had no Coffin, only a Sheet wrapt about him, with a Croſs made of Wax on his Stomach, with ſeveral <hi>Beads, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes,</hi> and other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Fopperies about him. Then preſently the <hi>Coroner</hi> was ſent for, and called a Jury of <hi>Inqueſt,</hi> who ſate and found the Body had been poyſoned, for it was very much ſwell'd. The Body was expoſed to publick view, for two or three days; in which time it was diſcovered, that it was the Body of the aforeſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrews</hi> the Jeſuite. Search was preſently made, to ſee if they coul'd find out how he came to be Buried in that place, and how he came to his End; but it could not be done, ſo that 'tis thought he was privately conveyed thither in the Night, and there Buried, becauſe it was Antiently a Religious Place. This is a Juſt Account, I am,</p>
