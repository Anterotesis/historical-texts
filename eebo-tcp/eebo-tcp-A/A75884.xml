            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Brethren, When I enter into a ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what the flock of God gone before endured in their dayes, not onely by cruel <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Deridings,</hi> and <hi>Evil Speakings,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Whipings, Impriſonments, Buffettings, Baniſhments,</hi> and <hi>painful Deaths, Patiently, Chearfully, Readily</hi> and <hi>Willingly;</hi> And all this that they might <hi>keep a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> in order to their

            </p>
            <p>I ſay, The ſerious conſideration of this, is that which doth much encourage me, notwithſtanding the <hi>many difficulties</hi> of this our day, to take up a reſolution, to go on in my Chriſtian progreſſe by Divine aſſiſtance, and not to look back, leſt with <hi>Lots wife, I become a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monument of Gods everlaſting Diſpleaſure;</hi> and therefore, theſe are earneſtly to deſire you alſo in Gods Fear, to perſevere in that Path, and to run ſwiftly towards perfection, in that race you have already made ſome progreſs in, beginning at <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.

               </hi> Therefore let us look <hi>unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the joy that was ſet before</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119310:3"/>
               <hi>him, endured the <hi>croſſe,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed</hi> the <hi>ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. Who is the <hi>Captain</hi> of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and was made <hi>perfect</hi> through <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
               </hi> Heb. 2. 10. <hi>Who was led as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before the ſhearer was <hi>dumb,</hi>
               </hi> ſo <hi>opened he not his mouth,</hi> Acts 8. 32. <hi>For even <hi>hereunto</hi> were ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, <hi>leaving</hi> us an example that ye ſhould <hi>follow his ſteps,</hi> who did no ſin, neither was <hi>guile found in his Mouth;</hi> who when he was <hi>reviled, reviled not</hi> again, when he <hi>ſuffered,</hi> he <hi>threatned not,</hi> but <hi>committed himſelf to him</hi> that Judgeth Righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11, 12, 13. Therefore ſeeing we have taken his yoak upon us, <hi>let us learn of him who is <hi>Lowly</hi> and <hi>Meek;</hi>
               </hi> and we ſhall find reſt for our Souls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. And let us not think to be above our Maſter, for if they have called the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe <hi>Belzebub,</hi> how much more them of his houſhold? And if they have ſo done to the green Tree, what will they not do to the dry Tree? It is enough for the <hi>Diſciple</hi> to be <hi>as his Maſter,</hi> and the <hi>Servant as his Lord;</hi> And therefore let us conſider what Legacy our Maſter hath left us, who ſaith, That in the World we ſhall have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation; for behold ſaith he, <hi>I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of Wolves, be ye therefore wiſe as Serpents, but harmleſſe as Doves; But beware of men, for they will <hi>deliver</hi> you up to the <hi>Counſels,</hi>—and they will <hi>ſcourge you in their Synagogues,</hi> and ye ſhall be <hi>brought before Governours, and Kings, for my names ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the Gentiles;</hi> And ye ſhall be <hi>hated</hi> of <hi>all men</hi> for my names ſake,</hi> Mat. 10. 16. 18. 22. Yea, <hi>the time will come, that if they ſhall <hi>kill you,</hi> they will think they do <hi>God good ſervice;</hi>
               </hi> and Chriſt hath ſpoken theſe things, <hi>that we ſhould not be offended, John</hi> 16. 12.</p>
            <p>Therefore in <hi>our patience let us poſſeſſe our Souls;</hi> And bleſſed is he that ſhall not be offended in him; <hi>for our light afflictions which are but for a <hi>Moment,</hi> worketh for us a <hi>far more exceeding</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>eternal weight <hi>of</hi> Glory; <hi>whileſt we</hi> look on <hi>the things which are</hi> not ſeen,</hi> and <hi>not on the things that are <hi>ſeen,</hi> for the things that <hi>are ſeen</hi> are <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> but the <hi>things</hi> that are <hi>not ſeen,</hi> they <hi>eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although <hi>no chaſtening at the preſent ſeemeth <hi>joyous but grievous,</hi> yet nevertheleſſe afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> unto them that are exerciſed thereby, Heb. 12. 11.</hi> And were it not (that to the rejoycing of my ſoul) I heard that your Joy is full, as well in <hi>Newgate, White-Lyon, Maydſtone, Alisbury,</hi> and in all other Priſon-Holes, as it is ſuper-abounding in the dark <hi>Gate-houſe Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with us; I ſhould then have deſired that the Hands hanging down, and the feeble knees ſhould have been held up and ſtrengthened; but ſeeing I hear that Faith is every where upon the Wing, and that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119310:4"/>
Omni-preſent God is pleaſed to viſit us in all our <hi>Priſon-holes,</hi> with the incomings of his <hi>comforting Spirit,</hi> even to joy unſpeakable and full of <hi>Glory:</hi> I ſhall conclude with our Apoſtle, and ſay, and that upon a good account to, that by the good hand of our God upon us, I ſee it is given unto us in the behalf of Chriſt, not onely to <hi>believe,</hi> but alſo to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for his name ſake; And herein we have cauſe to joy and rejoyce in the Lord, who by the incomings of his Spirit, hath ſupported both you and us in this Tryal, ſo as that we can with his people of old, <hi>joy in <hi>tribulations,</hi> knowing that tribulations <hi>worketh patience,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> Experience, and Experience Hope, and Hope maketh not aſhamed, <hi>becauſe the Love of God is ſpread abroad in our Hearts.</hi>
               </hi> So that we can with our Apoſtle upon a good account ſay, that, <hi>Though we are troubled on every ſide, <hi>yet not deſtreſſed,</hi> we are perplexed, <hi>yet not in deſpair,</hi> perſecuted <hi>but not forſaken,</hi> caſt down <hi>but not deſtroyed,</hi> alwayes bearing about in our Body the dying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for we which live, are alwayes delivered unto death for Jeſus ſake;</hi> And therefore let every ſoul of us, in ſingleneſſe of heart, eye Gods Glory in our preſent ſufferings, and take up that good reſolution of our aged and faithful brother <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 21. 13. And ſay (if thereto called) that we are willing in the behalf of Chriſt, not onely to be bound and lie in bonds, but alſo to die for his Name ſake.</p>
            <p>And this is that which is the rejoycing of my ſoul, that in the midſt of theſe Sufferings, both by you and us, <hi>I</hi> cannot hear of one man of our Society, that is found an evil doer in what is charged upon us, as to plotting, contriving or undermining, or in any Act of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in diſturbing the Peace of the Nation; for herein we can ſafely and upon a good account appeal to our God, the ſearcher of all hearts, and can with confidence and boldneſſe, in the faithfulneſſe of our ſouls, to the faces of the greateſt of men, affirm and ſay, <hi>We are not guilty of what we are charged withal, and that we are oppreſſed in Judgements, and are injuriouſly torn from our callings and Families, and moſt barbarouſly penned up in Priſon-holes; and my ſelf &amp; ſome others of our Society, thruſt into a damp, dark dirty Dungeon, without either Light or Air, Bed or Bedding, firſt nine, and after twelve of us together, ſcarce able to lie down one by another;</hi> being thus uſed, <hi>not for what we have done, but for what we are; nor for what is found in our Houſes, as to Arms or Ammunition:</hi> And that you may be ſatisfied in a meaſure with the truth of what my Sufferings are and have been in this juncture of time, in this our cruel leading into captivity; <hi>I</hi> ſhall lay down ſomething upon the account of report, &amp; alſo upon the account of Action.

as for falſe rumors raiſed upon me, <hi>I</hi> was reported to ſay, <hi>That I hoped to waſh my hands in the Kings Blood;</hi> this was raiſed by one Hopping <hi>Jane,</hi> commonly ſo called, a notorious drunken ſwearing perſon, whoſe common converſation is, to go ranting, raving and ſinging like a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam along the ſtreets, (to the admiration of thoſe that know her not) pulling and haling Gentlemen as they go along the ſtreets, to get money of them, to buy Ale to drink the Kings health; and this was reported that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay at my ſhop door, on Wedneſday morning, the ninth day of the eleventh Moneth, vulgarly called <hi>January,</hi> 1660. when <hi>I</hi> was not down my ſtairs in the ſhop all that morning, as <hi>I</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by three Witneſſes to the <hi>French Papiſh Fencer,</hi> that carried me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for ſaying theſe words after he, and they that were with him, had ſearched my houſe for Arms; the which words, or any other tending to that, or any ſuch horrid and wicked tendancy, God the ſearcher of all hearts knows, <hi>I</hi> never entertained ſo much as a thought of in the leaſt; and for my tongue to utter that which never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my thoughts, ſeemeth to me a very ſtrange thing, the which ſhe her ſelf hath ſince ſaid to my Wife, before ſome that heard her words, as to that particular, was not ſo.</p>
            <p>It is alſo further reported by others far and near, <hi>That I my ſelf, that ſaid Wedneſday night, had killed one of the Conſtables Watch-men;</hi> when <hi>I</hi> was in cuſtody as is aforeſaid, by nine of the clock in the morning, and was that night with ſome forty more upon the main Guard at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and was ſent on Thurſday morning to the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> Priſon <hi>Dungeon,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> now am.</p>
            <p>And further, it is commonly reported, that in my houſe when it was ſearched, <hi>There were ſeveral Arms and Ammunition found, with Barrels of Gun-powder; and that there was a Barrel of white Gun-powder left at one</hi> Mr. Horſes <hi>houſe in</hi> Stannop-<hi>ſtreet, a Coach-maker, to be conveyed to me;</hi> When in truth <hi>I</hi> had no Arms at all, nor any manner of Powder; but was ſo far from any ſuch thing, as that <hi>I</hi> can boldly affirm it in the preſence of God, that <hi>I</hi> have not had, nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo much as a defenſive Weapon this fifteen or ſixteen years.</p>
            <p>And in 1659. <hi>I</hi> declared againſt the acting with the Carnal Weapon, and pleaded the unlawfulneſſe thereof, as by the ſaid Declaration, in the end of my <hi>Fannatick's Mite caſt into the Kings Treaſury,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. More <hi>I</hi> might ſay as to Matter of Report, but <hi>I</hi> ſhall forbear and let you know, that my houſe was ſearched nine ſeveral times, twice before <hi>I</hi> was taken into Cuſtody, and ſeven times after <hi>I</hi> was in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and ſix times of that ſeven in one night, and by ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>So that I may ſay as to the malice of men, I am ſet up as</hi>

            <p>For I know nothing on my part as a Cauſe of it, unleſs in my <hi>Fannaticks Mite,</hi> my bearing my Teſtimony againſt the Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Times, in ſaying what I ſay therein, as to the madneſs of the rude Multitude; And in the revived and daily continued Acts of Folly in Stage-Playes, and the many bitter Oaths and Execrations uttered by unlawful Game-Players, &amp; in the abominations of Dammy and Debauch'd Bawdy-houſes, the foul deteſtable ſhame of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom; or in what I ſay in <hi>Page</hi> 49, 50, 51. of that <hi>Mite,</hi> in that Uſe of Examination to the Nation, Conſidered as a Nation; Or at my down-right and ſingle-hearted Concluſion of my <hi>Epiſtle</hi> therein to the <hi>KING</hi> Dedicated; Or in my <hi>After-Writing</hi> to the <hi>KING,</hi> in that I give Him ſome <hi>REASONS,</hi> why <hi>I</hi> could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Swear nor Fight for Him: If theſe, or any thing of this kind, Cauſeth them thus to become mine Enemy, becauſe <hi>I</hi> tell them and Him the Truth; if it be this that renders me vile in their Eyes, <hi>I</hi> muſt let them know in the words and <hi>Reſolution</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, <hi>If this be to be vile, I according to the Ability received, ſhall be yet more vile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall proceed to Diſcover to you what was Acted, as to Searching my Houſe, and by what manner of Perſons, that ſo you may be ſenſible, whither we are Poſting, if they were legally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated.</p>
            <p>The Second time that my Houſe was Searched, was by one <hi>John Goſling,</hi> a known Papiſt, and Servant to Mr. <hi>Hillyard</hi> an Apothecary in <hi>Long-Aker,</hi> who beyond his Commiſſion (if he had one) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away (he and his Party and Confederacy, Captain <hi>Wharton</hi> and others) near 30 of my <hi>Fannaticks Mite,</hi> and got Two ſhillings in Money of me, pretending it for the Souldiers. And about a Week after, Captain <hi>Wharton</hi> and another of them, came and took forcibly out of my Houſe, Two more of my Books, demanding more; which he would have had, had there been any ready.</p>
            <p>And the next time that my Houſe was Searched, was when I was taken into Cuſtody, and that was by <hi>Mounſeir Lawrence</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> a Papiſt, who keepeth a <hi>Fencing School</hi> in <hi>Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nnop-ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next was by Mounſeir <hi>De la Mane,</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> and a known Papiſt, living in <hi>Long-Aker,</hi> a Gilt-Leather man.</p>
            <p>The next time, or Another time, by one Mr. <hi>Kirbey,</hi> a Cloth-Drawer, in our own ſtreet; a known Papiſt alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:119310:5"/>And another time by <hi>Anthony Welch,</hi> a limping Porter, living in Mr. <hi>Roberd's</hi> Celler, in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> near <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet;</hi> whoſe horrid Oaths, Execrations and Debauch'd Actions, both to us, to Mris. <hi>Whitaker, Richard Day,</hi> and others, do beſpeak him to be no better than an Athieſt.</p>
            <p>And as if all theſe Actions and Reports, were not enough to render me and you ſufficiently odious to the view of the World, the weekly News-monger, Falſly, Injuriouſly, and moſt Ignomineouſly in his weekly Pamphlet, hath Branded us with that moſt Stigmatical Title of Traytors.</p>
            <p>To whom <hi>I</hi> would give this Chriſtian Caution, that for the time to come, <hi>he take a ſpecial care of venting and inventing Lies,</hi> leſt the Lord Chriſt ſay One day to Him, as once He ſaid to ſome of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> fleſhly Seed, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. Ye are of your father the Devil, and the works of your father ye will do; he was a Murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the Truth, becauſe there is no Truth in him; when he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own, for he is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and the Father of it; And therefore <hi>I</hi> would have him further to conſider the ſhame of it, for as <hi>the Lip of Truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever, ſo the <hi>lying Lip is but for a moment,</hi>
               </hi> Prov. 12. 19. <hi>And as a Righteous man hateth lying, ſo a wicked man is loathſome, and cometh to ſhame,</hi> Prov. 13. 5.</p>
            <p>And if we may believe the wiſeſt of men, he telleth us, <hi>that he that <hi>hideth hatred</hi> with <hi>lying Lips,</hi> and he that uttereth <hi>a ſlander,</hi> is a Fool,</hi> Prov. 10. 18.</p>
            <p>And farther, I would have him conſider the great danger of it; for firſt, <hi>lying Lips <hi>are an</hi> Abomination <hi>to the Lord, but they that deal tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are his delight,</hi>
               </hi> Prov. 12. 22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe <hi>ſix things the Lord <hi>hateth,</hi> yea, ſeven are an <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> unto him, a proud look, a <hi>lying Tongue,</hi> and Hands that ſhed <hi>Innocent Blood,</hi> an Heart that deviſeth wicked Imaginations, Feet that be ſwift in running to Miſchief, <hi>a falſe Witneſſe that ſpeaketh Lies, and him that ſoweth Diſcord amongſt Brethren,</hi> Proverbs</hi> 6. 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It will exclude him Heavens Glory; <hi>For without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters;</hi> and whoſoever <hi>loveth and maketh a Lie,</hi> Rev. 22. 15. <hi>For there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh Abomination, or <hi>maketh a Lie,</hi> but they which are written in the Lambs Book of Life,</hi> Rev. 21. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Fearful, and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119310:6"/>
               <hi>and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and <hi>all Lyars,</hi> ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimstone, which is the ſecond death,</hi> Rev. 21. 8.</p>
            <p>But leaving the man to conſider of his wicked action, in ſuffering his Pen to run to that exceſſe, that cauſeth men to raiſe falſe reports upon the Innocent; I ſhall in love to his ſoul, earneſtly deſire him to ſet himſelf upon the effectual work of Repentance, that ſo he may make his peace before he go hence and be no more; that when time ſhall be no more, he may then have a well-being with him, who gives a being to all beings, in that Kingdom that ſhall never fade away; the which that you my Brethren and I may make ſure, let us work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, and let us not be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but be followers of them, who thorow Faith and Patience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. And let us be found in Gods Way, doing Gods Work, being Fortified with Chriſtian Courage and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, following the foot-ſteps of the flock of God gone before us, not at all fearing what man can do unto us; for this is the requirement of our Lord and Maſter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. Who ſaith, <hi>Fear not him that can kill the Body onely, and afterwards can do no more, but rather fear him, that after he hath killed the Body, can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell, I ſay, Fear him:</hi> And in his Fear, let us be found in well-doing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring as much as in us lyeth, to ſee that the Peace and Welfare of the Nation be ſecured; For if every mans particular intereſt be involved in the General Good, then it ſtands every particular man in hand, to ſtudy the Good, Peace, Safety and Welfare of the whole.</p>
            <p>To this end, let us take the advice of our Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. Even as good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, to endure hardſhip, and take to us the whole Armor of God, that we may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all, to ſtand; let us ſtand therefore, having our <hi>Loyns</hi> girt about with <hi>Truth,</hi> and having on the <hi>Breſt-plate</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and our <hi>Feet ſhod</hi> with the <hi>Preparation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> above all, taking the <hi>Shield</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> wherewith we ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked; and take the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> praying with all Prayers and Supplication for all Saints, <hi>Epheſ. </hi> 6. 13. <hi> &amp;c.</hi> and for all men, for Kings, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. yea, for our very enemies, and all that hate us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. and of them that perſecute us, let us cry out, and ſay, in the Words of that Holy Martyr and Brother <hi>Stephen, Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge, Acts</hi> 7. 60. and in the Words of our Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119310:6"/>
and Maſter, <hi>John</hi> 13. 13. the Captain of our Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. our Elder Brother, <hi>Heb. </hi> 2. 11. <hi> Let us cry out and ſay, Father forgive them, they know not what they do, Luk.</hi> 23. 34.</p>
            <p>And thus being <hi>furniſhed with the Armour of Righteouſneſſe, on the right Hand, and on the left, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 7. Let us behave our ſelves manfully, fighting the Lords Battel, even to the reſiſting unto Blood, ſtriving againſt ſin, <hi>Heb. 12. 4. striving together for the <hi>Faith of the Goſpel,</hi> Phil.</hi> 1. 27. not for the <hi>Wealth, Pomp, Pleaſure, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Preferment, Power</hi> nor <hi>Dominions</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> neither in the behalf of our ſelves nor others, no not in the behalf of our Lord and Maſter <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> to ſet <hi>Him up as King;</hi> For though I do really believe that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall Perſonally Reign, yet his Kingdom is not to be ſet up as ſome would have it; For the ſeventh Angel Sounded, and there were great Voices in Heaven, ſaying, <hi>The Kingdoms of this World, are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, and He ſhall reign for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
            <p>For the ſtone that was cut out of the Mountain without hands, that ſmote the <hi>Image</hi> on the Feet, became a <hi>great Mountain,</hi> and <hi>filled the whole earth,</hi> Dan. 2. 35. <hi>And this was the confidence of that Holy Man, Job</hi> 19. 25. For ſaith he, <hi>I believe that my Redeemer liveth, and that <hi>he ſhall ſtand at the laſt day upon the earth:</hi>
               </hi> So alſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Zech. 14. 4.

               </hi> even to the <hi>ends of the earth; <hi>for he muſt reign, till he hath put all</hi> enemies under his Feet;</hi> the laſt <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <hi>that ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> is Death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25, 26. Yet this Kingdom ſhall not be ſet up by force of Arms, neither ſhall his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants prepare it for him, <hi>but he</hi> for them; for ſo ſaith he himſelf, <hi>John 14. 2. In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions, And I go to prepare a place for you; And I will <hi>come to you again,</hi> and <hi>receive you to my ſelf,</hi> that <hi>where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi>
               </hi> And therefore <hi>he ſpake unto them a Parable, <hi>becauſe</hi> he was nigh to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>becauſe</hi> they thought that the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> ſhould <hi>immediately appear.</hi> And a certain <hi>Noble-man,</hi> went into a <hi>far Countrey;</hi> to <hi>receive for himſelf a Kingdom, and to return,</hi> Luke</hi> 19. 11, 12. So that he ſhall give the Kingdom to them, if we may believe himſelf; for ſaith he, <hi>Fear not, <hi>little Flock,</hi> for it is your <hi>Fathers good pleaſure</hi> to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luke 12. 32. <hi>And <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as</hi> my Father hath <hi>appointed</hi> unto <hi>me,</hi> that ye may eat and drink at my Table;</hi>

               <hi>in my <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and ſit on Thrones, Judging the twelve Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Luke 22. 29.</p>
            <p>But we are yet in the Kingdom of Chriſts Patience, and not in the Kingdom of his Power; for if we may believe himſelf, he telleth us, <hi>John 18. That his Kingdom is not of this World; for this is</hi> Eſaus <hi>Kingdom;</hi> And ſo ſaith the Lord to <hi>Eſdras, For when</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>were born unto</hi> Iſaac, Jacobs <hi>hand held faſt the Heel of</hi> Eſau; <hi>for</hi> Eſau <hi>is the End of this World, and</hi> Jacob <hi>is the Beginning of that which is to come,</hi> 2 Eſdras 6. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is <hi>Eſau,</hi> or the evil ones Kingdom; for Satan is the god of this World; And ſo ſaith our Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3, 4.

Ye Luſt, and have not, ye kill, and deſire to have, and cannot obtain; ye <hi>Fight</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> yet ye have not, becauſe ye ask not; ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs; ye <hi>Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Adultereſſes,</hi> know ye not, that the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> is <hi>emnity with God;</hi> Whoſoever therefore will be a <hi>friend to the World, is an enemy to God,</hi>

                  <p>THat the Magiſtrates in every Province, by the Command of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tyrannical Emperors, did cruelly and grievouſly Oppreſs the Chriſtians, and brought them to Martyrdom, in ſo much that Godly Men were very ſcarce; At which <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was much troubled; who when he came to Succeed in the Empire, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſire to try his Courtiers <hi>(ſaith the ſtory)</hi> he began to contrive a ſtrong and Admirable Plot; for he Granted Free leave to all his Officers, and Men of Dignity, to offer Sacrifices unto Devils; and yet to give their Attendance in Court, and keep their Places; And thoſe that would not perform thoſe accurſed Sacrifices ſhould be baniſhed the Court and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed his Service: Whereupon his Courtiers being divided into a double Faction, preſently Diſcovered their Minds and Affections: And many were the number of Idolaters; whereupon this worthy <hi>Conſtantius</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his own Plot, he Reproved thoſe that were fearful and deſirous to keep their Places, Approving and Commending the other for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Gods Cauſe, Rejecting the Idolaters as Traytors to God, and not worthy of his Service: For how <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> can they be Faithful to me their Emperour, who have Revolted from their God?
