            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet conſidering better of the moſt ſeditious driftes and deuiliſh perſuaſions cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueyed in the argument of this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flet, vnder the cloak and ſhadovve of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

by meanes of vvhich title it might happly obtaine the more credit, if the fraud vvere not detected, I thought it a thing verie neceſſarie, to diſcouer and lay open to the vvorld, the ſlye &amp; ſubtile dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>D.

VVherby you may euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, that not only our wars in the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but thoſe alſo by Sea, which <hi>D. Allen</hi> ſo defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (if we did mainteine any ſuch warres) or anie other warres which wee ſhould vndertake againſt the K. of <hi>Spaine,</hi> are both iuſt and lawfull, euen by his owne allowance, beeing for our owne defenſe, and the procurement of our own peace and ſafetie.</p>
               <p>Further, becauſe <hi>D. Allen</hi> ſhall haue no ſhew of<note place="margin">Another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t drawn from D. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len himſelfe alſo, to proue the King of Spaine our enemy.</note> reaſon left him, whereby hee may cauill vpon the word, ſaying that we cannot iuſtifie our wars to be for defenſe againſt enemies, the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> beeing (as he termeth him) our neighbour, allie, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate: albeit it is a thing not needfull to bee proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor doeth anie way concerne my argument, (which is moſt ſtrong &amp; infallible without it) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I take vpon me of my ſelfe to affirme the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> to be our enemie, or touch him in anie wiſe with breach of his league &amp; confederacie with vs; yet to ſtoppe <hi>M. Allens</hi> mouth with his owne words, that he may (I ſaie) haue nothing to cauill vpon, I will onlie ſet himſelfe to anſwere himſelfe in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the kings rebels againſt their moſt iuſt Lord, &amp; Souereigne, is no lawfull, nor hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quarrel of warres: neither haue the ſaid traitors</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:9681:16"/>

               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>D. Allen</hi> termeth vs the K. of <hi>Spaines</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuis.</hi>
                  </note> and if wee bee his enemies (as <hi>D. Allen</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) then muſt he neceſſarily bee our enemie in like ſort, for it is a word of <hi>Relation,</hi> which beeing rightly pronounced of the one, muſt alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bee pronounced of the other. For a Prince can not bee ſaid to bee the confederate of him that is his enemie: but they muſt bee both as the one is, either both <hi>Socij,</hi> or both <hi>hoſtes,</hi> both Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, or both enemies. This a very meane ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, nay euerie man of anie reaſon or common ſenſe may perceiue to be true. And I doe not doubt but <hi>D. Allen</hi> himſelfe, when he termed vs the K. of <hi>Spaines</hi> enemies, knew him well inough to bee our enemie.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee not only that <hi>D. Allen</hi> hath failed in the proofe of the one part of his diuiſion, that is: <hi>That our warres are not for defence againſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therfore vnlawfull:</hi> but alſo that we haue prooued the contrarie againſt him, both according to his owne diuiſion, that is: <hi>That our warres are for defence againſt enemies, &amp; therefore lawfull:</hi> &amp; alſo by other reaſons of our owne, that is: <hi>That our warres are for the procurement of our owne peace and ſafetie, and therefore moſt iuſt, and lawfull.</hi> Wherein our proofes &amp; arguments (though they be ſtrong inough of themſelues againſt anie man)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9681:16"/>
yet are they ſtrongeſt againſt him of all men, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawen euen from his owne Allegations, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and aſſertions: and therefore the more to be credited.</p>
               <p>Now come we to the other part, and let vs ſee<note place="margin">The other part which D. Allen is to prooue, of his diuiſion drawen from <hi>Cicero.</hi> D. Allens aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that the King of Spaine hath done vnto her Maieſtie no iniurie. &amp;c.</note> how hee prooueth <hi>The Engliſh warres in the low Countreys not to be mooued for reuenge of iniuries or annoyance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings Maieſtie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath done to the Queene or her Realme no ſuch iniuries, for redreſſe or reuenge whereof ſhee ſhould by hoſtilitie enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Dominions, and ſurpriſe his Townes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and bring his people into her ſubiection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a point wherein I am loth to meddle in vttering what I thinke, or haue heard, yea ſcarcely would I touch that which is commonly bruted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the mouthes of all men, conſidering that the matter concerneth <hi>Princes,</hi> &amp; is not fit for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men to deale in: therfore would I rather refer the iudgement therof to euery mans own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge, opinion, &amp; conſcience. Yet bicauſe it is a part of <hi>D. Allens</hi> argument, which hee muſt not ſo clearly carry away, leaſt it ſhould ſeeme to be yeelded vnto him, as true: I will craue pardon and leaue, only to remember ſome particulars either knowen, or commonly beleeued and reported.</p>
               <p>And firſt I know men of iudgement think it no great kindnes in a Prince to harbour (much leſſe to enterteine &amp; mainteine) within his Dominions the fugitiue Rebels or Traitors of another Prince, his

But theſe (you wil ſaie) are but actions of vnkindnes, not ſuch hainous iniuries. VVell: I would they were leſſe, offences I am ſure they are at the leaſt, &amp; ſuch as fall within one of the kinds of <hi>Iniuſtice and Iniurie.</hi> For greater, it is not fit for me to ſpeake of.</p>

By this reaſon there ſhould no warres be vnlawfull: for there is no warre vndertaken, but that both the Prince which mooueth it, is able, and doth pretend ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (or colour of reaſon) to make it ſeeme iuſt, and the common people alſo, by the Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and perſwaſions, may eaſily be induced to eſteeme it to be lawfull. Wherein by the way I muſt note ſome ſimplicitie, or great diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>D. Allen,</hi> which would admit the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or vnlawfulnes of warres, to be meaſured by the opinion of the common people, who (God wot) are furtheſt from the knowledge of State matters, and the ſecret dealings which paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes, and from the conſideration of the iniuries and occaſions of warre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vnmeeteſt of all men to be iudges of the lawfulnes thereof.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer it be deemed lawfull, whether by the common people, or by the better and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort, and ſuch as are moſt priuie to the ſecrets of the State, vpon the Princes credit, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if it be in trueth vniuſt; neither can the<note place="margin">No compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betweene thinges ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply iuſt, and things onely deemed iuſt.</note> warre it ſelfe bee in anye ſort equalled with that warre, which is indeede lawfull, neither can th'executions thereof be allowed and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified

as th'executions of a lawfull warre. For the one is ſimply iuſt, and th'other ſimply vniuſt. And howſoeuer the ſubiect preſuming a thing to be iuſt vpon the Princes credit, perſwadeth himſelfe that he doth no iniuſtice, becauſe hee knoweth not that which he doth, to be vniuſt: yet is his action in it ſelfe neuer the leſſe vniuſt: for, <hi>ignorantia non excuſat peccatum.</hi>

politike, yea euen vnto themſelues? For what can bee more contrarye to it ſelfe, then firſt to ſay that reſtitution of thinges wrongfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined and vniuſtly deteined, is to be made, vnder paine of mortall ſinne and damnation (wherein is plainely implyed by himſelfe that both wrongfull obteining, and vniuſt deteining,<note place="margin">D.

A thing being iuſtly &amp; lawfully gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it be vniuſt &amp; vnlawfull?</p>
               <p>For better diſtinction of the actions, let vs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be in diſtinct and ſeueral perſons. Is not he that robbeth a man, and taketh away his goods, in as great fault, both by <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> lawes, as he that receiueth and poſſeſſeth<note place="margin"> The wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of goods as as great, or rather a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinne, then the wrongful withholding of the ſame goods.</note> them? Nay rather in greater: for we account him principall, the other but acceſſarie: and by great reaſon. For if the goods had not beene firſt wrongfully taken, they could neuer haue bene wrongfully deteined. So the vniuſt taking was the thing that made the deteining vniuſt: &amp; (euen by the rules of <hi>Philoſophie) Quicquid efficit tale, id ipſum eſt magis tale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the taking away of goods be a greater offenſe, or but as great, as the deteining of them, what is then the taking away of libertie, yea of life? Vndoubtedly, vnleſſe we will hold with <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricus</hi> the opinion of the <hi>Stoiks, omnia peccata eſſe aequalia,</hi> which opinion the holy church hath

               <p>What man then, that is of any iudgment, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſenſe, will giue credit to his doctrine, or thinke him to be an honeſtman, <note n="*" place="margin">Note the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere dealing of D.

               <p>But becauſe I thinke it more expedient to ſatiſfie other men (ſuch as wil with reaſon be ſatiſfied) then neceſſarie to anſwere your ſlanders, I will not ſtand wholy vpon thoſe aduantages.

                  <hi>not reskue and defend other men, from the iniuries offered them, if they be able.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of theſe two kinds of <hi>Iniustice,</hi> the one was exerciſed by the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> vpon the people of the low Countries (as they ſaie themſelues, for I, for my part, will not imitate the example of <hi>D.

               <p>Now if it be a principall point of <hi>Iniuſtice</hi> for a man not to defend and ſuccour them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried, if he be able, and ſo farre foorth as hee is able to doe it: then it followeth a <hi>contrarijs,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, for further confirmation thereof, I reaſon thus: Beſides the obedience and ſubiection which <hi>God</hi> hath commanded in the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be done vnto Princes, hee hath further forbidden all men <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 22. 28.

Whereby it maie be cleare and manifeſt vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man, that hath any ſenſe of <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> in him, that <hi>God</hi> hauing in theſe former places of <hi>Scripture</hi> expreſly forbidden all men to curſe in thought, or to ſpeake euill of the King, much more to curſe him openly or to bereaue him of his kingdome, doeth not therefore in anie place of <hi>Scripture</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or authoriſe anie man (contrarie to this inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition) to curſe, excommunicate, and depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">What <hi>God</hi> commandeth in one place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> he doth not countermand in another: neither are the <hi>Scriptures</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Firſt concerning <hi>Ioiada,</hi> as he was high prieſt,<note place="margin">The <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both the perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and caſes.</note> ſo was he alſo the Priace of his tribe, and thereby had more authoritie to deale in the ſtate of that kingdome, then the <hi>Pope</hi> can haue to deale in a forreine kingdome.

But it is very well knowne, that the Queenes Maieſtie is no vſurper, but a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">The <hi>Queenes Maieſtie</hi> knowne to be a lawfull prince, no vſurper.</note> Prince, neither came to the crowne by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch wicked meanes, but by due right of inheritaunce: So is there as great oddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her caſe and <hi>Athaliaes,</hi> as betweene the authority of <hi>Ioiada,</hi> and of the <hi>Pope:</hi> And the caſes being vnlike, the <hi>conſequent</hi> cannot be good. For though an vſurper may lawfully be depoſed, and ſlaine, yet it followeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a rightfull Prince may: and though the chiefe Princes and States of a countrey vnited together, may aide and aſsiſt the lawfull King to place him in his throne, and to put downe the vſurper: yet doth it not follow, that a prieſt, which is a meere ſtraunger to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, may therefore thruſt a lawfull Prince out of his kingdome.</p>
               <p>And as little reaſon as there is in his <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>

ſo litle truth is there in the antecedent.

               </p>
               <p>So it appeareth by the very text itſelfe, that <hi>Athalia</hi> was neither depoſed nor ſlaine by <hi>Ioiada,</hi> nor by his authority, but by the Nobles &amp; whole ſtate of the countrey, and by the authoritye of the rightfull king, whom they firſtcrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, annointed, and proclaimed: neither did

               <p>But (ſaith <hi>D. Allen) Iehu</hi> receiued authority and commiſſion ſo to do, from <hi>Eliſeus</hi> the prophet: &amp;

therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> may giue (and conſequently hath himſelfe) authoritie to depoſe and kill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>I deny your <hi>antecedent (M.

                  <hi>&amp;c: not, Thus ſaith Eliſeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So was it the authority of <hi>God</hi> (and not of a<note place="margin">The houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabell,</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſlaine by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, not of a <hi>prieſt,</hi> or <hi>prophet.</hi>

Now if <hi>D.

               <p>Now for his other example of k. <hi>Saul,</hi> wherby<note place="margin">D. Allens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of k. <hi>Saul</hi> depoſed.</note> he goeth about to inferre, that as <hi>Samuel</hi> depoſed

                  <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> may depoſe Princes: it doth not onely make nothing at all for his purpoſe, but is alſo moſt forcible againſt himſelfe, as ſhall bee moſt plainely declared vnto you.

                  </note> miſtaketh, or rather moſt wickedly belyeth the holy hiſtorie in this, as he hath done in the others: For the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God</hi> rebuked<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.</note>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Saule</hi> from his kingdome, to the great griefe of <hi>Samuel.</hi> So is <hi>D. Allens</hi> argument cleane ouerthrowne in this example aſwell as in the former, vnleſſe he will conclude, that the <hi>Pope</hi>

Our fathers haue conquered other Realmes: and ſhall not wee defend our owne Realme? Our fathers haue been Lords of other Countries: and ſhall we be ſlaues in our owne Countrie? What an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (or rather degeneration) would this bee in vs? how diſhonourable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and Nation? How iuſtlie might all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reproach vs, and all ſucceeding ages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord vs, for vnworthie <hi>Subiects</hi> of ſo worthie a <hi>Prince,</hi> degenerate <hi>Children</hi> of ſo generous <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,</hi> and infamous Inhabitantes of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Countrey?

our ſelues cheerefullie to th'encounter, let vs not reſpect the crie of wife, or childe, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their defenſe: let vs plucke vp our hartes, take vp our armes, and march hardilie to meete with our enimie; let vs fight with him, let vs die vpon him, yea let vs ſeeke him, if he ſeeke not vs.</p>
               <p>We do all owe <hi>God</hi> a death: how ſhall we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pay it, then in hîs quarrell? Our liues are all at our Princes commandement: how can they be better ſpent, then in hêr ſeruice? We are all borne for our countrey: why ſhould we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to die for our countrey? If we die in <hi>Gods</hi> quarrell, we ſhall liue in his kingdome: If we die in our Princes ſeruice, we ſhall liue in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of all poſteritie: If we die in defenſe of our countrey, our renowme ſhall liue for euer. A <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> could ſaie to his <hi>heathen</hi> countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in his age, <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum eſt pro patria mori:</hi>

                  <l>In countreys cauſe to ſpend our vitall breath:</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And ſhall not we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> thinke it moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable for vs, to feare to die in the common cauſe of our <hi>God,</hi> our Prince, and our countrey?<note place="margin">D. Allens own encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Why, <hi>D. Allen</hi> himſelf, in his pamphlet, where he goeth about to diſcourage vs, by admoniſhing vs not to be emboldened by <hi>the Memory of our old Engliſh notorious battailes and victories, which in olde time were comparable to what prouinces or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were moſt famous, nor by th'eſteeme or opinion</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:9681:67"/>
                  <hi>(either true, or partiall) of our preſent ſtrength and courage in England:</hi> what doth he but adde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and courage vnto vs, in ſtirring vs vp aſwell by the examples of our forefathers <hi>victories,</hi> to imitate their vertues, as by the knowledge of our own <hi>ſtrength and courage,</hi> to take hart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vnto vs?</p>
               <p>Let vs then not caſt away that encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which he giueth vs, rather let vs augment it by our own conſtancie of mind, and reſolution. If the ſtrength of our Realme were great in our<note place="margin">Our Realme neuer of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength then now.</note> forefathers times, it is now far greater: Nay, it was neuer ſo great in any <hi>Princes</hi> age, as it is now, God be thanked. And when our realme was not ſo ſtrong, yet hath it conquered other Nations, and was neuer conquered by any, ſo long as it was true within it ſelfe. And nowe, when our forces are greateſt, ſhall our faith bee leaſt? when our ſtate is moſt proſperous, ſhall wee bee moſt miſerable? when our quarrell is moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſhall we bee moſt infamous? No, no, let vs link togither in one mind, in one faith, in one force, let vs ſticke togither, fight togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, die togither, like men, like <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> like true-harted <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> Let vs all and euery one of vs ſhew ourſelues forward in aduauncing this ſeruice of the common cauſe, with our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with our forces, and with our bodies alſo to the vttermoſt, as a great number of our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countreymen in diuers partes of the realme,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:9681:67"/>
yea, whole countyes, cities, and townes, and<note place="margin">The duetiful, and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Londoners</note> namely the honorable citie of <hi>London,</hi> haue done moſt duetifully, louingly, and honorably. Which I do the more willingly remember, not onely for the comfort of my ſelfe, and them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and euery good ſubiect, and to their great honor and commendation, but alſo for an incitement vnto others by their example to be ſtirred vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like duetie and forwardnes. Wherein if we ioyne all, our hartes, armes, and forces togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like true and faithfull ſubiects, I am fully perſwaded our, forrein inuadors, whenſoeuer they come, ſhall find <hi>England</hi> the hoteſt countrey that euer they ſet foote in: We are likely inough to meaſure their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Caſſocks with our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> bowes, and their ſhoulders with our browne billes, before they meaſure our broad cloth with their long pikes. And before it come to that, I doubt not but ſome thouſands of them (<hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our guide) ſhall cary their laſt meſſage vnto their great grandfathers, the next way by water.</p>
               <p>But what do I vſe encouragement to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that<note place="margin">The aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Gods</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, our greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Yet let me adde this to your greateſt comfort, <hi>If God bee with vs, who can bee againſt vs:</hi> And that <hi>God</hi> is with vs in this quarrell, let vs ſtedfaſtly aſſure our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, howſoeuer <hi>D. Allen</hi> perſwade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye: and let him and his partakers knowe that <hi>God</hi> is againſt them, and will bee, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:9681:68"/>
long as they oppoſe themſelues againſt the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his word, the knowlddge of his <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp; the light of his glorious <hi>Goſpell.</hi> And that <hi>God</hi> may be with vs ſtill, and continue with vs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let vs humble ourſelues vnto him dayly and duely, with earneſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hartie <hi>prayer and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> let vs ſerue him continually with a zealous <hi>feare and obedience,</hi> let vs glorifie him inceſſantly with a liuely <hi>faith and conſtancie:</hi> laſtly, let vs giue ourſelues wholy to him, that we may winne him wholy vnto vs.</p>
               <p>So we being his, and he ours, let vs all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs, comfort ourſelues vpon his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, let vs fortifie our mynds vpon his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and adde our endeuour to his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: aſſuring ourſelues, that fighting in ſo godlie, ſo iuſt, ſo honorable a quarrell, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe cannot be but moſt happie, moſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, moſt glorious: that, if we defend our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, we ſhall remaine free and ſafe; if wee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw our <hi>Enimies,</hi> we ſhall abide victorious: if we die in this quarrell, we ſhall liue eternally. To which aſſurance of freedome, ſafety, victorie, &amp; life, what comfort can be comparable?</p>
