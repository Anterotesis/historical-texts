            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing openlye defamed, in writing ſet abroade by one that hath no name: I ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame, long time to delite himſelf in his own blindneſſe, and to boaſt himſelfe among hys ſecreto maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, being in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meane while better occupied, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in wreſtling with ſuche a one as is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſet his name to the booke he writeth, and cauſeth to be imprinted.</p>
            <p>I thought that the writings of ſuch one, coulde not haue bene hurtfull to the eſtimation that I and others of my calling, ſhould of right haue among the true profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Gods Goſpell: bicauſe ſuch haue inough alredie in print, and in the Engliſh tong, to aunſwere all ſuch blind barking dogs as this is. But perceiuing that ſome men which profeſſe the Goſpell, will rather credit ſuch a Rayler, than take the paynes to reade that, wherin they might haue wherewith to be able to anſwere for vs that are rayled vpon, bycauſe the ſame was written, before thys Hell Dogge began to barke: I haue now written a ſhort Apologie, or defence of my ſelfe and others of my calling, whom this Hell hound doth ſo egerly barke at: willing the Chriſtian reader, to reade it with indifferent iudgement, neyther inclining to the one nor the other, till he haue read both. And bicauſe none ſhall haue cauſe to complaine: I haue ſet downe in writing all that this
<pb facs="tcp:19793:3"/>
Dogge hath written, and then defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that which he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fault withall, ſo that euerie matter hath it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt defence ioyned vnto it, that the Chriſtian Reader, may haue wherewithall to bring himſelfe out of doubt. And leaſt any ſhoulde be offended, for that I terme mine aduerſarie by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>Cerberus</hi> or Hell dogge: I wold all men ſhould conſider the cauſe. He hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon him to reprehend the teachers of the truth, and thoſe, which are or ſhould be, the light of the worlde: and yet, as one that would not be called to an accompt of his doings, he hideth his name. Wherefore, I haue giuen him ſuche a name, as is méete for him: tyll he put hys name to that he writeth in the reproche and diſcredite of ſuch as feare not openly to teach the truth, and when they write it, to ſubſcribe their names to the ſame. When this Hel hound therefore ſhall ſet his name to his booke: I will vſe none other name but that which by his owne writing ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be his. In the meane while, let him &amp; his friends be contented that he beare ſuch a name, as hys doings do deſerue. <hi>Cerberus</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Poets do faine, is a Dogge with thrée heades, which watcheth Hell gates, whoſe barking is horrible, for he barketh with chrée mouthes, and his haires are ſnakes. His name by interpretation doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a deuourer of bodies. Wherefore, it is not a name vile inough for this Hel dogge, whoſe propertie is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſoules, and the good names of ſuch as he is not able to accuſe of any crime. And wyth his barking he goeth not about to trouble the Kingdome of Hel (as <hi>Cerberus</hi> did) but the Kingdome of Heauen, which is the Church of Chriſt, which by faith in Chriſt, is aſſured of hir eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Predeſtination to euerlaſting glorie after this life, and in this life to deliueraunce from all euill. Of which comfort this <hi>Cerberus</hi> laboureth by his barking to ſpoile hir: as ſhall more plainely appeare in the Apologie of
<pb facs="tcp:19793:3"/>
thoſe, whom he ſeketh by his barking to daſh out of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
            <p>But leaſt I ſhould trouble thée Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reader, with ouer manie wordes before the matter: I ceaſſe to write any more. Farewel in Chriſt Ieſus. And pray to God for the preſence of his holie ſpirite, to leade thée in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Apologie. Amen. Finiſhed the firſt of March Anno. 1565.</p>

Samuell, which is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me of very ſmall acquaintance: but a Preacher he is. And as for his ſaying, that a man may deſerue God. &amp;c. Which you deſire me to proue if I can: it is a doctrine ſo abhominable and blaſphemous: as I am ſure neither Papiſt, nor Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, nor any other Heretike, eyther olde or newe, hath written or maintained, a more filthy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable ſaying. For it is the flatte and manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall both of God the Father &amp; of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſu: neither doth it require any confutation to him that doth but confeſſe, that there is a God: and as for my ſelfe, I aſſure you: I doe not loue my lyfe ſo dearely, as I hate this vile ſaying deadlye. But wonder it is, that ſuch a ſentence, conteyning the very filthy dregs, of all <hi>Pelagius</hi> errours, coulde ſo long ſtande printed, and neither be forbidden, nor by any man written againſt.</p>

               <p>The firſt of <hi>Pelagius</hi> errours which Auguſtine here citeth is, that Adam ſhoulde haue died whether he had ſinned or not ſinned. This is as you heare, one of <hi>Pelagius</hi> wicked errours, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation, or caſting away, death ſprong out of Gods ordinance, or ſome other way &amp; came not of mans ſinne (ſaith he) whether man had ſinned or not ſinned, yet ſhould he haue dyed, contrary to the manifeſt Scripture which ſayeth, that by one man ſinne entred into the worlde, &amp; death by the meanes of ſinne. <hi>Roma. 5. b.</hi> And the wyſe man ſayth, that God <note place="margin">Rom. 5. b.</note>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:19793:8"/>
created ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vndeſtroyed. And againe he ſaith. <note place="margin">Sapiae.</note> God hath not made death, neither hath he pleaſure in the deſtruction of the liuing, he created al things that they might haue their being, yea all the people of the earth hath he made, that they ſhoulde haue health, that there ſhould be no deſtruction in them, and that the Kingdome of Hell ſhould not be vpon earth, for righteouſneſſe is euerlaſting and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but vnrighteouſeneſſe bringeth death. Wicked and abhominable therfore was this errour of <hi>Pelagius</hi> which affirmeth, that whether man had ſinned or not ſinned: he ſhoulde haue dyed.</p>
               <p>And here in the very beginning of <hi>Pelagius</hi> errours: I reporte me to themſelues, euen to themſelues (I ſaye) that blowe the trumpet of defamation againſt other, with the termes of peſtilent Pelagians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe, whome they ſo accuſe nowe to be Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, holde this errour, or whether they themſelues which woulde take ſome mote of errour out of other mens eyes, haue not this <hi>Pelagius</hi> beame ſticking faſt in their owne, let they themſelues be iudges, or let their owne doctrine iudge, both in print and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, whereof ſome parte ſhall be hereafter rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

               <p>After <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath ſet downe in Latine certaine of <hi>Pelagius</hi> errors, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of .xi. he repeteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt in Engliſhe, that is, that Adam ſhould haue dyed, though he had not ſinned. And bycauſe his purpoſe is to proue that we are thoſe that holde this Pelagian hereſie: he
<pb facs="tcp:19793:9"/>
vnderſtandeth <hi>Pelagius</hi> meaning to be, that ſinne was not the cauſe of Reprobation, or caſting away, but that heath ſprong out of Gods ordinaunce: And ſo at the laſt he concludeth, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> and we are all one in thys point: for we teache the ſame doctrine. What moued <hi>Pelagius</hi> to teache that doctrine, I knowe not, neyther did I at any time ſo much as once thinke to holde or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſende it. And I thinke I may be bolde to ſay in the name of all that haue written or preached the doctrine that <hi>Cerberus</hi> miſliketh: that not one eyther hath or will teache it. Although <hi>Cerberus</hi> doe boaſt, that hereafter ſome parte of our doctrine ſhall be ſhewed, whereby all men may be able to iudge that we are al one with <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> in this point. For mine owne parte I will put all men out of doubt, that I beleue, and haue, doe, and will (if God permit) wache, that if Adam had not ſinned, he had neuer dyed. And that God did create man to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroyed. And that God made not death as the wiſe <note place="margin">Sapi. 2.</note> man writeth. But by one man ſinne entred into the the worlde, and by ſinne, death. And I can not ſée that any of my breathren haue or doe teache any otherwiſe, either in writing or preaching. Wherefore <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth vs open wrong to ioyne vs with <hi>Pelagius</hi> in thys errour. As for the doctrine that I haue written, and <hi>Cerberus</hi> wreſteth top his purpoſe againſt me and my brethren: ſhall (by Gods helpe) be defended in the place where it is produced againſt vs.</p>

               <p>The ſeconde errour which Auſten rehearſeth, is, that Adams ſinne did onely hurt himſelfe, and not the whole generation of man. This is an other vile and deteſtable errour which <hi>Pelagius</hi> helde, that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19793:9"/>
ſinne of Adam brought not miſerie and death vpon all his poſteritie, contrarye to the open Scripture, which ſayth, that by the ſinne of one, condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came vpon all men. And the holy man Eſdras <note place="margin">Roma. 5. 4. Eſdr. 6.</note> ſayth: O Adam, what haſt thou done? for though it was thou that ſinned, yet thou arte not fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but all we that come of thee.</p>
               <p>The thirde, depending alſo vpon the ſeconde, is this: That Infantes being newe borne, are in that ſtate, that Adam was in, before his tranſgreſſion, which errour ſemeth onely, or chiefly to extende to the innocencie of children. For if his minde were, that in all pointes infantes were in Adames eſtate, then ſhoulde it be ouer brutiſhe. For who ſeeth not, that babes newe borne, ſuffer of tentimes payne and griefe, which Adam did not before his tranſgreſſion. But to affirme, that Infants are not borne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in ſinne, is to denie Originall ſinne, which is an olde and a diueliſh errour, and vtterly againſt the Scripture, which ſayth plainely: Beholde, I was borne in wickedneſſe, and in ſinne hath my mother <note place="margin">Pſalm. 51.</note> conceyued mee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crowley.</speaker>
               <p>In theſe two Articles can <hi>Cerberus</hi> finde nothing to burden vs withall. For we teache that by their firſt byrth all Infants are enheritours of that poſſeſſion that our common father Adam purchaſed by his firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or ſinne. That is, of bodily trauaile and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in this lyfe, and euerlaſting death after this lyfe. And that euen as the children of bonde ſlaues, can enioy none other thing by birth than that bondage which their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are in: ſo the children of Adam can by nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
<pb facs="tcp:19793:10"/>
none other thing but that which belonged to their firſt father, who by his firſt tranſgreſſion, made bath himſelfe and all his poſteritie, bonde ſlaues to death, hell, the diuell and damnation. Well therefore we ſhall not be Pelagians in this point. But if I woulde deale as ſtraightly with <hi>Cerberus,</hi> as he doth with <hi>Samuell:</hi> I coulde charge him with breaking of <hi>Priſcians</hi> heade, in the ſeconde Article, where he writeth <hi>leſeret</hi> for <hi>leſerit.</hi> Which though it be but a ſmall fault, yet is it as great a fault as that which <hi>Cerberus</hi> maketh ſo much of in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> rymes. And the printers were to blame for both, I am ſure. And therfore I woulde not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> eyther <hi>Samuell</hi> or <hi>Cerberus,</hi> ſhould beare any blame with them. Who ſo Iuſteth to conferre the copie of this aunſwere which was firſt caſt about in the ſtreates of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with this y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is written in this Apologie: ſhall eaſely ſée that I haue amended many ſuch faultes, without noting of them to any mans reproche.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cerberus.</speaker>
               <p>The fourth errour is, that neither by the death &amp; tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all the generation of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyeth, nor that by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of man doth riſe againe. I doe not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that <hi>Pelagius</hi> did here ſpeake of the laſt Refur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at the day of iudgement, as though he had, after the maner of the Saduceis, denied the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our ſoules and bodies in the laſt daye, for then were all them diſputation in vaine, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we ſhoulde be ſaued, whether by the grace of God, or by the deſeruing of man, if ſaluation or Roſurrection had on either parte bene denied alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. Neither doth the Scripture attribute the laſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19793:10"/>
Reſurrection vnto Chriſt, as though the ſoules and bodies of men, ſhoulde haue died lyke beaſtes and not haue riſen againe vnto iudgement, if Chriſt had not come. Yea no doubt, all men ſhoulde haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen againe, and that to the iudgement of euerlaſting damnation, if Chriſt had not come. But I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that <hi>Pelagius</hi> in this Article, denied the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of Redemption by the death of Chriſt, by which we doe, as it were ariſe from death, bycauſe of the ſtate of lyfe and ſaluation, wherevnto we are bought in Chriſt by Redemption, lyke as we were in the ſtate of death and damnation in Adam by ſinne. Not that any man is purged from the corruption of ſinne, vnto the innocencie of Adam: but bycauſe the ſinne is couered in Chriſt, and pardoned for his ſake. And further here is to be noted, that the firſt parte of this errour, is manifeſtly, the very ſame, which is in the ſeconde and thirde errour, before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed, and by the ſame Scriptures plainly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But to make the latter part of this errour more aparant, it was neceſſarie and thought good of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, to rehearſe the firſt againe: that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of condemnation in Adam, and Redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt, it might the more plainely be perceiued that Chriſt was not inferiour to Adam, nor grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to ſinne. And that, as all the generation of man is condemned in Adam: euen ſo is all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of man, Redemed in Chriſt. And as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a Sauiour is Chriſt by redemption: as Adam is a condemner by tranſgreſſion. Which compariſon is taken out of S. Paule his Epiſtle to the Romanes, where he ſaith. Likewiſe then as by the ſinne of one, condemnation came vpon all men: euen ſo, by the iuſtifying of one, commeth the righteouſneſſe that <note place="margin">Roma. 5.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:11"/>
                  <hi>bringeth lyfe vpon all men. Yet ſhall not all men be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by Adam eternally: for there is ordained of God againe, away vnto lyfe, which way is Chriſt. Neyther ſhall all be eternallye ſaued by Chriſt: for there is of God declared a waye againe vnto death, which waye is ſinne, and the wilfull contempt of Gods mercy in Chriſt. But this appeareth to be one of</hi> Pelagius <hi>damnable errours: That Chriſt was not a generall Sauiour, that Chriſt offered not vp the ſacrifice of redemtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for al the whole world, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to the manifeſt Scripture which ſayeth. He</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>it is that obtayned grace for our ſinnes, and not for our ſinnes onely, but alſo, for the ſinnes of the whole world.

               <p>When <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath framed this fourth Article of <hi>Pelagius</hi> to his purpoſe, and perſuaded himſelfe that it reboundeth into the boſomes of thoſe that accuſe him &amp; his ſort to be giltie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> errours: he concludeth that he deſireth no more, but that his dearely beloued: whoſe letter he aunſwereth, woulde be indifferent and woulde waighe the matter as it is.

And further, I will be an humble ſuiter to all that ſhall reade this Apologie, that they ſetting all affection a ſide, will weighe both his aunſwere, and this Apologie, euen as they are, and none otherwiſe, &amp; then haue I ynough alſo. The Article is, that all the generation of man, doth neyther die by the ſinne and tranſgreſſion of Adam, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſe againe by the Reſurrection of Chriſt. That is, that neither Adam was by his ſinne, a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner of himſelfe and all his poſteritie: neither Chriſt by his Reſurrection, a generall reſtorer of all mankinde. For ſo doth <hi>Cerberus</hi> interprete <hi>Pelagius</hi> meaning. I will not diſpute about <hi>Pelagius</hi> meaning. For I know it coulde not be good, ſith he denyeth a truth, plainely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by S. Paule and Eſdras both, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath truely affirmed vpon the ſeconde Article. But that S. <note place="margin">Roma. 5. 4. Eſdr. 6.</note> Paule ment in that place, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth vnderſtand him: I doe ſlatly venie. And will by Gods helpe proue, both by the Scriptures &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of auncient writers. And that the matter I go about may be the more playne to the reader: I will firſt ſet downe in plaine wordes, what meaning <hi>Cerberus</hi> gathereth of thoſe wordes of Paule. He gathereth, that Paule ſhoulde minde to teach by thoſe wordes, that Chriſt reſtored as many, as Adam loſte. Which gathering is very falſe, and that may be proued by the verye circumſtaunce of the place it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Paules purpoſe is, by comparing Chriſt with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to ſhewe that as Adam was able by diſobedience, to make himſelfe and all his poſteritie bonds ſlaues to Satan: ſo was Chriſt able by obedience, to deliuer the ſame from that bondage, and to make them the free chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. Now for the maner of ſpeache that he vſeth in comparing theſe two togither, we muſte beware that we vnderſtande it not ſo, that we make Chriſt &amp; Adam lyke in all pointes. For then ſhall we be enforced to
<pb facs="tcp:19793:12"/>
graunt many inconueniences, whereof thys is one. That as Adam loſt himſelfe by diſobedience: ſo Chriſt reſtored himſelfe by obedience. Wherof ſhoulde followe that filthy errour of them that affirme that Chriſt dyed for his owne ſinnes as well as for the ſinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, contrary to the whole courſe of the Scriptures, which teache that he was without ſpotte of ſinne, and therfore was able to ſatiſfie to God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father for ſinne. Another inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhoulde be repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie betwéene this place of Scripture &amp; other, (wherin both S. Paule &amp; our Sauiour Chriſt, doe teache, that not all mankinde, that is, not euery particular perſon of mankinde, but a certaine elected and choſen number, are by Chriſt reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauour of God) which thing may not be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For in the Scripture there is no repugnaunce at all. And the thirde inconuenience ſhoulde be, that only origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, (that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne that we haue of our parents, euen in our conception) is put awaye by the bloud of Chriſt, and not our actuall ſinne. So that we muſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatiſfie for that our ſelues, or elſe periſhe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſtes death and ſufferance. Which is ſuch an inconuenience as cutteth of from Chriſt as many as dye not in Infancie, before they commit any actuall ſinne. Theſe inconueniences conſidered, we muſt ſéeke to finde another meaning in S. Paules wordes, when he compareth Chriſt with Adam, than that which the bare wordes ſeeme to giue. His meaning is not to make Chriſt lyke vnto Adam, but to preferre Chriſt before A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, &amp; to ſhewe that grace is more abundant in Chriſt, than ſinne was in Adam. Which thing appeareth in Paules very wordes in the ſame chapter, where he ſaith. <hi>Sed non ſicut delictum ita &amp; donu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Si enim vnius delicto multi mortui ſunt: multo magis gratia Dei &amp; donum, in gratia vnius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Roma. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>hominis Ieſu Christi, in plures abundauit.</hi> That is to ſaye,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19793:12"/>
But the gifte was not lyke vnto the ſinne, for if many dyed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne of one: much more hath the mercy &amp; gifte of God, in the grace of one man Ieſus Chriſt, abounded vnto many. If theſe words of Paule ſhould be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the number that were loſte by Adam, and reſtored by Chriſt: then muſte we graunt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more were reſtored by Chriſt, than loſt by Adam. For he ſaith that the grace or mercy hath abounded vnto moe. Which wordes, being vnderſtand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number reſtored, muſt be ſpoken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, of the many that were loſt by Adam: &amp; ſo muſt it follow that moe were reſtored by Chriſt, than were loſt by Adam. Which can not be, vnleſſe we will ſaye that Chriſt reſtored moe than all. For Adam loſte all. The meaning of Paule is therefore, that as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne of Adam being but one man, was a ſufficient condemnation to himſelfe and all his poſteritie which are many: euen ſo, yea and much more was the grace or frée mercy, and gift of God, in Chriſt being but one, a ſufficient reſtitution of all the choſen Children of God, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame were neuer ſo many. And that this is the meaning of Paule, doth well appeare by his wordes that follow in the ſame chapter, where he ſayth. <hi>Et non ſicut per vnum qui peccauit, ita &amp; donum. Nam condemnatio quidem ex vno, in condemnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem: gratia autem ex mult is delictis, in iustificationem. Si enim vnius delicto, mors regnauit per vnum: multo magis, abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam gratiae &amp; donationis &amp; iustitiae accipientes, in vita regna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt, per vnum Ieſum Christum.</hi> That is to ſaye. And the gift is not ſo, as is that which entred in by one that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the condemnation came by one ſinne, into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: but grace or frée mercye, was of many ſinnes into righteouſeneſſe. For if by the ſinne of one man, death haue raigned, by the meanes of one man: much more, ſhall they which haue receiued abundance of frée mercye or grace, and of the gifte and righteouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb facs="tcp:19793:13"/>
raigne in lyfe, thorow one, which is Ieſus Chriſt. Here doth Paule plainely expreſſe his meaning. Which is, that they which haue receiued abundaunce of grace, and of the gyft and righteouſneſſe, are thoſe many, that are reſtored by Chriſt Ieſu, in whome, through the ſame Chriſt, lyſe ſhall raigne. Thoſe are not the whole poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Adam. For the ſame Paule ſayth in the .xj. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Epiſtle, <hi>Quod quaerebat Iſraell non est conſecutus, electio. aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſecuta est.</hi> Iſraell hath not obtayned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that he ſought for: but the election hath obtained. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the carnall Iſraelites obtained not righteouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, much leſſe did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole offſpring of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obtaine it. But the election, that is the elected and choſen children of God, whether they be of the ſtock of Iſrael or no, haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned righteouſeneſſe through Chriſt, which is forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of al their ſinnes by his bloud ſheading, &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; euerlaſting lyfe by his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. According to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying of Paul, <hi>Traditus est propter delicta nostra, &amp; reſurrex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it propter iustificatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nostra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> He was deliuered vnto death <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> for our ſinnes: and he roſe againe for our iuſtification.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes, do vrge the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall ſigne, <hi>Omnes.</hi> All. <hi>Sicut per vnius delictum in omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in condemnationem: ſic &amp; per vnius iustitiam in omnes homines, in iustificationem vitae.</hi> That is. Euen as by one mans fault, ſinne entred into all men, to condemnation, ſo by the righteouſeneſſe of one man, is righteouſeneſſe entred into all men, to the iuſtification of lyfe. This vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall ſigne muſte néedes ſtreatche it ſelfe to all Adams poſteritie, and therfore all muſte be made righteouſe by Chriſt. Theſe men will not ſee how ſuche vniuerſall ſignes are vſed in the Scriptures. They can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how this vniuerſall ſigne ſhoulde in the firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſtreatche it ſelfe to all the generation of the firſte Adam that ſinned, and in the ſeconde ſentence to all the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19793:13"/>
generation of the ſeconde Adam, which is Chriſt. The generation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt are all that haue or ſhall be borne of fleſhe and bloud, and the generation of the ſeconde, are al they that be borne of God. If we ſhoulde in all places of Scripture, ſtreatche this vniuerſall ſigne all, ſo farre as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth ſtreatche it here: we ſhould make as good a piece of worke as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nonne did, which reade in ſ. Paule <hi>Omnia probate,</hi> proue all things. And therefore hauing a <note place="margin">1. Theſs. 5.</note> minde to ſir Iohn, the Chaplen of the houſe, ſhe proued what it was to lye with a man. And being with childe, the matter came to the knowledge of the Abbas: ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed hir ſelfe by Saint Paule, who biddeth vs proue all things. If a théefe that taketh another mans goodes, ſhoulde excuſe himſelfe with <hi>Omnia mihi licent,</hi> I may doe <note place="margin">1. Corin. 3. 1. Corin. 6.</note> all things, or <hi>Omnia vestra ſunt.</hi> All things are yours: It would not be founde that theſe vniuerſall ſignes ſhould either make it léeful for him to take another mans goods, or to haue right to that that is not hys by ſome iuſt title. I woulde wiſhe <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes therfore, to weigh this matter better before they triumph ouer vs in ſuch ſort as he doth in this his aunſwere. And I woulde wiſhe him to conſider well whether ſaint Auſten in the Epiſtle where theſe Articles of <hi>Pelagius</hi> be written, do not write cleane contrary to this iudgement of his. For in the very place that he citeth to make for his purpoſe, S. Auſten ſayth thus. <hi>Infantes nuper nati, non ſunt in illo statu in quo Adam fuit ante praeuaricationem, vt ad ipſos perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat quod breuiter ait Apostolus. Per vnum hominem mors, &amp;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Corin. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>per vnum hominem reſurrectio mortuorum. Sicut enim in Adam omnes moriuntur: it a &amp; in Christo omnes viuiſicabuntur. Vnde ſit, quod Infantes no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptizati, non ſolum regnum coelorum, verum etiam vitam aeternam habere non poſsint.</hi> That is, Infantes that be lately borne, are not in that ſtate that Adam was before he ſinned, that that thing which the Apoſtle doth
<pb facs="tcp:19793:14"/>
in fewe wordes affirme, might partaine vnto them. By one man came death, and by one man came the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deade. For euen as in Adam all dye: ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alyne. Wherby it commeth to paſſe that Inſants which are not baptiſed, are not onely vnable to enioye the Kingdome of Heauen, but alſo lyfe euerlaſting. Theſe wordes me think, are very plaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which <hi>Cerberus</hi> would maintaine by Paule and Auſten. For if Infants vnbaptiſed can not haue the kingdome of God nor euerlaſting lyfe: how doth this ſaying <hi>In christo omnes viuificabuntur:</hi> All ſhalbe quickned in Chriſt: pertayne to all the poſteritie of Adam? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he will ſay, that Infantes that dye before baptiſme be not of Adams poſteritie? Better matter can I not wiſhe for againſt <hi>Cerberus,</hi> than that which hangeth to the foundation that he himſelfe buildeth vpon. It were for my purpoſe to aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the auctoritie of this Epiſtle, bicauſe it helpeth me very much againſt this Hel Dogge <hi>Cerberus:</hi> but bicauſe I woulde not haue the Reader to conceyue ſuch an opinion of S. Auſten, as to thinke that he ſhoulde be of ſuch minde as the Auctour of thys Epiſtle doth ſhewe himſelfe to be in certaine pointes: I will cite the iudgement of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> concerning thys Epiſtle &amp; all other of this title. That is, <hi>Ad Bonifacium.</hi> To Boniface. Speaking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Booke of Epiſtles, wher, in this Epiſtle. 106. is written, he ſaith. <hi>Nonnullae ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor confictae, quod genus ſunt illae Bonefacij ad Augustinum, Augustini ad Bonifacium.</hi> Some of thoſe Epiſtles (ſaith he) are altogether fayned. As are thoſe of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> to Auguſtine, and of Auſten to Boniface. Now iudge gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader what this <hi>Cerberus</hi> meaneth, that leauing the good and ſounde workes of Auſten, where he writeth very well of this matter: ſetteth his foundation vpon ſuch rotten patches as ſome ſuch as he is, haue put forth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19793:14"/>
in Auſtens name. No maruell though <hi>Cerberus</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſet his name to his booke. This might ſuffiſe for our defence againſt <hi>Cerberus</hi> his aſſaulte in thys point. But I will adde one Scripture or two, and ſo the iudgement of ſome learned writers, that he take not occaſion of a new calumniatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe I promiſed more than I haue yet performed. Saint Paule writing to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe in his ſeconde Epiſtle and ſeconde chapter, ſayth <note place="margin">2. Timo. 2.</note> thus. <hi>Sed firmum fundamentum Dei ſtat, habens ſignaculu hoc. Cognouit Dominus qui ſunt ſui.</hi> The foundation of God, ſtandeth firme and ſure, hauing this ſure ſeale. The Lorde knoweth who be his. By which wordes it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that S. Paule vnderſtoode not that all mankinde were elected in Chriſt, and ſo reſtored by Chriſt: but a certaine number, which though they be vnknowne vnto men, yet doth the Lorde (whoſe they be) knowe them well, and will not ſuffer them, no nor any of them, to periſhe. Wherfore he exhorteth all ſuch as call vpon the name of the Lorde (that is all Chriſtians) to depart from iniquitie. For in a great houſe (ſaith he) there be, not only veſſelles of Golde and Siluer, but alſo of Timber and Earth: ſome to ſerue for honorable vſes, and ſome for vile vſes. I knowe how ſome doe wreſt theſe latter wordes of S. Paule, to proue that it is in mans power to depart from iniquitie, bicauſe Saint Paule doth will Chriſtians ſo to doe. And eſpecially thoſe wordes which followe, which are theſe. <hi>Si quis ergo, emund. iuerit ſe ab istis, erit vas in honorem ſanctificatum, &amp; vtile domino, ad omne opus bonum paratum.</hi> If any man therfore, ſhall clenſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from theſe men: he ſhall be a veſſell ſanctified vnto honour, and profitable for the Lord, being prepared and made readie for euery good worke. Theſe wordes do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declare, ſay they, that it is in mannes power to clenſe himſelfe, and to make himſelfe a veſſel méete for
<pb facs="tcp:19793:15"/>
the Lordes vſe and ſeruice. Theſe men will not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that commaundements, admonitions, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and councelles be to any purpoſe: except thoſe to whome they be giuen, be able to do the things, that they be commaunded, admoniſhed, exhorted, or councelled to doe. And ſo ſhall the commaundements of God be to no purpoſe. For who hath bene, is, or ſhall be able, to doe that God commaundeth, when he ſayth. Thou ſhalte loue the Lorde thy God, with all thine heart, with al thy ſoule, and with all thy minde. And thy neighbour as thy ſelfe? Doth not S. Paule ſay that we are not able of our <note place="margin">2. Corin. 3.</note> ſelues, ſo much as to think a good thought. And is not this according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which Chriſt himſelfe teacheth when <note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> he ſaith to his Diſciples: without me ye can do nothing? But theſe men will not vnderſtande that the vſe of theſe things is, to cauſe the choſen children of God, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their owne inhabilitie, and humblye to begge at Gods hande his helpe that therby they may doe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is commaunded or taught: and that the reprobate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither let it trouble anye man, that the Deuill doth oftentimes ſeduce euen thoſe, that being alredy regenerated in Chriſt, do walke in the wayes of God.

               <p>After S.

For this cauſe alſo, is it ſaid, all, and all: for
<pb facs="tcp:19793:18"/>
not the ſame all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are begotten by Adam, are by Chriſt regenerated. But this is well ſayde, that euen as the carnall generation of no man, is otherwiſe than by Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo is the ſpirituall generation of no man otherwiſe than by Chriſt. For if there might be ſome men begotten in the fleſhe, and not by Adam, and ſome men regenerated in the ſpirite, &amp; not by Chriſt: we might not ſay plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all, either in the one place or in the other. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, he doth ſaye, that the ſame all, are many: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſome certaine thing, thoſe which are but fewe, may be all. But the carnall generation hath many, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall hath many alſo: although this ſpiritual haue not ſo many, as hath that carnall. But yet for all that, euen as that hath all men: ſo hath this all iuſte men. For as without that, no man is a man: euen ſo without this no man is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Now let <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes, bark at Auſten. For he hath made the ſame interpretation of S. Paules wordes, that I haue made before. Whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that that Epiſtle that <hi>Cerberus</hi> buildeth vpon, is not Auſtens owne, but fained by ſome ſuch as <hi>Cerberus</hi> is, and put forth in Auſtens name.</p>
               <p>But bycauſe I promiſed before to proue mine affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as well by the iudgement of Auncient writers, as by Scripture: I will adde the iudgement of one or two moe, whoſe autoritie and antiquitie is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. Of the which Ambroſe ſhall be one. Writing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Epiſtle to the Romans, he ſayth. <hi>Sicut per vnius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictum in omnes homines in condemnationem: ſic &amp; per vnius iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Roma. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>in omnes homines, in iustificationem vitae. Hoc est, ſicut per vnius delictum, omnes condemnationem meruerunt, ſimiliter peccantes: ita &amp; in iustitia vnius, omnes iustificabuntur creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Si qui autem condemnationem hanc, generalem eſse putant: ſimili modo &amp; iustificationem generalem accipient. Sed non est
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19793:18"/>
verum, quia non omnes credunt. Sicut enim per inobedientiam vnius hominis, peccatores constituti ſunt plurimi: ita et per vnius obedientiam iusti constituentur multi. Quos ſupra omnes dixit: hic plures &amp; multos ſignificat. Plures enim delictum Adae ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuti ſunt praeuaricando, non omnes, &amp; multi iusti constituentur, non omnes. Non ergo in eos regnauit mors, qui non peccauerunt in ſimilitudine preuaricationis Adae.</hi> That is to ſay. Euen as by one mans ſinne, giltineſſe came vpon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: ſo did iuſtification of lyfe come vpon all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the righteouſeneſſe of one man. That is, euen as by the ſinne of one man, all men that doe ſinne as he dyd, haue deſerued condemnation: euen ſo all that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, ſhall be iuſtified in the righteouſeneſſe of one man. And if any doe think that this condemnation is general: let them in lyke maner take the iuſtification to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. But that is not true, bycauſe all men doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue. For euen as by the diſobedience of one man, many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall be made righteous. The Apoſtle doth here call thoſe ſame, many, that he did before call, all. For many haue in ſinning folowed the ſinne of Adam, but not all: and many ſhall be made righteous, but not all. Death therefore hath not raigned ouer them, which haue not ſinned in lyke ſort as Adam did. Theſe be the wordes of Ambroſe. Which though at the firſt ſight, they ſéeme to incline to the errour of <hi>Pelagius:</hi> yet when they be well weighed, they giue a good and ſounde meaning. That is, that ſinne neuer raigned in any of Gods elect. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the elect of God, in as much as they be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Adam, be partakers of Adams ſinne, and in Adam condemned: yet are they by Chriſte deliuered from that condemnation, ſo that ſinne hath in them no dominion at all: Which thing appeareth in them by the fayth in Chriſt, which when they come to knowledge, they doe
<pb facs="tcp:19793:19"/>
both by wordes and workes declare. That this is the meaning of Ambros, doth very plainely appeare, by that he ſayth, that all the beleuers ſhall be iuſtified. For what nedeth iuſtification, where no condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was? Thus much I thought good to write concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſimple mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of this auncient Father, leaſt any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſimplicity miſtaking his meaning, might think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould denie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elect to be conceyued and borne in originall ſinne, from which neuer any that was borne (Chriſt only excepted) coulde be frée. But this is his meaning, that in the Elect and choſen Children of God, this ſinne hath no domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it doth appeare by their obedience that they ſhewe in beleuing the Goſpell: but in the Reprobates, it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rule ſtill: For Chriſt hath not killed it in them.</p>
               <p>And to make an ende of this matter: Saint Paule ſayth thus in his eyght chapter to the Romans. Who ſhall laye any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that doth iuſtifie, who is it that ſhall condemne? If all mankinde, then, be elected in Chriſt (as <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth) then ſhall no ſinne be layde to any mans charge. For who dare accuſe Gods choſen children? And ſo ſhall <hi>Cerberus</hi> doctrine be the deſtruction of all vertue, as he hath afore affirmed of the doctrine we teache of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>As for that which <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth out of the ſeconde chapter of S. Iohns firſt Epiſtle, &amp; the other places that he ſendeth the Reader vnto: I doe nowe paſſe ouer, as ſufficiently aunſwered, by that I haue written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning S.

               <p>The fift of <hi>Pelagius</hi> errours was, that riche men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized, except they did vtterly renounce and forſake their riches, though they ſeeme to doe ſome

good, yet is it not accepted, neither can they haue the Kingdome of God. A filthy, and an abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errour, directly repugnant, both to the ſtate of the common wealth, and alſo to the worde of God, which ſayth. Charge them that be riche in this <note place="margin">1. Timoth. 6.</note> world, that they be not exceding wyſe &amp;c. And that they doe good and be riche in good workes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſixt errour is, that the grace of God and the helpe of God, is not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery one of our works, but that it is in free choyſe, in the lawe, and in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine This errour is exceding wicked and execrable, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the law, by doctrine, and by free choiſe, is able to doe any maner of good worke, whatſoeuer it be, without the grace and helpe of God. For as S. Paule ſayeth; we are not ſufficient of our ſelues, to <note place="margin">2. Corinth. 3.</note> think any thing, as of our ſelues: but our ableneſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of God. And againe. It is God that worketh <note place="margin">Phillip. 2.</note> in vs, both the will and the dede, euen of good will.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth errour is, that the grace of God is giuen according to our deſeruing. Vile and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable is this errour alſo, and contrary to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt minde and words of the Apoſtle, which ſayth. If it be of workes, then is it no more grace, for then <note place="margin">Roma. 11.</note> were deſeruing, no more deſeruing.</p>
               <p>The eyght errour is, that none can be called the children of God, except they be all together made without ſinne. This errour is lyke wicked with the reſt, directly repugnant to the open Scripture, where it is written. If we ſay we haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs. For as S.

In theſe foure errours, <hi>Cerberus</hi> can finde nothing to charge vs with all: and therfore he goeth about to get himſelfe credite among the ſimple Chriſtians, by calling theſe errours, filthy, and abhominable, exceding wicked and execrable, vile and abhominable, and lyke wycked with the reſte. But if a man might come to reaſon with <hi>Cerberus:</hi> I thinke it woulde fall out in the ende, that he is not ſo cleare of the ſixt errour as he would ſéeme to be, when he calleth it exceeding wicked and execrable. For if he were aſked: why feared he to tranſlate Saint Paules words, according to his meaning, when he ſaide to the Philippians. <hi>Deus est qui operatur in vobis &amp; velle &amp; perſwere, pro bona voluntate.</hi> That is. It is God, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Phillip. 2.</note> in you, both the will and the performance therof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good will or pleaſure. <hi>Cerberus</hi> can not away with Gods good will. And therefore he tranſlateth S. Paules wordes, euen of good will. He feareth, by like, that ſome man woulde conclude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is Gods good will, that by ſuch malicious doings, as his is, in ſtrowing of his ſtaunderous writings: ſome of them that be ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered therby, ſhoulde take occaſion to open hys ſubtiltie, both in the deteſting of theſe errours, and alſo in the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Scriptures to the contrary of that which is affyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them. Which is nothing elſe, but to blinde the eyes of the ſimple. But ſuch as haue had to doe with ſuch as he is, do knowe, that as he ſaith here, that man is not ſufficient of himſelfe to thinke any thing, ſo he thinketh, and wyl ſay if he be vrged; that man hath power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to withſtande the good motions of Gods holy ſpirit, ſo that God can not drawe ſuch as he will, but only ſuch as he findeth willing to be drawne. And to auoide the errour of giuing of grace according to merites or deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he ſayth that it is giuen to all mankinde indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.

               <p>The ninth errour is, that there is no free choyſe, if a man haue neede of Gods helpe, ſeing it is in a mans owne will to doe a thing, or not to doe it. This was alſo the wicked opinion of <hi>Pelagius:</hi> that if it be graunted, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath neede of Gods helpe: then muſte it needes followe (ſaith <hi>Pelagius)</hi> that he hath no choiſe in doing of things, but whatſouer a man doth, that muſt he nedes, and cannot chooſe but do. This is the Deuils only way, aboue all other to leade men to diſtruction, not to ſuffer them to walke in the playne path of the Lorde, but to turne them to ſome extremitie, either on the left hande, or elſe on the right, either into the blinde path of crooked ſuperſtition, or into the wyde way of leude libertie, either to ſeeke iuſtification by deſeruing of workes, or by an only fayth, not mightie in loue by opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such lyke extremitie doth the Deuill vſe in this point of Doctrine, either driuing men into the doubting dreames of deſtenie, or into the abſolute freewill of Papiſtrie. Either affyrming all things ſo to be ordeyned of God, that whatſoeuer a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth, be it good or euill: he muſte needes, and can not chooſe, but of meere neceſſitie, by the ordinaunce of God, commit the ſame. Or elſe affirming, that man by freewill, or naturall ſtrength, can do the wil of God, and walke in his lawe without the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all helpe and grace of God. Which two extremities, Auſten doth very plainly condemne, in theſe words folowing.</p>

The ninth errour (ſayth he) is, that there is no frée choyſe, if a man haue néede of Gods help, ſéeing it is in a mans owne wil to do a thing, or not to do it. Now how agréeth this with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which he chargeth

                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> withall? Hath <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſayde that man hath no choyſe at all? Or can man haue no choyſe at all, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſame be frée to do what it luſteth? I thinke all men do ſée that he chargeth <hi>Pelagius</hi> wyth more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he ſpake or wrote in this poynt. And as touching the former part of his Article, which being truly tranſlated, are thus much. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> choyſe is not frée, if it haue néede of Gods helpe. Who is able to ſpeake againſt this? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding <hi>Liberum,</hi> or Frée, to ſignifie that which is not vnder the power of any other. And I trowe ſaint Auſten wyll ſay no leſſe in the. 13. ſermon that he wrate <hi>De verbis Apostoli,</hi> of the wordes of the Apoſtle. Thus ſayth ſaint Auſten. <hi>Cum dico tibi, ſine adiutorio Dei nihil agis, nihil boni dico. Nam ad mala agendum, habes ſine adiutorio Dei, liberam voluntatem, quanquam non est illa libera: A quo enim quis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uictus est, huic &amp; ſeruus addictus est. Et omnis qui facit pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ſeruus est peccati. Et ſi vos filius liberauerit, tunc veri liberi eritis.</hi> That is to ſay. When I ſay vnto thée, that thou doſt nothing without the help of God: I meane, no good thing. For thou haſt a frée will to doe euill without the helpe of God, although the ſame be not frée. For looke of whom a man is ouercome, to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame is he made a ſlaue, and euery one that doth commit ſinne, is become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of ſinne. And if the ſonne ſhall make you frée, then ſhall ye be frée in deede.</p>
               <p>Nowe if <hi>Cerberus</hi> will conclude that <hi>Pelagius</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that man hath any choyſe, bicauſe he ſayth, it is not frée, if it haue néede of Gods helpe: then let him ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude vpon ſaint Auſtens wordes in this place. For he ſayth that mans wil is not frée, no not in doing euil. For it is ſubiect vnto ſinne, and can not but obey that tyrant. And ſhall we thinke then that ſaint Auſten woulde ſaye that it is frée in doing good? I thinke not. For he hath ſayd that in that which is good, we can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:19793:23"/>
Gods helpe.</p>
               <p>But leaſt <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſhoulde take a newe occaſion to calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niate, bicauſe ſaint Auſten doth often tymes graunt that he denieth not the fréedome of mans will, and ſo ſet Auſten agaynſt Auſten: I will in fewe wordes ſhewe howe both ſaint: Auſten and we, do vnderſtande mans will, both to be frée, and not frée.</p>
               <p>As mans will is not regenerated, ſo is it frée from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſpirit, and bonde to that corruption that entred into all mankinde by the ſynne of the firſt man, which corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaint Paule calleth the lawe of the members, the wiſedome of the fleſh, the olde man and the fleſh, ſo that it cannot once liſte vp it ſelfe to any thing that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeyng to that corruption.</p>

Such as are ledde by the ſpirite of God, are the children of God. They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called ſpirituall, and newe creatures.</p>
               <p>Agayne, as man is a reſonable creature, ſo is his will called, <hi>Arbitrium,</hi> that is, Choyſo, and bycauſe the ſame cannot be enforced by any humane or mans power, it is called <hi>Liberum,</hi> that is, Frée. And ſo is it <hi>Liberum Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium,</hi> Frée Choiſe. For though man haue power ouer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reſtaine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his will, yet hath he not power to reſtayne the will it ſelfe. As for example. <hi>Simion,</hi> being impriſoned in Egypte, had a will to be with his <note place="margin">Geneſ. 42.</note>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19793:23"/>
Father and brethren in the land of Canaan, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that his body was kept in priſon and reſtrained of libertie to execute his will. For Ioſeph had no power vpon the wil to turne it, or reſtraine it. But <hi>Simion</hi> had, yea, he coulde not but haue his will at libertie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing that Ioſeph eyther dyd or coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to doe. For to turne or ſtaye the will of man, is the worke of God only. And therfore S. Paule ſayth. I haue planted, &amp; <hi>Apollo</hi> hath watred, but God gaue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> increaſe. <note place="margin">1. Corinth. 3.</note> And S.

And this is not done by any bodyly force, but by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drawing that Chriſt ſpeaketh of whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth. No man commeth vnto me, excepte my Father drawe him. <note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> This drawing is not a forcible drawing: but a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the power of God, whereby the will that ſtroue agaynſt, is made ready to follow the drawer.

Who willing to goe to <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> Damaſco to perſecute Chriſtians, is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſodaine made willing to preach Chriſt.

To this doe the wordes of Sainct Paule agrée when he ſayeth. <hi>Deus eſt qui operatur in vobis &amp; velle, &amp; operari.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2:</note> It is God that worketh in you both the will and the

By this meane therfore would God ſhewe vnto man: what frée will is able to doe without God. This maye ſuffiſe to as many as will be ſatiſfied.

               <p>By this it appeareth that we runne not into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth we doe.

Which maiſter one <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtius</hi> did in ſuch ſorte followe, that their followers are alſo called <hi>Celeſtines.</hi> Theſe men are ſuch enimies to the grace of God (whereby we are predeſtinated to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted or choſen to be his children through Ieſus Chriſt, and whereby we are deliuered from the power of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that we may beleue in him, and be tranſlated into his kingdome, for which cauſe he ſayd: No man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto me except it be giuen vnto him of my Father: and wherby, Charitie is poured out in our hearts, that fayth may worke by loue) that they beleue, that man is able without it, to do all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if that were true, it might ſéeme that the Lord had in vaine ſayde, <hi>Sine me nihil potestis ſacere.</hi> Without me, you can do nothing.</p>
               <p>Whether we be of this mind with <hi>Pelagius</hi> or no: let all the world that ſéeth our writings or heareth our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, iudge. Or whether <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes be
<pb facs="tcp:19793:25"/>
like to be of this minde, which finde fault with our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, bycauſe we teach that there is an elected and choſen number to whome God hath giuen fayth, and hath pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out loue in their hearts, ſo that they maye come vnto Chriſt, and by their works of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Gods wil, ſhew forth the liuely fayth in Chriſt, that in their election they haue receyued freely at Gods hand.</p>
               <p>Let all the worlde, I ſay, iudge betwixte vs. We ſay that there is a certayne choſen number, which in mercy are choſen to be the children of God images of the ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt, and inheritoures of his kingdome. And that none can be of this number, but thoſe onely to whome it is giuen fréely without any maner deſeruing, eyther paſt, preſent, or to come. And that they being thus choſen &amp; predeſtinated, muſt alwayes acknowledge, that it is God that worketh in them, and that of them ſelues they are not able ſo much as to think a good thought. And yet aſſure them ſelues, that Hell gates can not preuayle agaynſt them, that is, that the power of the Diuell ſhall not be able to hurte them. And that though they be ſtill ſore aſſaulted, and ſometimes ſore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: yet they ſhal neuer be ouercome, but ſhal ouercome in Chriſt, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with him in immortalitie for euer.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his company, ſay that al mankind is elected, and that there is no reprobation at all, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, no election. For if there be none reſuſed, then is there none election, but a generall acceptation. And this their election they ſay is ſo vncertayne, that no man can thereby be certaine of his ſaluation, but al men muſt ſtill remayne in doubte of damnation by ſinne, whereas S. Paule hath ſayde, that there is no damnation to them <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that be graſſed into Chriſt. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, that it is not poſſible that the elected ſorte ſhoulde be ſeduced. <note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> They ſay alſo that the power of mans Frée will is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19793:25"/>
or refuſe the grace of God which is indifferently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto al. Which if it be true, then muſt he be able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of himſelfe to do that God commaundeth, which is the playne errour of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Well, I leaue theſe two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the iudgement of the reader, to conſider which of them is moſt like to be that which <hi>Pelagius</hi> helde.</p>
               <p>But to giue a little more light to the Reader, I wyll note one ſentence more out of that that S. Auſten wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth concerning the hereſie of <hi>Pelagius. Illam vero gratiam Dei, ſine qua nihil boni poſsumus facere, non eſse dicunt niſi in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero arbitrio, quod nullis ſuis praecedentibus meritis, ab illo acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit nostranatura, ad hoc tantum ipſo adiuuante per ſuam legem at<expan>

Nos autem ad hoc per donum ſpiritus ſancti, vt quae didiſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus eſse facienda faciamus.</hi> That is. They ſay (ſayth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten) that the grace of God, without which we are able to do no good thing, is not otherwiſe than in Frewil; which our nature hath receyued of him, not by any deſeruings that was in the ſame before, he only helping vs herevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his law and doctrine, that we may learne what we ought to do, and what to hope for. But we ſay to this, that through the gift of the holy Ghoſt, we may do thoſe things that we haue learned to be méete to be done. Here it is playne, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> maketh the grace of God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an helpe to the Frée wil of man. Whether <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes do ſo too, or not, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudge that reade his words that are written in his aunſwere to this letter, and do weygh them with indifferent mindes.</p>
               <p>Now as touching that place that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth out of the ſermon <hi>De tempore,</hi> that is of the time. 191. Although I knowe what Auſten himſelfe writeth of all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and his ſermons, ſaying that he had not peruſed or retracted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he ſet forth his two bookes of Retrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <note place="margin">Retract. 2. in fine.</note> neither doeth it appeare in any of his writings,
<pb facs="tcp:19793:26"/>
that euer he did retract them: Yet I will not reiecte it as none of Auſtens wordes, for the doctrine is ſound if it be rightly vnderſtande. It is poſſible for man by the power of God to be preſerued from Actuall ſinne, although he can neuer be without the ſinne of concupiſcence ſo long as he liueth in mortall fleſh. So is it poſſible alſo, yea it can not be choſen, but vnleſſe God doe by his grace ſtaye man, he ſhall commit Actuall ſinne after his regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of him ſelf man is not able to ſtay him ſelf from <note place="margin">Vide. Lib. 2. De pecc. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs. Cap. 6. 7.</note> it. But what make Auſtens wordes againſt vs? We confeſſe with Auſten, that man hath alwayes néede of Gods helpe, and we ſay with the ſame Auſten, that they do erre, which ſay that man can not auoyde ſinne, but yet as I haue ſayd before, being ſtayed by the power of God. For otherwiſe theſe wordes of Auſten ſhould be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his owne wordes in his. 13. ſermon <hi>De verbis Apoſtoli,</hi> Of the wordes of the Apoſtle. Where he ſayeth thus. <hi>In hoc agone cum conſtigimus, Deum habemus ſpectatorem, in hoc agone cum laboramus, Deum poſcimus adiuterem. Si enim nos ipſe non adiuuat, non dico vincere, ſed nec pugnare poterimus.</hi> That is. When we ſight in this battayle, we haue God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and loke vpon vs, when we are in daunger in this battayle, we do pray vnto God to helpe vs. But if he do not helpe vs, I ſay not that we ſhall not ouercome, but that we ſhall not be able ſo much as to fight.</p>
               <p>We wil not therefore ſet Auſten againſt him ſelf, but take that meaning of his wordes in one place, that may agrée with his wordes in another place. And ſo are we with Auſten, and not againſt him, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> layeth to our charge. Neyther do we holde with <hi>Pelagius</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vntruth, but if he do in any poynt confeſſe truth, then do we agrée with him, although S. Auſten ſhoulde ſay to the contrary. Loke better vpon your concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (good maſter <hi>Cerberus)</hi> and learne to apply Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19793:26"/>
better than you haue applied the words of S. Paul to the Phillippians, elſe men will ſay ye vnderſtand not <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> S. Paule, for S. Paule doth not there goe about to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe any thing to the power of his owne Frée will: but altogether to ſet forth the exceeding great mercy of God towards him who did ſtay him from falling both in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie and in wealth. As it may well appeare to al that will with iudgement reade the place.</p>
               <p>Your ſentence alſo cyted out of Eſoras: you ſhoulde <note place="margin">4.

What can it make againſt vs which deny not that man hath a choiſe which in ſome ſort is free (as I haue declared) but do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that man which deſpiſeth the warnings and long ſufferings of God in this life, ſhall after this life, in paynes learne to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they did then.

               <p>There followeth the tenth, and the eleauenth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which are theſe: That our victorie commeth not of Gods helpe, but of free choyſe, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes is not giuen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that repent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace and mercy of God, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deſeruing and labor of them, whych by repentaunce are worthy of Gods mercy.

               <p>Thus haue I ſet forth in Englyſhe theſe errours of <hi>Pelagius</hi> together, that thou which art willing to

knowe the truth, and vnderſtande the matter euen as it is, mayeſt be able to iudge, who they are that holde of any of theſe errours, and not to credit the malice of certaine, whych to cloke their owne falſe opinions, accuſe other to be Pelagians, who in dede, from their verie heart and ſoule, abhoral theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opinions, and haue bene manye yeares willyng to beſtow their lyues againſt all theſe abhominable errours.</p>
               <p>Yet is there one thing whervnto <hi>Pelagius</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſubſcribe, whiche I haue not rehearſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the errours afore ſayde, bicauſe the deniall therof, is of all our Goſpellers (as I ſuppoſe) recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for no errour.

That infantes whiche are not baptiſed, can not haue the Kingdome of God nor eternall lyfe. Which cruel opinion, that all vnbaptiſed children are damned, Auſten in manye places of hys workes doth boldly and vehemently mayntayne. But Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin ſayth, <hi>Explodendam eſse illorum gloſsam palam eſt, qui oes non baptizatos, aternae morti adiudicant.</hi> It is cleare (ſayth he) that theyr gloſe is worthye wyth hiſſing or clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of handes, to be driuen out of the dores: which condemne vnto euerlaſting death, all thoſe, whych are not baptiſed, &amp; bicauſe Caluin is with ſo many of vs, whych are Goſpellers, in auctoritie fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to encounter with Auſten: I thynke it good (for ſhortneſſe) in this article to ſay no further.</p>

                  <hi>Cerberus,</hi> minding to enter into that which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:19793:28"/>
before (that is to ſhewe what part of our doctrine he miſſliketh) doeth conclude with his friende to whome he ſéemeth to write this aunſwere: as thoughe he beyng willing to know the truth, and vnderſtande the matter, coulde no more gyue credit to anye that writeth or ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth contrary to that which he hath here written. Whoſe doyngs therein, it pleaſeth him to terme malice, and the accuſing of ſuch as are of ſound beliefe, that thereby they may cloke their owne falſe opinions.</p>
               <p>But if it ſhall pleaſe that friend of his (if any ſuch be) or <hi>Cerberus</hi> himſelfe, to reade this my ſimple Apologie with indifferent mindes: it maye be that they will be of another minde then <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth in thys aunſwere ſhewe himſelfe to be, vnderſtanding that oure doyngs are neither malicious, nor yet the clokings of anye falſe opinions, but the true trauaile of them that ſeke the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the ſaluation of his people, by the ſetting forth of the truth of his eternall and euerlaſting Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination. Let God gyue the increaſe at hys good wyll and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Yet one thing he woulde not ſeme to haue forgotten, but rather of purpoſe to haue deferred to thys place, that he might not ſeme to agrée with <hi>Pelagius</hi> in any point that might ſeme to be erronious. For he hath ſaid before. Here concludeth Auſten with the errours of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Subtillye handled of <hi>Cerberus.</hi> For thoughe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that which <hi>Pelagius</hi> hath by his ſubſcription co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: yet he agréeth not with <hi>Pelagius</hi> in his errour, for he was inforced thus to ſubſcribe, &amp; did afterwardes returne to his olde errours againe, as S. Auſten affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his Cataloge of hereſies. And if he denye it, yet conſenteth he not to <hi>Pelagius</hi> errour: but to <hi>Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> and vs Goſpellers, and to make vs beleue that he is one of vs in this point: he calleth that a cruel opinion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19793:28"/>
that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was conſtrained to ſubſcribe vnto, that is, that Infantes which are not baptiſed can not haue the kingdome of God, nor eternall lyfe. And to knit vp the knot withall, he ſetteth <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> againſt S. Auſten, affirming, that for as muche as in the opinion of verye many of vs Goſpellers (for now <hi>Cerberus</hi> is one of vs) <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> is in authoritie fully able to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with S. Auſten: he will for ſhortneſſe ſake, ſay no further of this article. I woulde I had none occaſion here to thinke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Cerberus</hi> vſeth a figure, which learned men cal <hi>Ironîa.</hi> For what a frumpe is this? That <hi>Caluin</hi> is in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie fully ſufficient, to encounter with Auſten. Surelye <hi>Cerberus</hi> may be a Goſpeller, as he tearmeth him ſelfe: but no Papiſt could deuiſe to giue a more kindely mocke to <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; vs Goſpellers, than this is. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the authoritie of wryters, is iudged to ſtande chiefely in the auncientneſſe of their writings, and then there is no compariſon to be made betwixt <hi>Caluin</hi> and S. Auguſtine, who liued .x. hundreth yere &amp; more before this day. And <hi>Caluins</hi> modeſtie was neuer ſo little, as to compare him ſelfe with Auſten, but in all his writings he doth reuerence the iudgement of that learned Father, and doeth alledge his auctoritie in confirming of truthes, ſo far forth as the ſame doth not diſſent from truth. And Auſten neuer deſired to haue hys iudgement in matters to be otherwiſe receiued, than the ſame ſhould be found to be ſound, &amp; according to the Scriptures. As appeareth in his. 7. Epiſtle, and in the Proeme of his thirde booke <hi>De Trinitate.</hi> Of the Trinitie. Whoſe woordes concerning this matter, being many, it ſhall ſuffiſe to note this ſhort ſentence. <hi>Noli meis litteris quaſi Scripturis canonicis inſtruire, ſed in illis, &amp; quod non credebas cum inueneris, incunctanter cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: in istis autem, quod certum non habebas, niſi certum intellex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eris, noli firmiter retinere.</hi> That is. Be not bounde vnto my
<pb facs="tcp:19793:29"/>
writings, as vnto the Canonical Scriptures: but when thou ſhalt finde in the Scriptures that whiche thou didſt not beleue, beleue it without any delay or doubting: but when thou findeſt that in my writings, which thou didſt not know certainlye before, except thou ſhalt certainlye vnderſtand it, do not ſtiſfely affirme it.</p>
               <p>I am ſure that <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> did always obſerue this rule in reading S. Auſtens workes. And if he were nowe liuing woulde giue <hi>Cerberus</hi> the hire of a mocking Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſite, thus to ſet him againſt S. Auſten. Yea, it might haue becommed <hi>Cerberus</hi> very well, either to haue bene ſhorter, and haue written no worde of this matter: or elſe to haue vttered his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this article, in ſuche ſorte that the reader might haue vnderſtand thereby the truth of the article, and howe <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; we that be Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers do hold this article, not ſetting our ſelues againſt S. Auſten, but for good cauſe diſſenting in Iudgement, both from <hi>Pelagius</hi> and Auſten. And yet hauing a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend opinion of the one, do deteſt and abhorre the errour of the other.</p>
               <p>Well, I maye not be ſo ſhorte in this matter as <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> is, but I thinke it my dutie, hauing this occaſion, to do what ſhall lie in me, to let the reader vnderſtande that S. Auſten is not ſo much to be blamed for this cruell opinion, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> woulde haue men to thinke that <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> doth recken him to be. Neither doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy inſtrument of God, mind to make the name of Auſten odious to the Chriſtian reader, as it ſemeth that <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> would make the names of both thoſe men of God.</p>
               <p>Marke therfore, gentle reader, what might cauſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſome thing to ſwarue from the truth in thys article. He had to do with ſuche a one as denied Infantes to be ſpotted with Adams ſinne, and that therfore they neded no regeneration, and ſo conſequently no ſacrament of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19793:29"/>
The abhomination of this errour cauſed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to flye ſo far on the other ſide, that he had not ſuch a conſideration of the promiſe of God, as he ſhoulde haue had. And ſo affirmed more than once, that al that die with out baptiſme muſt nedes be damned. Let vs be contented that God hath by this errour ſhewed Saint Auſten to bée a man. And let vs giue him thankes for the abundaunce of good doctrine that this man hath lefte in writing, not doubting, but that that mercifull Lorde whom he ſerued, woulde not ſuffer him to ende his life in that errour (no more than he dyd in the <hi>Manicheis</hi> hereſie, which he did ſometime ſtoutly defende) althoughe it haue not pleaſed him to ſuffer it to appeare in writing, that euer he did acknowledge it to be an errour.</p>
               <p>As touching the opinion, that <hi>Caluin</hi> and we Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers do holde concerning Infantes that die withoute baptiſme: it differeth ſomething from Auſten, but more from <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Yea, we doe as muche abhorre the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as Auſten did. For we affirme, and are able by the Scriptures to proue, that al Adams natural children are deade throughe Adams ſinne, and that none of them can be quickened and reuiued againe, otherwiſe than by Chriſt. And that ſo many as are not giuen vnto Chriſt, do ſtil remain in that ſinne, and cannot be ſaued. So far off are we from this Pelagian hereſie.</p>
               <p>Nowe that it maye appeare howe wée differ from S. Auſten: I will cite ſome matter out of the woorkes of maiſter <hi>Iohn Caluin.</hi> Not as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth, to ſet him directly againſt Auſten, but to ſhewe how God hath reuealed vnto hys ſeruant <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> that ſecret that he had not reuealed vnto his ſeruant Auſten ſo fully: ſo far forth as we can finde written in his bookes. Firſt, we reade in the booke of maiſter <hi>Iohn Caluins</hi> Inſtitutions in the title of Pedobaptiſme or baptiſing of Chyldren,
<pb facs="tcp:19793:30"/>

To enioy the miſerable enheritaunce of ſinne: it is enough to be a man: for if dwelleth in fleſh and bloud. But to enioy the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it is required of neceſſitie, that a man be faithfull, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or felowſhip of Chriſt is obtained by ſaith. To In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, it is after a certaine peculiar maner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated.

               <p>By theſe wordes of <hi>Caluin,</hi> it appeareth how we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Auguſtine, for we are of one minde with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> who denieth not, that the children of the vnfaithfull

Whether Auſten continued to the ende in that minde that he ſheweth him ſelfe in certaine of hys writings concerning this matter: it is vncertaine, for in his Retractations there is no mention therof.

Adam therfore, beyng ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a creature, that there was in him no luſt to ſinne, and yet ſo weake, that of himſelfe he was not able to withſtand the aſſault of the ſubtile ſerpent: no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medye, the onely cauſe of his fall, muſt nedes be the predeſtination of God.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt, dearly beloued, in the concluſion of this ſentence one point declared, wherin the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie doth conſiſt. For where he plainlye affirmeth, that Gods predeſtination is the only cauſe of Adams fall, which is the ſountayne of all ſinne: other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a much more reuerend opinion of God and of hys holye predeſtination, do ſet their fote, or rather their heart and ſoule, agaynſt their ſayd concluſion.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19793:32"/>
one partie or the other, but in the balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of vpright iudgement, waye the difference. The one ſayth (as in this concluſion manifeſtlye appeareth, and as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, yet more plainly he affirmeth) that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination of God, is the onelye cauſe of Adams ſinne, and ſo conſequently of all euill. The other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth directly contrary. That God or his predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is the cauſe of no ſinne or euyll, but the only cauſe of all goodneſſe and vertue. And herewyth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth the holye and diuine Apoſtle Sainct Iohn in hys Epiſtle ſaying. All that is in the worlde, as the <note place="margin">1.

               <p>I do acknowledge that this Engliſh booke, that <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> ſaith he hath read, was of my writing.

Whiche I neuer ment to teache, neither do my wordes, duely conſidered, giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion of ſuch concluſion.</p>
               <p>I graunt, my words might haue bene more explaned, and my meaning ſet forth more at large, and all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuche calumniations cut off, if I had ſene that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wrate that booke, whiche I thanke my Lord God, I haue ſene ſince. Wherfore I minde by the help of God to do that now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I was not ſo well able to do then, that the Reader may perceiue, that I haue with Auſten profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in writing. My words that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth, are theſe. <note place="margin">August. prol. 1. lib. Retract.</note> Adam therefore, being ſo perfect a creature, that there was in him no luſt to ſinne, and yet ſo weak, that of him ſelfe he was not able to withſtande the aſſault of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19793:33"/>
ſerpent: no remedie, the only cauſe of his fall, muſt nedes be the predeſtination of God. <hi>Cerberus</hi> findeth no fault with any of theſe wordes, till he commeth to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. And then no remedy, I muſt be condemned as one that affirmeth Gods Predeſtination to be the onelye cauſe of Adams ſinne, and ſo conſequentlye of all ſinne. But I haue not ſaide that Gods predeſtination was the onelye cauſe, or anye cauſe of Adams ſinne. My wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be that Gods Predeſtination is the onelye cauſe of Adams fall. Nowe <hi>Cerberus</hi> can not ſée howe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams fall may be good, and therefore he ſayeth that it is the fountaine of all ſinne, and that to be the cauſe of that fall, is to be the cauſe of all ſinne. But ſuche as haue eyes to ſée, do ſée, that as Gods predeſtination is the cauſe of Adams fall: ſo Adams fall is good. For it is the meane whereby God hath ſhut vp all vnder vnbeliefe, that he <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> might haue mercye on all. And the meane whereby the <note place="margin">Galath. 3.</note> Scripture ſhutteth vp all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe which is of the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, might be giuen to the faithfull.</p>
               <p>I write therefore now, as I wrate before in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutation of <hi>Shaxtons</hi> Articles: that for aſmuch as there was in Adam nothing to moue him to ſinne (for luſt to do contrarie to Gods wil, was not yet entred into him) &amp; Sathan the enimy had no power then, neither hath anye power yet, ouer anye creature of God, further than God doth limit and appoint him: it muſt nedes followe, that the only cauſe that Adam was aſſaulted &amp; ouerthrowen by Satan, was the predeſtination of God, which is euer all one with his vnſearcheable will &amp; counſel. The fall of Adam thus conſidered, neyther is, nor can be counted ſinne: for it is the performance of Gods purpoſe, whiche is euer good, although vnſearchable by mans feble vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And yet I do not denie Adams fall to be ſinno
<pb facs="tcp:19793:34"/>
in Adam himſelf: for it was <hi>Factum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tramandatum Dei.</hi> A dede done contrary to the commaſidentent of God. And ſo it had a cauſe in Adam himſelfe, which was the power of his wil, whereby he conſented to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enticement of Satan, who vſed the woman as his inſtrument therin. Of thys will and the power therof, Sainct Auſten writeth thus: <hi>De libero arbitrio, lib. 3. Cap. 18.

his owne fréewill.

               <p>By theſe places of S. Auſten, we maye ſee of what minde he was concerning the frée will of man before his fall. It was ſuche that hée mighte conſent to what hée woulde.

               <p>The cauſe of Adams fall therfore, euen by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S.

But the cauſe that made his fall ſinne, was in himſelfe.

               <p>If <hi>Cerberus</hi> could conſider the fall of the firſt man after this ſort: he would neuer conclude, that I teaching that the Predeſtination of God was the onelye cauſe of mans fall, ſhoulde withall conclude, that it is the onlye cauſe of all ſinne and euill. For I do not teache that it is the cauſe of any euill or ſinne at all.</p>
               <p>In vaine therfore, doeth <hi>Cerberus</hi> make his <hi>Antite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> or compariſon of contraryes, when he ſayth. The one affirmeth that the Predeſtination of God is the onelye
<pb facs="tcp:19793:35"/>
cauſe of Adams ſinne, and ſo conſequentlye of all euill: And the other affirmeth directly contrary, that God or his Predeſtination is the cauſe of no ſinne or euil. And much more vaine is it, that he citeth ſo manye teſtimonies of Scripture to that purpoſe. For I affirme that which he woulde make men beleue I denye, and denye that which he would haue men to thinke I do affirme.</p>
               <p>But one thing I woulde gladly learne of <hi>Cerberus.</hi> That is, where he findeth, eyther in Scripture, or in auncient writer, that Adams fall is the fountayne of all euill. We may manifeſtly proue by Scripture, that ſinne was before Adam fell, otherwiſe there coulde haue bene no tempter to entice him to ſinne. For God tempteth no man to euill. And man had in himſelfe no concupiſcence <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> or luſt to ſinne: therfore euill was before Adam fell. And conſequently, Adams ſal was not the fountain of al euil.</p>
               <p>Sainct Auſten in the .ix. Chapter of his firſte booke of Retractations ſayth, that when he with others had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched from whence euill might ſpring: it was agréed vpon amongſt them, that it had none other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine than the frée choyſe of the will. Mans fall can not then be the fountaine of all euill: for there was euill in Aungels before man was made, and that ſprang out of the frée choyſe of the will that was in the Aungelles.</p>
               <p>But graunt, that the fall of man had bene the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of all euill: might not Gods predeſtination be the cauſe of mans fal, but it muſt ſtraight waye follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlye that the ſame is the cauſe of all the euill that ſpringeth therof? Then tell me (maiſter <hi>Cerberus)</hi> how it may be, that Gods predeſtination is not the cauſe of all the euill that ſpringeth of the frée choyſe of will. For this ye wil not deny, I am ſure, that God hath predeſtinated, both men and Aungels to haue the frée choiſe of wil. And his will alone, according to which he hath predeſtinated
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19793:35"/>
all things, is the cauſe why men and Aungels haue the frée choyſe of wil. Shal we ſay therefore, that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the cauſe of all euill? bicauſe it is the cauſe of that whereout all euilles do ſpring? No thou hell hound, not ſo. God is altogether good, and the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and from him can ſpring nothing that is not good. All thoſe things therfore that ſpring out of the frée choiſe of the will, are exceding good, as God, or his predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe of them, and the euill that is in them, commeth of the inſtrument whereby God doth worke thoſe things. I pray you therfore, loke better vpon your conſequently. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the ſentence that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth oute of S. Auſten: <hi>Non ergo caſus ruentium. &amp;c.</hi> I thynke if a man ſhould vpon a Moneth warning, require to ſée the place where S. Auſten writeth thoſe wordes: it would be hard for <hi>Cerberus</hi> to ſhewe it him. And therfore I blame him not, though he haue not quoted the place. But to do him a pleaſure, I haue ſought it in S. Auſtens workes and founde it <hi>In decimo. articulo falſo Augustino impoſito.</hi> In the x. of thoſe articles that were falſlye aſcribed to S. Auſten. Of what auctoritie that booke of S Auſten is, may eaſely appeare to them that will reade his Retractations: for it is not mentioned among the bookes that he retracted, and reformed in ſuche pointes as he himſelfe miſſeliked. But leſt maiſter <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſhould ſaye (as the Papiſtes vſe to ſay of the Proteſtantes, and as ſome Frée wil men haue ſaid of vs that teache the doctrine of predeſtination) that this is the common ſhift of all heretikes and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate defenders of vntruthes, to diminiſh the auctoritie of Scriptures and ſayings of Doctours that are alleaged againſt them, by ſaying that the ſame are not autentike, or that they maye be ſuſpected not to be the writings of them in whoſe name they be ſet abrode: I will admit
<pb facs="tcp:19793:36"/>
this ſaying of S. Auſten as his owne, and that therein he ment as he wrote, and that his meaning is true. Let vs weigh the wordes of S. Auſten therfore, and ſee how his meaning may be true, &amp; yet agrée wyth the doctrine that we teache. The predeſtination of God (ſayth he) hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtirred vp, counſelled, nor enforced, the falles of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do ruſh downe headlong, nor the malignitie of them that be wicked, nor the deſiers of them that do ſinne: but doubtleſſe he hath predeſtinated his iudgement, whereby he will rewarde euerye man according to his doings, whether the ſame be good or euill. Whiche iudgement ſhould not be, if it were the will of God that men ſhoulde ſinne. I haue tranſlated theſe wordes ſomewhat other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth. But whether of vs both better expreſſe the meaning of S. Auſten, let the learned iudge. And whether I haue not tranſlated theym ſo that they may ſerue better for <hi>Cerberus</hi> purpoſe, than as they are tranſlated by himſelfe. Let vs therefore loke to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and howe they make with vs or againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Sainct Auſten teacheth that Gods predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth not ſtir vp, entice or enforce any man to ſal, to be wicked, or to haue a deſire to ſinne. And which of vs doth teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary? Euen you ſir (ſaith <hi>Cerberus)</hi> when ye ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Predeſtination of God, muſt nedes be the only cauſe of Adams fall. To this I haue ſufficiently aunſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any aunſwere wil ſatiſfie <hi>Cerberus.</hi> But yet for further aunſwere I ſaye nowe, that I haue not at anye time ſaide or written, that Gods predeſtination did ſtirre vp, entice or driue Adam to fall. Wherfore I haue not taught contrary to S. Auſten in thys pointe. But <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> will ſaye that our meaning is not alone with S. Auſtens. Let vs therefore examine S. Auſtens meaning. I vnderſtand his meaning to be, that when man doeth fall, is wicked, or deſireth to ſinne: his will is not by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19793:36"/>
Gods Predeſtination ſtirred vp, enticed or compelled thervnto, but doth fréely conſent therevnto being ſtirred vp, prouoked and driuen forwarde by the tempter, and by none other meane, if we ſpeake of the firſt man, for in him was not, before his fall, that concupiſcence that is nowe in vs, &amp; was in him after his fall. Whether thys be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true meaning of S. Auſten or no, let the learned iudge. And why may not the ſame meaning be gathered of my wordes, when I ſaye, that Adam being ſo perfect a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there was in him no luſt to ſinne, and yet ſo weake, that of himſelfe he was not able to withſtand the aſſault of the ſubtile ſerpent: no remedie, the onlye cauſe of his fall muſt nedes be the Predeſtination of God. I ſay not, that Gods Predeſtination did ſtir, prouoke, or dryue him forward to fall: And why maye I not meane as S. Auſten doth in the eleauenth chapter of his booke, <hi>De cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptione &amp; gratia,</hi> where he ſayeth (as I haue cited before) <hi>Nec ipſum ergo Deus eſse voluit ſine ſua gratia, quem reliquit in ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Tale quippe erat adiutoriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod deſereret cum vellet, &amp; in quopermaneret ſivellet, non quo fieret vt vellet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God therfore (ſayth Auſten) would not ſuffer him to be without his grace, whom he had left in hys owne frée choiſe: for free will is able inough to do euill, but to do good it hath no power at all, except it be holpen of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty goodneſſe: which help, if that man had not by his frée wil forſaken, he ſhould haue bene good for euer, but he did forſake &amp; was forſaken. For the help was ſuch that he might forſake it when he woulde, and ſuche wherein he might remaine if he woulde, not ſuch whereby it might come to paſſe that he ſhould be willing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:37"/>
Doth not S. Auſten affirme here, that the help of God which Adam had, was not ſuche, that by it he might be willing neuer to forſake it? And what other cauſe of this can you find: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Predeſtination of God, which is according to his euerlaſting will, vnto the whiche all things are and muſt be ſubiect.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Cerberus</hi> will not be ſatiſfied with thys: let him remember the ſaying of S. Paule, which S. Auſten doth <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> ſo often vſe, to ſtop the mouthes of the vnaunſwereable enimies of Gods frée grace and predeſtination. <hi>O altitudo diuitiarum, ſapientiae &amp; ſcientiae Dei. Quám incomprehenſibilia ſunt iudicia cius, &amp; inuestigabiles viae cius?</hi> O the depeneſſe of the richeſſe of the wiſedome and knowledge of God. Nowe incomprehenſible are hys iudgementes, and hys wayes paſt finding out?

               <p>And although there be ſome places of Scripture, whervpon they would ground this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that men ſhould ſinne by the wyll of God, or that God ſhould predeſtinate or ordeyne men to ſinne, as where it is ſayde, that God hardened the heart of Pharao, and ſuch like: yet partayneth it nothing to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if it be wayed with the reſt of the Scriptures. For as Auſten ſaith. <hi>Ipſe quaſi cos indurat, quia iusto iudicio indurari ſinit. Lib. de eſsentia Diuinitatis.</hi> He doth (ſaith Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten) as it were harden them, bicauſe, that with his iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he ſuffreth them to be hardened. And in his booke, <hi>De libero arbitrio &amp; gratia. Cap.</hi> 21. he ſayeth: Where at any time we reade in the ſcripture, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſeduced, or their hearts hardened of God: there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19793:37"/>
may we not doubt, but that their wicked deſeruings went before, leſt ye runne (ſayth he) into the ſaying of Salomon. <hi>Inſipientia viri violat vias cius. Deum autem cauſatur in corde ſuo.</hi> The fooliſhneſſe of a man defileth his wayes, but he ſayeth in his heart, God is the cauſe of this hardening of heart.</p>
               <p>Melancthon, in his common places, ſpeaketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainely, ſaying: <hi>Nec figure illae verborum offendunt. &amp;c.</hi> Neither, ſayth he, do theſe figuratiue ſpeaches offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. As I wil harden the heart of Pharao &amp; ſuch like. For it is certaine, that in the Hebrew phraſe, they ſignify a permiſſion or ſuffring, and not an effectuall wyl of God, as, Lead vs not into temptation, that is to ſay, Suffer vs not to be led into temptation. Theſe are Melancthons woordes. And marke what he ſayth of the Hebrew phraſe, for al men know him to be a man learned. But to be ſhort, it is ſurely to be maruelled at, that although they do thus accuſe Gods Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be the only cauſe of Adams fal (which is in dede, not onely ſinne, but alſo the very welſpring of al wickedneſſe, and the filthy fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe) yet they dare affirme themſelues to be the only friendes and louers of Gods Predeſtination, &amp; al others to be the enimies of Gods holy Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doe not ſubſcribe to this their fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call imagination. Moreouer, if it ſhould be ſaid, that they make God the Autor of ſinne, they would crie naye, and ſaye they were ſlaundered. But, whether God be not the autor of that, whereof he is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye cauſe: let the vncorrupted heart iudge. Alſo to ſaye the truth, when they ſee their time and place, they are bolde inoughe, yea, euen to vſe the terme Autor, in that ſame manifeſt ſenſe, as in a boke ſet forth by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> againſt an aduerſarie of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
<pb facs="tcp:19793:38"/>
(as he calleth hym) where, in the. 158. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he ſayth thus.</p>
               <p>Therfore, whatſoeuer the Ethnickes and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant did attribute vnto Fortune, wee aſſigne to the prouidence of God. And ſtraight way he ſayth. We ſhall iudge nothing to come of fortune, but that all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by the determination of hys counſell. And furder, it diſpleaſeth him when we eſteme any thing to procede from any other, ſo that we do not behold hym and know him, not only the principall cauſe of al things: but alſo the auctour, appointing al things, to the one part or to the other by his counſell.</p>
               <p>Marke well his wordes, and the very ſenſe therof. All commeth of God, ſayth he, God is the principal cauſe, and God is the auctour of it whatſoeuer it be. God appointeth al things, both to the one part and to the other, both to the wicked and to the godly all things, nothing is excepted, aſwell damnation as ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as well ſinne as vertue, as well wickedneſſe as holyneſſe, yea, if it happen to be murder it ſelfe, for that a little before he rehearſeth. Whatſoeuer it be, it procedeth from none other (ſaith he) but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, God ſo hath appointed it. God is the principal cauſe of it. Yea, and not onely the principall cauſe: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the auctor of it. Here ſeeſt thou thoſe playne ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, which ſometime for a little nice liſpyng, they can not, or will not ſpeake, that God is the auctour of all murder and miſchiefe. As for fortune, I knowe it to be an Heatheniſh fable, but where he ſaith, that God is not onelye the principall cauſe, but alſo the auctour of all things, without any exception: and that whatſoeuer the Ethnickes attributed vnto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that ſame we ought to aſcribe to the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God: it is ſuche a wide wandring and large blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemye,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19793:38"/>
as hath not bene lightlye heard. For who knoweth not, that vnto fortune the Ethnickes aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed treaſon, and craftie conſpiracie. As where they call her <hi>Inſidioſa, Perſida</hi> &amp; <hi>Maleſida.</hi> Vnto fortune they aſcribe cruell murder, and tyrannicall miſchiefe. As when they call her <hi>Aspera, Dura, Saeua, Truculenta.</hi> Vnto fortune they aſcribed filthy luſt and impudent baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye: as when they call her <hi>Lenocinaus, Bruta</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudens.</hi> Vnto fortune they aſcribed, ſcornefull pride, and vaine glory, calling her, <hi>Imperioſa, Procax</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</hi> Vnto fortune they aſcribed, beaſtly blindneſſe, &amp; rude ignoraunce, calling her <hi>Coeca,</hi> and <hi>Exoculata.</hi> To conclude, vnto fortune, the Ethnickes aſcribed all peruerſe and peſtilent wickedneſſe, and all abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation deteſtable, calling her <hi>Nefaria, Abhominanda</hi> &amp; <hi>Improba.</hi> Yet ſaye theſe profeſſors of deſtiny: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Ethnickes aſcribed vnto fortune, that ſame ought we to attribute to the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God: yea and God is the very auctor, the principal cauſe, and the only cauſe therof.</p>

                  <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſuppoſeth nowe, that he hath pulled from vs y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of our faith. For he ſaith, that thoſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that we would ground our opinion vpon, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing to that purpoſe, when they be weighed with the reſt of the ſcriptures. For the triall of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhalbe mete for me at this time, plainly to ſet down in writing, what the opinion is, that I and other of my minde in this matter of Predeſtination, doe holde. And then, what thoſe Scriptures be that <hi>Cerberus</hi> meaneth of, conferring the ſame with as manye other places of ſcripture, as haue any ſhewe of a contrarye meaning: ſo
<pb facs="tcp:19793:39"/>
ſhall it appeare what <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath wonne by that he citeth out of Auſten and Melancthon. Firſt, we hold that what ſoeuer hath bene from the beginning, is nowe, or ſhal be to the ende and for euer: was in Gods purpoſe without beginning, and predeſtinated or foreappointed to be in the time and order that it hath ben, is, or ſhal be: ſo that nothing hath, doth or ſhal come to paſſe otherwiſe than he hath withoute beginning purpoſed and foreap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ſame. The reaſons that we ſtay vppon, are theſe. Gods power is abſolute, ſo that what he will do, hé is able to do, and what he will haue done, can not be let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary power, &amp; what he wil not haue done, can not by anye power be done. But his power coulde not be abſolute. &amp;c. if ought might be done otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath purpoſed &amp; appointed. Therfore, all things come to paſſe, euen as he hath without beginning purpoſed &amp; appointed the ſame. Another reaſon is thus. Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is moſt perfect; ſo that whatſoeuer he doeth, is ſo done, that the doing thereof cannot be repented: But if ought that he doth, might fal out otherwiſe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ment it ſhould, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did it, it ſhould folow that his wiſdome were not moſt perfect, for it is not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> point of a wiſe man to ſaye, I thought not that it woulde haue ſo happened. Therfore nothing hath, doeth, or ſhall happen otherwyſe than he ment it ſhould, when he did firſt ordeine it. The third reaſon is; that his foreknowledge can not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but euen as he did foreſée, and know before hande, that things ſhould come to paſſe, ſo they haue, be, and ſhal be brought to paſſe. But this coulde not be, if things ſhould be done, otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al things haue, are and ſhal be done by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe be the chief reaſons that we ſtay vpon.

               <p>To conclude, in the laſt chapter of the ſame booke, we reade the matter repeated after this ſort. <hi>Nolite timere, num Dei poſsumus reſistere voluntati?

               <p>By theſe Scriptures it appeareth plainelye, that all thoſe thinges that Herode, Pilate, and the Iewes did to Chriſt: that Pharao did in the hardneſſe of his heart: that the ſonnes of Sinacharib did to their Father: and that Ioſephes brethren did vnto him: were all done by the determinate purpoſe and Predeſtination of God. Whervpon, it ſemeth to me, that we may conclude that all other actions are done according to the ſame purpoſe and predeſtination. Otherwiſe, we muſt nedes confeſſe, that God is either diſapointed of his purpoſe oftentimes, or elſe that he createth many things, not knowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

I am ſure <hi>Cerberus</hi> can not applye this place better to his purpoſe, than it is in this argument applied.

For to be willing or vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is after ſuch ſort in the power of him that is willing or vnwilling, that it be not a let to the will of God, nor do ouercome his power. For of them that do thoſe things that he willeth not, both he make thoſe things that he is willing to make. And where as it is written: that he is willing that all men ſhould be ſaued, and yet all be not ſaued: it may be vnderſtanded many wayes, whereof we haue in our other little workes made mention of ſome, but I wil now ſpeake of one moe. This is the ſaying. He is willing that all men ſhoulde be ſaued, that therby, all that be predeſtinated might be vnderſtande, for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them are men of all ſortes. As it was ſayd to the Phariſeis, ye doe pay the tenth of euerye garden hearbe. Where we may not vnderſtande, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19793:43"/>
For in expounding of theſe wordes of S. Paule, God is willing that al men ſhould be ſaued &amp; come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth: S. Auſten doth affirme as much as we do, as may wel appeare to as many as will way theſe places of his, with indifferent iudgement.</p>
               <p>One other place for this purpoſe, is written in the. 33. Chapter of Ezechiell. The words are theſe. <hi>Viuo ego dicit Dominus. Nolo mortem impij, ſed vt conuertatur impius à via ſua, &amp; viuat. Conuertimini, conuertimini, à vijs vestris peſsimis, &amp; quarè moriemini domus Iſrael?</hi> That is to ſay. As truely as I liue, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that the vngodly be conuerted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys owne way and liue.

               <p>That is to ſaye. If we reade this negligently, it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be the ſame prophecie, that is before, wherin it is ſaid, do I willingly deſire the death of the vngodly, ſayth the Lorde: or, but that he be conuerted from his owne euill waye and liue? And in the ende of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie: Be ye conuerted and come backe againe from all your vngodlineſſes, and your iniquities ſhall not turne you to tormentes. For in that place he ſpeaketh vnto thoſe which are willing to repent, and by righteous life, to blot out their ſinnes, that they might with ſure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence returne vnto God, and with full mindes repent. But in this place he ſpeaketh vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that throughe the greatneſſe of their owne ſinnes (yea their owne impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) do diſpayre of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſay. Our iniquities and our ſinnes are vppon vs, and in them doe we conſume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: how can we therefore liue? And this is their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Seing that death is once ſet before vs, and no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is able to heale our wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: what nede we labour and be conſumed, and not paſſe ouer thys life with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo, that at the leaſt way we may enioy this life?

               <p>By theſe wordes of S.

For Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome ſaith, that in the .xviii. Chapter of his Prophecie, Ezechiell ſpeaketh to them that be penitent, and woulde by righteous life blot out their ſinnes paſt. Theſe doth he there encourage, with bolde courage and aſſured hope of forgiueneſſe at Gods hand, to go forward with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance begon, ſaying: Be ye conuerted, and returne againe from all your vngodlineſſes, and your iniquities ſhall not turne you to torment. But in this place, in the 33. of his Prophecie (ſayth S.

The greatneſſe of our ſinnes can be no cauſe why we ſhould diſpaire of Gods mercy.

Nowe, if God do permit any thing to be done which he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhould be done, how is he almightye? Other there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as learned as Melancthon, haue ſayd, &amp; in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truly: that to permit and to will is alone, in him that can not be enforced to permit or ſuffer that which he is not willing ſhould be. But as I haue declared before, we affirme not, that the actions, wordes, and thoughtes of man, as they are willed or permitted by God, are or can be ſinne. For he being altogether good, and nothing elſe but goodneſſe; can not will or permit anye thing that is euill. The euill therefore that is in mens thoughtes, wordes or actions, commeth of the Deuil and mens own willes: which God doth will or permit, as a meane, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſet forth his mercie in forgiuing, or his iuſtice in puniſhing, whiche in that reſpect can not be other than good. What <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath wonne by citing theſe words of Melancthon: let y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> learned that haue read other mens writings vppon this matter, iudge. I haue ſayde that I thinke to be true.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Cerberus</hi> thinketh to paye vs home. To be ſhorte, ſayeth he, it is ſurelye to be maruelled at, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe they doe thus accuſe Gods Predeſtination to be the onely cauſe of Adams ſall (which is in dede not onely ſinne, but alſo the very welſpring of all wickedneſſe, and the ſilthy fountaine of all our vncleanneſſe) that yet they dare affirme themſelues to be the onely friendes and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of Gods Predeſtination. &amp;c. <hi>Cerberus</hi> will be ſhorte now. Well let him be aunſwered as ſhortly. He hath all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19793:47"/>
this while laboured to proue that was neuer denied, that is, that the ſinne of Adam in his firſt fall, is the cauſe of al the ſinne that hath bene, is, or ſhalbe committed by his poſterity. For we hold, that after Adam had once ſinned, neyther he nor anye of hys poſteritie, being naturallye brought forth in this worlde, could of them ſelues do any other thing than ſinne. The cauſe wherof we ſay, is that concupiſcence and luſt to do euil, which entred into him, &amp; from him is deſcended into his poſteritie. But what is this to the cauſe of Adams fall. Thys concupiſcence was not in Adam before his fall. It could not therefore be the cauſe therof. And as I haue declared before: Adams fall coulde not be the cauſe of all ſinne: for ſinne was before Adam fell. We knowe that ſinne is not a creature: but it is a falling away of the creature from that order that the Creator did commaunde the creature to continue in. But this was in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Aungels, <hi>Ergo</hi> before the fall of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fall of man therfore was declared what mans frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will was able to do. It was able to admit ſinne, and ſo by freewill ſinne entred into man, and by man into the world, that is into all naturall men. And yet we ſay not, that either mans freewill or man himſelfe is euill, as he is Gods creature, and fréewill Gods gifte. I conclude therfore, that as the fall of Adam was the performance of Gods purpoſe, ſo was it no ſinne, but excéeding good, as euery performance of Gods purpoſes muſte néedes be. And ſo the Predeſtination of God being the cauſe therof, is no cauſe of ſinne. Let <hi>Cerberus</hi> maruel as much as he will, how we can graunt God to be the cauſe and not the Autour of ſinne. For we do not ſay that Gods Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the cauſe of ſinne. Much leſſe doe we ſay that he is the Autour, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth charge vs by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of certayne wordes written by <hi>Iohn Knoxe</hi> againſt an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie of Gods Predeſtination.</p>

Although <hi>Iohn Knoxe</hi> being yet liuing, &amp; able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his owne writings, I might refer <hi>Cerberus</hi> to his aunſwere: yet I wil not ſticke to write a few lines in the defence of his doctrine in this point. <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſéemeth to miſlike with <hi>Knoxe</hi> for two things: one is, for that he ſaith that we aſſigne to the prouidence of God, all things that the Ethnickes and Ignoraunt attributed vnto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And the other is, for that hée ſayth that we know and beholde God to be, not onelye the principall cauſe, but alſo the authour of all things, appointing them to the one parte or ſo the other by hys counſell. Thys is (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> ſuche a wyde wandring blaſphemie, as hath not lightly bene hearde of.

For what mad man woulde write words in ſuch meaning, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> would haue vs thinke that <hi>Iohn Knoxe</hi> wrate his? That is, to call God deceyiſull, vnfaythful, and vntruſty? Rough, hard, ſierce and cruel? Bawdy, beaſtly, and ſhameleſſe? Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, malapert, and proude? Blinde, and wythout eyes? Wicked, to be abhorred, and altogether naught? Was there euer man ſo farre beſide himſelf, as to wryte of God in this meaning? I durſt appeale to <hi>Cerberus</hi> himſelfe (though he be the dogge of Hell) whyther in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he doe thinke that it were poſſible that any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man may ſo far forget him ſelfe, as to write words in any ſuch meaning.

                  <hi>Iohn Knoxe</hi> words, and ſeke a better ſenſe in them than this. If he wil do ſo, he ſhall finde that <hi>Iohn Knoxe</hi> meaning is, that where as the Ethnickes and Ignorant attributed vnto fortune, a power to giue or take away,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19793:48"/>
to preſerue or deſtroy, to helpe or to hinder. We which know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there is no ſuch power in any other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in God, do aſſigne all theſe things to his prouidence: knowing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nothing commeth to paſſe by Fortune or chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but that God by his prouidence doth gouerne and rule all things, appoynting them to the one parte, or the other, by hys counſell. And when he appointeth anye to that thing which in them is ſinne (as was the murder of Sinacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib in his owne ſonnes) yet in Gods purpoſe it is good, for it is the execution of his iuſt iudgement, or the meane whereby his glorie ſhal be the more aduaunced in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercie.

No, ſaye the freewill men. Here thou ſeeſt dearly beloued, who they are that ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie are noted with the name of freewyll men.

Theſe men, I ſay, whych affirme that Caine was predeſtinate to murder hys innocent brother Abell. And as in the ſame boke and the ſame Article alſo, he ſayth, that the moſt wicked perſons that haue bene, were of God appointed to bee wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked euen as they were. They hold the errour both of the Stoikes, and alſo of the Manicheans. That is to ſay, as Auſten declareth in the ninth &amp; .xvi. chapter of the firſt boke of his Retractations: that euil hath his original of Gods ordinance, &amp; not of mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil. For if murderers, theues, adulterers, traitours, &amp; Rebelles be of God predeſtinated and appoynted to be wicked eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they are, and can not chooſe but of mere neceſſitie by the ordinance of God commit, al ſuch wickedneſſe, euen as they do: then what is our lyfe but a mere deſtinie, all our doyngs Gods ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and all oure imaginations, braunches of Gods predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And I doubt not, but the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ikes and Manicheans, would alſo temper the matter

wyth a great diſcretion of wordes, as theſe men wyll ſaye, that we muſt ſpeake more reuerentlie of the matter. But ſeyng they plainely holde theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and when they ſee theyr tyme, ſpeake plainely thereof them ſelues, as you maye well perceyue by that whych hath alredy, and ſhal yet be more largely rehearſed: I ſee no cauſe why it ſhould not of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be plainely declared. Agayne, if it be a trueth, why ſhould it not be plainly ſpoken, if it be a truth, that traitours be predeſtinate of God to conſpire the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Princes, and Rebels predeſtinate of God to make inſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt their ſoueraines: If (I ſay) it be a trueth, that God hath ſo predeſtinated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that they muſt of neceſſity, &amp; can not chooſe but commit ſuch wyckedneſſe: why ſhoulde it not be plainly ſpoken? except a man ſhould be aſhamed to ſpeake the trueth.

                  <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath in this his returne to <hi>Crowley,</hi> written, I might referre the Reader to that whiche I haue already written.

               <p>I haue ſaide, that Gods predeſtination was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe of Adams fall, that Caine was predeſtinate to ſlea his brother Abell, and that the moſt wicked perſons that haue bene, were of God appointed to be wicked, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they were. For the firſt, I referre the Reader to that which I haue alreadie written thereof. For the ſeconde, I ſay: that as God predeſtinated Abell to be a figure of Chriſt and his Churche in ſuffering, ſo he predeſtinated Caine to be a figure of the cruell perſecuting Iewes &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that haue, do, &amp; ſhall perſecute Chriſt &amp; his Church. And as Caine in ſleaing his brother Abell was a figure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19793:50"/>
of the cruell perſecutours, ſo was not the murder euill: but as it was the execution of Caines wicked will, it was abhominable ſinne, and deſerued no leſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Gods hand, than it had in deede. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the power of Caines will, whereby he conſented to do this deede: it was altogether bound to the will of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, by the ſinne that his Father Adam had firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, &amp; was not deliuered from that bondage, bicauſe he was none of them whome Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God had deliuered and made frée: as doeth well appeare by that he ſayeth: My ſinne is greater than that it can be forgiuen. He had not receyued the ſpirite of Adoption, whereby he might cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. Wherefore, it is manifeſt, that whatſoeuer he did, was abhominable in Gods ſight, for he lacked fayth whereby mennes workes are made acceptable before God. For without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. As it is written. <hi>Sine fide im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibile</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>eſt placere Deo.</hi> Without fayth, it is not poſſible to pleaſe GOD. And hereof it came, that is written <hi>Ad Cain enim &amp; munera eius Deus nòn reſpexit.</hi> God had <note place="margin">Geneſ. 4.</note> no regarde to Caine and his oblations. For euen his verie oblations which he offered, were ſinne in the ſight of God, according to the wordes of Saint Paule. <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ex</hi>

                  <hi>ſide nòn eſt, peccatum eſt.</hi> Whatſoeuer is not of faith, the ſame is ſinne. How can it be then, but that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his brother muſt be ſinne, as it was the execution of his malicious purpoſe: but as it is the performance of Gods purpoſe, it can not be but good. The lyke is to be ſaide of the murder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſonnes of Sinacharib commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon their own father, and the rebellion of Abſolom, <note place="margin">4. Reg. 19. 2. Reg. 16.</note> the whoredome of the ſame, the thefte of the Sabines, and whatſoeuer wickedneſſe we reade of. For God had ſayde before, that he woulde ſlea Sinacharib with the ſworde, and that the ſworde ſhould not depart from Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids
<pb facs="tcp:19793:51"/>
houſe. And Iob ſayde: The Lorde hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <note place="margin">2. Reg. 12. Iob. 1.</note> In that <hi>Cerberus</hi> therefore, hath taken vpon him to write thus maliciouſlye againſte me and others that teach the true doctrine of Gods euerlaſting predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he is not by our doctrine iuſtified from ſinne therin, althoughe in the purpoſe of God the ſame be good (for it is the ſtirring vp of me and others, to loke more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the teaching of that doctrine, in ſuche ſorte that the weake Chriſtians be not offended, neyther the enimies occaſioned to blaſpheme) but when <hi>Cerberus</hi> and we ſhall ſtand before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt togither: then ſhall it appeare with what mynde wée haue both written. For his malice towards <hi>Crowley</hi> can not then be couered.</p>
               <p>And where as <hi>Cerberus</hi> woulde know, where it is written that all truth ſhould not be playnely ſpoken: let him aſke Sainct Paule why he would firſt féede his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with mylke, and afterwarde with ſtronger meate. And let him aſke our Sauiour Chriſt, why he ſayd that olde bottles coulde not holde new Wyne, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men vſe to put newe Wyne into new veſſelles that both maye be preſerued togither. And as for hys place that he citeth out of Sirache, (For thy lyfe ſhame not to ſay the truth) I reſer to the Reader to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider and weigh <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4.</note> by the circumſtance of the place. Wherby it ſhal appeare how well it maketh for hys purpoſe. Sirach ſayth: For thy lyfe ſhame not to ſaye the trueth, for there is a ſhame that bringeth ſinne, &amp; there is a ſinne that bringeth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; fauour. Now, how can <hi>Cerberus</hi> proue by this place that a preacher muſt without diſcretion vtter all truth at all times &amp; in al places? It is manifeſt that Sirach mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to inſtruct all men, that ſhame ſhould not ſtaye vs from confeſſing the trueth of our owne euyll, when we are deprehended therein: for that ſhame bringeth ſinne.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19793:51"/>
(That is, cauſeth vs to lie in hyding our owne faults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed) but the other ſhame, that is, to doe that which is not honeſt, bringeth glorie and fauour. Shame therefore ſayth Sirach, to do euil: but for thy life, ſhame not to confeſſe the euyll that thou haſt once done, and art taken withal, or vehemently ſuſpected therof. But (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> how can any man ſpeake more plainly of this matter, than they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues doe? For what can be more plainely ſpoken: than that Gods Predeſtination is the cauſe of Adams fall? And that Caine was predeſtinated to ſlea his brother? And that God is both the principall cauſe &amp; alſo the Author of al things, both on the one ſyde and on the other. &amp;c. Al this is ſufficiently aunſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſe, why in our writings we vſe ſo plaine wordes in this matter: is, for that we haue not to doe with babes that néede milk, but with open enimies, that vnder colour to cleare God of iniquitie, go about to take from him the glorie of his almighty power, and libertie, to do what he will do with his owne creatures, without checke or controlement: And to aſcribe to the power of their owne fréewil, that glory that the frée mercy of God deſerueth. We doe not this therefore in our common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of teaching, but being enforced by the malice of ſuch as <hi>Cerberus</hi> is.</p>

               <p>And furder, in the ſame boke and the ſame Article. Yea, I am ſure (ſayth he) that you will graunt, that if God doe predeſtinate a man to do things raſhly and without any deliberation: he ſhall not deliberate at all, but runne headlong vpon it, be it good or euyll that he doth. He maketh alſo an argument after this ſort, ſaying: Whatſoeuer God foreſeeth and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinateth:
<pb facs="tcp:19793:52"/>
muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe (for his preſcience and predeſtination are infallible) but he foreſeeth and predeſtinateth al things: <hi>Ergo</hi> al things muſt come to paſſe of neceſſitie. The <hi>minor</hi> of which Argument is apparantly falſe. For though God doe foreſee all things: yet doeth he not predeſtinate all things. For his foreſight doeth extende both to good and euill: but his predeſtination is onelye of things that be good. As the Scriptures and all aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers proue. And here againe it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo: how plainely they make God the Authour of ſinne. For if this <hi>maior</hi> be true, that God doth not onely foreſee, but alſo predeſtinate all things: Yea, euen ſinne and euill, as the fall of Adam, and the murder of Caine, and the wickedneſſe of all them that haue bene moſt wycked: then may this <hi>minor</hi> be truely annexed: That God is the Authour of al that he predeſtinateth. And ſo muſt this concluſion nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des follow: that God is the Authour of all ſinne and euyll. The firſt parte, that God: predeſtinateth all thinges, or all that he ſoreſeeth: is a propoſition of their own aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without any ambiguitie or dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meaning. The ſeconde part, that God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of al that he predeſtinateth, is mine aſſertion. Which is ſo manifeſt and true, that they haue ſcarce any maner of colour to deny it. For what is it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate any thing? but firſt to purpoſe, decree, and appoint, and ordeine it to be done? Now, he which firſt purpoſeth, decreeth, appointeth, ordeineth, or inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth a thing to be done: is not he the Author of the ſame? Or is not he rightly to be called <hi>Cauſa, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, Fons: Radix, Principium, Autor?</hi> The Cauſe, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Fountaine, Roote, Beginning or Authour of the ſame? He which firſt purpoſeth, decreeth, apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19793:52"/>
and ordeineth an Inſurrection or Rebellion to be made againſt his Prince: is not he to be apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the very Authour of al the ſedition, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and rightly to be iudged and called? What ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be ſo ignorant: as not to perceiue it? For all the worlde knoweth, that for none other cauſe, one is ſayde to be the Authour of any thing, but onely, for that he is eyther the firſt inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tor, or elſe the firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, appointer, &amp; ordeiner of the ſame. And alſo, whoſoeuer is the firſt inuentor, or elſe the firſt ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of any thing: moſt properly he is ſayd to be the Authour of the ſame. Nowe, marke againe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and ſee how the concluſion followeth. God predeſtinateth all things, yea, euen ſinne and euyll: And God is the Author of all that he predeſtinateth, as hath bene plainely proued: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is the Authour of ſinne. This muſt needes follow, if the firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be graunted. That God predeſtinateth or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deineth al things, or al that he foreſeeth. Wherfore, the olde writers, in confutation of the Manicheans, laboured in nothing ſo much; as to proue, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God did foreſee all things, both good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll: yet dyd he onely foreſee, and not predeſtinate thoſe things which are euill. As by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of places, out of the auncient writers, if ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe woulde ſuffer, I coulde eaſely proue. But one place of Auſten, I wil rehearſe, which doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolue clearely this matter betwene foreſight and for cordinaunce: or betwene the preſcience and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination: but alſo moſt plainely teacheth, al that is to be ſayde of predeſtination. <hi>Prosper. Ad obiectio. Vince.</hi> Rehearſing the words, and defending the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Auſten, where he proueth that the Diuell can ſcarcely be called the Authour of ſinne, by cauſe

it came of mans owne will, and asketh by what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and frenſle men doe attribute that vnto God, which can not be altogether aſcribed vnto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. And at the laſt he concludeth with theſe words of Auſten.</p>

Yea, it is parte of that which I doe inferre vpon the confeſſion of <hi>Shaxton</hi> himſelfe, in his Article that I confute, after I had by many Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res proued the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition of that Argument. But who can hope that <hi>Cerberus</hi> can with his thrée mouthes kepe order in his barking? Let me (if I can) aunſwere him in order, vnto that wherewith he doth ſo vnorderly charge me.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſaith, that I ſay that I am ſure that <hi>Shaxton</hi> will graunt, that if God doe predeſtinate a man to doe things raſhly and without any deliberation, he ſhall not deliberate at al, but runne headlong vpon it, be it good or euyll that he doth. Nowe let vs ſee what <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath ſayde to this. He ſéemeth to make a great matter of it: For he beginneth thus: And furder. As though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he wyll nowe charge <hi>Crowley,</hi> is more to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted than the reſt that is already ſpoken of. And yet when he hath made rehearſall of the wordes: he ſéemeth by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to allowe them. Wherefore, I will be bolde to ſay to <hi>Cerberus,</hi> as I dyd to <hi>Shaxton.</hi> I am ſure that you will graunt. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But as one that vnaduiſedly had gone about to finde fault with words that he was not able iuſtly to diſproue: <hi>Cerberus</hi> leaueth theſe wordes, and returneth to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that I wrate well moſt nyne leaues before, and ſaith. He maketh alſo an Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after this ſort, ſaying: Whatſoeuer God foreſéeth and predeſtinateth, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily come to paſſe (for his preſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and predeſtination are infallible) but he foreſéeth &amp; predeſtinateth al things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all thinges muſte come to paſſe of neceſſitie. Here <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath found matter to brabble about. The <hi>maior</hi> propoſition of this Argument he findeth no fault withal. Wherefore I wyll ſuppoſe that he thinketh it to be true,
<pb facs="tcp:19793:54"/>
that whatſoeuer God foreſéeth and predeſtinateth, muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe. But by <hi>Cerberus</hi> owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God foreſéeth &amp; predeſtinateth all good things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all good thinges come to paſſe of neceſſitie. Thus much haue we gotten of <hi>Cerberus.</hi> So that if it be a Stoicall opinion, to ſay that al things come to paſſe of neceſſitie: yet <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſhall not be ſo cleare from it as he woulde ſéeme to be.</p>
               <p>But my <hi>minor</hi> propoſition muſt be apparantly falſe. For though God do foreſée al things, yet doth he predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate only thoſe things which are good, as the ſcriptures &amp; auncient writers doe proue. So that nowe there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no more to be proued by me, but that God predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth thoſe things that be euyll. Which thing if I can proue: <hi>Cerberus</hi> and I are agréed.</p>
               <p>Well, If <hi>Cerberus</hi> would be entreated to beléeue all that I haue written in the former part of this Apologie: then ſhould the controuerſie betwixt vs, ſone be ended. For I haue ſayde, that euen thoſe things, that are worſt in mans doings, are good in Gods purpoſe. As the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the perſuaſion of the Serpent in the firſt man: the murder of Abel in Caine, &amp; thoſe wyckedneſſes that others haue wrought: were in Gods purpoſe good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in thoſe that did thoſe things, they were excéeding euyll. For then hath <hi>Cerberus</hi> graunted, that God doth predeſtinate them, and ſo conſequently he hath graunted that they come to paſſe of neceſſitie, as thoſe things that God predeſtinateth muſt néedes doe. But whether <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> wyll beléeue that which I haue written or no: I will by Gods help proue that thoſe actions which in man are moſt wicked, were predeſtinated by God to be done: And then I trowe mine Argument ſhal conclude aright, notwithſtanding ought that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſhalbe able to ſay to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:19793:54"/>
And leaſt we ſhoulde varie aboute predeſtination, as not agreing vpon the definition what it is: I am conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take that deſcription which <hi>Cerberus</hi> hym ſelfe hath made of it. He ſayth, that to predeſtinate any thing, is firſt to purpoſe, decree, apoynt, or ordeyne it to be done. But God hath firſt decreed to be done all the euil things as euer were done by men: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath predeſtinated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. The <hi>minor</hi> in this argument is proued by that that is written in the fourth Chapter of the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. <hi>Conuenerunt enim in Ciuitate ista, aduerſus filium tuum Ieſum, quem vnxisti, Herodes &amp; Pòntius Pilatus, cum gentibus &amp; populis Iſrael: ad faciendum quaecunque manus tua &amp; conſiliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuum decreuerunt fieri.</hi> That is to ſay. In this ſame Citie (meaning Ieruſalem) Herode and Pontius Pilate, with the Heathen and the people of Iſraell, gathered themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues together, agaynſt thy childe Ieſus whome thou haſt annoynted: to doe vnto him whatſoeuer things thy hand and counſell haue firſt decréed to be done. What thoſe things were, it is manifeſt in the hyſtorie of the Goſpels. They called him a Samaritane, they ſayd he had a diuel, they ſought to take him in his aunſweres, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſtone him to death, they accuſed him, they conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and faſtened him to a Croſſe, &amp; then rayled vpon him. What could men do worſſe than to vſe themſelues ſo towardes the ſonne of God? But S. Peter ſayth, that all theſe things were done according as the hand &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God had firſt decréed to be done: Wherfore I think my <hi>minor</hi> in my firſt Argument that <hi>Cerberus</hi> findeth ſuch fault withall, to be ſufficiently proued.</p>
               <p>But nowe <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath made of my <hi>minor,</hi> a <hi>maior,</hi> and framed an Argument for his purpoſe, which I muſt ſay ſome thing to, otherwiſe wyll <hi>Cerberus</hi> glorie in his Arte.</p>
               <p>God doth not onely foreſée, but alſo predeſtinate all
<pb facs="tcp:19793:55"/>
things, yea, euen ſinne and euyll. &amp;c. But he is Authour of all that he predeſtinateth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is the Authour of ſinne. The firſt part (ſaith <hi>Cerberus)</hi> is their owne aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And for my part, I acknowledge it ſo to be. But not in that meaning that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth it. For it is not our hare aſſertion without proufe, but we are able by playne Scriptures and reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to proue that God doth both fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee and predeſtinate all things, as I haue before proued in the confirming of this ſame propoſition, being the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> in mine Argument. But for more ample proufe: the Reader may conſider that which is written in the Pſalm 138. where Dauid the Prophet ſayth thus. Lorde, thou <note place="margin">Pſal. 138.</note> haſt proued me, and haſt knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. Thou haſt knowen my downeſitting and my vpryſing. Thou vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt my thoughts long ſince. Thou haſt ſearched my path and my coutch rounde about, and haſt foreſéene all my wayes. For loe, there is not a worde in my mouth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, thou Lord knoweſt all things. This is ſufficient for the proufe of the firſt parte of this propoſition. Which is, that God foreſéeth all things. For the proufe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, which is, that God predeſtinateth all things: I haue cited the words of Peter in the fourth of the Acts: wherin is affirmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the power &amp; counſel of God did firſt apoint thoſe things to be done, which were done to Chriſt by Herod, Pilate, the Gentiles, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Reaſons alſo we haue to proue the ſame, which are theſe. If God ſhould not foreſée all things, he could not be prouident in all things: but it muſt néedes be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he is prouident in al things: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he doth foreſée all things. If God did not predeſtinate all things, then might his prouidence be deceyued: but his prouidence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceyued: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he doth predeſtinate all thinges. This may ſuffice for the proufe of our aſſertion. Now let vs ſee, howe <hi>Cerberus</hi> annecteth hys <hi>minor</hi> to this <hi>maior,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:19793:55"/>
which is this. But God is the Author of all thoſe things that he predeſtinateth. And to proue this doth <hi>Cerberus</hi> make much a doe, yea and much more than néedeth. For we will not ſticke to graunt him that God is the Author of all that he predeſtinateth. Well ſayth <hi>Cerberus,</hi> then I conclude, that God is the Authour of all ſinne &amp; euyll. I denie that Argument.</p>
               <p>It were but follie to reaſon much with this bawling Curre, about the rules of Logicke: For it ſeemeth by his concluſion that he knoweth no Logicke at all. For if he did, he would not ſo ſhameleſſely inferre a neceſſarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion vpon the graunting of pure particulers. For it is a generall rule among Logitians, that <hi>A puris particular ribus nòn neceſse est ſequi veram concluſionem.</hi> It is not a thing of neceſſitie, that a true concluſion ſhoulde followe vpon thoſe propoſitions that be pure particulers. As in thys Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath made, the <hi>maior</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are. Agayne, he concludeth more than is graunted in the Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (which is alſo contrary to the rules of Logick) For though it be graunted, that God is the Authour of all that he predeſtinateth: yet is he not the Authour, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth conclude that he is: That is to ſay, the cauſe, the ſpring, the fountaine, the roote, the beginning and Authour of any thing that is not good. For none euil thing can ſpring of him that is altogether good &amp; nothing but goodneſſe it ſelfe. As I haue ſayd already therefore: ſo I ſay agayne. God is the cauſe, ſpring, fountaine, roote, beginning and Author of al things that haue any being. For he only hath his being of hymſelf: &amp; all other things haue their being of him. And he alone is the worker of al actions: <hi>Nam in eo viuimus, mouemur &amp; ſumus.</hi> In hym we lyue, moue, &amp; haue our being. And as theſe things ſpring of God the fountaine of goodneſſe, ſo are they al excéeding <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> good. And as the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are wrought by him ſo are they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding
<pb facs="tcp:19793:56"/>
good alſo: although in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues they be excéeding euyll, as is the Diuell and al his Angels and members, and all thoſe works that are wrought contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. And the wordes and thoughts that are of the ſame kinde. As I haue ſufficiently proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by examples taken out of the holy hyſtories.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Cerberus</hi> therfore loke vpon his Logiek againe, and learne to frame a <hi>Syllogiſmus</hi> better. Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being in his mad moode when he wrote this anſwere to his friendes letter: he had quite forgotten the fourtene moodes of the thrée fygures, wherin the Logicians do vſe to forme their <hi>Syllogiſmuſſes.</hi> To giue him occaſion therefore, to call himſelfe to remembraunce: I wyll ſet downe thoſe ſhort memoriall Uerſes which the teachers of Arte vſe to print in the minds of their Scholers, to the end that they ſhould not in diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be abuſed by ſuch as <hi>Cerberus</hi> is, which vſe to frame Arguments, without eyther fygure or moode. The Uerſes are theſe.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Now, if <hi>Cerberus</hi> be acquainſed with theſe Uerſes: Let him ſhewe in which of theſe fygures and moodes hys <hi>Syllogiſmus</hi> is formed. And if he find it in none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then let hym deſire ſome more ſkilfull than hymſelfe, to take this matter in hande. For hys Arte wyll not ſerue him to goe thorowe withall, ſo long as he medleth wyth them that knowe what Arte is.</p>
               <p>I know that the matter conteined in <hi>Cerberus Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme,</hi> may be brought into the forme of a <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> in the firſt fygure, and the thirde moode called <hi>Darij.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19793:56"/>
this maner. Whoſoeuer doth predeſtinate any thing, is the Author thereof. But God doth predeſtinate ſinne. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is the Author thereof. Thus farre I haue holpen <hi>Cerberus</hi> to frame his Argument. But leaſt <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſhould thinke that I haue framed againſt my ſelfe ſuch an Argument as I am not able to ſalute: I wyll ſhewe the fallace of it. Firſt in the <hi>maior,</hi> the word Authour is doubtfull. For it may be vnderſtanded eyther of him that predeſtinateth or foreappointeth a thing to be done, or of him that is the doer of the ſame thing. And therfore in reaſoning it muſt be explaned and made voide of all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibologie and doubt. For this is a rule in Logicke, that the termes which are vſed in reaſoning, muſt be plaine and voyd of all doubtfulneſſe. If we will therfore make a good <hi>maior</hi> in this Argument, we muſt ſay, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth predeſtinate or foreappoint a thing to de done, is ſo the Authour of it, that the acte or déede done, muſt be aſcribed to him, in as much as it is a déede or an act done. And then may we adde this <hi>minor,</hi> but God hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and foreappointed the acte or déede that is done by the ſinner: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo farre forth as it is an acte or a déede, God is the Authour of it. Here is not God charged with the ſinne that man committeth, for that ſpringeth of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s choyſe, which being corrupted and made bonde to ſinne by the ſinne that the firſt man firſt committed, can not of it ſelfe chooſe to do any thing in ſuch ſort, that the ſame ſhall not be ſinne. For mans wiſdome and choyſe, which S. Paule calleth the wiſdome of the fleſh, neyther is, nor <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> can be ſubiect to the lawe of God. And ſo all that man thinketh, ſpeaketh or doth in his owne wiſdome &amp; choyſe, is againſt the law &amp; commaundement of God, &amp; ſo ſinne by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon deſinition of ſinne, as is mentioned before.</p>
               <p>And to make this matter more plaine, let vs take one example or two, whereof in the holie Hiſtories &amp; bookes
<pb facs="tcp:19793:57"/>
of the Prophetes, we haue many, and let vs ſée how God is the Author of the acte or déede, and not of the ſinne that is in the acte. Firſt in the .xix. Chapter of the fourth booke <note place="margin">4. Reg. 19.</note> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings, we read, that when Sinacharib had blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med God, and Ezechias the King had made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and praiers to God: the Prophet Eſay was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to ſay thus vnto the King. Be not afraid of the wordes wherewith ye haue heard the King of the Aſſiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſeruants blaſpheming me. Beholde, I will chaunge his minde, and he ſhall heare a tidings, and ſhall returne into his owne country, &amp; I will ouerthrow him with the ſword in his owne land. And in the end of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Hiſtorie ſayth thus. And when he was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the Temple of Neſroch his God: Adramelech &amp; Saraſer his owne ſonnes, ſlew him with the ſword. Here it is manifeſt, that God according to his promiſe made to Ezechias, hath killed Sinacharib: but yet by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſword of his own ſonnes. The acte in this murder is Gods, and ſo it is exceeding good, for it is the performance of Gods promiſe, and the execution of iuſt iudgement vpon the wicked blaſphemer. But the ſinne of the acte, was theyrs whoſe handes were inſtruments to murder their father. For they minded nothing leſſe than to fulfill Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or to execute his iudgement vpon the blaſphemer.</p>
               <p>The ſame example we read in the .x. chapter of Eſay the Prophet, ſet forth yet more plainely after this ſort. <note place="margin">Eſay. 10.</note> Come Aſſur, thou rodde of my furie, and the ſtaffe of my wrath, amongſt theſe men. &amp;c. And a little after. But he will not think ſo, and his heart will not be ſo perſuaded: but his purpoſe will be to deſtroy, and to bring many Nations to naught. &amp;c. Here we ſee, how God vſed Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharib as his rod in chaſtiſing the Nations: and yet did he ſinne in thoſe actions that God wrought by him. And we ſée alſo how God vſed his ſonnes, in deſtroying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19793:57"/>
him, and yet they ſinned in murdering their Father. So is God the Authour of the acte, which was good in him, and they Authours of the ſinne of the acte, which was euill in them.</p>
               <p>Another example we haue written in the .xii. chapter of the ſecond booke of the Kings, where the Prophet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> ſayth thus to King Dauid. Thus ſayth the Lord. Beholde, I will ſtirre vp euill againſt thée in thine own houſe, and I will take from thée thy wiues, euen before thy face, and will giue them to thy neighbour, &amp; he ſhall lie with them in the open ſunnelight. Thou haſte done this déede in ſecrete: but I will doe this that I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, euen in the ſight of all Iſraell, and in the open ſunnelight. The fulfilling of this is written in the .xvj. Chapter of the ſame booke. The acte whereof wrought by Abſolome, was in God, who vſed Abſolome as his inſtrument, the iuſt puniſhment that Dauids ſinne, in abuſing Uries wife, had deſerued. But the ſame in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolome, was abhominable and inceſtuous whoredome, whereby Abſolome minded to make all Iſraell thynke, that he abhorred his father, and that he would vtterly roote him out.</p>
               <p>Let this ſuffice for the making plaine of that whych I haue ſaid, concerning that which I haue ſaid, touching the acte in God, and ſinne of the wicked acte in man.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the matter of <hi>Cerberus</hi> Argument reduced into forme.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs ſée what may be ſayd to that one place, that in ſtede of ſo many, <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth out of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten. Which doth not onely reſolue clearely this matter betwene foreſight and predeſtination, but alſo moſte plainely teach all that is to be ſaid of Predeſtination.</p>
               <p>And firſt, let vs ſet downe al the words of S. Auſten, euen as they ſtande in the place whereout <hi>Proſper</hi> doth

God therefore hath not predeſtinated any ſuch things to be done, neyther hath he prepared that ſoule to liue filthily and wickedly, of purpoſe that it ſhould ſo liue: but he was not ignorant that it would proue ſuch a one, and he knewe before hand, that he him ſelfe ſhould execute iuſt iudgement vpon ſuch a one. And ſo, nothing may be referred to the predeſtinatiö of God, more than that, which appertaineth to the due reward of iuſtice, or to the vndeſerued gyft of grace or mercy.</p>
               <p>Theſe wordes (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> being thorowly weyghed: do plainly ſet forth, the full reſolution of this queſtion. It is very true, they do ſo.

               <p>When Sinacharibs ſonnes ſlew their owne father: was not the acte in this murder y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> due reward of iuſtice, for that he had blaſphemed God?

               <p>If <hi>Cerberus</hi> had had eyes to ſée: he might as well haue ſéen theſe places of Auſten, as that one place which he thinketh ſo ſufficient for the declaration of the whole matter. And there is not one of theſe places, that is not of equall authoritie with that one place of his. Yea, and the firſt of theſe places is of greater authoritie, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to them that will reade the bookes of S. Auſtens Retractations.</p>
               <p>In theſe places S.

This thing is made more plaine in the other places cited oute of S. Auſten. Firſt he ſayth: Chriſt know him that ſhould betraie him, and he choſe him ſo much the rather, as one neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his buſineſſe. And againe he ſayth, ſpeaking of

Iudas, was not he alſo elected to ſome thing wherevnto he was neceſſarie? And againe. Except Chriſt would haue deliuered vp himſelfe: no man could haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him. What was there in Iudas but ſinne? As who ſhould ſay, the acte was Chriſtes, but the ſinne in the acte was Iudaſſes. Yea, he ſaith furder: That which thou doeſt, do quickly. Not bicauſe thou art able to do it: but bicauſe he that is able to do all things will haue it ſo done. And laſt of all he ſayth of Iudas, that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the child of perdition, bicauſe he was predeſtinated to deſtruction.</p>

               <p>But to returne againe vnto thoſe, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Scripture, and all auncient writers: doe teach, that God doeth not onely foreſee, but alſo predeſtinate both good and euill, as well the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Caine, as the holineſſe of Abell: and thereby make God plainly the Authour of ſinne. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perceyue the outragious blaſphemie, to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much apparant and manifeſt: then doe they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſely rolle it vp in a riddle agayne. Which yet for the darke ſpeach thereof, may ſerue at the

leaſt, to blind the eyes of ſome. As where (among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wayes) they plainly make God the Author of ſinne is, ſaying that God is not only the principal cauſe, but alſo the Authour of al things without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, both on the one ſide and on the other. If they be then vrged with the conſequence, that God is the Authour of ſinne: they will aunſwere, that in all abhomination, God is the Authour of the fact, but not of the crime, as of the fact, deede or worke of adulterie, Sodometrie, murder and Idolatrie, God is the Author ſay they, but not of the fault or crime. This <hi>Enigma</hi> haue I heard ſome men vſe, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo written in a booke, entitled, a briefe treatiſe of election and reprobation, lately ſet forth and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Engliſh tong, where he ſaith thus. Though we be compelled to ſay, that God is the Authour of the fact: yet we muſt anſwere, but not of the crime.</p>
               <p>Areade, areade, what is that? God is the Author of the very fact &amp; deede of adulterie, theft, murder, and treaſon: and yet he is not the Authour of ſinne. And why? The ſubtilitie of the Riddle is this. That ſinne is nothing. The theefe is not hanged for the deede that he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted (for God is the Author therof) but he is hanged for the ſinne, and that is for nothing. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay, God is the Author of all things, then nothing is excepted. But ſin is nothing, &amp; therfore he is not the Author of ſinne. The theefe is hanged for nothing. The murderer is put to death for nothing. The traitor loſeth his head for nothing. The wicked are puniſhed in euerlaſting fire for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. A maruellous ſophiſtication. A ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, &amp; cautelous riddle. But to be ſhort, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways, this ſubtiltie might be anſwered: I wil take onely the definition of ſinne, as I finde it written in
<pb facs="tcp:19793:62"/>
the ſame booke, where he ſayth verie truly.</p>
               <p>The nature of ſinne, is defined by the authoritie of Scripture, to be a thought, word or deede, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wyll of God.</p>
               <p>Now, bicauſe they ſay, that God is the Author of all euil deedes, though not of the crimes: let vs paſe ouer the euill thought, and euill words, and ſpeake onely of the deede it ſelfe, whych he hymſelfe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be ſinne, and contrary to Gods wyll. If God then be Authour of the fact or deede, which deede is ſinne, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to Gods wyll: how can he then ſay, that God is the Authour of the fact, but not of the fault, ſoyng he hymſelf ſetteth forth, not only a thought or a word, but alſo a deede to be ſinne? And if God be the Authour of that ſame deede, whych deede is ſinne: is it not a thing moſt plain, that God is the Authour of ſinne?</p>

Though we be compelled to ſaye, that God is the Authour of the fact: yet we muſt aunſwere, but not of the crime.</p>
               <p>Areade, areade, what is that? ſayth <hi>Cerberus.</hi> The Curre can not ſmell how the acte may be Gods, and the

ſinne that is in the acte: his that is the inſtrument in the working of the acte.</p>
               <p>But the ſubtiltie of this Riddle, ſaith he, is this. That ſinne is nothing. And then the theefe is hanged for nothing, the murderer is put to death for nothing, the traytour loſeth his head for nothing, and the wicked are puniſhed in euerlaſting fire for nothing. But this is ſome thing. That <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth that there is ſome thing wherof God is not the Authour.

But <hi>Cerberus</hi> muſt be borne withall, whatſoeuer be ſayth. For if he be contraried: all hell ſhall ring of his bauling.

               <p>And where they denie this doctrine of theirs to be the Stoicall opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe the Stoikes (ſay they) fayned, that nature, wyth ſuch order of cauſe as ſhe hath tyed together, doth bring all things to paſſe by neceſſitie. But they affirme, that God by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall predeſtination, foreordinance, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, bringeth all things to paſſe by like neceſſitie. Thus doe the beſt learned of them make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But a playne diluſion it is, to blinde the eyes of men withall. For (as <hi>Priſcianus</hi> ſayth) <hi>Fatum,</hi> (which we call deſtinie) is deriued of the particple <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> whych is as much to ſay, as ſpoken.

It is manifeſt therefore that the Stoikes did not imagine, that nature by an order of cauſes brought all things to paſſe by neceſſitie.

               <p>The Stoikes &amp; we (as <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth) do differ only in this.

Here mayſt thou ſée (gentle Reader) howe <hi>Cerberus</hi> falleth out with him, whoſe authoritie he woulde ſéeme chieſly to leaue to. Auſten ſayth, that whatſoeuer is done commeth to paſſe by that knitting together and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all order of cauſes which the Stoikes call deſtinie. But <hi>Cerberus</hi> will haue al ſet at ſix and ſeauen, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould come to paſſe by any ſuch order. Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth that it is verie well and truely thought, that God doeth knowe all things before they come to paſſe, and that he doth leaue nothing vnordered. But <hi>Cerberus</hi> will none of that. For then muſt Marten Swarth &amp; his men, Syr Richard Simon Prieſt, and his ſcholler Lambert, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh men, Lady Margret, the Earle of Lincolne, the Lorde Louell, with the reſt that rebelled in King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the fourthes time, be appoynted and ordeyned of God to doe as they did.

But where as he doth denie that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all cauſes is moſt certaine and knowen to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God: we do deteſt him more than the Stoikes did.

But to be ſhort: thou ſeeſt here by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the ſame which <hi>Tullie</hi> calleth <hi>Series cauſarum,</hi> the continuall order of cauſes appointed of God.

               <p>Nowe <hi>Cerberus</hi> can no longer kéepe it in. He muſt néedes breake out in an exclamation againſt the doctrine of prouidence, predeſtination &amp; preordinance.

               <p>If God doe by his prouidence gouerne all things: If God haue predeſtinated or preordeyned all things, ſo that they ſhall come to paſſe in ſuch time and order as God by his prouidence, predeſtination and preordinance hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted that they ſhall: then muſt no man be ſo blinde as not to ſée, that Englande muſt be deſtroyed. Then muſt all Commonweales come to confuſion. Then ſhal no King ſit ſafely in his kingdome, nor any ſubiect in his poſſeſſion. Yea, no man ſhall be ruled by the right of a law: but if God do leaue the matter to mans diſcretion, to vſe the matter as he ſhall ſée cauſe, and doe but put to his helping hand when he ſéeth that man goeth about to bring things to good effect, but in any caſe determine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing, tyll the ſame ſhall be by mans wyſedome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and enterpriſed: then ſhall England and all other

Thus much followeth vpon the pityfull complaynt that <hi>Cerberus</hi> maketh vpon the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Gods prouidence, his predeſtination, or preordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: but I would gladly know, what <hi>Cerberus</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be the cauſe, that in King Edwarde the fourthes dayes, Marten Swarth, Syr Richard Simon, and the reſt, made ſuch a ſtyrre in England. Was it for that they were perſuaded in this doctrine that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſeemeth to make the cauſe of all ſuch doings? Surely I ſuppoſe there was not one of them that did once dreame of any prouidence of God. For thoſe that take ſuch matters in hand, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly as great enimies to Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as is <hi>Cerberus</hi> himſelfe. And ſhall <hi>Cerberus</hi> wordes make vs afrayde, to ſay that God in his prouidence had predeſtinated &amp; preordinated all thoſe things to be done? yea, &amp; that it could not otherwiſe be, but that thoſe things muſt then be done? Surely, I can ſée no cauſe why we ſhould feare ſo to ſay: Let <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes conclude what they wil. For I am ſure S. Auſten in the x. Chapter of his fift boke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei:</hi> will take our parte herein.

And where as it is ſaid, he ſpake once: we vnderſtand that he ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueably, that is vnchaungeably, euen as he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeably know al things that are to come, and that he himſelfe will do. After this ſort therfore, we may ſay that <hi>Fatum</hi> or deſtinie, is deriued <hi>à fando,</hi> or ſpeaking, if this name had not now bene accuſtomed to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of another matter, wherevnto we are not willing that mens hearts ſhould be enclined.</p>

               <p>And as for that which the Heathen did attribute to the ſtarres or planets, they meant none other, but that God ordeined the planets in nature to worke ſuch things, as he before had decreed &amp; appointed: Euen as we alſo iudge, that God vſeth the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the planets in ſending ſuch rayne &amp; tempeſt, faire weather or ſoule, as his pleaſure is, let them ſay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or wil. This meere neceſſitie which our men do teach, is the verie ſame which the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ikes did hold, which opinion bicauſe it deſtroied the ſtate of a common wealth, it was baniſhed out of Rome, as Auguſtine declareth. <hi>Lib.

few words, ſaying. <hi>Qua ratione nati dicuntur. &amp;c.</hi> By what reaſon (ſayth Auguſtine) were they borne which ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Mathematicos,</hi> the ſetters forth of deſtinie out of Rome, which law was kept, and they were but Heathen, howe were thoſe things done by deſtinie which make agaynſt deſtinie? But ſurely if there be a deſtinie, it doth nothing againſt it ſelfe, ſaith Aug. For ſo were deſtinie, no deſtinie, or at the leaſt, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie fighting agaynſt it ſelfe: Or to ſpeake the ſame in thoſe wordes, which our men by abuſe take out of the Scripture, to maintain the very ſame matter. If it be Gods predeſtination that men ſhould write and ſpeake agaynſt hys predeſtination, as they ſaye ſome men do, then is Gods predeſtination a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not only deuided, but alſo fearcely fighting agaynſt it ſelfe. O miſerable abſurditie which any child may perceyue muſt needes follow, if all things come to paſſe with abſolute neceſſitie by Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination as they teach. Thys ſame doctrine alſo that all euill ſpringeth out of Gods ordinance, or that Gods predeſtination was the cauſe of Adams fall and of all wickedneſſe, is plainly maintained in an Engliſh boke lately ſet forth and entitled agaynſt a priuie Papiſt. &amp;c. where among many open and plaine ſentences vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this matter. I find an argument made in theſe words: Whatſoeuer was in Adam was in him by Gods wil &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: ſinne was in Adam, <hi>Frgo</hi> ſinne. &amp;c. was in him by Gods will &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The <hi>maior</hi> of which argument being vnderſtand of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam after his fall, is manifeſtly falſe, &amp; therefore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion alſo is falſe, for if it may be ſayd of Adam after his fal (as by the <hi>minor</hi> you wel perceyue that he ſo doth vnderſtand it) then may it alſo be ſayd now of any man, that what execrable wickedneſſe ſo euer
<pb facs="tcp:19793:72"/>
is in any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſame is in him by Gods wil &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. He goth about alſo to proue the ſame by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which he maketh ſpeaking of the lying ſpirit, ſaying: God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him to ſinne, but God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded nothing which he ordeineth not, ſo he ordeined him to ſinne. Which argument it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel that any man could be ſo blind as not to ſee how it might with more ſtrength and force, and much more manifeſt truth be turned againſt him in this ſort: ſpeaking of Adam, yea and of all men ſaying, God commaunded Adam, and doth commaunde all men to abſteine from ſinne, but he commaundeth nothing which he ordeineth not. <hi>Ergo</hi> God ordeined Adam and all men to abſteine from ſinne. If God then ordeyned Adam and all men to abſteine from ſinne, than did he not ordeyne Adam or any man to commit ſinne, ſo was not ſinne in Adam, or in any man by Gods will and ordinance, nor Gods ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the cauſe of Adams fall, or of any mans ſinne. And therefore their opinion is vtterly falſe: alſo if God in hys ſecret counſell do predeſtinate, appoint, and ordeine man to ſinne, and yet gyue vnto him a ſtraight law and commaundement not to ſinne: is not then his ſecret wyll contrary to his open word? and hys eternal ordinance, repugnant to his written law: All theyr ſayre wordes and ſine framed fetches can not auoide it.</p>

But if there be a deſtinie, it worketh agaynſt it ſelfe. &amp;c. ſayth Auſten. But ſtay there Maſter <hi>Cerberus:</hi> and proue that Auſten was Authour of that booke.

Nay, he wyll not ſtay there, but as though deſtinie and Gods predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were all one thing: he wyll conclude, that it is alſo a Kingdome, not onely deuided, but alſo fiercely fighting agaynſt it ſelfe. And then knitte vp the matter with hys maner of exclaming.

Euery childe may ſée (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> what abſurditie muſt néedes follow. And euery wiſe man may ſée (ſay I) that there can no abſurditie followe vpon that neceſſitie that we teach. For it taketh away no fréedome that mans will hath, or euer had. Neyther doth Gods prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination ſight againſt it ſelfe, bycauſe <hi>Cerberus</hi> wyth his fellowes, were predeſtinated before the worlde was in this time of the world, thus to go about to deface thoſe that doe truely teach, that Gods preſcience, prouidence, and predeſtination is infallible. For what wiſe man wil ſay, that the Potmaker is contrarie to himſelfe, bycauſe he maketh of his clay ſome veſſels to ſerue in honourable vſes, and ſome other to vſes cleane contrarie? Or who wil ſay that God is contrarie to hymſelf, bycauſe he hath made, and doeth daylie make ſome of his creatures to be deuourers and deſtroyers of the reſt: or that nature doth fight againſt it ſelf: bicauſe it doth bring forth both helth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome foode and poyſon? Surely I thinke there is no man of that minde but <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes, and that Auſten that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth for his purpoſe. But how worthy credit that Auſten is: is afore ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath found in an Engliſhe Booke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled againſt a priuie Papiſt, two Argumenes: one in theſe words.

God commaunded him to ſinne: but God commaundeth nothing which he ordeyneth not: ſo he ordeyned him to ſinne. <hi>Cerberus</hi> miſlyketh much with theſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Theſe are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great workes of God, ſought out, according to all his wylles: and yet wyſely ſought out, ſo that when the nature both of Angels and man had ſinned: that is, had done, not the thing that he wylled, but that it ſelfe wylled, euen by the ſame will of the creature, wherby that thing was done, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was not willing ſhould be done, he fulfilled that which he would haue done, euen as he that is beſt of all, vſing well, euen thoſe things that are euill, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of thoſe whome he hath iuſtly predeſtinated to paine: and to the ſaluation of thoſe whom he hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly
<pb facs="tcp:19793:74"/>
predeſtinated to frée mercy. As touching themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, they did y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which God was not willing they ſhould do: but as touching the almightie power of God, they were by no meanes able to bring that to paſſe. For euen in the verie ſame thing that they did contrarie to the wil of God: his will was wrought vpon them. For that cauſe therefore, the workes of the Lord are great, &amp; ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out according to all his willes. So that after a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous and vnſpeakable maner, that thing that is done euen contrarie to his will: ſhould not be done without his will. For if he would not ſuffer it, it ſhould not be done: neyther doth he ſuffer it being vnwilling, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Neyther would he that is good, ſuffer a thing to be euill done: except the ſame being almightie, were alſo able to worke a good effect of thoſe things that be euill.</p>
               <p>Thou maiſt ſée here, gentle Reader, how great cauſe <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath to miſlike with this Argument. S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſayth, that after a maruellous and vnſpeakable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that thing that is done contrarie to the will of God, is not without his will. And thou mayſt be bolde, rather to conſent vnto that which was written againſt a priuy Papiſt, hauing Auſten alſo on thy part: than by <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his miſliking to be perſuaded that that writer hath taught an vntrueth.</p>
               <p>Of the other Argument, <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth, that it was maruell that any man coulde be ſo blinde, as not to ſée how the ſame might with much more ſtrength and force, and manifeſt truth be turned againſt himſelfe that made it, in this ſort. God commaunded Adam, and doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund all men, to abſtaine from ſinne: But he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth nothing which he ordeineth not: <hi>Ergo</hi> God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned Adam and all men to abſteyne from ſinne. But what hath <hi>Cerberus</hi> wonne by this: I graunt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be good. But that the concluſion is againſt vs
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19793:74"/>
I denie. For we affirme that when man abſtaineth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, the ſame is done by Gods will and ordinance, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he committeth ſinne, the ſame is alſo by the wil and ordinance of God: as by the words of Auſten afore writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth plainly appeare. As for <hi>Cerberus</hi> his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the concluſion that he inferreth therevpon: I referre to the iudgement of all wiſe men that will weygh the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore written words of S. Auſten. Who ſhall thereby ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceyue, that no ſuch concluſion can follow vpon ſuch premiſſes. But to his, Alſo if God in his ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. &amp;c. I muſt ſay ſome thing. Elſe will <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſay that Gods ſecret will and eternall ordinance, is contrary to his open word and written law.</p>
               <p>When Ionas was ſent to Niniue, the open word &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God was, that he ſhould ſay vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Yet fortie dayes and Niniue ſhalbe deſtroyed. The effect doth declare, that his eternall purpoſe was not to deſtroy them, for they were not deſtroyed. Neyther was this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement contrarie to his eternall purpoſe: but he did vſe it as a meane whereby to bring his eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to paſſe, which was to ſhew mercie in forgiuing the ſinnes of the Niniuites.</p>
               <p>When Moſes was ſent to Pharao, the open word and commaundement was thus. Say vnto Pharao, let my people go, that they may offer ſacrifite vnto me. But his eternall purpoſe was, that by the ſtubbornneſſe of Pharao in refuſing to do his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he might haue iuſt occaſion to ſhew his power vpon him, in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out vpon him and his people, the manifold plagues that we reade of in the holie Hiſtories, and that thereby his name might be made knowen in all partes of the earth. So that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement was not contrarie to the eternal purpoſe, but did concurre &amp; run together with it, to that ende, that in the eternal purpoſe was prefixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:75"/>
When Ieſus Chriſt began to preach, the open word was, Repent and beleue the Goſpell: but the eternall purpoſe was, that for his doctrine &amp; miracles, he ſhoulde be hated of his countriemen and kinſemen (for the moſt part) and by them be deliuered to the Heathen to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and made a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the world. So that this open word was not againſt the ſecret purpoſe of God: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> as S. Paule doth terme it) it was to them that periſhed, the ſauor of death vnto death, and to them that be ſaued, the ſauor of life vnto life. For in the one ſort it did worke beliefe, and by beliefe ſaluation: and in the other it did manifeſt and make open the vnbeliefe that was in their heartes before, and ſo make them vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly without excuſe. As our Sauiour himſelfe ſayth: Now haue they nothing to pretend for excuſe.</p>
               <p>The Law and the Goſpell are both written &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the open word is, do this, and thou ſhalt haue this: but the eternall purpoſe of God is, that thoſe that haue cares to heare, ſhould heare and obey, and ſo enioy the reward promyſed: and that they which lacke ſuch eares, ſhould haue the iuſt condemnation of their owne conſciences. Theſe two therefore be not contrarie the one to the other, but doe concurre and runne together to one ende.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid to this effect, without either faire words or finely framed fetches: and ſo the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that <hi>Cerberus</hi> would conclude, clearely auoyded. But I will content my ſelfe with one ſaying of Auſten, writing vpon the ninth Pſalme. His wordes be theſe. <hi>Non in toto corde conſitctur Deo, qui de prouidentia eius in aliquo dubitat. Sed quia iam cernit occulta ſapicutiae Dei, quantum ſit inuiſibile premium cius, qui dicit, gaud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

aut iustè damnationi vltimae praeparent obduratos: &amp; ſic omnia ad diuinae prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiae regimen referrantur, quae ſtulti qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi caſu &amp; temere, &amp; nulla diuina administratione fieri putant, ait. Narrabo omnia mirabilia tua. &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay. That man which doth doubt of the prouidence of God in anye thing: doth not ſhew himſelfe thankful or praiſe God in all his heart. But bicauſe he doth now ſée the ſecretes of the wiſedome of God, how great the inuiſible reward of him is which ſayth, we reioyce in troubles: and how all afflictions which are brought vpon the body, eyther to exercyſe thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> be conuerted vnto God, or that they may admoniſh them to conuert, or that they may prepare to the laſt damnation, thoſe that be iuſtly made hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that ſo all thoſe things might be referred vnto the gouernement of Gods prouidence, which fooliſh men do ſuppoſe to be wrought by chaunce, at aduenture, and by no diuine prouidence: he ſayth. I will declare all thy wonderous workes. &amp;c. We maye be bolde therefore (I thinke) to ſay, that this which <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath done, in writing this ſpitefull aunſwere to his friendes Letter (if any ſuch were) was gouerned by Gods prouidence. And yet we are not <hi>Genethliaci,</hi> or declarers of mens fortunes or deſtinies, ſuch as were baniſhed out of Rome: for we ſay not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is <hi>Cerberus</hi> his fortune or deſtinie to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or drowned, or that he ſhal die a natural death before he ſhalbe as great a fauourer of Gods predeſtination, as he doth now ſhew himſelf to be a mortall foe therof. But we knowe, that if God haue predeſtinated any of theſe things, the ſame ſhall vndoubtedly come to paſſe, in ſuch ſort as he hath appointed. And yet ſhal not <hi>Cerberus</hi> his will be enforced. But if he hang himſelfe, it ſhall be with the full conſent of his will. And if he ſhalbe a fauourer of our ſide, it ſhalbe with the frée choyſe of his owne will, gouerned by the prouidence of God. As there be ſome yet
<pb facs="tcp:19793:76"/>
liuing, that can teſtifie, that once they were of the ſame minde that <hi>Cerberus</hi> is now, and that with conſent of will. And now they be of one minde with me: and that with aſſent of will alſo.</p>
               <p>We leaue <hi>Cerberus</hi> and his fellowes therefore to him that by his prouidence gouerneth al things. And yet do we our ſelues vſe the meanes that God in prouidence hath appointed to be vſed, and we teach all other to do the ſame, committing the ſucceſſe to him that knoweth what he hath determined to worke in all his creatures.

Wherefore, this is the cauſe why our willes are able to doe, as much as God would &amp; did know afore hand that they ſhould do, and therefore, loke what they are able to do, that are they moſt certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do: and what ſo euer they ſhall do, they ſhall in déede do: bicauſe he whoſe preſcience or foreknowledge cannot be deceiued, did know afore hand that they ſhould do it.

               <p>This may be the Apocalips of ſome men in thys our age: but ſure I am, it is not the reuelation of S. Iohn the Euangeliſt, nor of any other olde Apoſtle or Prophet. Theſe new reuelations which are reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto men of our age out of a ſecrete counſel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and ordinance of God, contrarie to the open worde and commaundement of God, are meete for thoſe which delight in the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable dreames of ſome doting deſtinie, and may well be called inſpirations of olde Arrians, reuelations of blinde Anabaptiſtes, or vnwritten verities of ſuperſtitious Papiſts, rather than the ſecrete counſel of God, reuealed vnto men of our age. But to conclude: That Angell or ſpirite, which contrarie to the manifeſt word of God, hath

But the purpoſe of the vngodlie is nothing leſſe than that Gods iuſtice and mercie ſhould be ſet forth by him: therfore he is iuſtly puniſhed for his wickedneſſe. And Eſaie the Prophet, comparing Nabuchodonoſor to an Axe, a Sawe, and a Rodde: doth plainly teach, that it was God that wrought all the plagues and deſtructions that were by that wicked inſtrument brought, not onely vpon the people of the Iewes, but vpon other Nations alſo.

<pb facs="tcp:19793:82"/>
of God, than to ſay, that God puniſheth man with the torments of Hel, in euerlaſting fier, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe thyngs whych he himſelfe hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ordeyned, decreed, determined, appoynted, wylled and compelled hym to do: and that whych a man can not chooſe but muſt needes doe, by the force and compulſion of hys predeſtination.</p>
               <p>All which thyngs in thoſe playne termes, they moſt euidently teach in diuers partes of theyr wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but of all other this is moſt odious and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where they affyrme that men ſinne by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, through the neceſſitie of Gods predeſtination.</p>
               <p>And the verie ſame ſayth Knoxe in the. 317. ſide of his booke, before named, affirming likewyſe in thoſe playne termes: that the wycked are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left by Gods ſuffryng, but compelled to ſinne by power, and he citeth it as the ſaying of Auguſtine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt <hi>Iulian.

               <p>It doth here manifeſtly appeare, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hys chiefe quarrell is againſt <hi>Crowley.</hi> For though there be other that haue written as plaine, and as open mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the neceſſitie of Predeſtination as I haue, and to ſay the truth more plaine too: yet doth <hi>Cerberus</hi> lay the matter to no man charge ſo often &amp; ſo openly as he doth to mine. For this is nowe the fift tyme y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he hath made playne mention of mée in this his ſhort aunſwere to hys friendes Letter. No maruell therefore, though the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his minde, doe ſometimes cauſe him to miſconſter my wordes and writings, as in this place he doeth, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing my wordes ſo in this his aunſwere, that they ſéeme to haue a manifeſt meaning farre differing from that which they haue in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place where I wrate them in mine aunſwere to <hi>Shaxton.</hi> Firſt he ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vſing the terme of driuing, I haue ſayde, that Gods Predeſtination hath driuen them to it. Now (Gentle Reader) I muſt make thée iudge of the meaning of theſe wordes, in the place where they ſtande written by mée.</p>
               <p>After I had declared, that the Adminiſtration of the common weale by publike Miniſters, lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, coulde not be other than profitable, and alwayes redounding to the glorie of God, notwithſtanding that the hauing of ſuch miniſters and miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is a thing that commeth to paſſe of neceſſitie and can not but be: I laboured to make the matter more plaine by certain que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherof this is one. How could it haue bene, that ſo great and rude multitudes of barbarous nations, ſhould haue ſubmitted themſelues, to be vnder lawes &amp; rulers: had not Gods Predeſtination driuen them to it?</p>
               <p>Here be the words in that order y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I firſt wrate them.
<pb facs="tcp:19793:83"/>
Nowe iudge (gentle Reader) whether <hi>Cerberus</hi> meant ſimply, when he cited them thus: He ſayth, that Gods Predeſtination hath driuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it. Adding ſuch words immediately after, that it might ſéeme that I had ſpoken theſe wordes in no ſuch meaning: but rather, that my whole meaning had bene, to affirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God doth by his Predeſtination, forcibly driue men to do the things that they are damned for. For he ſaith, that I ſay: We are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the neceſſitie of Goddes Predeſtination, to doe thoſe things, for which we are damned. And then to ſet a ſhew of indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpon his doing, as though he meant nothing leſſe than to applie my wordes otherwiſe than my meaning was, he ſayth, that he will repeate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſentence, in this maner. To this muſt we aunſwere. &amp;c. As though the aunſwere that I make, were but an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to mine own words, which I haue before affirmed.</p>
               <p>But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou mayſt ſée (gentle Reader) what wordes they he that I doe there make aunſwere vnto: I will ſet them downe here in writing, as they ſtande in my booke againſt <hi>Shaxton.</hi> They are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Well, here followeth yet another inconuenience, and that is this. If all things be done of neceſſitie: Why ſhould any man be blamed for miſſedoing? Why ſhould any man be damned, ſithens all they do is but the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of God, and that more is, they can not auoide the neceſſitie, wherby they are conſtrayned to do al that they do. Wherfore if they ſhould endeuour to refrain the euil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do, it were but al in vaine, for they are predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eyther to do it, or elſe to leaue it vndone. Iuſtly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can they not be condemned, bicauſe the euill they do, is not of themſelues, but of the ordinance of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then follow the wordes that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But when he commeth to thoſe wordes that myght ſome thing ſhewe my meaning to be otherwyſe than he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19793:83"/>
would haue it ſéeme to be: he ſtayeth. I will therefore ſet downe thoſe wordes which doe immediately followe, which are theſe. But foraſmuch as he is ſubiect to no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour power, and we be all his treatures: ſo that to what ende ſoeuer he haue framed vs, we are his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to doe the work that he hath appointed to be done: why ſhoulde we ſtande vp and reaſon with him to know his purpoſe in creating vs, or why he made vs to this or that faſhion? to this or that vſe? to be precious or vils? For this one thing we may be ſure of, that God hath by his eternall wiſedome, created nothing, nor appointed nothing to be done, but the ſame ſhall redounde to hys glory in the ende: ſéeme it neuer ſo contrarie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time. Let vs hearken to the words of S. Paule to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> in this matter. What if God (ſayth he) willing to ſhew. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here thou mayeſt ſée (gentle Reader) what malice may doe. I ſayde that ſo many barbarous and rude na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions woulde neuer haue ſubmitted themſelues to liue vnder lawes, if Goddes Predeſtination had not driuen them to it: meaning that God in hys wyſedome &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting prouidence, had appointed that all multitudes of peoples ſhould be gouerned by lawes and orders, and to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereunto, he vſed ſuch meanes, that they were driuen to chooſe rather to liue vnder lawes, and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and flouriſh, than to liue without lawes, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and come to naught. But <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth maliciouſly conſter my wordes, as though my meaning were, driuen to be vnder lawes, as ſhepe are driuen from the paſture to the folde. But I ſpake of men, and not of brute beaſts. We vſe to ſay that men are driuen, ſome by feare, ſome by frendſhip, ſome by affection, ſome by infirmitie, and ſome by pouertie and néede: and yet in all theſe caſes, we meane not that man hath not a will which conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:19793:84"/>
to the thing that he doeth: but that the will of man is by theſe meanes induced to chooſe that which it conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto, and to leaue the other which it refuſeth to do. Againe, in anſwering the inconuenience that <hi>Cerberus</hi> &amp; ſuch as he is, do ſay wil enſue vpon the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of Gods predeſtination: I ſayd: If God were an inſerious to any ſuperiour power, or if we were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creation, and not of his making: then might we charge him with tyrannie, bicauſe he condemneth vs, and appointeth vs to be puniſhed for the things we do by compulſion. Not meaning (as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme that I do meane) that man is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled by force without the conſent of his will, to do thoſe actions which God doth condemne him for, and appoint him to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for: For that were to denie God to be God, and man to be man. For God is not God, vnleſſe he be both iuſt and mercifull. But there ſhoulde appeare in him neyther mercie nor iuſtice, if he ſhould vſe ſuch compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> would haue me ſeeme to teach. And if man ſhould be ſo ſpoyled of the libertie of his will, that he ſhoulde be compelled to do actions without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will: then were man ſpoyled of his principall part, which is his reaſonable ſoule, without which he is not, neyther can be thought to be man.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo beaſtly therefore, as to ſpeake of ſuch a compulſion. But I ſpeake of the ſame that <hi>Knoxe</hi> ſpake of in the place that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth, I now, for I dare not aſſirm vpon his word, neither haue I ſéene the booke my ſelfe. But the matter that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayeth <hi>Knoxe</hi> hath cited out of S. Auſten. I haue ſéene in S. Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not in the. 3. booke and, 5. chapter againſt Iulian: but in the. 5. booke and. 3. chapter againſt the ſame.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19793:84"/>
it ſhould be enough for hym to ſay, that he muſt thinke that we haue forged a lie in S. Auſtens name. But to put thée out of doubt, gentle Reader, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hys thought is a lying thought: I wil ſet downe S.

and neceſſitie that S. Auſten ſpeaketh of in the places that I haue before cited out of his workes, which is not without the frée conſent of the will.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> (which is, that it is tyrannie for one that is an inferior power, and not their Creator, to puniſh them that do commit crymes by ſuch compulſion) I do not in any part of my writings affirme. Wherefore <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth me open wrong, to conclude that I charge al rulers with tyrannie.</p>
               <p>The rulers are commaunded of God (who is theyr <note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and to that ende hath God giuen them a ſword. Woe vnto them therefore, if they do not punyſh ſuch, and defend the innocent. And when they do puniſh the offenders, and defend the innocent: then do they their dutie. So far of do I thinke them to be from the fault of tyrannie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> woulde fayne haue the Rulers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with vs, and eſpecially with <hi>Crowley.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he laboureth to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleue that <hi>Crowley</hi> ſaith that which he neuer thought. The words that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath cited out of my booke againſt <hi>Shaxton,</hi> when they be indifferently weyghed, ſhall be found none other in effect, than are thoſe wordes that Eſaie wrate in the. 45. Chapter of his Prophecies, where he ſayeth thus: <hi>Vae</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſai. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>contendenti cum ſictore ſuo. Testa cum testis terrae contendat. An dicet lutum ſictori ſuo, quid facis? &amp; opus tuum manibus destituitur.</hi> That is to ſay. Wo be to him that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende with his maker. Let the earthen veſſell contende with the earthen veſſelles. Shall the claye ſaye vnto him that made it: what dueſt thou make? and thy worke is not made with handes?</p>
               <p>What other thing can Eſaie meane by theſe words:
<pb facs="tcp:19793:86"/>
but that as it is a thing farre vnſéemely for a piece of clay to ſtand vp and reaſon with him that tempereth it with his fingers, and to ſay vnto him, why doeſt thou faſhion me after this ſort: ſo is it vnſéemely that man ſhould reaſon with God, concerning his purpoſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him after this faſhion or that, or to this vſe or that vſe?

For although one man haue by Gods ordinance, authoritie ouer other men: yet may not that man do with the reſt what he luſteth, as God maye doe with his creatures.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, I conclude, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> his exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with woe worth the ſinfull generation of our age. &amp;c. is not worth the weighing, neyther would <hi>Cerberus</hi> if he had ſéene thus much before, haue thought it worth the writing as I ſuppoſe.</p>

               <p>Againſt which errour crieth out the word of God in a multitude of places: manifeſtly prouing, that through the grace &amp; helpe of God, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may chooſe, and are neyther driuen by abſolute neceſſitie, nor compelled by Gods Predeſtination, to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, theft, treaſon or any ſuch flagitious offence, nor any maner of ſinne or euill, whatſoeuer it be. As for example: Moyſes ſayth: Therefore chooſe life. Deut. 30. And Ioſua ſayeth, chooſe whome you will ſerue. And after when the people promiſed to ſerue the Lord only, he ſayth vnto them, you are witneſſes vnto your ſelues, that ye haue choſen the Lord to ſerue him. Ioſua. 24. But afterward when the people forſoke the Lord agayne, and choſe other Gods: the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19793:86"/>
Lord ſayth vnto them. Goe, crie vnto the Gods which ye haue choſen. Iud. 10. Chriſt ſayeth, Marie hath choſen hir that good part, which ſhall not be taken from hir. Luc. 10. Dauid ſayth: I haue choſen the way of truth: and againe in the ſame Pſalme: I haue choſen thy commaundements: Pſalm. 119. But the Lord ſaith by his Prophet Eſay: They did wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe before mine eyes, and choſe the thyng that pleaſed me not. Eſay. 65. and in the next chapter he ſayth. <hi>Et elegerunt quae ego nolui.</hi> And they haue choſen thoſe things whych I would not. Eſay. 66.</p>
               <p>Thus it is playne, that as chooſe, and can not chooſe agree together, ſo doth their opinion agree wyth the Scripture, for ſuch direct contrarietie is betwene choiſe and meere neceſſitie, betwene viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t compulſion and chriſtian libertie, that blacke and white, may wyth more poſſibilitie, be coupled in a ſubiect.</p>
               <p>But it is maruell to ſee, how ſcrupulous ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are in theſe wordes of choyſe. I doubt whether they dare read theſe &amp; many ſuch like places of ſcripture, which ſo plainly ſpeake of choyſe: But perhap they alway skip ouer that word, or reade ſome other in ſteade therof, as the Iewes do <hi>Adonai</hi> in ſteade of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah,</hi> for ſurely manie are ſo afrayde of freewill, that they fall as the Prouerbe ſayth, out of the lime Kell into the cole pit, from high preſumption into depe deſperation, fiercelie following that olde ſpirite of wicked <hi>Pelagi,</hi> as before it is touched in the .ix. of his diueliſh errors, where he affirmeth, that if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue neede of Gods helpe, then hath he no freedome or choyſe at all: Thus do they breake theyr ſhippe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perillous rocke, ſeeking to eſcape the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Hurlepole. For an horrible preſumption it
<pb facs="tcp:19793:87"/>
was of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to thinke that a man by nature, had ſuch power to chooſe good, and refuſe euill, that he needed not the grace and helpe of God: and a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate opinion is this of other, to ſay that the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God worketh all things in man, whether it be good or euill, and that a man can not chooſe, but do whatſoeuer he doth. For no doubt, thys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion maketh a verie diſordered <hi>Chaos,</hi> and an vtter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion of al thyngs, as it were mixing &amp; thruſting together, both heauen, earth and hell. Making one confuſed lumpe, of God, the Diuell and the world. Of ſinne, grace, and nature, turning all doings into dreames, all trueth into traunces, all veritie into ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, all prayer and meditation into vaine imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For if Gods predeſtination be the onlie cauſe of Adams fall and filthie ſinne, and conſequently the onely cauſe and worker of all euill, yea euen wyth compulſion &amp; ſorce, as they ſhamefully and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, then will no man denie, that on the other ſide: Gods predeſtination worketh as violently in all thyngs that are good.</p>
               <p>So then if Gods predeſtination work all, without all exception, both in euill and good, then all other things, whatſoeuer they be, although they appeare to worke, and doe ſome thing, yet doe they in dede vtterly nothyng. So that the Diuell doth nothyng, man doth nothing, lawes do nothing, doctrine doth nothing, prayer doth nothyng: but Gods predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth altogether, &amp; is the efficient cauſe, yea and, the only cauſe of all thyngs.</p>
               <p>Agaynſt thys opinion, the worde of God is exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding playne and manifeſt, not only in the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed, but alſo in theſe folowing, here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>In a multitude of places (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> the worde of God cryeth oute againſt the doctrine of the neceſſitie of Gods Predeſtination: manifeſtly prouing that, through the grace and helpe of God, men may chooſe, and are ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther driuen by abſolute neceſſitie, nor compelled by Gods Predeſtination, to commit murder, thefte. &amp;c. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Moyſes ſayth. Deut. 30. Chooſe lyfe. &amp;c. Haue I ſayde that man is driuen by abſolute neceſſitie? Or that he is compelled by the compulſion of Gods Predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:88"/>
to commit murder, theft. &amp;c? I am ſure <hi>Cerberus</hi> is not able to ſhewe it, in any of my writings. And I think he hath not ſéene it in anye of the writings of them that he writeth againſt.</p>
               <p>But this is his maner, when we ſpeake of ſuch a kind of neceſſitie as followeth vpon the preſcience of GOD, which can not be deceiued: then will he make y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worlde beleue, that we affirme an abſolute neceſſitie, wherein the will wreſteling and ſtriuing to the contrarie, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to giue place, and violently driuen to doe that it woulde not: And when we ſpeake of that compulſion, that God vſeth in deliuering the wicked and obſtinate ſinners into a reprobate ſenſe, to commit things that are vnſéemely: that by ſinning, their former ſinne might be puniſhed: then <hi>Cerberus</hi> woulde haue men to beleue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we meane of a violent compulſion, which man ſtriueth againſt, but is not able to reſiſt the force &amp; violence of it.</p>
               <p>Wel, I doubt not but the indifferent Readers of this Apologie, will haue a better opinion of vs than ſo. For it doth plainely appeare by the words hereof, that we teach no ſuch neceſſitie, violent driuing, nor compulſion.</p>
               <p>But we ſaye, with the Scripture, and auncient and all ſounde Fathers: that Gods preſcience, prouidence, &amp; Predeſtination, can not be diſapointed, but muſte néedes come to paſſe, as he hath foreſeene, and in prouidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated that it ſhoulde: and yet not without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the wyll, in thoſe whome God did knowe before woulde conſent, and in foreknowledge did appoint to conſent, and to chooſe the things which he knewe before that they woulde chooſe.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures therfore, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth out of Moiſes, Ioſua, Iudges, Dauid and Eſaie: are nothing againſt vs, for we confeſſe as much as is taught by them. We confeſſe alſo, that man may by the grace and helpe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19793:88"/>
of God chooſe to refuſe murder, theft, &amp;c. What is it then that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath ſayde againſt vs? He woulde faine haue men think that we teach, that God is not able with his grace and helpe to make men able to refuſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is euill, and to chooſe to do that which is good. As though we ſhould think no better of our God, than the heathen Poets did of their <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Whome they bring in, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that he was by the deſtinies letted ſo, that he coulde not doe that good for his deare children, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he would gladly haue done for them. But we knowe, that our God is able to doe what he will doe, and that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all places, and doth in all places al that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe. Yea, we doe confeſſe with S. Paule, that by <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> his helpe that doth comfort &amp; ſtrengthen vs, we are able to doe all things. So farre are we from thinking, that man is not, or may not be able by Gods helpe to refuſe to commit murder. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth it is playne, that as chooſe and can not chooſe doe agrée togither: ſo doth our opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with the Scripture. And then he ſetteth méere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and violent compulſion, againſt Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. That doctrine may be his owne. We refuſe it as none of ours. But if <hi>Cerberus</hi> would come to talke: a man might aſke him in what pointes the Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie doth conſiſt. Whether he meane that it conſiſteth in an abſolute power to do what we will, bicauſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mere neceſſitie and violent compulſion, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to it. If he meane ſo, then doth he not meane as S. <note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> Paule doth meane in his Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where he exhorteth them to ſtande in that libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free: As may well appeare to as many as will reade the Text. Well, I will leaue thys matter, tyll I may knowe <hi>Cerberus</hi> and talke with him mouth to mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:89"/>
As for thoſe that be ſo ſcrupulous in the wordes of choyſe, let them (if there be any ſuch) aunſwere for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For my parte, I can be well contented to reade them and heare them too: but to apply them as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth, I think no man can be to ſcrupulous, that will not agrée with <hi>Cotta,</hi> who woulde rather that God ſhoulde not know of things before they came to paſſe, than that man ſhould not haue frée choyſe to doe what he will. And yet do I not follow the ſpirit of <hi>Pelagius:</hi> as I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before vpon that ninth Article that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of: neyther haue I, in ſéeking to eſcape the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hurlepoole, daſhed my ſhippe againſt the perillous Rocke, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> woulde haue men to thinke that I and ſuch other haue.</p>
               <p>But if Gods predeſtination be the cauſe. &amp;c. Then, ſaith <hi>Cerberus.</hi> &amp;c. This (if) is alreadie aunſwered. I wil not therfore trouble the Reader with it any more.</p>
               <p>But if Gods predeſtination worke all: then the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, man, lawes, doctrine, and prayer, do nothing. Thys is the very reaſon that <hi>Cotta</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> made (as S. Auſten declareth in his ſyft booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei. Cap.</hi> 9.) And in the tenth Chapter of the ſame booke, he doth aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere this obiection, declaring to what vſe, lawes, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and prayers do ſerue.

The life of man is euill, when his beliefe concerning God is not good. Wherefore, be it far from vs, that we, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that we our ſelues woulde be frée, ſhould denie the preſcience of him, by whome we are or ſhalbe frée. Therfore, lawes, reprehenſions, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, commendations, and ſharpe rebukes, are not in vaine: bicauſe that both he did knowe before hand that they ſhoulde come to paſſe, and alſo they are of great force, euen of as great force as he did foreknow that they ſhould be. And iuſt rewardes are appointed for good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and puniſhments for ſinnes. Neyther doth man ſin, bicauſe God did knowe before that he ſhoulde ſinne. Yea rather, it is therfore out of doubt that he doth ſinne, when he doeth ſinne: bicauſe he, whoſe foreknowledge can not be deceyued, did know before, that it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinie, nor fortune, or anie other thing, that ſhould ſinne, but he himſelfe. Which if he be not willing: he ſinneth not at all. But if he ſhould not be willing to ſinne: God did alſo know that before.</p>
               <p>Here may <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſée (as it were in a glaſſe) howe far vnlike S. Auſten he is in this matter: and how liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth reſemble his olde friendes <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Cotta.</hi> For feare of graunting anie neceſſitie to follow vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſcience and predeſtination of God: he will rather graunt that God may be deceyued, and that he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careleſſe, and predeſtinateth nothing ſo certainely, but that man may by the power of his will alter and chaunge it. And this is in effect, as much as to denie that there is any God at all.</p>
               <p>But the worde of God is excéeding plaine and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt againſt this opinion (ſayth <hi>Cerberus.)</hi> For Geneſ. 4. 2. King. 24. &amp;c. are places moſt manifeſtly againſt it.

               <p>All the auncient Doctors alſo (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> and the beſt learned of the Proteſtantes. &amp;c. doe vehemently write againſt our opinion. And Auſten only bicauſe of his exceeding obſcuritie. &amp;c. is alleaged on both parts. But when <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſhall cite their wordes that they haue ſo vehemently written againſt vs: there ſhall none of them be found to maintaine his opinion. Which is, that in Chriſt all mankinde is elected. As it appeareth in the former part of this Apologie.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>their words and ours ſhal be well weighed, and our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes perceyued, as all the learned may well vnderſtand and know, though <hi>Cerberus</hi> be blinde on that ſide.</p>

               <p>Wherefore, to conclude. Take thys one note, in this matter of cannot chooſe, or of neceſſitie, both for the better vnderſtanding of the thyng it ſelf, and alſo of thoſe which write therevpon.</p>
               <p>They commonly ſpeake of two kindes of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The one is, of neceſſitie abſolute, and the other, of neceſſitie of conſequence, or mere neceſſitie, and neceſſitie vpon condition, which diuiſion, all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and good Authours do vſe, and it is verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to be conſidered. For touching the one, there is neyther reaſon, law, counſell or doctrine, neyther fayre promiſe, nor ſharpe threatning, nor any other thyng whatſoeuer it be, which may helpe or hinder, adde or take away, hurt or profite. Wherfore, there is neuer any of al the aforeſaid waies or meanes vſed in any of all thoſe things, whych come to paſſe by abſolute neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:91"/>
As for example: It is of meere neceſſitie, that the Diuell is and euer ſhall be damned, that the ſoule of man ſhalbe euerlaſting, and not come to an end, like to the liſe of beaſtes: nor the life of beaſtes be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall as the ſoule of man, and ſuch like. Wherein it were more than madneſſe, to endeuour, eyther by reaſon, law, or counſell, or anie other way whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it were, to alter, chaunge, withſtand or remoue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of thoſe thyngs, ſeing of meere neceſſitie they muſt needes be ſo, and can not be altered.</p>
               <p>For as Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith: <q>
                     <hi>Omne enim quod prohibetur, ideo prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, ne (quia potest ſicri) ſiat. Si autem fati eſset, nòn poſset fieri, ne<expan>

                           <ex>que</ex>

Whatſoeuer is forbidden (ſayth Auſten) therfore it is forbidden, bicauſe it might be done, and yet ought not to be done. But if it were of deſtinie, then could it not be done, nor ſhould not be forbidden.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words of Auſten being few, conteine much matter, if they be truly weighed.</p>
               <p>Now to the neceſſitie of conſequence, or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of condition, wherof Melancthon ſayth: <hi>Ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>, enim haec conſequentia libertatem voluntatis tollit.</hi> Neyther doeth thys conſequence take away the libertie of the wyll. And thys neceſſitie is not repugnant to diligence, prayer, lawes and doctrine. For therfore (that I may vſe agayne the wordes of Auſten) thyngs are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be done, bicauſe they might be done, but ought not to be done. And thys neceſſitie groweth vpon former cauſes, graunted or wrought. As it is of neceſſitie, or needes muſt be, that ſectes and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhall growe in the Church, bicauſe the wycked ſeeke their owne glorie, and Sathan ſtirreth theyr heartes, to imagine &amp; ſet forth abhominable errors, wherin they ſerue the Diuell, wyth all the diligence
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19793:91"/>
of their power. Wherefore, it muſt follow: that ſects and hereſies ſhall grow.</p>
               <p>Neyther doth this neceſſitie proue, that they could not chooſe but commit ſuch euilles: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do refuſe the light, and embrace the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thys muſt neceſſarily follow, thys muſt needes be the end, that hereſie &amp; much miſchief ſhal ſpring. Or as when a man preſently beholdeth with his eyes murder, theft, dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kenneſſe, or any other wickedneſſe, it muſt nedes be true, that ſuch things are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to that whych a man doth ſee plainly before hys eyes. Yet doeth it not follow, that thoſe wicked doers coulde not chooſe but commit thoſe outragious crimes. But ſeeyng that they do commit ſuch thyngs, it muſt needes be true by the neceſſitie of conſequence, that ſuch things are committed of them. Theſe two kindes of neceſſitie, doeth Auſten notably declare, how, &amp; after what ſort they ſpring out of Gods predeſtination. <hi>Lib. De Praedest. Dei. Cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt of all (ſayth Auſten) it is horrible iniquitie to ſay, that God doeth predeſtinate anie thing: ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only that whych is good. But of predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome be of bynding or of bondage, and other be of condition. Theſe are of iuſtice, and thoſe of power. And that it may be the more manifeſt, it ſhal be declared (ſayth he) by example, which are of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and power: and whych are of condition and iuſtice. God created heauen and earth, ſunne and moone: Furder, he did foreordeyne or predeſtinate that the heauen ſhould euer be turned, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable earth ſhould be in place of a center vnto the turning heauen. The Sunne and Moone ſhould rule the day and night. The day &amp; night ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede one another in certain times appoynted. Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:19793:92"/>
predeſtinations are of power and of bynding. For euerie one of thoſe thyngs aforeſayd: is ſo bounde vnto hys worke, by the predeſtination of God, that it can not be moued from the ſame. But God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, and did predeſtinate him, that if he were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and did abſteyn from the taſt of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den apple: he ſhould liue, but if he were diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, he ſhould abide the ſentence of death. Thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is of condition and of iuſtice. For God before the fall of man, dyd not by the power of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo predeſtinate him to die, that of neceſſitie he muſt nedes die, but vnder that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, if he ſinned. Bicauſe therfore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did ſin, it was a righteous thing, that he ſhould die. If he ſinned not, he ſhould not be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to death by any chayn of Gods predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe are the wordes of Auſten. And thys di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, is often repeated and commended, by the beſt learned of the Proteſtantes.</p>

               <p>Now <hi>Cerberus</hi> will ſhortly come to an ende. For he will conclude with one note in this matter of can not chooſe or neceſſitie. &amp;c. And this note is of the two ſortes of neceſſitie, one abſolute, and the other of conſequence. Or méere neceſſitie and neceſſitie vpon condition. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And to make men beleue, that all that we doe, is to perſuade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that al things do come to paſſe of méere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie: he putteth for example the damnation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the immortalitie of mans ſoule, and the mortalitie of the brute beaſtes. As though the thoughts, words and déedes of men were like vnto theſe. And therfore it ſhould as little auaile, to vſexeaſon, law, counſell, doctrine, faire promiſes or threatnings, to pull men from euil thought,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19793:92"/>
words or déedes, and ſo from damnation, which doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe doings, as it were by the ſame meanes to goe about to make the Diuell a ſaued ſpirite, mans ſoule mortal, &amp; the life of a brute beaſt euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>But we ſpeake not of that neceſſitie which is méere or abſolute: but we ſpeake of the other, which is of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or condition. And therefore his Auſtens wordes are cited out of place (I ſaye his Auſtens wordes, bicauſe they are the words of the ſame Auſten that I haue noted before not to be the Biſhop of <hi>Hippoe)</hi> for theſe wordes of this Auſten are ſpoken of the thoughtes, wordes and déedes of men, which, though they do come to paſſe by a certaine neceſſitie, as God dyd without beginning foreſee that they ſhould: yet doth man vſe the libertie of his wil therein. For he doth neyther thinke, ſpeake, nor doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing without the conſent of his will. And there is no impoſſibilitie in man, but that his thoughtes, wordes and déedes may be contrarie to that they are.</p>
               <p>As for example. There was no impoſſibilitie in <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> but that he might haue refrayned, both y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> weiting, and publiſhing and caſting abroade of this aunſwere to his friendes letter. Neyther was it impoſſible for me to refraine from writing this Apologie. And <hi>Cerberus</hi> and I both haue herein vſed the libertie of our will. And yet did God foreſée &amp; predeſtinate both his doings herein and mine. And as he did foreſée that we ſhould chooſe to do as we haue done: ſo did he alſo predeſtinate oure doings herein. So that chooſing to doe as God did foreſée and predeſtinate that we ſhould chooſe to doe: we haue done it by that neceſſitie that all learned Authours do call the neceſſitie of conſequence or condition.</p>
               <p>And God doeth foreſee, whether this Apologie ſhall perſuade <hi>Cerberus</hi> to be of one minde with vs or not. And if it ſhall be ſo: then hath God predeſtinated my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb facs="tcp:19793:93"/>
ſo that end. If not: then ſhall my labours ſerue to ſome other purpoſe that God knew before. And yet do I herein vſe the libertie of my wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo ſhall <hi>Cerberus.</hi> vſe his. For neyther of vs is or ſhalbe enforced to do that which our will would not haue vs do.</p>
               <p>This is all the matter that the wordes of <hi>Cerberus</hi> his Auſten do conteine, when they be truly weighed.</p>
               <p>As for the ſentence of Pelancthon, it maketh nothing againſt vs, for we ſpeake of the ſame neceſſitie that he ſpeaketh of: and we affirme with him, that it taketh not away the libertie of mans will.</p>
               <p>The ſame Melancthon, writing <hi>De neceſsario,</hi> in hys booke which he doth entitle <hi>Erotematum dialectices:</hi> ſayeth that there be foure ſortes of neceſſities. One abſolute. As that God is true, liberall, iuſt. &amp;c. Another of deſinitions or demonſtrations: as a thrée cornered ſtone muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie haue thrée corners, and vertue muſt néedes be a thing that agréeth with the rule of Gods will. The third is natural, in things which are ſo ordered in nature, that they can not otherwiſe be, in and by that order. But this neceſſitie may be altered at Gods pleaſure, as by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we ſée it hath. As at the redde ſea when the water ſtoode ſtill on heapes like hilles, and when at the word of Ioſua, the ſunne ſtoode ſtil and moued not. &amp;c. The fourth and laſt, is that which al the buſineſſe is about. And <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> would faine make all men beleue, that we make no difference betwéene this fourth and the firſt.</p>
               <p>Of this neceſſitie, doth Melancthon write thus. <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus gradus est mutabilium, quae tamen vocantur neceſsaria, nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſsitate conſequentiae, id est, quae ſuns quidem re ipſa mutabilia: ſed nòn mutantur, vel quia ſic à Deo decreta ſunt, vel quia ſequu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ex cauſis, quae nòn mutantur, cum tamen mutari potuiſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vel quia cum ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, contradictoriae ſimul verae eſse nòn poſſunt. &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſaye. The fourth degree of neceſſities, is of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19793:93"/>
thoſe things which are mutable, which are notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding called neceſſarie, by the neceſſitie of conſequence. That is to ſay, which are in déede mutable: but are not chaunged, eyther for that they be ſo decréed of God, or elſe for that they doe follow vpon cauſes that are not chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, where as notwithſtanding they might haue bene chaunged. Or elſe, for that when they be done, the fiat contraries of them, can not at the ſame time be true.</p>
               <p>What haue I written againſt <hi>Shaxton</hi> more than this? The thoughts, the wordes, and the déedes of men, are of themſelues mutable: but as God hath decréed, ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, in all mens thoughts, wordes and déedes.</p>
               <p>It followeth therfore, that though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teachers of ſects, the muderers, the theues and the drunkerds, might haue withholden the conſent of their willes from thoſe wicked doings: yet God hauing decréed to puniſh eyther them or others by that meane, the thing muſt fal out according to that decree: and yet God remayne iuſt, and mans wil vnconſtrained, as I haue before ſufficiently declared.</p>
               <p>As touching the Text of Auſten, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth out of his booke <hi>De Predestinatione Dei. Cap.</hi> 2. I will firſt note what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and the reſt of the learned ſort, doe thinke of that booke. <hi>Hoc opuſculum de Praedestinatione Dei, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſse Augustini, vel ipſa breuitas arguit.

This little worke of the predeſtination of God: is by the verie ſhortneſſe thereof, ſhewed not to be of Auſtens writing. Moreouer, it doth teach that predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which thing Auſten doth mightely refell. It ſéemeth to be a ſcrap of ſome booke, wherevnto ſome man, beyng deſirous therof, hath faſtened a proeme and concluſion.</p>

               <p>Many things do offer themſelues in this matter to be ſpoken, but my purpoſe of briefneſſe cauſeth me to growe to an ende. I haue thought good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in few wordes, to note one point more of euill doctrine, which now a dayes is taught, and it ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth alſo out of this foreſaid propoſition, that Gods predeſtination cauſeth all ſinne and wickedneſſe, &amp; this it is, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation, nor of Gods hatred towardes the wicked which are damned, which thing in deede, to be ſhort, I graunt muſt needes follow, if the former concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be true, that ſinne commeth of Gods predeſtination, or that Gods predeſtination was the cauſe of Adams fall, which was the originall of ſinne. For if ſinne, or the orignall thereof came of God, or of hys ordinance, and from God commeth nothing but that which is holie, iuſt and good, then is ſinne, no ſinne, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the cauſe of Gods hatred towardes them that periſh, except we ſhould ſaye, that God hateth them for that thing, which is holie, iuſt, and good.</p>
               <p>And leaſt I ſhould be thought, through pretence of breuitie, to paſſe ouer, wythout plaine proufe of that which I ſay, that thys part of doctrine, is alſo ſet forth and taught. I will rehearſe one ſentence of theirs publiſhed in print, which is ſo open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that it may ſerue as well as a thouſand: I read in the forenamed booke tranſlated out of French into Engliſh, toward the latter end of the booke, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19793:94"/>
this place, thus noted in figures, and theſe verie words follow. Rom. 9. c. 11. 12. 13. He ſayth not onely that Eſau was ordeyned to be hated, before he did any euil: for in ſo ſaying, he ſhould not ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing, but an actual ſinne &amp; incredulitie. But he ſaith expreſſely, before he was borne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he excludeth originall ſinne, and all that whych might be conſidered in the perſon of Eſau by hys byrth from the cauſe of hate.</p>
               <p>Touching the Text, whervpon it is ſpoken, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly Inke ſerueth not worſſe to make Iuorie white: than theſe words, to open the minde and ſence of the Apoſtle, as it were eaſy to proue, if ſhortneſſe would ſuffer to make a digreſſion, but touching that parte of doctrine: thou feeſt that he ſpeaketh of two opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons: the one that actual ſinne or incredulitie, ſhould be the cauſe of Gods hatred toward the wycked: The other, that originall ſinne, is the cauſe of Gods hate toward them. Thys man agaynſt them both, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occaſion vpon thys exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Eſau: to exclude all that is in man, eyther outward ſinne or inwarde, eyther originall ſinne or actuall, from the cauſe of Gods hate, ſo that (if it be true which they ſay) God doth hate men: neyther for their outward wicked life, nor for their inwarde diueliſh luſte, but for hys owne pleaſure onely.</p>

               <p>The purpoſe to be briefe, cauſeth <hi>Cerberus</hi> to cut of many things that offer themſelues to be ſpoken. Yet for all the haſt, he muſt néedes note one poynt more of euill doctrine. Which is, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:95"/>
I would faine know how <hi>Cerberus</hi> could aunſwere this Argument. All cauſes are in order before their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes: but ſinne was not before Reprobation: <hi>Ergo</hi> ſinne could not be the cauſe thereof. <hi>Cerberus</hi> will denie the <hi>minor.</hi> For he holdeth that ſinne was before Reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The <hi>minor</hi> therefore muſt be proued thus. Whatſoeuer was before Reprobation, is eternall: but ſinne is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, <hi>Ergo</hi> ſinne was not before Reprobation. If <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> wil doubt of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>maior,</hi> it ſhal be proued thus. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was before Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is eternall: but Election and Reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are of like antiquitie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> whatſoeuer was before reprobation is eternall. The <hi>maior</hi> is manifeſt by the wordes of S. Paul to the Epheſians. <hi>Cap. 1. Sicut ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git nos in ipſo ante mundi constitutionem.</hi> As he elected vs in him before the worlde was made. And if <hi>Cerberus</hi> wyll doubt of the <hi>minor</hi> (as perhaps he will) then let him ſhew vs, how there can be a choyſe where none are refuſed.</p>
               <p>This might ſuffiſe for our deſence in this matter that <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth now charge vs withall. But bicauſe he ſayth that this our concluſion is the ſequele of a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we affirme, that is, that Gods predeſtination cauſeth all ſinne and wickedneſſe: I muſt take ſome what more paine in the defence of that which we haue written.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I muſt ſay that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath belyed vs: For we ſaye not that Gods predeſtination doeth cauſe any ſinne. Then I muſt alſo denie, and haue alredie proued, that Adams fall was not the originall of ſinne. Thirdly, we denie that the originall of ſinne came of God: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion that <hi>Cerberus</hi> maketh is not againſt vs.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath found one ſentence of ours ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and manifeſt, that it maye ſerue as well as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. It is in the latter ende of the forenamed Engliſh
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19793:95"/>
booke tranſlated out of French, vpon the words of Paul Rom. 9. c. He ſaith not only. &amp;c. <hi>Cerberus</hi> can not ſée how this Text of Paul may by thoſe words be better opened, than Iourie may be made white with ynke. But for haſt to come to an ende, he will not ſtande to proue this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he might eaſely do it, as he ſayth.</p>
               <p>But touching the two opinions, one that actuall ſinne or incredulitie, the other that originall ſinne, is the cauſe of Gods hatred towardes men: this fellow (ſayth <hi>Cerberus)</hi> taketh occaſion vpon the example of Eſau to exclude all that is in man. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A little helpe woulde make this man of one minde with Origine, who writing vpon this parte of Paules Epiſtle to the Rom. and theſe verſe wordes, Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau I haue hated: ſaith, that Iacobs ſoule being yet without a bodie, did purge it ſelfe, and when God ſaw the pureneſſe of it, he tooke it, and put it into that bodie wherin Iacob was borne, and Eſau his ſoule which had not cleanſed it ſelfe, he put into a bodie made out of the ſame lumpe, but not to honour as the other was, bicauſe the ſoule of Eſan was not worthie of ſuch a bodie. So he loued Iacob (as Origine thinketh) bicauſe Iacobs ſoule had clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed it ſelf before it came into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body: &amp; he hated Eſay, bicauſe his ſoule had not clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould aſke this queſtion of <hi>Cerberus:</hi> why did God loue Iacob and hate Eſau? what could he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, if he wyll not ſay, <hi>Quia voluit?</hi> bicauſe he woulde, If he will ſaye, that God reſpected the actuall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſinne that was in them: then ſhall he be found to ioyne with Origine. If he ſhall ſaye that he reſpected originall ſinne in Eſau, and did therfore hate him: then may it be aſked why he did not hate Iacob for the ſame. For both were defiled therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alike. But if <hi>Cerberus</hi> wil ſay, that God had reſpect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes that they ſhould do
<pb facs="tcp:19793:96"/>
in the time of their life; then doth he ioyne with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes: And that he would not ſéeme to do.</p>
               <p>His beſt waye therfore, ſhalbe to ioyne with vs, and ſay: That God loued Iacob and hated Eſau, bicauſe it pleaſed him ſo to doe. And if any man ſhall ſtand vp to diſpute the matter any further: then to aunſwere with S. Paule. <hi>O homo tu quis es, qui respondeas Deo?</hi> O thou ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who art thou, that dareſt take vpon thée to reaſon wyth God?</p>

               <p>That verie ſame thyng ſayth Knoxe in the. 141. pag. of hys foreſayd booke: where his wordes are theſe. Further I ſaye: that if Eſau was hated for his euill deſeruing, then muſt it needes follow, that Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was loued for hys well deſeruing, by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment following: of the nature of contraries.</p>
               <p>As well it might be ſaid, it muſt needes follow by the contraries: that if a King or Prince hate one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whych hath well deſerued his hate, by ſtealing from him his ring, his chain, or ſome great Iuel, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he not loue any other man, but he whych hath well deſerued hys loue, by giuing to hym a ryng, a chain, or ſome great treaſure, as though he ſhould ſay: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe iuſtice worketh on the one ſide, therfore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath nothing to doe on the other ſide, or as though God were not both iuſt &amp; mercifull: Iuſt in damning for their offence, thoſe which are damned: and mercifull in ſauing without their deſert thoſe which are ſaued.</p>
               <p>And who ſeeth not that neyther <hi>ſimile,</hi> nor <hi>diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,</hi> neyther like thyngs, nor thyngs contrarie, do holde in all poyntes, for nothing is ſo like, whych in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19793:96"/>
ſomethyng is not vnlike, neyther any thing ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, whych doth in all things varie. Chriſt is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Lion, but did he euer rauiſh, or deuour, and ſhedde any innocent bloude? <hi>Latimer</hi> wyſheth, that al Byſhops were like Byſhop Diuell in diligence, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not the Diuell and a Byſhop to differ in all thyngs. And moſt ſpecially and plainely, doeth the Scripture beate in our heads: aboue al other things, that the nature of contraries, doe not holde in both ſides of Gods reward, &amp; mans deſeruing. For as they are inſeparable relatiues in the one part, ſo on the other ſide, the one hath neuer any relation to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for as Gods hatred and vengeaunce, hath euer relation to mans deſeruing: ſo hath Gods loue and mercie neuer any relation to mans merite. Yea, all the Scripture teacheth vs, that God neuer hateth, or puniſheth man wythout his owne deſeruing. For as the wyſe man ſayth: <hi>Et cum qui nullam poenam comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sapient. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnaſse, a tua potentia iudicas alienum.</hi> And thou Lord (ſayth he) eſtemeſt it a thyng contrarie to thy power, to haue condemned him whych hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued puniſhment.</p>
               <p>What ſhould be ſayde of the Cananites and the Iſraelites, if the nature of contraries do alway hold, and haue ſuch relation of the one to the other, muſt it not then neceſſarily follow (as he ſayth) by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of contraries: that if the Cananites were caſt out of the fortunate land that floweth wyth milke and hony, for their euill deſeruing: that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Iſraelites were brought and planted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſame happie and bleſſed reſt, for their well deſeruing? But what ſayth the Scripture? Speake not in thy heart, after that the Lorde thy God hath caſt them out before thee, ſaying: for my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Deut. 9.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:97"/>
the Lorde hath brought me in, to poſſeſſe thys lande, naye, but for the wickedneſſe of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Lorde doth caſt them out before thee. So plainly ſpeaketh the holie ghoſt here, that thou mayſt eaſily perceyue, how groſſe and vayne their ſaying is, which affirme: That if God hate an euill man for his owne euill deſeruing, then muſt it nedes follow, that he loueth a good man for hys owne well deſeruing. For the hatred of God and euerlaſting damnation are iuſt rewardes of mans euil deſeruing: but the loue of God and euerlaſting life are free gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> of God, for Chriſtes ſake wythout any part of mans owne deſeruing.</p>
               <p>Take therefore this ſaying of theyrs: No ſinne neyther originall nor actuall, is the cauſe of Gods hate or eternal death, and put the ſame into the one ſide of the ballaunce, then take, and put into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, this ſaying of S. Paul to the Romanes: was <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> that then that was good, made death vnto me? God forbid, but ſinne was made death vnto me. Then wey both theſe ſayings together with the hand of good aduiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in the indifferent balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of vpright iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, and put not in aboue three graynes of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful partialitie: thus ſhalt thou plainly ſee, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle agreeth farre better with the Maieſtie of God, and hath a much more reuerent opinion of hys iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements, than theſe men haue, yea, thou ſhalt eaſily perceyue (whatſoeuer they ſay) that neyther Gods pleaſure, nor Gods ordinance, or predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor none other thing that is good, is made death, or the cauſe of Gods hatred, agaynſt any man, but ſinne is the very grounded cauſe, why God hateth, taketh vengeaunce, and puniſheth man by death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, according to that which the ſame Apoſtle
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19793:97"/>
ſayth: Death is the reward of ſinne. And the wordes <note place="margin">Rom. 6. Oſee. 13.</note> of O ſee are alſo manifeſt &amp; plaine where he ſaith: O Iſraell thou doeſt deſtroy thy ſelfe, but in me onely is thy helpe. In which words of the holie ghoſt, thou ſeeſt how manifeſtly God doth, as it were purge him ſelfe, from being the cauſe or worker of mans deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo that the perdition and deſtruction of man, is altogether to be attributed vnto hym ſelfe: And God being cleare, neyther acceſſarie, nor partaker thereof, as the chiefe and hygh Iudge of heauen and earth, vnſpotted and wythout blame, gyueth the ſentence of euerlaſting death vpon man, for his own wicked deſeruing and offence.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide ſayth God vnto man, in me only is thy helpe. In God onely, onely in God is our helpe and ſaluation, in him onely, and of him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not of our ſelues: commeth our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all whatſoeuer belongeth therevnto. The ſame is alſo ſet forth by all thoſe Scriptures, whych are before rehearſed, to proue that ſinne and euill, commeth not of Gods predeſtination, for vpon that concluſion dependeth alſo thys propoſition, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation, or of Gods hatred towards man.</p>

               <p>Yet once againe hath <hi>Cerberus</hi> a ſnatch at <hi>Knoxe.</hi> Whether he do report his words truly or not, I knowe not: for I haue not ſeene that booke of his, neither haue I cauſe to thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al is Goſpel that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſaith. Much more adoe than néedeth doth <hi>Cerberus</hi> make, to proue that an Argument <hi>à contrarijs, ſimile</hi> and <hi>diſsimile:</hi> doth not alwayes conclude neceſſarilie. For as he ſayth, who
<pb facs="tcp:19793:98"/>
ſéeth not, that they do not holde in all pointes? This therfore that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath here written, is but dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce, and as it were dauncing about the buſhe. The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, whether the ſequele be good in the matter that <hi>Knoxe</hi> doth vſe it in, or not. We muſt therfore conſider the matter, and how <hi>Knoxe</hi> doth applie this maner of reaſoning to this matter. The matter therfore, is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion moued concerning the cauſe why Eſau ſhoulde be hated of God, and Iacob beloued, before any of them had done eyther good or euill, yea and before they were borne, and therfore, before there could be in them any deſeruing at all. Now, <hi>Knoxe</hi> ſayth, that if Eſau were hated for his euill deſeruing: then muſt it néedes follow, by an Argument following of the nature of contraries, that Iacob was beloued for his well deſeruing.</p>
               <p>Nowe, I muſt thinke well of <hi>Knoxe,</hi> for I knowe hym to be not only learned but alſo godlie, and therefore not like to ouerſhoote himſelfe ſo farre, that he woulde ſtretch an Argument, taken out of the place of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, further than the nature thereof will ſuffer. I muſt thinke therfore, that he meant, that if God do in chooſing and refuſing, in louing and hating, reſpect nothing but the well deſeruing of one ſort, and the euill deſeruing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other (as the common opinion of the Papiſtes is) then it muſt néedes follow, by an Argument of the nature of contraries, that if he hated Eſau for his euill deſeruing, he muſt needes loue Iacob for his well deſeruing.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Cerberus</hi> be not ſatiſfied with this, let him looke for furder aunſwere at <hi>Knoxes</hi> owne hand, for he is yet liuing and able to aunſwere for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>As for the ſimilitude of a King or Prince, that <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> vſeth to deface <hi>Knoxes</hi> Argument withall: may ſerue him among ſuch as know not that God is frée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al mens affections, and that he can not be moued to loue
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19793:98"/>
vs the better for the giftes that we beſtow vpon him, nor the worſſe, for that we take from him and ſpoyle him of any treaſure that he ought to haue.</p>
               <p>The nature of God is not to hate but to loue. For S. Iohn ſayth, God is loue. And as the wiſe man ſayth, he <note place="margin">1. Iohan. 4. Sapient. 11.</note> loueth all things that be, and he hateth none of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that he hath made. Neyther hath he ordeined or made any thing, hating the ſame that he ordeyned or made. For in that he made or ordeyned them, they are all excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good. Wherefore, when we ſay, or when it is ſayd in the Scriptures, that God doth hate any of his creatures, (as it is ſaid that he hated Eſau) it is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he loued not Eſau or thoſe other creatures, whome he is ſayde to hate, ſo well as he loued the others, of whome it is ſayd that he loued them.</p>
               <p>It can not be denied, but muſt néedes be confeſſed, that God loued al his creatures, in that he would make them ſome thing, where as before they were nothing, and in that he would giue them ſome part of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelfe. For to be, is proper to God. And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath any being: it hath the ſame of God. When God giueth a being to his creatures, he ſheweth that he loueth them: but when he giueth them an euerlaſting and bleſſed being, then he loueth them ſo, that the other loue in compariſon of that, ſeemeth but an hatred. And therfore it is ſayd that he hateth them, whom he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to that euerlaſting bleſſed being, but leaueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to themſelues, that in them he may haue occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his iuſtice, and by them to gyue occaſion to hys dearlie beloued to ſée and conſider the excéeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his loue and mercie towardes them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſéemeth to haue the whole Scripture on his ſide. For he ſayth, that all the Scripture teacheth vs, that God neuer hateth and puniſheth vs without our
<pb facs="tcp:19793:99"/>
owne deſeruing. Which ſaying, I graunt to be true, but not in that ſenſe that <hi>Cerberus</hi> would haue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it. For <hi>Cerberus</hi> woulde haue vs to thinke that God could not be compted iuſt, if he ſhoulde refuſe any man in whome there were not ſinne, that might moue God to refuſe him, and to that ende he citeth the wordes of the wiſe man. For this is his opinion, as it appeareth <note place="margin">Sapient. 12.</note> before, that in Chriſt all mankinde is elected, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that Eſau was elected in Chriſt. But by ſinne he made himſelf a reprobate, and was not refuſed before he ſinned.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſée, how this place of the wiſe man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for his purpoſe. The words are theſe, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth them. <hi>Et cum qui nullam poenam commeritus ſit condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſse: a tua potentia iudicas alienum.</hi> And thou Lorde, eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt it a thing contrarie to thy power, to haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him that hath not deſerued puniſhment. All the Scripture is nowe, by <hi>Cerberus,</hi> brought into a ſhort ſumme. For it is knit vp in leſſe than two lines, written in the .xij. Chapter of the booke of wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Of what authoritie that booke hath awayes bene thought to be: I thinke <hi>Cerberus</hi> is not ignorant. And how diuers readings there be of that place which he cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: I ſuppoſe he knoweth. The Tygurine Bible is it that <hi>Cerberus</hi> followeth. Other tranſlations there be, that differ from that, and from the olde alſo. The olde tranſlation hath it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cum ergo ſis iustus, iustè omnia disponis: ipſum quo<expan>

Foraſmuch as thou thy ſelfe art iuſt, thou doeſt diſpoſe all things iuſtly: him alſo that ought not to be puniſhed, thou doeſt condemne, and doeſt eſteeme him as one exiled from thy power or dominion. Bylike, when <hi>Cerberus</hi> cited this place, he ſuppoſed that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19793:99"/>
ſée his booke, but ſuch as were not able to diſcerne Chalk from Chéeſe. What place can make more manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and for vs, than this place doeth? For by theſe wordes it is plaine, that though God do condemne him, that hath not by any déedes deſerued to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yet is God neuer the latter, iuſt, and doth diſpoſe all things iuſtly.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the circumſtance of the Text doth ſhew that this tranſlation is more nigh the meaning of the writer, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that which <hi>Cerberus</hi> followeth. For the ſentence going immediatly before, is thus. <hi>Ne<expan>

               <p>And the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence that doth immediatly follow, is thus. <hi>Virtus enim tua, iustitiae initium est: &amp; ab hoc quod omnium Dominus es, omnibus te parcere facis.</hi> That is. For thy power is the beginning of iuſtice, and bycauſe thou art Lord of all, thou doeſt make thy ſelfe to ſpare all.</p>
               <p>But bicauſe there is ſuch diuerſitie of tranſlations in the Latine, and peraduenture <hi>Cerberus</hi> wyll ſaye he hath loked in the Gréeke, and findeth that the Tygurine tranſlation, which he followeth, is moſt agréeable to the Gréeke Text, out of which all our Latine tranſlations are taken. It ſhall not be amiſſe therfore to ſet downe the Gréeke Text, that ſuche as haue any ſkill therein, may iudge betwixt vs.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is to ſay (ſo far as I am able to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it) Thou being iuſt, doeſt diſpoſe all things iuſtly, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding to condemne ſtraunge from the land of thy power, him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not to be iudged ignominious. If any ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſée any other meaning in this Gréeke text: I wil
<pb facs="tcp:19793:100"/>
not contende, for I ſée that many men of great learning, haue varied in opinion about the tranſlation therof.</p>
               <p>But graunt that <hi>Cerberus</hi> haue cited that tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is according to the true meaning of the Text: what hath he wonne thereby? Shall all the Scripture be on his ſide, bicauſe it is written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of wiſdom, that God eſtemeth it a thing contrarie to hys power (or more truly after the Latine Text that <hi>Cerberus</hi> citeth) a thing ſtraunge from his power, to condemne him that hath not deſerued puniſhment? I thinke not. For the booke of wiſedome, is of that ſort of bookes that muſt be made to agrée with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canonical bookes: the Canonicall bookes muſt not be enforced to agree with it: For it is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pokryphe,</hi> that is a booke permitted to be read priuatly, but not of ſuch authoritie that we may builde our fayth vpon euerie ſentence in it.</p>
               <p>But graunt that this booke were of as great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as any other booke of Scripture is: ſhould we thinke that God might not iuſtly refuſe ſuch of his creatures as it pleaſeth him not to chooſe, vnleſſe the ſame creatures had firſt by ſinne made them ſelues vnworthie to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen? We muſt not reſtraine God of his libertie, to doe wyth his creatures what he himſelfe will. Neyther muſt we ſay or thinke, that any thing that he doth, is or can be other than iuſt, albeit that we can not vnderſtand howe the ſame ſhoulde be iuſt. We muſt therefore, wyth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend ſeare, ſeeke another meaning of thys place than <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth teach vs: let vs thinke therefore, that God ſpeaketh here of therecution of his iudgement, and not of election. And it ſhalbe good for vs to ſay always wyth S. Auſten, that the cauſe of Gods doings may be ſecrete, ſo <note place="margin">Aug. Paulino Quest. 6.</note> that we can not know them: but vniuſt they can not be.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſéemeth to himſelfe to haue gotten a great aduauntage by the example of the Cananites and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19793:100"/>
Iſraelites. The Cananites were driuen out for theyr ſinnes, and this was iuſtice: but the Iſraelites were put in their place without deſeruing, and that was mercie. Wherefore in refuſing, God worketh by iuſtice, and in chooſing, he worketh by mercie. As though there were no difference betwene chooſing and refuſing of creatures, and the vſing of them when they be choſen or refuſed. God chooſeth and refuſeth without reſpect of good or euill deſeruings: but he maketh not his refuſal knowen vnto men, till the refuſed haue by theyr ſinnes ſhewed them ſelues worthie to be refuſed. And though the choſen ſort, neyther do nor can ſhewe themſelues worthie for theyr good workes to be choſen: yet before they receyue the great bleſſing promiſed, they ſhewe themſelues by theyr workes, leſſe worthie to be refuſed than the other.</p>
               <p>And to this do the Scriptures that <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Moſes, Paule, O ſée and the reſt: full well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée. But it followeth not hereof that therefore God had not refuſed the wicked ſort before they ſinned.</p>
               <p>It is true, that death is the rewarde of ſinne: but it is not true that euerie one that ſinneth, receyueth that reward, for Chriſt came to ſaue ſinners, and the frée gift of euerlaſting life is beſtowed vpon ſuch ſinners, as were elected in Chriſt before the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p>It is true alſo, that man deſtroyeth himſelfe, by the frée conſent of his will, to do contrarie to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, &amp; that his helpe and ſuccour commeth of God alone: &amp; yet doth it not therfore follow, that no man is refuſed of God before he haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſinne, whereby he deſtroyeth himſelf. For when the elect were choſen in Chriſt, then were the reſt refuſed. For otherwiſe, it could not be an election, but a generall acceptation.</p>
               <p>As for the ſaying that <hi>Cerberus</hi> ſayth is ours, and would haue his friend to lay it in the one ſide of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launce

And let him put in as many graines of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full partialitie as he will: for the ſaying is none of ours. For we teach, that ſinne is the cauſe of eternall death, in thoſe that be not Gods elect, and were it not that Chriſt hath waſhed his choſen ſlocke in his owne heart bloud: ſinne would be theyr deſtruction too.</p>
               <p>It is but for his owne pleaſure therfore, that <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> doth thus turne round after his owne tayle.</p>

               <p>And vpon the ſame Article dependeth alſo an other part of doctrine, which they teach, worthy to be miſliked of all men, as wel for that it importeth a ſophiſticall ſearch of bottomleſſe ſecretes, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie eſſence and nature of God, as alſo, for that it clearely withdraweth vs from Chriſt, the only ſtaie, and comfort of our weake conſcience, deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the word of God, for that they might be ſure to holde faſt the former principle, that all things come of Gods predeſtination, as running ſtreames out of a deepe fountaine. They affirme, that the free mercie of God in Chriſt, is but an inferiour cauſe of Election, and that we are taught to aſcende vnto a higher cauſe, as vnto the eternall purpoſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination of God, which he determined onely in himſelfe. So ſayth the printed booke before named, tranſlated out of French into Engliſh.</p>
               <p>That ſame thing we reade alſo, lately ſet forth in Engliſh print, in the gloſe of the laſt tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated Bible. Rom. cap. 9. wyth theſe wordes. As the only wyl and purpoſe of God, is the chiefe cauſe of Election and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19793:101"/>
Reprobation, ſo his free mercie in Chriſt is an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cauſe of ſaluation. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I truſt in minde, neuer to aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto that high cauſe of Election, and in heart neuer to taſte of that eternall purpoſe or predeſtination, which God hath determined only in himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or aboue his free mercie, which is in Chriſt. For ſurelie, that eternall purpoſe, whych cometh not of Gods free mercie in Chriſt, is to deſtroy, and not to ſaue. Agayne, if that eternall purpoſe ſpring out of Gods free mercie, then is that free mercie of God, the chiefe cauſe, and not an inferiour cauſe why he purpoſeth to ſaue vs, for a great diſhonor it were to the mercie of God: to be put to an inferiour place, touching election and ſaluation of man. For if euer Gods mercie be aboue all, it is in the ſauing of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man: and mercie there is not in God towarde man, but onely in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore S. Paule Epheſ. 3. b. calleth it the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purpoſe, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord: In Chriſt therefore was this eternall purpoſe, and for hys onely ſake, God the Father eternally purpoſed to elect and ſaue vs. Conſider and marke it well, whence commeth thys purpoſe or wyll of God to ſaue vs: but of his free mercie? If hys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſaue vs, ſpring out of his free mercie, why is then his mercie inferior to his purpoſe, or how is the fountaine inferior to the ſprings that come therof?</p>
               <p>Alſo, what may be ſayd in God at any time, or in any reſpect to be higher or greater than his mercie, ſeeing it is written, that his mercie is as great as him ſelfe. Eccleſiaſt 2. d. Yea, and moſt ſpecially it is ſo to be ſayd, that his mercie paſſeth all, when we ſpeak of this matter: For of thys it is written, that mercie <note place="margin">Iacob. 2. b.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19793:102"/>
reioyceth agaynſt iudgement, and why? all the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes of God in thys behalfe are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto hys mercie, for though it were not true, whych Dauid ſayeth, that his mercie is aboue all his <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. b</note> workes, yet were it cleare, that in Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſaluation of man, Gods mercie in Chriſt, hath euer the higheſt place: and thoſe which in the ſaluation of our ſoules, make the free mercie of God an inferiour cauſe, how baſe a roume will they aſſigne vnto hys free mercie, in nouriſhing and preſeruing our bodies. Let them reach as hygh as they can, I truſt to go no furder, but to hold me faſt by the euerlaſting mercie of God, and by the hemme of Chriſtes garment, for the Scripture deſcribeth God vnto me, wythout Chriſt as a wrathfull and moſte terrible Iudge, but in Chriſt, and for hys ſake, as a father whoſe wrath is pacified, and he well pleaſed, reconciled, agreed, and at one: and to ſpeak of a hygher cauſe or purpoſe, to elect and ſaue only in God, beſide or without this free mercie in Chriſt, or that Chriſt and Gods free mercie in hym, is not the chiefeſt cauſe which worked and obteyneth the decree, and purpoſe of God, to elect and ſaue, it is plainely nothing elſe, but to deny the mercy of God in election, reconciliation, redemption and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Chriſt, in Chriſt, and for Chriſt: As eaſily it may be perceyued, if a man do but weigh and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what eternall purpoſe an Election, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is, ſeing Chriſt is our Aduocate, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Peace, Reconciliation &amp; Atonement, as in theſe Scriptures following, and many other, it doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. Pſal. 84. a. Math. 1. a. Ephe. 1. a. 2. b. Rom 5. a. b. Coloſſ. 1. c. 2. Corin. 5 d. 1. Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. a. Heb. 5. b. c. and. 7. a. b. c. d. e. 2. Timoth. 1. c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:19793:102"/>
And although it be true according to the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that God ſo loued the worlde, that he gaue his onely begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne. &amp;c. yet did he neither loue the world, nor gyue hys ſonne wythout the interceſſion &amp; mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſonne, for if God loued the world without the reconciliation and mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or before he was reconciled, intreated, and pacified by Chriſt, then is Chriſt in vaine come to late to be our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, ſeing God the Father is without him alredy reconciled. But horrible falſe is thys opinion: For like as the ſonne of a King might entreat his Father for the ſeruant, whom for hys offences, the King in hys diſpleaſure, were ready to caſt, not onely out of hys ſeruice, but alſo into perpetuall priſon: euen ſo Chriſt our onely Sauiour, and Gods only ſonne, did offer vp himſelfe, as a raunſome vnto his Father for vs, whereby he pacified the wrath of hys Father, and adioyned vs with himſelfe, to be ſonne and heyres of hys Fathers glorie. And this hath Chriſt done, not only now in tyme, but alſo euerlaſtingly in the moſt hygh and eternall purpoſe of God, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world was layde.</p>
               <p>Thus I end, thinking it ſufficient for this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that I haue in theſe few wordes pourged my ſelfe of thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs which you lay to my charge, &amp; ſet forth vnto your iudgement, the errors of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that you may the better diſeerne, who they are, whych are worthie to be called after that ſect: and alſo plainly declared, in what pointes my conſcience differeth, from certayne teachers of our time: and vpon what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, I am moued ſo to miſſlike ſome part of their doctrine, whych thyngs if you diligently weye and conſider, readyng the ſame wythout partiallitie: then haue I my deſire.</p>

               <p>I am glad, that <hi>Cerberus</hi> is nowe come to an ende. Much adoe he had to let ſlip ſo manie things as offered themſelues to be ſpoken off. But now he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, concenting him ſelfe wyth fewe wordes, in purging him ſelfe of thoſe things that his friende charged him with, and ſetting forth the Pelagians errours. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet, euen in the winding vp of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, he hath found one part of doctrine, hanging vpon the Article of Gods eternal predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is to be miſliked of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if <hi>Cerberus</hi> be not deceyued) and that is: That as the only will &amp; purpoſe of God is the chiefe cauſe of Election and Reprobation: ſo his free mercie in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c. Here <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth of purpoſe leaue out the ende of that gloſe, ſhutting vp the matter wyth his. &amp;c. I will therefore ſet downe the words that follow, which are theſe: and the hardening of the heart an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cauſe of damnation. Now this gloſe is ſome thing more plaine than it was before, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath cited it with his. &amp;c. He thought belike, that the Bible wherin he findeth this gloſe, is not in euerie mans hande, and therefore his. &amp;c. ſhould cauſe men to thinke that the reſt of the gloſe muſt be as good ſtuffe as he thinketh the firſt part to be. That is worthy to be miſliked of all men, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a ſophiſticall ſearch of bottomleſſe ſecretes, and drawing from Chriſt. Such ſhifts doth <hi>Cerberus</hi> vſe, to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miſlike with that which he himſelfe liketh not.</p>
               <p>But to proue this part of doctrine to be ſuch as <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> aſſirmeth it to be: he vſeth two reaſons. One is, that the eternall purpoſe of God, ſpringeth out of hys frée mercie in Chriſt: wherefore that frée mercie cannot be inferiour to Gods eternall purpoſe, more than the fountaine, from which ſtreames of water do ſlowe, can
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19793:103"/>
be inferiour to the ſtreames that flow from it. The other is of the mediation of Chriſt. For if God did in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall will and purpoſe, elect vs before Chriſt had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his wrath, by his mediation: then was it but a vaine thing for Chriſt to be a Mediatour, neyther had we any neede of his mediation.</p>
               <p>Although I would gladly content my ſelf, to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended mine own writings, and other mens wherewith <hi>Cerberus</hi> findeth fault, euen with as fewe wordes as he vſeth in purging himſelfe and other, of that which his friend layeth to his charge: yet may I not ſo ſhortly ſlip ouer this matter wherewith <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath ſhut vp his aunſwere.</p>
               <p>For if <hi>Cerberus</hi> would haue ſought how to haue ſet forth to be ſéene, his owne wilfull ignorance, and errour in the chiefe pointes of our Religion: he could not haue found a better meane, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath vſed in theſe two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he maketh againſt the doctrine conteyned in the gloſe wherewith he miſliketh.</p>
               <p>For what greater errour can there be, than to holde that with God there is time paſt, and time to come: and that any of the eſſentiall properties of God do ſpring out of other in time, as though there had bene or could haue bene a time, wherein God lacked thoſe properties? Or that the ſonne of God, the ſeconde perſon in Trinitie, ſhould in his diuine nature in time, make mediation to God the Father, that thereby he might purpoſe to ſaue man, whom he was before purpoſed to deſtroy. For ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt him that hath ſayde, that the only will and purpoſe of God, is the chiefe cauſe of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: and that his frée mercie in Chriſt is an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cauſe of ſaluation. &amp;c. He ſayth that the purpoſe or will of God to ſaue vs, muſt néedes ſpring out of the frée mercie of God, and that therefore the will or purpoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:19793:104"/>
God in ſauing, muſt of force be inferiour to his mercie, euen as ſtreames that iſſue from fountaines, are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the fountaines that they come from.</p>
               <p>And to proue this, he citeth the words of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus the. 2. Chapter. <hi>Secundum enim magnitudinem ipſius: ſic &amp; miſericordia illius cum ipſo est.</hi> That is: Euen according to his owne greatneſſe, ſo is his mercie with hym. He ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth alſo the ſaying of S. Iames. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. of his Epiſtle, where he ſayth. <hi>Iudicium enim ſine miſcricordia: illi qui nòn ſacit miſcricordiam. Gloriatur autem miſcricordia aduerſus iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium.</hi> That is: He that ſheweth no mercie, ſhall haue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without mercie. But mercie reioyſeth againſt iudgement. And againe, he citeth the words of Dauid in the Pſalm. 145. <hi>Miſcricordia eius ſuper omnia opera eius.</hi> That is: His mercie is vpon all his workes.</p>
               <p>All this ado he maketh, to proue that Gods will and purpoſe are inferiours to his mercie. But how well that is by theſe Scriptures proued, I referre to the iudgement of the indifferent Reader. Sirach ſayth, that thoſe which feare the Lorde will prepare their heartes, and humble their ſoules before the Lord. Let vs fall into the handes of God, and not into the hands of men: For euen as his greatneſſe is, ſo is his mercy. Sirach his purpoſe is to ſet forth the effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of God, which worketh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a true turning to God, with an aſſured hope of forgiueneſſe at his hande, bicauſe they be perſuaded, that he is no leſſe readie to forgiue penitent ſinners, than he is able to puniſh the impenitent.</p>
               <p>S. Iames ſayth, that the merciful ſhall finde mercie, minding to perſuade all men to ſhew mercie one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Aſſuring themſelues, that vnleſſe they do ſo, they can finde no mercie with God, and on the contrarie, if they do ſhew mercie, they ſhall not néede to feare iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for mercie ſhall preuaile againſt iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:19793:104"/>
And Dauid the Prophet hath ſaid, that Gods mercie is vpon all his workes, although it pleaſe <hi>Cerberus</hi> to cite his wordes otherwiſe, for his purpoſe. For he ſayth, that Dauid hath ſaid, that the Lordes mercie is aboue all his workes. Which words though they be true, yet hath not Dauid ſo ſayd, neyther maye I ſuffer <hi>Cerberus,</hi> to cauſe the Prophet Dauid to ſpeake as he woulde haue him, that his fantaſie might be maintained by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes words. Dauids meaning is to teach that the Lord God ſheweth mercie vpon all his works, ſo that there is not one of the works of God, that hath not cauſe to praiſe him for his louing kindneſſe and mercie. Both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrue and Gréeke Text, and al the tranſlations in Latine, and Engliſh too (ſo many as I haue ſeene) do giue thys ſenſe of the Prophetes wordes.</p>
               <p>How can <hi>Cerberus</hi> proue then, by theſe Scriptures, that the mercie of God is the fountaine of his wil &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? All that he doeth therefore is nothing elſe but a ſetting forth of his owne wilfull ignoraunce, whereby he is fallen into the filthy errour of them that imagine of God, as of a man, and that he is moued with affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as men be. Whereas, in God: His vnderſtanding, his vnmeaſurable power, his vnſearcheable wiſedome, his mercifull goodneſſe, his truth and iuſtice, his chaſteneſſe and fréedome in all poyntes, to wyll what he luſteth, to do what it pleaſeth him, and to purpoſe &amp; appoynt what liketh him: are eſſentiall properties, without which he neyther is, nor can be God. To imagine therefore, that there was a time wherein God was purpoſed to deſtroy man, and that his mercie in Chriſt hath chaunged that purpoſe, and cauſed him now to purpoſe and will to ſaue man: is to imagine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was a time wherin God was not ſo mercifull as he is now, &amp; ſo, not ſo perfectly God as he is now. And that by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he hath learned ſome
<pb facs="tcp:19793:105"/>
what more wiſedome than he had at the firſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may be wiſer hereafter than he is now. How great abſurdities theſe are, I leaue to the iudgement of the indifferent Readers.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cerberus</hi> will ſaye, that though I haue ſayde ſome thing againſt him, yet I haue ſayd nothing for him whoſe wordes I haue taken in hande to defende: but in my wordes I ſéeme to fight againſt them both. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: I haue not taken vpon me to defend, eyther mine owne or other mens wordes, ſucder than in conſcience I thinke them to be true. And if I did thinke that the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that gloſe did meane as groſſely, as I perceyue by his open wordes that <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth: I would not ſpare him more than I haue ſpared <hi>Cerberus:</hi> but for as much as his wordes ſéeme not to me, to haue any ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as to teach that there was a time, wherein God was mercileſſe towards ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that his mercy firſt ſprang out of his will and purpoſe (as <hi>Cerberus</hi> doth plainely teach, that his wil and purpoſe ſprang out of his mercie) I muſt not refuſe to take that good meaning of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which may ſéeme to me to be according to the truth of Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>The wordes of Paule, whervpon this note is made, are theſe. I will haue mercie on him, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wil ſhew mercie. Upon this it is noted in the margine, that as the onlie will and purpoſe of God is the chiefe cauſe of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation: ſo his frée mercie in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſaluation: and the hardening of the heart an inferiour cauſe of damnation. I vnderſtand the meaning of theſe words to be, that as the only wil &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God is the chiefe cauſe, that there was an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choiſe of ſome, and a refuſall of other ſome: ſo the ſhewing forth of his mercie in Chriſt, is an inferiour cauſe, that is, an inſtrumentall cauſe whereby ſaluation
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19793:105"/>
is wrought in the elected, according to Gods will and purpoſe, and the hardening of the hearts of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, an inſtrumentall cauſe of damnation, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, according to the ſame eternal wil and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>He therefore that ſayth we muſt aſcende to an higher cauſe of Election, than that which appeareth in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Gods mercie in Chriſt, doth not teach to ſet vp the eſſentiall properties one aboue another, as thoughe one were fountaine of another, and that God lacked the one till it ſprang out of the other: but he teacheth that the ſame mercie that we ſée executed in Chriſt in time, was decreed in the eternall will and purpoſe of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time, and ſo was the refuſall of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes we ſee hardened in time. If any man do ſée cauſe to iudge otherwiſe of this gloſe: I am well pleaſed that the ſame vſe his owne iudgement in enterpreting the meaning therof. And if I may perceyue any mans iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement herein to be ſounder than mine, I truſt I ſhalbe ready to condeſcend to that.</p>
               <p>And leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that herein I doe followe mine owne fantacie, without example of any thing that I ſée in the auncient Fathers: I will ſette downe the wordes of S. Auſten, that haue bene a meane to confirme me herein.</p>

Neyther was man, by his ſinne able to diſorder the purpoſe of God, as though he ſhoulde haue conſtreyned God to chaunge the thyng that he had once decréed: ſéeing that God by his foreſight did preuent both, that is to ſay, both how the euill man ſhould become (whom he had created good) and alſo what thing he woulde make of him, euen when he ſhoulde in ſuch wiſe become euill. For although it be ſayd that God doth chaunge his purpoſes (whereof it commeth that by a figuratiue ſpeach, it is reade in the holie Scriptures, that God did repent) the ſame is ſpoken according to that which man hoped for, or that which the order of naturall cauſes did import: not according to that, which the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie did know before hand that he himſelf would do.</p>

That is to ſaye: God is the cauſe of all thoſe things that be. And in aſmuch as he is the cauſe of all things: he is the cauſe of his owne wiſedome. Neyther was God at any time without his owne wiſedome: therefore he is the euerlaſting cauſe of his owne euerlaſting wiſedome, neyther is he in time more auncient than his owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Furthermore, if to be an euerlaſting Father, be a thing that is in God, and that he hath not at any time not bene a Father: then hath he neuer bene without a ſonne. Whatſoeuer is paſt, is not now. Whatſoeuer is to come, is not yet. Therefore, whatſoeuer is paſt or to come, is wanting, but with God there is nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. There is with God therefore nothing paſt or to come, but all preſent.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſayings of Auſten do ſéeme to me ſufficient to ſtaie a man in that minde that I am of, concerning the cauſe of Gods Election and Reprobation. His will and purpoſe which could neuer be wanting in him, neyther can by any meanes be altered, chaunged or letted, maye well be called the cauſe why he hath choſen ſome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected ſome other ſome. And this Election is in him euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting as he himſelfe is: neither may it be thought that there was euer any time wherein he had not elected thoſe that be elected, and refuſed thoſe that be refuſed. But we holde not that this is done without Chriſt, and therefore <hi>Cerberus</hi> laboureth more than néedeth to proue by Scriptures that our Election is in Chriſt. For we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt Chriſt to be eternall as his Father is, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation to be alwayes preſent with God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Election that is in Gods purpoſe and wil, is not without Chriſt the mercyſeate and mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man. Thus much for the firſt of <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Now a fewe wordes to his ſecond reaſon, and ſo an
<pb facs="tcp:19793:107"/>
end. Firſt, <hi>Cerberus</hi> doeth in this reaſon flatly affirme, that God did not loue the worlde, nor giue his ſonne for the worlde, before his wrath was appeaſed by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his ſonne. Wherevpon it followeth, that there was a time, wherein God was wroth with the worlde, and not pacified by his Sonne. Which doctrine is as muche as to denie Chriſt to be a mediatour. But in the cloſing vp of the matter, he ouerthroweth that againe, affirming that Chriſt hath pacified the wrath of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely nowe in tyme, but alſo euerlaſtingly in the moſt highe and eternall purpoſe of God before the foundation of the worlde was layed.</p>
               <p>Hitherto he hath fought againſt vs: but nowe in the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ioyneth with vs, calling the purpoſe of God eternall and moſt high. And what is that but to affirme all that we teache concerning the cauſe of Election and Reprobation.</p>
               <p>As touching the mediation of Chriſt: we holde that which S. Auſten wryteth in his Homelie, <hi>De ouibus. Non mediator homo praeter Deitatem, Non mediator Deus praeter hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitatem. Ecce mediator. Diuinitas ſine humanitate non eſt mediatrix. Humanitas ſine diuinitate, non eſt mediatrix. Sed inter diuinitatem ſolam, &amp; humanitatem ſolam, mediatrix eſt, humana diuinitas, &amp; diuina humanitas Christi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man without the Godhead, is not mediatour. God without the manhode is not mediatour: Loe here is the mediatour. The diuinitie without the humanitie is not mediatrix. The humanitie without the diuinitie is not mediatrix: but the humane diuinitie and the diuine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie of Chriſt, is the mediatrix betwéene the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie alone and the humanitie alone. And this mediation doe we holde (as in his concluſion, at vnwares I think, <hi>Cerberus</hi> hath confeſſed) to be euerlaſting in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and moſt highe purpoſe of God: according to the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19793:107"/>
ſaying of Saint Iohn in the ſeconde of his firſt Epiſtle. We haue an Aduocate with God the Father, which is Ieſus Chriſt the righteous. To whome with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Ghoſt be all honour and glorie. Amen.</p>
               <p>Thus in as fewe wordes as I could: I haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that doctrine of Gods Prouidence &amp; Predeſtination, which I and others, haue taught, and as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, doe teach, both in preaching and wryting. Beſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Chriſtian Reader to call vpon God, for the ayde of his holy ſpirite to aſſiſt vs, and to make vs able to continue in the teaching of true doctrine, in this and all other Articles that concerne Chriſtian religion, that by vs, as the miniſters of God, the congregation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt maye be edified.</p>
               <p>And if the Authour of the anſwere, doe finde himſelfe grieued for that I haue talked of him vnder the name of <hi>Cerberus:</hi> my deſire is, that he woulde make his right name knowne to me eyther by worde or wryting, and if he thinke himſelfe able to diſproue ought that I haue written in this defence, he ſhall eyther finde me able to mayntayne my wryting by good authoritie, or elſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to yelde to better. But if he will lurcke ſtill in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and caſt abroade ſuche libelles as is this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to his friends letter: I wil not trouble my ſelfe any more in defending my ſelfe &amp; others againſt him that dare not ſhew his face. Farewell. If thou profite in reading, I haue the gayne that I ſought in writing.</p>
