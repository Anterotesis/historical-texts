         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can belief na vtherwise, if the tyme

that nouther honour nor commoun welth

quhat kind of pepill thay are, that professis
thame selfis in deid, and disemblis in worde,
to be enemeis to God, to Iustice, and to you,
becaus ye maintene the Kingis actioun.</p>
            <p>Sum of tham ar conseilaris of the Kyng
his fatheris slauchter, sum conueyaris of him
to the schambles, that slew his Grandschir,
banisched his father, and not satisfyid to haue
slayne him self, murtherit the Kingis regent,
and now seikes his awin blude, that they may
fullfill thayr cruelie and auarice being kingis,
quhilk thay begonne to exercise the tyme of
thair gouerning.</p>
            <p>Vthers ar, that being alliat, nor neir of kyn
to the Hamiltounis, thinkis to be partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
of all thair prosperitie and succes.</p>
            <p>Vthers being giltie of kyng Henryis death,
in the first parliament halden in the kyngis
regne that now is, could well accord, that the
Quene should haue bene put to deith also.
And seing thay could not obtene that point,
the next schift of thayr impietie was to put
<pb facs="tcp:22815:4"/>
downe the King, that he should not rest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
his Fatheris deith, quhilk they thocht
could not be mair easely done, then by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home the Quene with sic a husband, that

of blude, nuryshers of theft, raisers of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
counsallours of Traitouris, inuenters of

            <p>It is also necessarie to your Lordschippis

            <p>First, it is not honour, riches, nor authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>It is not the Quenis authoritie that thay

And seing thair purpois succedit not by craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>¶And that ye may see quhat meanis thay

violence, force and tresoun. I will call to your
memorie sum of thair practisis, quhilk many
of you may remember asweill as I.</p>
            <p>First after the deith of King Iames the Fourt
Iohn Duke of Albany chosin by the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to gouerne in the Kingis les age, The Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltounis
<pb facs="tcp:22815:7"/>
thinkyng that he had bene als wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kid
as thay, and should to his awin aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
put downe the King beyng of tender age
for the tyme and by the deceis of his brother
left alone, and that thay wald easilie get thair
hand beyond the Duke, being an stranger and
without successioun of hys body, held tham
quyet for a season, thinkyng that vther mens
actioun should be thair promotion, but seyng
that the Duke as Prince baith wyse and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
to bryng him selfe out of sic suspitioun,
put four Lordis estimid of the maist trew and
verteous in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in that tyme to attend on
the Kingis grace, to wit; the Erle Merchell, the
Lordis Erskyn, Ruthuen, and Borthicke, The
Hamiltounis beyng out of hope of the Kingis
puttyng downe by the Duke of Albany, &amp; out
of credeit to do him any harme by tham selfis,
maid one conspyracie with certane Lordis,
to put the sayd Duke out of authoritie, and
take it on tham selfis, that all thynges put in
thair power they might vse the King and the
Realme at thair awin plesure. To that effect
thay tooke the Castell of Glasgow, and there
maid an assembly of thair factioun, the quhilk
was dissoluit by the hastie cummyng of the
Duke of Albany with an armie, for feir of the
quhilk the Erle of Arrane cheif of that cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ded to his wifis brother the Lord Hume
<pb facs="tcp:22815:7"/>
being then out of Court.</p>
            <p>The second conspiracie was after the Dukis
last departing (the foresayd Lordis separate
from attending on the king) deuysit by Schir
Iames Hammiltoun bastard sonne to the sayd
Erle of Arrane, quha conspirit the Kinges
deith then being in his hous in the Abbay of
Halyruidhous, quhilk couspiracie ester many
yeiris reueillit, the sayd Schir Iames sufferit
deith for it. This conspiracie not being exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
Schir Iames perseuerid in hys euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentioun,
&amp; by secreit meanis in Court soght
alwais that the king should not mary that for
lack of his succession, the Hamiltounis might
cum to thair intentis. For the king was yong,
lusty, and redy to auenture his persoun to all
hasardis, baith by sea and land, in down put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of theifis, and vpsetting of Iustice. The
Hamiltounis luiked on quhen seiknes, throw
excesse of trauell, or sum vther rakles aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture
shold cut him of without children, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of this hope, first he stopped the kingis
metyng with his vncle the king of Ingland,
quha at that time hauing but one daughter,
was willing to haif maryid with the kyng of
Scotland, and maid him kyng of the hole Ile
after him, &amp; to haue enterid him at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time in possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Duchy of Yorke,
but the sayd Schir Iames euer hauing eye to
<pb facs="tcp:22815:8"/>
his awin scope, hinderid this purpois by sum
of the Kingis familiaris, that he had practised
with by giftis, and specially by the Bischop of
Sanctandros Iames Betoun, vncle to the Erle
of Aranis mother, and greit vncle to Schir
Iames wyfe, and raysed sic suspitioun betuix
the twa Kingis, that brought baith the realmes
in greit besines.</p>
            <p>This purpois as sayd is put abak, the King
seing that his Ambassadouris furtherit not at
his plesure, deliuerid him self in persoun to ga
by sey in France, and Schir Iames Hamiltoun
perseuering in his former inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion went with
him to hinder his mariage, by all menis that
he might, and to that effect, the King sleiping
in the Schip, without any necessitie of winde
and wedder, Schir Iames caused the marineris
to turne saill of the West coist of Ingland bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart
and land in Galloway, quhair the Kyng
was varray miscontent with Schir Iames and
Maister Dauid Panter, principall causeris of
his returnyng, as diuers that was in the Schip
yit liuyng can report. And fra that time furth,
the King hauing tried out his pretence, and
persaiuing his vnfaithfull dealyng euer disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
him, and to his greit displesure fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
opinlie the Erle of Lennox &amp; his freindis
in his abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the quhilk Erle prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded a right
and tytill to the hole Erldome of Arrane, the
<pb facs="tcp:22815:8"/>
present Erle for that time being knawin to be
bastard, as also it was in mens recent memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
how Schir Iames Hamiltoun had cruellie
slayne the Erle of Lennox at Linlythgow, euin
to the great displesure of the Erle of Arrane
father to Schir Iames, and vncle to the Erle of
Lennox, commyng by the Kingis commandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Linlythgow. Sa the King as sayd is,
vnderstandyng the priuate practike of Schir
Iames, in keipyng him vnmaryid, haistit hym
the mair eirnestlie to mary, to the effect, that
hys successioun might put the Hamiltounis
out of hope of thair intent, and hym out of
danger by the Hamiltounis. And albeit that
Schir Iames to make him self clene of that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitioun,
soght many diueris wayis to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structioun
of the Erle of Arrane hys brother,
yit he could neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queis the Kingis fauour,
vntill finallie he was executid for tresoun, and
tooke ane miserabill end conforme to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
lyfe.</p>
            <p>The King at last decessit, &amp; leuing a dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of sex dayis auld, the Hamiltounis thoght
all to be thairis. For then the Erle of Arranea
young man of small wit &amp; great inconstancie,
was set vp by sum of the Nobilitie, &amp; sum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
seruandis of the kingis lately deceissit,
for thay thought him mair tollerabill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Cardinall Beton, quha by ane fals instrument
<pb facs="tcp:22815:9"/>
had takin the supreme authoritie to him selfe.</p>
            <p>The Erle of Arrane namid Gouernour, by a
priuait factioun, and fauourid by sa many as
professit the trew Religioun of Christ, becaus
he was beleift then to be of the same, howbeit
he was gentil of nature, yit his freindis for the
maist pairt, wer gredie baith of geir and blud,
and geuin to iniustice quhair gayne followid.
Thair was in his time nothyng ellis, but werr,
oppression, and brybing of his callid brother
the Bischop of Sanctandrois, sa that all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis
wer werie of him, and dischargid hym
of hys office, and charged with it an woman
strangear.</p>
            <p>In the begynnyng of hys gouernement the
Quene and hir mother wer keipit by hym, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lyke presoneris then Princessis, but yit
that incommoditie was caus of preseruyng of
the Quenis lyfe, he beleifing to mary hir on
his sone. But after the Erle of Lennox had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuerid
tham out of his handis, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
had refusid to mary hir on his sone, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he left his ferme freindis, &amp; come to the
Quene, abiurid his Religion in the gray frei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eis
of Striuiling, yit he could neuer cum agane
to his pretendid clymmyng to the Crowne,
quhilk he had lang soght, partly by fauour of
sic of the Nobilitie as wer alliat with him, and
partlie by distructioun of the ancient housis
<pb facs="tcp:22815:9"/>
that might haif put impediment to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonabill
ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For hauing banished the
Erle of Lennox, he thoght the Erle of Angous
to be the principall that might resist him, and
hauing enterid in waird Schir George Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas,
to be yit mair assurid, he send for the said
Erle of Angous in freindly maner, &amp; put him
in prisoun without any iust occasioun, and
wold haue beheadid them baith, if the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the Inglis army had not stayit his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois,
by the quhilk, and feir of the murmour
of the pepill, he was constranit to deliuer tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And seing he durst not at sic a time put tham
downe by tyrannie, he offerit tham to the
sword of the enemy to be slaine by tham. And
to the effect that thay and thayr freindes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
put aback the Inglis horsmen, &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
an vther charge, might be the mair ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

tham, and sa these Nobill men sa far as lay in
him was slayne, and preseruid by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God.</p>
            <p>The young Quene quhilk being in hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theris
keiping, he might not put downe, nor
mary at his plesure, he consentid to offer hir
to the stormes of the sea, and danger of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meis,
and sold hir as a slaue in France, for the

sche seikyng a querrell agaynst the sayd
Duike and sum vther Lordis, vnder pretence
that thay had conspyrit agaynst hir, for the
Religionis caus, the Duikis freindis left hym
all, becaus that the rest of the Lordis wald not
consent to destroy the Quene, or derogat hir
authoritie by any maner of way. A litill befoir
the quhilke tyme, the occasioun of the Dukis
conspyracie, with the Erle Bothwell to slay
the Erle of Murray in Falkland, was na vther,
but becaus the sayd Erle of Murray lyuyng,
thay could nouther do the said Quene harme

quhilke act ye may see how the thrist of your

First thay chose the principall enemie of

thame, seyng thay pretending neyrest clame
to the crowne, should be neirest the danger.
And vit for all this could these men be weill
contentit, if by any meanes they could attene
to thair intent, by spoyle &amp; rubberie, as thay
did quhen as they wer placid in supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or by making of you slaues as thay

quhairin howbeit the inhumanitie was

of all his trew seruandis and trew subiectis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentlie.
For quhat defence can be in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,

            <p>¶If this thirst of blud of these Lochlechis,
might be imputit to haistie hounger or any
sodane motion, quhilk causis men sum times
to forget thair dewtie, there might yit be sum
hope, that sic a passioun ouerpast, thay wald
with time remember thame selfis, and after
