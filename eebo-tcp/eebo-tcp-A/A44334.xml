         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>I Think it necessary to inform my Reader that Doctor <hi>Gauden</hi> (the late Bishop of <hi>Worcester)</hi> hath also lately wrote and publisht the Life of Master <hi>Hooker;</hi> and though this be not writ by design to oppose what he hath truly written; yet, I am put upon a neccessity to say, That in it there be many Material Mistakes, and more O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions. I conceive some of his Mistakes did proceed from a Belief in Master <hi>Thomas Fuller,</hi> who had too hastily published what be hath since most ingenuously retracted. And for the Bishops Omissions, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his more weighty Business and Want of Time, made him pass over many things without that due Examination, which my better Leisure, my Diligence, and my accidental Advantages, have made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
                  <p>And now for my self, I can say, I hope, or rather know, there are no Material Mistakes in what I here present to you, that shall become my Reader. Little things that I have received by Tradition (to which there may be too much and too little Faith given) I will not at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Time undertake to justifie; for, though I have used great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and compared Relations and Circumstances, and probable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults and Expressions: yet, I shall not impose my Belief upon my Reader; I shall rather leave him at liberty: But, if there shall appear any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb facs="tcp:66185:7"/>
Ommission, I desire every Lover of truth and the Memory of Master <hi>Hooker,</hi> that it may be made known unto me. And, to incline him to it, I here promise to acknowledge and rectifie any such Mistake in a second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which the Printer says he hopes for; and by this means my weak (but faithful) Endeavours may become a better Monument, and in some degree more worthy the Memory of this Venerable Man.</p>
                  <p>I confess, that when I consider the great Learning and Vertue of Master <hi>Hooker,</hi> and what satisfaction and Advantages many Eminent Scholars and Admirers of him have had by his Labours: I do not a little wonder that in Sixty years no man did undertake to tell Posterity of the Excellencies of his Life and Learning, and the Accidents of both; and sometimes wonder more at my self, that I have been perswaded to it; and indeed I do not easily pronounce my own Pardon, nor expect that my Reader shall, unless my Introduction shall prove my Apology, to which I refer him.</p>

                  <p>THough a Familiarity of Forty years continuance, and the constant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your Love, even in the worst times, be sufficient to indear our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: yet, I must confess my affection much improved, not onely by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of private respect to those very many that know and love you, but by your new demonstration of a Publick Spirit, testified in a diligent, true, and useful Collection of so many Material Passages as you have now afforded me in the Life of Venerable Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>; Of which, since desired by such a Friend as yourself, I shall not deny to give the Testimony of what I know concerning him and his learned Books; but shall first here take a fair occasion to tell you, that you have been happy in chusing to write the Lives of three such Persons, as Posterity hath just cause to honour; which they will do the more for the true Relation of them by your happy Pen: of all which I shall give you my unfeigned Censure.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with my most dear and incomparable Friend Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> late Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, who not only trusted me as his Executor, but three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death delivered into my hands those excellent Sermons of his which are now made publick: professing before Dr. <hi>Winniff,</hi> Dr. <hi>Montford,</hi> and I think your self then present at his bed-side, that it was by my restless importunity that he had prepared them for the Press; together with which (as his best Legacy) he gave me all his Sermon-Notes, and his other Papers, containing an Extract of near Fifteen hundred Authors. How these were got out of my hands, you, who were the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger for them, and how lost both to me and your self, is not now seasonable to complain: but, since they did miscarry, I am glad that the general Demonstration of his Worth was so fairly preserved, and represented to the World by your Pen in the History of his Life; indeed so well, that beside others, the best Critick of our later time (Mr. <hi>Iohn Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge) affirm'd to me, <hi>He had not seen a Life written with more advantage to the Subject, or more reputation to the Writer, than that of Dr.</hi> Donnes.</p>
                  <p>After the performance of this task for Dr.<hi>Donne,</hi> you undertook the like office for our Friend Sir <hi>Henry Wolton,</hi> betwixt which two there was a Friendship begun in <hi>Oxford,</hi> continued in their various Travels, and more confirm'd in the religious Friendship of Age: and doubtless this excellent Person had writ the Life of Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> if Death had not prevented him; by which means, his and your Pre-collections for that Work, fell to the happy manage of your Pen: A Work, which you would have declin'd, if imperious perswasions had not been stronger then your modest resolutions against it. And I am thus far glad, that the first Life was so impos'd upon you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it gave an unadvoidable cause of writing the second; If not, 'tis too probable we had wanted both, which had been a prejudice to all lovers of Honor and ingenuous Learning. And let me not leave my Friend Sir <hi>Henry</hi> without this Testimony added to yours, That he was a Man of as florid a Wit, and elegant a Pen, as any former, or ours, which in that kinde is a most excellent Age, hath ever produced.</p>
                  <p>And now having made this voluntary observation of our two deceased Friends, I proceed to satisfie your desire concerning what I know and believe of the ever-memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who was <hi>Schismaticorum Malleius,</hi> so great a Champion for the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Rights, against the Factious Torrent of Separatists that then ran high against Church-Discipline, and in his unanswerable Books continues still to be so against the unquiet Disciples of their Schism, which now under other names carry on their design; and who (as the proper Heirs of their Irrational Zeal) would again rake into the scarce-closed Wounds of a newly bleeding <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first, though I dare not say I knew Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>; yet, as our Ecclesiastical History reports to the honor of <hi>Igna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ius,</hi> That he lived in the time of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and had seen him in his childhood; so I also joy, that in my minority I have often seen Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> with my Father, then Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> from whom, and others at that time, I have heard most of the material passages which you relate in the History of his Life; and, from my Father received such a Character of his <hi>Learning, Humility,</hi> and other Vertues, that like Jewels of unvaluable price, they still cast such a lustre as Envy
<pb facs="tcp:66185:8"/>
or the Rust of Time shall never darken. From my Father I have also heard all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the Plot to defame him; and how Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> outwitted his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, and gained their confession; and could give an account of each particular of that Plot, by that I judge it fitter to be forgotten, and rot in the same Grave with the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Authors. I may not omit to declare, That my Fathers knowledge of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was occasioned by the Learned Dr. <hi>Iohn Spencer,</hi> who after the death of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> was so careful to preserve his unvaluable Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Books of EC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLESIASTICAL POLITT, and his other Writings, that he procured <hi>Henry Iackson,</hi> then of <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge, to transcribe for him all Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written Papers, many of which were imperfect; for his Study had been rifled or worse used by Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> and another of principles too like his: But as these Papers were, they were endeavored to be compleated by his dear Friend Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed them as a precious Legacy to my Father; after whose death they rested in my hand, till Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> commanded them out of my custody, authorising Dr. <hi>Iohn Barkham,</hi> (his Lordships Chaplain) to require and bring them to him to <hi>Lambeth:</hi> At which time I have heard they were put into the Bishops Library, and that they remained there till the Martyrdom of Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and were then by the Brethren of that Faction given with the Library to <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> as a reward for his remarkable service in those sad times of the Churches confusion: And though they could hardly fall into a fouler hand, yet there wanted not other endeavors to corrupt and make them speak that Language, for which the Faction then fought; which was, <hi>To subject the Soveraign Power to the People.</hi> I need not strive to vindicate Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in this particular; his known Loyalty to his Prince whilst he lived, the sorrow expressed by King <hi>Iames</hi> for his death; the value our late Soveraign (of ever-blessed Memory) put upon his Works, &amp; now the singular Character of his worth given by you in the passages of his life, (especially in your <hi>Appendix</hi> to it) do sufficiently clear him from that imputation: And I am glad you mention how much value <hi>Robert Stapleton,</hi> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, and other eminent Men of the Romish perswasion, have put upon his Books, having been told the same in my youth by persons of worth that have travelled <hi>Italy.</hi> Lastly, I must again congratulate this undertaking of yours, as now more proper to you then any other person, by reason of your long knowledge and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the worthy family of the <hi>Cranmers</hi> (my old friends also) who have been men of noted wisdom, especially Mr. <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> whose prudence added to that of Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> proved very useful in the compleating of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> matchless Books; one of their Letters I herewith send you to make use of, if you think fit. And let me say further, you merit much from many of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> best friends then living; namely, from the ever-renowned Archb. <hi>Whitgist,</hi> of whose imcomparable worth, with the Character of the times, you have given us a more short and significant account then I have received from any other Pen. You have done much for Sir <hi>Henry Savile,</hi> his contemporary and familiar friend; amongst the surviving Monuments of whose Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (give me leave to tell you so) two are omitted; his Edition of <hi>Euclid,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his Translation of King <hi>Iames his Apology for the Oath of Allegeance,</hi> into elegant Latine: Which flying in that dress as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> was by the Pope and Conclave sent unto <hi>Franciscus Snarez</hi> to <hi>Salamanca</hi> (he then residing there as President of that Colledge) with a command to answer it. When he had perfected the work (which he calls <hi>Defensio Fidei Catholica,</hi>) it was transmitted to <hi>Rome</hi> for a view of the Inquisitors; who according to their custom blotted out what they pleased, and (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath been used since his death) added whatsoever might advance the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or carry on their own interest, commonly coupling together <hi>Dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Have been perswaded by a Friend, that I ought to obey, to write, <hi>The Life of RICHARD HOOKER,</hi> the happy Author of Five (if not more) of the Eight Learned Books of <hi>The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</hi> and though I have undertaken it, yet it hath been with some unwillingness, foreseeing that it must prove to me, and especially at this time of my Age, a Work of much labor to enquire, consider, research, and determine what a needful to be known concerning him. For I knew him not in his Life, and must therefore not onely look back to his Death, (now Sixty four years past) but almost Fifty years beyond that, even to his Childhood and Youth, and gather thence such Observations and Prognosticks, as may at least adorn, if not prove necessary for the compleating of what I have undertaken.</p>
                     <p>This trouble I foresee, and foresee also; that it is impossible to escape Censures; against which I will not hope my well-meaning and diligence can protect me, (for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Age in which I live) and shall therefore but intreat of my Reader a suspension of them, till I have made known unto him some Reasons, which I my self would now fain believe, do make me in some measure fit for this undertaking: And if these Reasons shall not acquit me from all Censures, they may at least abate of their severity; and this is all I can probably hope for.</p>
                     <p>My Reasons follow.</p>
                     <p>About Forty years past (for I am now in the Seventieth of my age) I began a happy affinity with <hi>William Cranmer,</hi> (now with God) Grand Nephew unto the Great Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of that name; a family of noted prudence and resolution; with him and two of his sisters I had an entire and free friendship: One of them was the Wife of Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> a Bosom-friend, and sometime Compupil with Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and after President of the same. I name them here, for that I shall have occasion to mention them in this following Discourse; as also <hi>George Cranmer</hi> their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whose useful abilities my Reader may have a more authentick testimony then my Pen can purchase for him, by that of our Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>William Cranmer</hi> and his two forenamed Sisters, had some affinity, and a most familiar friendship with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and had had some part of their Education with him in his House, when he was Parson of <hi>Bishops-Born</hi> near <hi>Cantebury</hi>; in which City their good Father then lived. They had (I say) a great part of their Education with him, as my self since that time, a happy Cohabitation with them; and having some years before read part of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Works with great liking and satisfaction, my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on to them, made me a diligent Inquisitor into many things that concerned him; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66185:9"/>
of his Person, his Nature, the management of his Time, his Wife, his Family, and the Fortune of him and his. Which inquiry hath given me much advantage in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is now under my consideration and intended for the satisfaction of my Reader.</p>
                     <p>I had also a friendship with the Reverend Dr. <hi>Usher,</hi> the late Learned Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi>; and with Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> the late Learned and Charitable Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>; as also with the Learned <hi>John Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge; and with them also (who loved the very name of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>) I have had many discourses concerning him; and from them, and many others that have now put off Mortality, I might have had more Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if I could then have admitted a thought of any fitness for what by perswasion I have now undertaken. But, though that full Harvest be irrecoverably lost, yet my Memory hath preserved some Gleanings, and my diligence made such Additions to them, as I hope will prove useful to the compleating of what I intend. In the discovery of which I shall be faithful, and with this assurance put a period to my Introduction.</p>

                     <p>IT is not to be doubted, but that <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> was born within the Precincts, or in the City of <hi>Exeter.</hi> A City which may justly boast that it was the Birth-place of him and Sir <hi>Thomas Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>; as indeed the County may in which it stands, that it hath furnished this Nation with Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and many others memorable for their Valor and Learning. He was born about the Year of our Redemption One thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty and three; and of Parents, that were not so remarkable for their Extraction or Riches, as for their Vertue and Industry, and Gods Blessing upon both: By which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to educate their Children in some degree of Learning, of which, our <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> may appear to be one fair Testimony: And that Nature is not so partial, as always to give the great Blessings of Wisdom and Learning, and with them the greater Blessings of Vertue and Government, to those onely that are of a more high and honorable Birth.</p>
                     <p>His Complexion (if we may guess by him at the Age of Forty) was Sanguine, with a mixture of Choler; and yet his Motion was slow even in his Youth, and so was his Speech, never expressing an Earnestness in either of them, but a Gravity suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Aged. And it is observe (so far as Inquiry is able to look back at this distance of Time) that at his being a School-boy, he was an early Questionist, quietly inquisitive, <hi>Why this was, and that was not, to be remembred? Why this was granted, and that denied?</hi> This being mixt with a remarkable Modesty, and a sweet serene Quietness of Nature; and with them a quick Apprehension of many perplext parts of Learning, imposed then upon him as a Scholar, made his Master and others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to have an inward Blessed Divine Light, and therefore to consider him to a little wonder. For in that, Children were less pregnant, less confident, and more malleable, then in this wiser, but not better Age.</p>
                     <p>This Meekness and conjuncture of Knowledge, with Modesty in his Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being observed by his School-master, caused him to perswade his Parents (who intended him for an Apprentice) to continue him at School till he could finde out some means, by perswading his rich Uncle, or some other charitable Person, to ease them of a part of their Care and Charge: Assuring them, that their Son was so enriched with the Blessings of Nature and Grace, that God seemed to single him out as a special Instrument of his Glory. And the good Man told them also, that he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66185:9"/>
would double his diligence in instructing him, and would neither expect not receive any other Reward, then the content of so hopeful and happy an imployment.</p>
                     <p>This was not unwelcome news, and especially to this Mother, to whom he was a dutiful and dear Childe; and all Parties were so pleased with this Proposal, that it was resolved <hi>So it should be.</hi> And in the mean time his Parents and Master laid a Foundation for his future Happiness, by instilling into his Soul the <hi>Seeds of Piety.</hi> those Consciencious principles of <hi>Loving and fearing God</hi>; of <hi>an early belief, that he knows the very secrets of our Souls; that he punisheth our Vices, and rewards our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; that we should be free from Hypocrisie, and appear to Man, what we are to God, because first or last the crafty man is catcht in his own snare.</hi> These Seeds of Piety were so seasonably planted, and so continually watered with the daily dew of Gods Blessed Spirit, that his Infant-vertues grew into such holy Habits, as did make him grow daily into more and more favor, both with God and Man; which with the great Learning that he did attain to, hath made <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> honored in this, and will continue him to be so to succeeding Generations.</p>
                     <p>This good School-master, whose name I am not able to recover, (and am sorry, for that I would have given him a better Memorial in this humble Monument, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the memory of his Scholar) was very sollicitous with <hi>Iohn Hooker,</hi> then Chamberlain of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and Uncle to our <hi>Richard,</hi> to take his Nephew into his care, and to maintain him for one year in the University, and in the mean time to use his Endeavors to procure an Admission for him into some Colledge; still urging and assuring him that his Charge would not continue long; for the Lads Learning and Manners were both so remarkable, that they must of necessity be taken notice of; and that God would provide him some second Patron, that would free him and his Parents from their future care and charge.</p>
                     <p>These Reasons, with the affectionate Rhetorick of his good Master, and Gods blessing upon both, procured from his Uncle a faithful promise that he would take him into his care and charge before the expiration of the year following, which was performed.</p>
                     <p>This Promise was made about the Fourth year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and the Learned <hi>Iohn Iewel</hi> (after Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>) having been in the first of this Queens Reign expelled out of <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> (of which he was a Fellow) for adhering to the truth of those Principles of Religion, to which he had assented in the days of Her Brother and Predecessor, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; and he having now a just cause to fear a more heavy punishment then expulsion, was forced by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking this, to seek safety in another Nation, and with that safety the enjoyment of that Doctrine and Worship for which he suffered.</p>
                     <p>But the Cloud of that Persecution and Fear ending with the Life of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Affairs of the Church and State did then look more clear and comfortable; so that he, and many others of the same judgment, made a happy return into <hi>England</hi> about the first of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; in which year, this <hi>Iohn Iewel</hi> was sent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner or Visitor of the Churches of the Western parts of this Kingdom, and especially of those in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> in which County he was born; and then, and there he contracted a friendship with <hi>Iohn Hooker,</hi> the Uncle of our <hi>Richard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Third year of Her Reign, this <hi>Iohn Iewel</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and there being always observed in him a willingness to do good and oblige his Friends, and now a power added to it: <hi>Iohn Hooker</hi> gave him a visit in <hi>Salisbury, and besought him for Charities sake to look favorably upon a poor Nephew of his, whom Nature had fitted for a Scholar; but the estate of his Parents was so narrow, that they were unable to give him the advantage of Learning; and that the Bishop would therefore become his Patron, and prevent him from being a Tradesman; for he was a Boy of remarkable hopes.</hi> And though the Bishop knew Men do not usually look with an indifferent eye upon their own children and Relations, yet he assented so far to <hi>Iohn Hooker,</hi> that he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Boy and his School-master should attend him about <hi>Easter</hi> next following at that place; which was done accordingly: And then after some Questions and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of the Boys Learning, and Gravity, and Behavior, the Bishop gave his School-master a Reward, and took order for an Annual Pension for the Boys Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, promising also to take him into his care for a future preferment; which was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66185:10"/>
performed. For, about the Fourteenth year of his age, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. he was by the Bishop appointed to remove to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there to attend Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> then President of <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge: Which he did, and Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> had (according to a promise made to the Bishop) provided for him both a Tutor (which was said to be the Learned Dr. <hi>Iohn Reynolds</hi>) and a Clerks place in that Colledge: Which place, though it were not a full maintenance, yet with the contribution of his Uncle, and the continued Pension of his Patron, the good Bishop, gave him a comfortable subsistence. And in this condition he continued unto the Eighteenth year of his age, still increasing in Learning and Prudence, and so much in <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> that he seemed to be filled with the Holy Ghost, and even like St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from his Mothers Womb, who did often bless the day in which she bare him.</p>
                     <p>About this time of his age, he fell into a dangerous Sickness, which lasted two Moneths: All which time, his Mother having notice of it, did in her hourly Prayers as earnestly beg his life of God, as the Mother of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did, that he might become a true Christian: And their Prayers were both so heard, as to be granted. Which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would often mention with much joy, <hi>and pray that he might never live to occasion any sorrow to so good &amp; Mother, whom he would often say, he loved so dearly, that he would endeavor to be good, even as much for her sake, as for his own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as he was perfectly recovered from this Sickness, he took a journey from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Exeter,</hi> to satisfie and see his good Mother, being accompanied with a Countreyman and Companion of his own Colledge, and both on foot; which was then either more in fashion, or want of Money, or their Humility made it so: But on foot they went, and took <hi>Salisbury</hi> in their way, purposely to see the good Bishop, who made Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and his Companion dine with him at his own Table; which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> boasted of with much joy and gratitude when he saw his Mother and Friends: And at the Bishops parting with him, the Bishop gave him good Counsel, and his Benediction, but forgot to give him Money; which when the Bishop had considered, he sent a Servant in all hasle to call <hi>Richard</hi> back to him: And at <hi>Richards</hi> return, the Bishop said to him, <hi>Richard, I sent for you back to lend you a Horse which hath carried me many &amp; mile, and I thank God with much ease.</hi> And presently deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his hand a Walking-staff, with which he professed he had travelled through many parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> And he said, <hi>Richard, I do not give, but lend you my Horse; be sure you be honest, and bring my Horse back to me at your return this way to</hi> Oxford. <hi>And I do now give you Ten Groats to bear your charges to</hi> Exeter; <hi>and here is Ten Groats more, which I charge you to deliver to your Mother, and tell her, I send her a Bishops Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with it, and beg the continuance of her Prayers for me. And if you bring my Horse back to me, I will give you Ten Groats more to carry you on foot to the Colledge: And so God bless you, good Richard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this, you may believe, was performed by both parties. But alas! the next news that followed Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to <hi>Oxford</hi> was, That his Learned and Charitable Patron had changed this for a better life. Which may be believed, for that as he lived, so he died, in devout Meditation and Prayer; and in both so zealously, that it became a Religious question, <hi>Whether his last Ejaculations, or his Soul, did first enter into Heaven?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> became a Man of Sorrow and Fear: Of sorrow, for the loss of so dear and comfortable a Patron; and of Fear, for his future subsistence. But Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> raised his spirits from this dejection, by bidding him go cheerfully to his Studies, and assuring him he should neither want Food not Rayment, (which was the utmost of his hopes) for he would become his Patron.</p>
                     <p>And so he was for about Nine Moneths, or not much longer; for about that time this following accident did befal Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> (then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and after Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>) had also been in the days of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> forced, by forsaking this, to seek safety in another Nation; where for many years, Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> and he were Companions at Bed and Board in <hi>Germany</hi>; and, where in this their Exile, they did often eat the Bread of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and by that means they there began such a friendship, as time did not blot out, but lasted till the death of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> which was One thousand five hundred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66185:10"/>
and one. A little before which time the two Bishops meeting, <hi>Iewel</hi> began a story of his <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> and in it gave such a Character of his Learning and Manners, that though Bishop <hi>Sandys</hi> was educated in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, and had many Friends: Yet his resolution was, that his Son <hi>Edwin</hi> should be sent to <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and by all means be Pupil to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> though his Son <hi>Edwin</hi> was then almost of the same age: For the Bishop said, <hi>I will have a Tutor for my Son, that shall teach him Learning by Instruction, and Vertue by Example; and my greatest care shall be of the last, and (God willing) this</hi> Richard Hooker <hi>shall be the Man, into whose hands I will commit my</hi> Edwin. And the Bishop did so about Twelve Moneths after this resolution.</p>
                     <p>And doubtless, as to these two, a better choice could not be made: For, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was now in the Nineteenth year of his age; had spent five in the University, and had by a constant unwearied diligence, attained unto a Perfection in all the Learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: By the help of which, as excellent Tutor, and his unintermitted Study, he had made the subtilty of all the Arts easie and familiar to himself, and useful for the discovery of such Learning as lay hid from common Searchers. So that by these added to his great Reason, and his Industry added to both, <hi>He did not onely know more of Causes and Effects; but what he knew, he knew better then other men.</hi> And with this Knowledge he had a most blessed and clear Method of Demonstrating what he knew, to the great advantage of all his Pupils, (which in time were many) but especially to his two first, his dear <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> and his as dear <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> of which there will be a fair Testimony in the ensuing Relation.</p>
                     <p>This for his Learning. And for his Behavior, amongst other Testimonies, this still remains of him, That in four years he was but twice absent from the Chappel prayers; and that his Behavior there was such as shewed an awful reverence of that God which he then worshipped and prayed to; giving all outward Testimonies that his Affections were set on Heavenly things. This was his Behavior towards God; and for that to Man, it is observable, That he was never known to be angry, or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate, or extream in any of his desires; never heard to repine or dispute with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but by a quiet gentle submission and resignation of his will to the Wisdom of his Creator bore the burthen of the day with patience; never heard to utter to an uncomly word: And by this and a grave Behavior, which is a Divine Charm, hebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got an early Reverence unto his Person, even from those that at other rimes, and in other companies, took a liberty to cast off that strictness of Behavior and Discourse that is required in a Collegiate Life. And when he took any liberty to be pleasant, his Wit was never blemished with scoffing, or the utterance of any conceit that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon, or might beget a thought of loosness in his hearers. Thus innocent and exemplary was his Behavior in his Colledge; and thus this good man continued till his Death; still increasing in <hi>Learning,</hi> in <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Nineteenth year of his Age, he was chosen, <hi>December</hi> 24. 1573. to be one of the Twenty Scholars of the <hi>Foundation</hi>; being elected and admitted as born in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> (out of which County a certain number are to be elected in Vacancies by the Founders Statutes.) and now he was much encouraged; for now he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly incorporated into this beloved Colledge, which was then noted for an eminent Library, strict Students, and remarkable Schollars. And indeed it may glory, that it had Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> Doctor <hi>Iohn Reynolds,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Thomas Iackson,</hi> of that <hi>Foundation.</hi> The first, famous by his Learned Apology for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and his Defence of it against <hi>Harding.</hi> The second, for the learned and wise Menage of a publick Dispute with <hi>Iohn Hart,</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> perswasion, about the Head and Faith of the Church, then Printed by consent of both parties. And the third, for his most excellent Exposition of the Creed, and for his other Treatises; all such as have given greatest satisfaction to men of the greatest Learning. Nor was this man more eminent for his Learning, then for his strict and pious Life, testified by his abundant Love and Charity to all Men.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1576. <hi>February</hi> 23. Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Grace was given him for <hi>Inceptor</hi> of Arts; Doctor <hi>Herbert Westphaling,</hi> a Man of noted Learning, being then Vice-Chancellor, and the Act following he was compleated Master, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. His Patron Doctor <hi>Cole</hi> being that year Vice-Chancellor, and his dear Friend
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66185:11"/>
                        <hi>Henry Savil</hi> of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, then one of the Proctors. It was that <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> that was after Sir <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> Warden of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, and Provost of <hi>Eaton:</hi> He which founded in <hi>Oxford</hi> two famous Lectures, and endowed them with liberal maintenance. It was that Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> that translated and enlightned the History of <hi>Cornelim Tacitus,</hi> with a most excellent Comment; and, enriched the World by his laborious and chargeable collecting the scattered pieces of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and the Publication of them in one entire Body in <hi>Greek</hi>; in which Language he was a most judicious Critick. It was this Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> that had the happiness to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, and a most familiar Friend to our <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> and let Posterity know it.</p>
                     <p>And in this year of 1577. he was chosen Fellow of the Colledge: Happy also in being the Contemporary and Friend of Dr. <hi>Iohn Reynolds,</hi> of whom I have lately spoken, and of Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>; both which were after, and successively, made Presidents of his Colledge: Men of great Learning and Merit, and famous in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Nor was Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> more happy in his Contemporaries of his Time and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then in the Pupillage and Friendship of his <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> and <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> of whom my Reader may note, That this <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> was after Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys.</hi> and as famous for his <hi>Speculum Europe,</hi> as his Brother <hi>George</hi> for making Posterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to his Pen by a Learned Relation and Comment on his dangerous and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Travels</hi>; and for his harmonious Translation of the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> the Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> and other Poetical parts of Holy Writ, into most high and elegant Verse. And for <hi>Cranmer,</hi> his other Pupil, I shall refer my Reader to the Printed Testimonies of our Learned Master <hi>Cambden,</hi> the Lord <hi>Tottenes, Fines, Morison,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> Cranmer, <hi>whose Christen name was</hi> George, <hi>was a Gentleman of singular hopes, the eldest Son of</hi> Thomas Cranmer, <hi>Son of</hi> Edward Cranmer, <hi>the Archbishops Brother: He spent much of his Youth in</hi> Corpus-Christi <hi>Colledge in</hi> Oxford, <hi>where he continued Master of Arts for many years before he removed, and then betook himself to Travel, accompanying that worthy Gentleman Sir</hi> Edwin Sandys <hi>into</hi> France, Germany, <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>for the space of three years; and, after their happy return, he betook himself to an imployment under Secretary</hi> Davison: <hi>After whose fall, he wen: in place of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary with Sir</hi> Henry Killigrew <hi>in his Embassage into</hi> France; <hi>and after his death, he was sought after by the most Noble Lord</hi> Mount-Joy, <hi>with whom he went into</hi> Ireland, <hi>where he remained, until in a Battel against the Rebels near</hi> Carlingford, <hi>an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wound put an end both to his life, and the great hopes that were conceived of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Betwixt Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and these his two Pupils, there was a Sacred Friendship; a Friendship made up of Religious Principles, which increased daily by a similitude of Inclinations to the same Recreations and Studies; a Friendship elemented in Youth, and in an University, free from self-ends, which the Friendships of Age, usually are not. In this sweet, this blessed, this Spiritual Amity they went on for many years: And, as the Holy Prophet saith, so <hi>they took sweet counsel together, and walked in the House of God as Friends.</hi> By which means they improved it to such a degree of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as bordered upon Heaven; a Friendship so sacred, that when it ended in this World, it began in the next, where it shall have no end.</p>
                     <p>And, though this World cannot give any degree of pleasure equal to such a Friendship; yet obedience to Parents, and a desire to know the Affairs, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Laws, and Learning of other Nations, that they might thereby become the more serviceable unto their own, made them put off their Gowns and leave Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to his Colledge: Where he was daily more assiduous in his Studies, still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching his quiet and capacious Soul with the precious Learning of the Philosophers, Casuists, and Schoolmen; and with them the Foundation and Reason of all Laws, both Sacred and Civil; and with such other Learning as lay most remote from the Track of Common Studies. And as he was diligent in these; so, he seemed restless in searching the scope and intention of Gods Spirit revealed to mankinde in the Sacred Scripture: For the Understanding of which, he seemed to be assisted by the same Spirit with which they were written: He that regardeth truth in the inward parts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66185:11"/>
making him to understand Wisdom secretly. And the good man would often say, <hi>The Scripture was not writ to beget Pride and Disputations, and Opposition to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but Moderation, and Charity, and Humility, and Obedience, and Peace, and Piety in Mankinde; of which, no good man did ever repent himself upon his Death-bed.</hi> And that this was really his Judgment, did appear in his future Writings, and in all the Actions of his Life. Nor was this excellent man a stranger to the more light and aery parts of Learning, as Musick and Poetry; all which he had digested, and made useful: And of all which, the Reader will have a fair Testimony in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>Thus he continued his Studies in all quietness for the space of Three or more years; about which time he entered into Sacred Orders, and was made both Deacon and Priest; and not long after, in obedience to the Colledge Statutes, he was to Preach either at St. <hi>Peters, Oxford,</hi> or at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, <hi>London,</hi> and the last fell to his Allotment.</p>
                     <p>In order to which Sermon, to <hi>London</hi> he came, and immediately to the <hi>Shunamites</hi> House; which is a House so called, for that: Besides the stipend paid the Preacher, there is Provision made also for his Lodging and Diet two days before, and one day after his Sermon. This House was then kept by <hi>Iohn Churchman,</hi> sometimes a Draper of good note in <hi>Watling street,</hi> upon whom, after many years of Plenty, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty had at last come like an armed man, and brought him into a necessitous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Which, though it be a Punishment, is not always an Argument of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favor, for he was a vertuous man: I shall not yet give the like testimony of his Wife, but leave the Reader to judge by what follows. But to this House Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> came so wet, so weary, and weather-beaten, That he was never known to express more Passion, then against a Friend that disswaded him from Footing it to <hi>London,</hi> and for hiring him no easier an Horse, (supposing the Horse trotted when he did not;) and at this time also, such a faintness and fear possest him, that he would not be perswaded two days quietness, or any other means could be used to make him able to Preach his Sundays S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rmon; but a warm Bed, and Rest, and Drink proper for a Cold given him by Mistress <hi>Churchman,</hi> and her diligent attendance added unto it, enabled him to perform the Office of the day, which was in or about the year One thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty and one.</p>
                     <p>And in this first publick appearance to the World, he was not so happy as to be free from Exceptions against a point of Doctrine delivered in his Sermon, which was, <hi>That in God there were two Wills; an Antecedent, and a Consequent Will: His first Will, That all mankinde should be saved; but his second Will was, That those onely should be saved, that did live answerable to that degree of Grace which he had offered or afforded them.</hi> This seemed to cross a late opinion of Mr.: <hi>alvins,</hi> and then taken for granted by many that had not a capacity to examine it, as it had been by him, and hath been since by Dr. <hi>Iackson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and others of great Learning, who believe that a contrary opinion trenches upon the Honor and Justice of our Merciful God. How he justified this, I will not undertake to declare; but it was not excepted against (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> declares in an Occasional Answer to Mr. <hi>Travers</hi>) by <hi>Iohn Elmer,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; at this time one of his Auditors, and at last one of his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates too, when Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was accused for it.</p>
                     <p>But the justifying of this Doctrine did not prove of so bad consequence, as the kindness of Mistress <hi>Churchmans</hi> curing him of his late distemper and cold; for that was so gratefully apprehended by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> that he thought himself bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to belive all that she said: So that the good man came to be perswaded by her, <hi>That he was a man of a tender constitution</hi>; and, <hi>that it was best for him to have a Wife, that might prove a Nurse to him; such an one as might both prolong his life, and make it more comfortable; and such a one, she could and would provide for him, if he thought fit to marry.</hi> And he not considering, that <hi>the Children of this World are wiser in their Generation then the Children of Light:</hi> But, like a true <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> fearing no guile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he meant none; did give her such a power as <hi>Eleazar</hi> was trusted with, when he was sent to chuse a wife for <hi>Isaac</hi>; for even so he trusted her to chuse for him: Promising upon a fair Summons to return to <hi>London,</hi> and accept of her choice; and he did so in that, or the year following. Now, the Wife provided for him was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66185:12"/>
her Daughter <hi>Ioan,</hi> who brought him neither Beauty nor Portion; and, for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they were too like that Wife's, which is by <hi>Solomon</hi> compared to a Dripping House: So that he had no reason to <hi>rejoyce in the Wife of his Youth,</hi> but rather to say with the Holy Prophet, <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>This choice of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> (if it were his choice) may be wondered at; but let us consider that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> says, <hi>There is a Wheel within a Wheel;</hi> a secret Sacred Wheel of Providence (especially in Marriages) guided by his hand that <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not the Race to the swift,</hi> nor <hi>Bread to the wise,</hi> not good Wives to good Men: And he that can bring good out of evil, (for Mortals are blinde to such Reasons) onely knows why this Blessing was denied to patient <hi>Iob,</hi> and (as some think) to meek <hi>Moses,</hi> and to our as meek and patient Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> But so it was; and let the Reader cease to wonder, for <hi>Affliction is a Divine Diet</hi>; which though it be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to mankinde, yet Almighty God hath often, very often, imposed it as good, though bitter Physick to those Children whose Souls are dearest to him.</p>
                     <p>And by this means the good man was drawn from the tranquillity of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: From that Garden of Piety, of Pleasure, of Peace, and a sweet Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, into the Thorny Wilderness of a busie World; into those corroding cares that attend a Married Priest, and a Countrey-Parsonage; which was <hi>Draiton Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> (not far from <hi>Alesbury,</hi> and in the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln</hi>;) to which he was presented by <hi>Iohn Cheny</hi> Esquire (then Patron of it) the Nineth of <hi>December,</hi> 1584. where he behaved himself so, as to give no occasion of evil, but (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth a Minister of God) <hi>in much patience, in afflictions, in anguishes, in necessities, in poverty, and no doubt in long-suffering;</hi> yet troubling no man with his discontents and wants.</p>
                     <p>And in this condition he continued about a year; in which time his two Pupils, <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> and <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> were returned from Travel, and took a journey to <hi>Draiton</hi> to see their Tutor; where they found him with a Book in his hand (it was the <hi>Odes of Horace</hi>) he being then tending his small allotment of Sheep in a common Field; which he told his Pupils he was forced to do, for that his Servant was then gone home to Dine, and assist his Wife to do some necessary houshould business. When his Servant returned and released him, his two Pupils attended him unto his House, where their best entertainment was his quiet company, which was presently denied them, for, <hi>Richard</hi> was called to rock the Cradle; and the rest of their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was so like this, that they staid but till next morning, which was time enough to discover and pitty their Tutors condition: And having in that time remembred and paraphrased on many of the innocent Recreations of their younger days, and by other such like diversions, given him as much present pleasure as their acceptable company and discourse could afford him, they were forced to leave him to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his Wife, and seek themselves a quieter Lodging. But at their parting from him, Mr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> said, <hi>Good Tutor, I am sorry your lot is faln in no better Ground, as to your Parsonage: And more sorry your Wife proves not a more comfortable Companion after you have wearied your thoughts in your restless Studies.</hi> To whom the good man replied, <hi>My dear</hi> George, <hi>if Saints have usually a double share in the miseries of this life, I that am none, ought not to repine at what my Wise Creator hath appointed for me; but labor, as indeed I do daily, to submit to his Will, and possess my Soul in Patience and Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At their return to <hi>London, Edwin Sandys</hi> acquaints his Father, then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and after Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> with his Tutors sad condition, and sollicites for his removal to some Benefice that might give him a more comfortable subsistence: Which his Father did most willingly grant him, when it should next fall into his power. And not long after this time, which was in the year One thousand five hundred eighty and five, Mr. <hi>Alvy</hi> (Master of the <hi>Temple</hi>) died, who was <hi>a man of a strict Life, of great Learning, and of so venerable Behavior, as to gain such a degree of love and reverence from all men that knew him, that he was generally known by the name of</hi> Father Alvy. At the <hi>Temple</hi> Reading, next after the death of this <hi>Father Alvy,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>York</hi> being then at Dinner with the Judges; the Reader and Benchers of that Society, he met there with a Condolement for the Death of <hi>Father Alvy,</hi> an

high commendation of his Saint-like Life, and of his great Merit both to God and Man: and as they bewail'd his Death, so they wisht for a like Pattern of Virtue and Learning to succeed him. And here came in a fair occasion for the Bishop to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to <hi>Father Alvies</hi> Place, which he did with so effectual an earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that seconded with so many other Testimonies of his worth, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was sent for from <hi>Draiton Beauchamp</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and there the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Temple proposed unto him by the Bishop, as a greater freedom from his Country Cares, the advantage of a better Society, and a more liberal Pension than his Parsonage did afford him. But these Reasons were not powerful enough to incline him to a willing acceptance of it: his wish was rather to gain a better Country Living, where he might <hi>be free from Noise,</hi> (so he exprest the desire of his Heart) and eat that bread which he might more properly call his own, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy and quietness.

                     <p>And here I shall make a stop; and, that the Reader may the better judge of what follows, give him a Character of the Times, and Temper of the people of this Nation, when Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> had his Admission into this Place. A Place which he accepted, rather than desired; and yet here he promised himself a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quietness: that blessed Tranquillity which he always prayed and laboured for; that so he might in Peace bring forth the Fruits of Peace, and glorifie God by uninterrupted Prayers and praises: for this he always thirsted; and yet this was denied him. For his Admission into this Place was the very beginning of those Oppositions and Anxieties, which till then this Good man was a stranger to, and of which the Reader may guess by what follows.</p>
                     <p>In this Character of the Times, I shall, by the Readers favour, and for his information, look so far back as to the beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; a time in which <hi>the many pretended Titles to the Crown, the frequent Treasons, the Doubts of her Successour, the late Civil War, and the sharp Persecution that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the effusion of so much Blood in the Reign of Queen Mary,</hi> were fresh in the memory of all men; and these begot fears in the most Pious and Wisest of this Nation, least the like days should return again to them or their present Posterity. The apprehension of which Dangers begot an earnest desire of a Settlement in the Church and State; believing there was no other probable way left to make them sit quietly under their own <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Fig-trees,</hi> and enjoy the desired Fruit of their Labours. But <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> begot <hi>Self-ends</hi>; and those begot <hi>Animosities, Envy, Opposition,</hi> and <hi>Unthankfulness</hi> for those blessings for which they lately thirsted: being then the very utmost of their Desires, and even beyond their Hopes.</p>
                     <p>This was the temper of the Times in the beginning of her Reign; and thus it continued too long: For those very people that had enjoyed the desires of their hearts in a Reformation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> became at last so like the Grave, as never to be satisfied; but were still thirsting for more and more: neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to pay that Obedience to Government, and perform those Vows to God, which they made in their days of Adversities and Fear: so that in short time theree appeared thre several Interests, each of them fearless and restless in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of their Designs; they may for distinction be called, The <hi>active Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> The <hi>restless Non-conformists</hi> (of which there were many sorts) and The passive <hi>peaceable Protestant,</hi> The Counsels of the first considered and resolved on in <hi>Rome</hi>: the second in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and in divers selected, secret, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conventicles, both there, and within the bosom of our own Nation: the third pleaded and defended their Cause by Establisht Laws, both Ecclesiastical and Civil; and if they were active, it was to prevent the other two from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying what was by those known Laws happily establisht to them and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
                     <p>I shall forbear to mention the very many and as Dangerous Plots of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists against the Church and State: because, what is principally intended in this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66185:13"/>
Digression, is an account of the Opinions and Activity of the Non-conformists; against whose judgement and practice, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> became at last, but most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, to be ingaged in a Book-war; a War which he maintained not as against an Enemy, but with the spirit of Meekness and Reason.</p>
                     <p>In which number of Non-conformists, though some might be sincere and well-meaning men, whose indiscreet zeal might be so like Charity, as thereby to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a multitude of Errors, yet of this Party there were many that were possest with an high degree of Spiritual wickedness; I mean with an innate restles radical Pride and Malice; I mean not those lesser sins that are more visible and more properly Carnal, and sins against a mans self, as Gluttony, and Drunkenness, and the like, (from which good Lord deliver us;) but sins of an higher nature; because more unlike to the nature of God, which is <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi>; and more like the Devil: (who is not a glutton nor can be drunk; and yet, is a Devil:) those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses of Malice, and Revenge, and Opposition, and a Complacence in working and beholding Confusion) which are more properly his work, who is the Enemy and disturber of mankind, and greater sins, though many will not believe it) Men whom a furious Zeal and Prejudice had blinded, and made incapable of hearing Reason, or adhearing to the ways of Peace; Men whom Pride and Self-conceit had made to overvalue their own Wisdom, and become pertinacious, and to hold foolish and unmannerly disputes against those Men which they ought to Reverence, and those Laws which they ought to obey; Men that laboured and joyed to <hi>speak evil of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and then to be the Authors of Confusion (of Confusion as it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion:) whom Company, and Conversation, and Custom had blinded, and made insensible that these were Errours: and at last became so restless, and so hardened in their opinions, that like those which perisht in the gain-saying of <hi>Core,</hi> so these dyed without repenting these spiritual wickednesses, of which <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Hacket,</hi> and their adherents are too sad testimonies.</p>
                     <p>And in these times which tended thus to Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fusion, there were also many others that pretended a Tenderness of Conscience, refusing to submit to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or to take an Oath before a lawful Magistrate: and yet these very M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n did in their secret Conventicles, Covenant and Swear to each other, to be assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faithful in using their best endeavours to set up a Church Government that they had not agreed on. To which end, there was many Select parties that wandered up and down, and were active in sowing Discontents and Sedition, by venemous and secret Murmurings, and a Dispersion of scurrilous Pamphlets and Libels against the Church and State; but especially against the Bishops: by which means, together with very bold, and as indiscreet Sermons, the Common people became so Phanatick, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> observed, there were in his time, <hi>some that wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scripture to their own destruction:</hi> so by these men, and this means many came to believe <hi>the Bishops to be Antichrist,</hi> and the onely Obstructers of Gods Discipline; and many of them were at last given over to such desperate delusions, as to find out a Text in the <hi>Revelation of</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that <hi>Antichrist was to be overcome by the sword,</hi> which they were very ready to take into their hands. So that those very men, that began with tender <hi>meek Petitions,</hi> proceeded to print publick <hi>Admonitions</hi>; and then to <hi>Satyrical Remonstrances</hi>; and at last, (having like <hi>David</hi> numbred who was not, and who was, for their Cause,) they got a supposed Certainty of so great a Party, that they durst threaten <hi>first the Bishops,</hi> and not long after, both <hi>the Queen and Parliament</hi>; to all which they were secretly encouraged by the <hi>Earl of Leicester,</hi> then in great favour with her Majestie, and the reputed Cherisher and Patron-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of these Pretenders to Tenderness of Conscience; whom he used as a sacreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous snare to further his Design, which was by their means to bring such an <hi>odium</hi> upon the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as to procure an Alienation of their Lands, and a large proportion of them for himself: which Avaritious desire had at last so blinded his Reason, that his ambitious and greedy Hopes had almost flattered him into present possession of <hi>Lambeth-house.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to thse strange and dangerous Undertakings, the Non-conformists of this Nation were much encouraged and heightened by a Correspondence and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with that Brotherhood in <hi>Scotland</hi>; so that here they became so bold, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66185:13"/>
one told the Queen openly in a<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dering.</hi>
                        </note> Sermon, <hi>She was like an untamed Heyfer, that would not be ruled by Gods people, but obstructed his Discipline.</hi> And in <hi>Scotland</hi> they were more confident, for there <note n="†" place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Spotswoods</hi> History of the Church of Scotland.</note> they declared Her an Atheist, and grew to such an height, as not to be accountable for any thing spoken against Her; <hi>No nor for Treason against their own King, if spoken in the Pulpit:</hi> Shewing at last such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience even to Him, that His Mother being in <hi>England,</hi> and then in distress, and in prison, and in danger of Death, the Church denied the King their Prayers for Her; and at another time, when he had appointed a day of Feasting, their Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for a general Fast, in opposition to his Authority.</p>
                     <p>To this height they were grown in both Nations, and by these means there was distill'd into the mindes of the common people such other venemous and turbulent Principles, as were inconsistent with the safety of the Church and State: And these, vented so daringly, that beside the loss of Life and Limbs, the Church and State were both forced to use such other severities as will not admit of an excuse, if it had not been to prevent Confusion, and the perilous consequences of it; which without such prevention, would in short time have brought unavoidable ruine and misery to this numerous Nation.</p>
                     <p>These Errors and Animosities were so remarkable, that they begot wonder in an ingenious <hi>Italian,</hi> who being about this time come newly into this Nation, writ scoffingly to a Friend in his own Countrey; <hi>That the common people of</hi> England <hi>were wiser then the wisest of his Nation; for here the very Women and Shop-keepers were able to judge of Predestination, and determine what Laws were fit to be made concerning Church Government; then, what were fit to be obeyed or abolished. That they were more able (or at least thought so) to raise and determine perplex'd Cases of Conscience, then the most Learned Colledges in</hi> Italy. <hi>That Men of the slightest Learning, and the most ignorant of the common people, were mad for a new, or</hi> Super- <hi>or</hi> Re-Reformation <hi>of Religion; and that in this</hi> they appeared like that man, who would never cease to whet, and whet his Knife, till there was no Steel left to make it useful. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Letter with this observation, <hi>That those very Men that were most busie in Oppositions, and Disputations, and Controversies, and finding out the faults of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, had usually the least of Humility and Mortification, or of the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to heighten all these discontents and dangers, there was also sprung up a Generation of Godless-men; Men that had so long given way to their own Lusts and Delusions; and, had so often, and so highly opposed the Blessed Motions of his Blessed Spirit, and the inward Light of their own Consciences, that they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by sinned themselves to a belief of what they would, but were not able to believe: Into a belief, which is repugnant even to Humane nature (for the Heathens believe there are many gods;) but these had sinned themselves into a belief, that there is no God: And so finding nothing in themselves, but what is worse then nothing, began to wish what they were not able to hope for, <hi>That they should be like the Beasts that perish</hi>; and, in wicked company (which is the Atheists Sanctuary) were so bold as to say so: Though the worst of mankinde, when he is left alone at midnight, may wish, but cannot then think it. Into this wretched, this reprobate condition, many had then sinned themselves.</p>
                     <p>And now! When the Church was pestered with them, and with all these other Irregularities; when her Lands were in danger of Alienation, her Power at least neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and her Peace torn to pieces by several Schisms, and such Heresies as do usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend that sin: When the common people seemed ambitious of doing those very things which were attended with most dangers, that thereby they might be punished, and then applauded and pittied: When they called the Spirit of Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Tender Conscience, and complained of Persecution, because they wanted power to persecute others: When the giddy multitude raged, and became restless to finde out misery for themselves and others; and the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

About which time the Queen made him her Chaplain; and not long after Prebend of <hi>Ely,</hi> and then Dean of <hi>Lincoln</hi>; and having for many years past looked upon him with much reverence and favor, gave him a fair testimony of both, by giving him the Bishoprick of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and (which was not a usual favor) forgiving him his First-fruits; then by constituting him Vice-President of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of <hi>Wales.</hi> And having for several years experimented his Wisdom, his Justice, and Moderation in the menage of Her affairs, in both these places, She in the Twenty sixth of Her Reign, made him Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and not long after, of Her Privy Council; and trusted him to menage all Her Ecclesiastical Affairs and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In all which Removes, he was like the Ark, which left a Blessing upon the place where it rested, and in all his Imployments, was like <hi>Iehoida,</hi> that did good unto <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were the steps of this Bishops Ascension to this place of Dignity and Cares; in which place (to speak Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> very words in his <hi>Annals</hi>) <hi>He devoutly consecrated both his whole life to God, and bit painful labors to the good of his Church.</hi> And yet in this place he met with many oppositions in the regulation of Church Affairs, which were much disordered at his entrance, by reason of the age and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Bishop <hi>Grindal</hi> (his immediate Predecessor) the activity of the Non-conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists, and their cheif assistant, the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>; and indeed, by too many others of the like Sacrilegious Principles. With these he was to encounter; and though he wanted neither courage nor a good cause, yet he foresaw, that without a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Queens favor, it was impossible to stand in the Breach that was made into the Lands and Immunities of the Church, or to maintain the remaining Rights of it. And therefore by justifiable Sacred Insinuations, such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Agrippa, (Agrippa believest thou? I know thou believest)</hi> he wrought himself into so great a degree of favor with Her, as by his pious use of it, hath got both of them a greater degree of Fame in this World, and of Glory in that, into which they are now entred.</p>
                     <p>His merits to the Queen, and Her Favors to him were such, that <hi>she called him Her little black Husband, and called his Servants Her Servants:</hi> And She saw so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and blessed a sincerity shine in all his cares and endeavors for the Churches, and for Her good, that She was supposed to trust him with the very secrets of Her Soul, and to make him Her Confessor: Of which She gave many Fair testimonies; and of which, one was, That <hi>She would never eat flesh in Lent without obtaining a Licence from Her little black Husband:</hi> And would often say, <hi>She pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ed him, because She trusted him, and had eased Her-self by laying the burthen of all Her Clergy-cares upon his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which She was certain he managed with Prudence and Piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall not keep my self within the promised Rules of Brevity in this account of his Interest with Her Majesty, and his care of the Churches Rights, if in this digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I should enlarge to particulars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and therefore my desire is, that one example may serve for a testimony of both. And that the Reader may the better understand it, he may take notice, that not many years before his being made Archbishop, there passed an Act or Acts of Parliament intending the better preservation of Church Lands, by recalling a Power which was vested in others to Sell or Lease them, by lodging and trusting the future care and protection of them onely in the Crown: And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66185:14"/>
amongst many that made a bad use of this Power or Trust of the Queens, the <hi>Earl of Leicester</hi> was one; and the good Bishop having by his Interest with Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty put a stop to the Earls Sacrilegious designs, they two fell to an open Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before her; after which they both quitted the Room, nor Friends in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But the Bishop made a sudden and a seasonable return to Her Majesty, (for he found her alone) and spake to her with great Humility and Reverence, and to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I beseech your Majesty to hear me with patience, and to believe that yours and the Churches Safety are dearer to me than my Life, but my Conscience dearer than both: and therefore give me leave to do my Duty, and tell you that Princes are deputed Nursing Fathers of the Church, and owe it a Protection; and therefore God forbid that you should be so much as Passive in her Ruines, when you may prevent it; or that I should-behold it without horrour and detestation; or should forbear to tell your Majesty of the Sin and Danger. And though you and my self are born in an Age of Frailties, when the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Piety and Care of the Churches Lands and Immunities are much decayed; yes (Madam) let me beg that you will but first consider, and then you will believe there are such sins at Prophaneness and Sacriledge; for if there were not? they could not have Names in Holy Writ: and particularly in the New-Testament. And I beseech you to consider, that though our Saviour said,</hi> He judged no man; <hi>and to testifie it, would not judge nor divide the Inheritance betwixt the two Brethren, nor would judge the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in Adultery; yet, in this point of the Churches Rights, he was so zealous, that he made himself both the Accuser, and the Iudge, and the Executioner to punish these sins; witnessed, in that he himself made the Whip to drive the Prophaners out of the Temple; overthrew the Tables of the Money-changers, and drove them out of it. And consider that it was S.</hi> Paul <hi>that said to those Christians of his time that were offended with Idolatry, yet</hi> Thou that abhorrest Idols, dost thou commit Sacriledge? <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing I think Sacriledge to be the greater sin. This may occasion your Majesty to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there is such a sin as Sacriledge; and to incline you to prevent the Curse that will follow it; I beseech you also, to consider that</hi> Constantine <hi>the first Christian Emperor, and</hi> Helena <hi>his Mother; that King</hi> Edgar, <hi>and</hi> Edward the Confessor, <hi>and indeed many others of your Predecessors, and many private Christians, have also given to God and to his Church, much Land, and many Immunities, which they might have given to those of their own Families, and did not; but gave them as an absolute Right and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God: And with these Immunities and Lands they have entailed a Curse upon the Alienators of them; God prevent your Majesty from being liable to that Curse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And, to make you that are trusted with their Preservation, the better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the danger of it; I beseech you forget not, that, besides these Curses, the Churches Land and Power have been also endeavoured to be preserved, as far as Humane Reason and the Law of this Nation have been able to preserve them, by an immediate and most sacred Obligation on the Consciences of the Princes of this Realm. For they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult</hi> Magna Charta <hi>shall find, that as all your Predecessours were at their Coronation, so you also were sworn before all the Nobility and Bishops then present, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and in his stead to him that anointed you,</hi> to maintain the Church Lands, and the rights belonging to it; <hi>and this testified openly at the holy Altar, by laying your Hands on the Bible then lying upon it. And not only</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>but many Modern Statutes have denounced a Curse upon those that break</hi> Magna Charta. <hi>And now what account can be given for the breach of this Oath at the last Great Day, either by your Majesty, or by me, if it be wilfully, or but negligently violated, I know not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And therefore, good Madam, let not the late Lords Exceptions against the failings of some few Clergie-men, prevail with you to punish Posterity, for the Errors of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age; let particular Men suffer for their particular Errors, but let God and his Church have their right; And though I pretend not to prophesy, yet I big Posterity to take notice of what is already become visible in many Families;</hi> That Church-land added to an ancient Inheritance, hath proved like a Moth fretting a Garment, and secretly consumed both: <hi>Or like the Eagle that stole a Coal from the Altar, and thereby set her Nest on fire, which consumed both her young Eagles, and her self that stole it. And, though I shall forbear to speak reproachfully of your Father: yet, I beg you to take notice, that a part of the Churches Rights, added to the vast Treasure left him by his Father,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66185:15"/>
hath been conceived to bring an unavoidable Consumption upon both, notwithstanding all his diligence to preserve it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And consider, that after the violation of those Laws, to which he had sworn in</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>God did so far deny him his Restraining Grace, that be fell into greater sins then I am willing to mention.</hi> Madam, Religion is the Foundation and Cement of Humane Societies: <hi>And, when they that serve at Gods Altar shall be exposed to Poverty? then Religion it self will be exposed to scorn, and become contemptible; as you may already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in too many poor Vicaridges in this Nation. And therefore, as you are by a late Act or Acts entrusted with a great Power to preserve or waste the Churches Lands; yet, dispose of them for Iesus sake as the Donors intended: Let neither falshood nor flattery beguile you to do otherwise, and put a stop (I beseech you) to the approaching ruines of Gods Church, as you expect comfort at the last great day</hi>; For Kings must be judged. <hi>Pardon this affectionate plainness, my most dear Soveraign, and let me beg to be still continued in your Favor; and the Lord still continue you in his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Queens patient hearing this affectionate Speech; and Her future care to preserve the Churches Rights, which till then had been neglected, may appear a fair Testimony, that he made Hers and the Churches good, the cheifest of his cares, and that She also thought so. And of this, there were such daily Testimonies given, as begot betwixt them so mutual a joy and confidence, that they seemed born to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and do good to each other: She not doubting his Piety to be more then all his opposers, which were many, and those powerful too; nor his Prudence equal to the cheifest of Her Council, who were then as remarkable for active Wisdom, as those dangerous times did require, or this Nation did everenjoy. And in this condition he continued Twenty years; in which time he saw some flowings, but many more ebbings of Her Favor towards all men that opposed him, especially the Earl of <hi>Leicester:</hi> So that God seemed still to keep him in Her Favor, that he might preserve the remaining Church Lands and Immunities from Sacrilegious Alienations. And this good man deserved all the honor and power with which She trusted him; for he was a pious man, and naturally of Noble and Grateful Principles: He eased Her of all Her Church cares by his wise menage of them; he gave Her faithful and prudent Counsels in all the extremities and dangers of Her Temporal Affairs, which were very many; he lived to be the cheif comfort of Her life in Her declining age; to be then most frequently with Her, and Her assistant at Her private Devotions; to be the greatest comfort of Her Soul upon Her Death-bed; to be present at the expiration of Her last breath; and to behold the closing of those eyes that had long looked upon him with reverence and affection. And let this also be added, That he was the chief Mourner at Her sad Funeral; nor let this be forgotten, that within a few hours after Her death, he was the happy Proclaimer that King <hi>Iames</hi> (Her Peaceful Successor) was Heir to the Crown.</p>
                     <p>Let me beg of my Reader, that he allow me to say a little, and but a little more of this good Bishop, and I shall then presently lead him back to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would hasten, I will mention but one part of the Bishops Charity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; but this of both. He built a large Alms-house near to his own Palace at <hi>Croydon</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and endowed it with maintenance for a Master and Twenty eight poor Men and Women; which he visited so often, that he knew their names and dispositions; and was so truly humble, that he called them Brothers and Sisters: And whensoever the Queen descended to that lowliness to dine with him at his Palace in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> (which was very often) he would usually the next day shew the like lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his poor Brothers and Sisters at <hi>Croydon,</hi> and dine with them at his Hospital; at which time, you may believe there was joy at the Table.</p>
                     <p>And at this place he built also a fair Free-School, with a good accommodation and maintenance for the Master and Scholars. Which gave just occasion for <hi>Boyse Sisi,</hi> then Ambassador for the <hi>French</hi> King, and Resident here, at the Bishops death, to say, <hi>The Bishop had published many Learned Books, but a Free-School to train up Youth, and an Hospital to lodge and maintain aged and poor People; were the best evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Christian Learning that a Bishop could leave to Posterity.</hi> This good Bishop lived to see King <hi>Iames</hi> settled in Peace, and then fell sick at <hi>Lambeth</hi>; of which, the King having notice, went to visit him, and found him in his Bed in a declining
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66185:15"/>
condition, and very weak; and after some short discourse, the King assured him, <hi>He had a great affection for him, and high value for his Prudence and Vertues, which were so useful for the Church, that he would earnestly beg his life of God.</hi> To which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Pro Ecclesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Dei, Pro Ecclesiâ Dei:</hi> Which were the last words he ever spake; therein testifying, That as in his Life, so at his Death, his chiefest care was of Gods Church.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Iohn Whitgift</hi> was made Archbishop in the Year One thousand five hundred eighty and three. In which busie place, he continued Twenty years and some moneths, and in which time, you may believe he had many Tryals of his Courage and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but his Motto was, <hi>Vincit, qui Patitur:</hi> And he made it good. Many of his many Tryals were occasioned by the then powerful Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who did still (but secretly) raise and cherish a Faction of Non-conformists to oppose him; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially one <hi>Thomas Cartwright,</hi> a Man of noted Learning; sometime Contemporary with the Bishop in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and of the same Colledge, of which the Bishop had been Master: In which place there began some Emulations, (the particulars I forbear) and at last open and high oppositions betwixt them; and, in which you may believe Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was most faulty, if his Expulsion out of the University can incline you to it.</p>
                     <p>And in this discontent, after the Earls death (which was One thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty and eight) Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> appeared a cheif Cherisher of a Party that were for the <hi>Geneva</hi> Church-Government; and to effect it, he ran himself into many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, both of Liberty and Life; appearing at last to justifie himself and his Party in many Remonstrances, which he caused to be Printed; and to which, the Bishop made a first Answer, and <hi>Cartwright</hi> Replied upon him; and then the Bishop having rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Reply, Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> either was, or was perswaded to be satisfied; for, he wrote no more, but left the Reader to be judge which had maintained their Cause with most Charity and Reason.</p>
                     <p>After some silence, Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> received from the Bishop many Personal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, and retired himself to a more Private Living, which was at <hi>Warwick,</hi> where he was made Master of an Hospital, and lived quietly, and grew rich; and, where the Bishop gave him a Licence to Preach, upon promise not to meddle with Controversies, but incline his hearers to Piety and Moderation: And this promise he kept during his life, which ended One thousand six hundred and two, the Bishop surviving him but one year, each ending his days in perfect charity with the other.</p>
                     <p>And now after this long digression made for the information of my Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what follows, I bring him back to venerable Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> where we left him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and where we shall finde him as deeply engaged in a Controversie with <hi>Walter Travers,</hi> a Friend and Favorite of Mr. <hi>Cartwrights,</hi> as the Bishop had ever been with Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> himself; and of which, I shall proceed to give this following account.</p>
                     <p>And first this; That though the Pens of Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the Bishop were now at rest, yet there was sprung up a new Generation of restless Men, that by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Clamors became possest of a Faith which they ought to have kept to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but could not: Men that were become positive in asserting, <hi>That a Papist can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved:</hi> Insomuch, that about this time, at the Execution of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Bishop that Preached Her Funeral Sermon (which was Dr. <hi>Howland,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Peterborough)</hi> was reviled for not being positive for Her Damnation. And beside this boldness of their becoming Gods, so far as to set limits to his Mercies; there was not onely <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate,</hi> but other venemous Books daily Printed and dispersed: Books that were so absurd and scurrilous, that the Graver Divines dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them an Answer. And yet these were grown into high esteem with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, till <hi>Tom Nash</hi> appeared against them all, who was a man of a sharp wit, and the master of a scoffing Satyrical merry Pen, which he imployed to discover the absurdities of those blinde malicious sensless Pamphlets, and Sermons as sensless as they. <hi>Nash</hi> his Answers being like his Books, which bore these Titles, <hi>An Almond for Parro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. A Fig for my God-son. Come crack me this Nut,</hi> and the like: So that his merry Wit made such a discovery of their absurdities, as (which is strange) he put a greater stop to these malicious Pamphlets, then a much wiser-man had been able.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:66185:16"/>And now the Reader is to take notice, That at the Death of Father <hi>Alay,</hi> who was Master of the <hi>Temple,</hi> this <hi>Walter Travers</hi> was Lecturer there for the Evening Sermons, which he Preached with great approbation, especially of the younger Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Society; and for the most part approved by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himself, in the midst of their oppositions. For he continued Lecturer a part of his time; Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> being indeed a Man of competent Learning, of a winning Behavior, and of a blameless Life. But he had taken Orders by the Presbytery in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and if in any thing he was transported, it was in an extream desire to set up that Government in this Nation: For the promoting of which, he had a correspondence with <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and others in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and was one of the cheifest assistants to Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in that design.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> had also a particular hope to set up this Government in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to that end, used his endeavors to be Master of it; and his being disappointed by Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> admittance, proved some occasion of opposition betwixt them in their Sermons. Many of which were concerning the Doctrine, Discipline, and Ceremonies of this Church; insomuch, that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> withstood St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his face, so did they. For as one hath pleasantly exprest it, <hi>The Forenoon Sermon spake</hi> Canterbury; <hi>and the Afternoons,</hi> Geneva.</p>
                     <p>In these Sermons there was little of Bitterness, but each party brought all the Reasons he was able, to prove his Adversaries Opinion erroneous. And thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time, till the oppositions became so high, and the consequences so dangerous, especially in that place, That the prudent Archbishop put a stop to Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> his Preaching, by a positive Prohibition; against which Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed and petitioned Her Majesty and Her Privy Council to have it recalled, where he met with many assisting powerful Friends; but they were not able to prevail with or against the Archbishop, whom the Queen had intrusted with all Church Power; and he had received so fair a Testimony of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Principles and of his Learning and Moderation, that he withstood all Sollicitations. But the denying this Petition of Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> was unpleasant to divers of his party, and the reasonableness of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at last to be so magnified by them and many others, as never to be answered: So that intending the Bishops and Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> disgrace, they procured it to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Printed and scattered abroad; and then Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was forced to appear as publickly, and Print an Answer to it, which he did, and dedicated it to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop; and it proved so full an Answer, to have in it so much of clear Reason, and writ with so much Meekness and Majesty of style, that the Bishop began to wonder at the Man, to rejoyce that he had appeared in his Cause, and disdained not earnestly to beg his Friendship; even a familiar Friendship with a Man of so much quiet Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Humility.</p>
                     <p>To enumerate the many particular Points, in which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> dissented (all or most of which I have seen written) would prove at least tedious; and therefore I shall impose upon my Reason no more then two, which shall immediately follow; and by which, he may judge of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> excepted against Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> for that in one of his Sermons be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That the assurance of what we believe by the Word of God, is not to us so certain as that which we perceive by Sense.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> confesseth he said so, and endeavors to justifie it by the Reasons following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, I taught, That the things which God promises in his Word, are surer to us then what we touch, handle, or see: But are we so sure and certain of them? If we be, Why doth God so often prove his Promises to us as he doth, by Arguments drawn from our sensible experience?</hi> For we must be surer of the proof, then of the things proved; otherwise it is no proof. <hi>For example, How is it that many men looking on the Moon at the sametime, every one knoweth it to be the Moon as certainly as the other doth? But many believing one and the same Promise, have not all one and the same fulness of Perswas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For how falleth it out, that men being assured of any thing by Sense, can be no surer of it then they are; when at the strongest in Faith that liveth upon the Earth, hath always need to labor, strive, and pray, that his assurance concerning Heavenly and Spiritual things, may grow, increase, and be augmented?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:66185:16"/>The Sermon that gave him the cause of this his Justification, makes the case more plain, by declaring, <hi>That there is besides this certainly of Evidence, a certainty of Adherence.</hi> In which, having most excellently demonstrated what the <hi>Certainty of Adherence</hi> is, he makes this comfortable use of it: <hi>Comfortable</hi> (he says) <hi>as to weak Believers, who suppose themselves to be faithless, not to believe, when notwithstanding they have their Adherence; the Holy Spirit hath his private operations, and worketh se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in them, and effectually too, though they want the inward Testimony of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tell this to a Man that hath a minde too much dejected by a sad sense of his sin; to one that by a too severe judging of himself, concludes that he wants Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wants the comfortable Assurance of it; and his Answer will be, <hi>Do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me against my knowledge, against what I finde and feel in my self: I do not, I know I do not believe.</hi> (Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> own words follow) <hi>Well then, to favor such men a little in their weakness, let that be granted which they do imagine; be it, that they adhere not to Gods promises, but are faithless, and without belief: But are they not grieved for their unbelief? They confess they are; Do they not wish it might, and also strive that it may be otherways? We know they do. Whence cometh this, but from a secret love and liking, that they have of those things believed? For,</hi> no man can love those things which in his own opinion are not; <hi>And, if they think those things to be, which they shew they love, when they desire to believe them; then must it be, that by desiring to believe, they prove themselves true Believers: For,</hi> without Faith no man thinketh that things believed are: <hi>Which Argument all the Subtilties of Infernal Powers will never be able to dissolve.</hi> This is an Abridgment of part of the Reasons he gives for his Justification of this his opinion, for which he was excepted against by Mr. <hi>Travers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was also accused by Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> for that he in one of his Sermons had declared, <hi>That he doubted not but that God was merciful to save many of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers living heretofore in Popish Superstition, for as much as they sinned ignorantly:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Answer professeth it to be his judgment, and declares his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for this charitable opinion to be as followeth.</p>
                     <p>But first he states the Question about <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> and how the <hi>Foundation of Faith is overthrown</hi>; and then he proceeds to discover that way which <hi>Natural Men</hi> and some others have mistaken to be the way by which they hope to attain true and everlasting Happiness: And having discovered the mistaken, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to direct to that true way, by which, and no other, Everlasting Life and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is attainable. And, these two ways he demonstrates thus, (they be his own words that follow) <hi>That, the way of Nature; This, the way of Grace; the end of that way, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation merited, presupposing the Righteousness of Mens works: Their Righteousness, a natural ability to do them; that ability, the goodness of God which created them in such perfection. But the end of this way, Salvation bestowed upon men as a gift: Presupposing not their Righteousness, but the forgiveness of their Unrighteousness, Iustification; their Iustification, not their natural ability to do good, but their hearty sorrow for not doing; and unfeigned belief in him, for whose sake not doers are accepted,</hi> which is their <hi>Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their Vocation, the Election of God, taking them out of the number of lost Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; their Election, a Mediator in whom to be elect: This Mediation inexplicable Mercy, this Mercy, supposing their misery for whom be vouchsafed to die, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Mediator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he also declareth, <hi>There is no meritorious cause for our Iustification, but Christ; no effectual, but his Mercy</hi>; and says also, <hi>We deny the Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, we abuse, disannul, and annihilate the benefit of his Passion, if by a proud imagination we believe we can merit everlasting life, or can be worthy of it.</hi> This Belief (he declareth) is to destroy the very Essence of our Justification, and he makes all opinions that border upon this, to be very dangerous. <hi>Tet nevertheless,</hi> (and for this he was accused) <hi>considering how many vertuous and just Men, how many Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have had their dangerous opinions, amongst which this was one, That they hoped to make God some part of amends, by voluntary punishments which they laid upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</hi> Because by this, or the like erroneous opinions which do by consequene overthrow the Merits of Christ, shall Man be so bold as to write on their Graves, <hi>Such men are damned, there is for them no Salvation!</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, <hi>Errare possum, Hareticus esse nolo,</hi> And except we put a difference betwixt them that erre ignorantly,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66185:17"/>
and them that obstinately persist in it, how is it possible that any Man should hope to be saved? Give me a Pope or a Cardinal, whom great afflictions have made to know himself, whose heart God hath touched with true sorrow for all his sins, and filled with a love of Christ and his Gospel; whose Eyes are willingly open to see the Truth, and his Mouth ready to renounce all Error, this one opinion of Merit except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which he thinketh God will require at his hands; and because he wanteth, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, and is discouraged, and yet can say, <hi>Lord, cleanse me from all my secret sins!</hi> Shall I think because of this, or a like Error, such men touch not so much as the Hem of Christs Garment? If they do, wherefore should I doubt, but that Vertue may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Christ to save them? No, I will not be afraid to say to such a one, <hi>You erre in your opinion, but be of good comfort, you have to do with a Merciful God, who will make the best of that little which you hold well, and not with a captions Sophister, who gathereth the worst out of every thing in which you are mistaken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it will be said, <hi>The admittance of Merit in any degree, overthroweth the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, excladeth from the hope of Mercy, from all possibility of Salvation.</hi> (And now Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> own words follow.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What though they hold the truth sincerely in all other parts of Christian Faith? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have in some measure all the Vertues and Graces of the Spirit? Although they have all other Tokens of Gods Children in them? Although they be far from having any proud opinion, that they shall be saved by the worthiness of their Deeds? Although the onely thing that troubleth and molesteth them, be a little too much dejection, somewhat too great a fire arising from an erronious conceit. That God will require a worthiness in them, which they are grieved to finde wanting in themselves? Although they be not obstinate in this Opinion? Although they be willing, and would be glad to forsake it, if any one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were brought sufficient to disprove it? Although the onely cause why they do not forsake it ere they die, be their ignorance of that means by which it might be disproved? Although the cause why the ignorance in this point is not removed, be the want of knowledge in such as should be able, and are not to remove it? Let me die</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>) <hi>if it be ever proved, That simply an Error doth exclude a Pope or Cardinal in such a case utterly from hope of life.</hi> Surely I must confess. That if it be an Error to think that God may be merciful to save men, even when they err; my greatest comfort is, my error: Were it not for the love I bear to this Error, I would never wish to speak or to live.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to take notice of these two points, as supposing them to be very material; and that as they are thus contracted, they may prove useful to my Reader; as also for that the Answers be Arguments of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> great and clear Reason, and equal Charity. Other Exceptions were also made against him, as, <hi>That he prayed before, and not after his Sermons; that in his Prayers be named Bishops, that be kneeled, both when he prayed, and he when he received the Sacrament; and</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Defence) <hi>other Exceptions so like these, as but to name, I should have thought a greater fault then to commit them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And 'tis not unworthy the noting, that in the menage of so great a Controversie, a sharper reproof then this, and one like it, did never fall from the happy Pen of this humble Man. That like it, was upon a like occasion of Exceptious, to which his Answer was, <hi>Your next Argument consists of Railing and of Reasons; to your Railing I say nothing, to your Reasons I say what follows.</hi> And I am glad of this fair occasion, to testifie the Dove-like temper of this meek, this matchless Man; and doubtless, it Almighty God had blest the Dissenters from the Ceremonies and Discipline of this Church, with a like measure of Wisdom and Humility, instead of their pertinacious Zeal, then Obedience and Truth had kissed each other, then Peace and Piety had flourished in our Nation, and this Church and State had been blest like <hi>Ierusalem, that is at unity with it self;</hi> but that can never be expected, till God shall bless the common people with a belief, <hi>That Schism is a sin, and that there may be offences taken which are not given; and that Laws are not made for private men to dispute, but to obey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this also maybe worthy of noting, That these Exceptions of Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> against Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> were the cause of his transcribing several of his Sermons, which we now see Printed with his Books; of his Answer to Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> his Supplication;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66185:17"/>
and of his most learned and useful Discourse of <hi>Iustification,</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi>; and by their Transcription, they fell into the hands of others, that have preserved them from being lost, as too many of his other matchless Writings have been; and from these I have gathered many observations in this Discourse of his Life.</p>
                     <p>After the publication of his Answer to the Petition of Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> grew daily into greater repute with the most Learned and Wise of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it had a contrary effect in very many of the <hi>Temple</hi> that were zealous for Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> and for his Church Discipline; insomuch, that though Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> left the place, yet the Seeds of Discontent could not be rooted out of that Society, by the great Reason, and as great Meekness of this humble Man: For though the Cheif Benchers gave him much Reverence and Incouragement, yet he there met with many neglects and oppositions-by-those of Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> judgment; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it turned to his extream grief: And that he might unbeguile and win them, he designed to write a deliberate sober Treatise of the Churches power to make Cannons for the use of Ceremonies, and by Law to impose an obedience to them, as upon Her Children; and this he proposed to do in <hi>Eight Books of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</hi>; intending therein to shew such Arguments, as should force an assent from all Men, if Reason, delivered in sweet Language, and void of any provocation, were able to do it: And that he might prevent all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, he wrote before it a large <hi>Preface</hi> or <hi>Epistle</hi> to the Dissenting Brethren, wherein there were such Bowels of <hi>Love,</hi> and such a Commixture of that <hi>Love</hi> with <hi>Reason,</hi> as was never exceeded but in Holy Writ; and particularly, by that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to his dear Brother and Fellow-Laborer <hi>Philemon:</hi> Then which, none ever was more like this Epistle of Mr. <hi>Hookers.</hi> So that his dear Friend and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in his Studies, Doctor <hi>Spencer,</hi> might after his Death justly say, <hi>What admirable height of Learning, and depth of Iudgment, dwelt in the lowly minde of this truly humble Man, great in all wise mens eyes except his own: With what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and majesty of Speech his Tongue and Pen uttered Heavenly Mysteries; whose eyes in the Humility of his Heart, were always cast down to the ground: How all things that proceeded from him, were breathed as from the Spirit of Love; as, if he, like the Bird of the Holy Ghost, the Dove, had wanted Gall: Let those that knew him not in his Person, judge by these living Images of his Soul, his Writings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Foundation of these Books was laid in the <hi>Temple</hi>; but he found it no fit place to finish what he had there designed; and therefore solicited the Archbishop for a remove, to whom he spake to this purpose; <hi>My Lord, When I lost the freedom of my Cell, which was my Colledge; yet, I found some degree of it in my quiet Countrey Personage: But I am weary of the noise and oppositions of this place; and indeed, God and Nature did not intend me for Contentions, but for Study and Quietness. And, My Lord, my particular Contests here with Mr.</hi> Travers, <hi>have prov'd the more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to me, because I believe him to be a good Man; and that beliefe hath occasioned me to examine mine own Conscience concerning his opinions; and, to satisfie that, I have consulted the holy Scripture, and other Laws, both Humane and Divine, Whether the the Conscience of him, and others of his Iudgment, ought to be so far complied with us, as to alter our Frame of Church-Government, our manner of Gods worship, our praising and praying to him, and, our establishe Ceremonies, as often as their tender Consciences shall require us. And, in this Examination, I have not onely satisfied my self; but have begun a Treatise, in which I intend the satisfaction of others, by a demonstration of the reasonableness of our Laws of</hi> Ecclesiastical Policy; <hi>and therein laid a hopeful founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Churches Peace; and, so as not to provoke your Adversarie Mr.</hi> Cartwright, <hi>nor Mr.</hi> Travers, <hi>whom I take to be mine (but not my enemy) God knows this to be my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To which end, I have searched many Books, and spent many thoughtful hours; and I hope not in vain; for I write to reasonable men. But, My Lord, I shall never be able to finish what I have begun, unless I be remov'd into some quiet Countrey Parsenage, where I may see Gods Blessings Spring out of my Mother Earth, and eat mine own Bread in peace and privaty. A place where I may without disturbance, Meditate my approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mortality, and that great account, which all flesh must at the great day, give to the God of all Spirits.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66185:18"/>
this is my design; and, as these are the desires of my heart, so they shall by Gods assistance be the constant indevors of the uncertain remainder of my life. And therefore if your Grace can think me and my poor labors, worthy such a favour? Let me beg it, that I may perfect what I have begun: which is a blessing I cannot hope for in this place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the time of this request to the Bishop, the Parsonage or Rectory of <hi>Boscom,</hi> in the Diocess of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and six miles from that City, became void. The Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> is Patron of it, but in the vacancy of that See (which was three years betwixt the death of Bishop <hi>Peirce,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Caldwells</hi> admission into it) the disposal of that and all Benefices belonging to it, during the time of this said vacancy, came to be disposed of by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and he presented <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> to it in the year 1591. And <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> was also in this said year Instituted, (<hi>Iuly</hi> 17.) to be a minor Prebend of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Corps to it being <hi>nether-Havin,</hi> about ten miles from that City; which Prebend was of no great value, but intended chiefly to make him capable of a better preferment in that Church. In this <hi>Boscum</hi> he continued till he had finished four of his eight proposed Books of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, and these were enter'd into the Register Book in Stationers-Hall the 9th of <hi>March</hi> 1592. but not printed till the year 1594. and then with the beforementioned large and affectionate Preface, which he directs <hi>to them that seek (as they term it) the Reformation of the laws and orders Ecclesiastical in the Church of England</hi>; of which Books I shall yet say nothing more, but that he continued his laborious diligence to finish the remaining four during his life (of all which more properly hereafter) but at <hi>Boscum</hi> he finisht and publisht but only the first four, being then in the 39 year of his Age.</p>
                     <p>He left <hi>Boscum</hi> in the year 1595. by a surrender of it into the hands of Bishop <hi>Caldwell,</hi> and he presented <hi>Benjamin Russel,</hi> who was Instituted into it, 23 of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the same year.</p>
                     <p>The Parsonage of <hi>Bishops Borne</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> three miles from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is in that Archbishops gift, but in the latter end of the year 1594. Doctor <hi>William Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Rector of it was made <hi>Bishop of Norwich,</hi> by which means the power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to it was <hi>pro ca vice</hi> in the Queen; and she presented <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> whom she loved well, to this good living of <hi>Borne</hi> the 7 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1595. in which Living he continued till his Death, without any addition of Dignity or Profit.</p>
                     <p>And now having brought our <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> from his Birth-place, to this where he found a Grave, I shall only give some account of his Books, and of his behaviour in this Parsonage of <hi>Borne,</hi> and then give a rest both to my self and my Reader.</p>
                     <p>His first four Books and large Epistle have been declared to be printed at his being at <hi>Boscum, Anno</hi> 1594. Next I am to tell that at the end of these four Books there is printed this Advertisement to the Reader; <hi>I have for some causes thought it at this time more fit to let go these first four Books by themselves, than to stay both them and the rest, till the whole might together be published. Such generalities of the cause in question as are here handled, it will be perhaps not amiss to consider apart, by way of Introduction unto the Books that are to follow concerning particulars; in the mean time the Reader is requested to mend the Printers errors, as noted underneath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I am next to declare that his fifth Book (which is larger than his first four) was first also printed by it self <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. and dedicated to his Patron (for till them he chose none) the Archbishop. These Books were read with an admiration of their excellency in This, and their just same spread it self into forain Nations. And I have been told more than forty years past, that Cardinal <hi>Alen,</hi> or learned Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> (both English men, and in <hi>Italy</hi> when Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> four Books were first printed) meeting with this general fame of them, were desirous to read an Author, that both the Reformed and the Learned of their own Church did so much magnifie, and therefore caused them to be sent for; and, after reading them, boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Pope (which then was <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth) <hi>that though he had lately said he never met with an English Book whose Writer deserved the name of an Author</hi>; yet there now appear'd a wonder to them, and it would be so to his Holiness, if it were in Latin; for <hi>a poor obscure English Priest had writ four such Books of Laws, and church Polity, and in a Style that exprest so Grave and such Humble Majesty with clear
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66185:18"/>
demonstration of Reason, that in all their readings they had not met with any that exceeded him</hi>; and this begot in the Pope an earnest desire that Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> should bring the said four Books, and looking on the English; read a part of them to him in Latin, which Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> did, to the end of the first Book; at the conclusion of which, the Pope spake to this purpose; <hi>There is no Learning that this man hath not searcht into, nothing too hard for his understanding: This man indeed deserves the name of an Author; his Books will get Reverence by Age, for there is in them such seeds of Eternity, that if the rest be like this, they shall last till the last Fire shall consume all Learning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not was this high, the only testimony and commendations given to his Books; for at the first coming of King <hi>Iames</hi> into this Kingdom, he inquired of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gift</hi> for his friend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> that writ the Books of Church Polity; to which the answer was, that he dyed a year before Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who received the sad news of his Death with very much Sorrow; to which the King replyed, <hi>and I receive it with no less, that I shall want the desired happiness of seeing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with that Man, from whose Books I have received such satisfaction: Indeed my Lord, I have received more satisfaction in reading a Leaf, or Paragraph in Mr. Hooker,</hi> thought it were but about the <hi>fashion</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Church Musick,</hi> or the like, but especially <hi>of the Sacraments, then I have had in the reading particular large Treatises written but of one of those subjects by others, though very Learned Men</hi>; and, I observe there is in <hi>Mr. Hooker</hi> no affected Language; but a grave comprehensive, cleer manifestation of Reason; and that back't with the Authority of the Scripture, the <hi>Fathers and Schoolmen,</hi> and with all <hi>Law</hi> both <hi>Sacred and Civil.</hi> And, though many others write well, yet in the next Age they will be forgotten; but doubtless there is in every page of <hi>Mr. Hookers Book,</hi> the Picture of a Divine Soul, such Pictures of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and drawn in so sacred colours, that they shall never fade, but give an immortal memory to the Author. And it is so truly true, that the King thought what he spake; that, as the most Learned of the Nation have and still do mention Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> with Reverence: so he also, did never mention him but with the Epithite of <hi>Learned,</hi> or <hi>Iudicious,</hi> or <hi>Reverend,</hi> or <hi>Venerable</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor did his Son our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, ever mention him but with the same Reverence, enjoyning his Son our now gracious King, to be studious in M. <hi>Hookers</hi> Books. And our learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>

                           </gap> 1599.</note> mentioning the Death, the Modesty, and other Vertues of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and magnifying his Books, wisht, <hi>that for the honour of this, and benefit of other Nations, they were turn'd into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Language.</hi> Which work though undertaken by many, yet they have been weary and forsaken it; but the Reader may now expect it, having been long since begun, and lately finisht, by the happy pen of Doctor <hi>Earl,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> of whom I may justly say (and let it not offend him, because it is such a truth as ought not to be conceal'd from Posterity, or those that now live and yet know him not) that since Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> died, none have liv'd whom God hath blest with more innocent Wisdom; more sanctified Learning, or a more pious, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, primitive Temper: so that this excellent person seems to be only like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and our venerable <hi>Richard Hooker</hi>; and only fit to make the learned of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions happy in knowing what hath been too long confin'd to the language of our little Island.</p>
                     <p>There might be many more and just occasions taken to speak of his Books, which none ever did or can commend too much; but I decline them, and hasten to an account of his Christian behaviour and Death at <hi>Borne,</hi> in which place he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his customary rules of Mortification and Self-Denyal; was much in Fasting, frequent in Meditation and Prayers, injoying those blessed Returns, which only Men of strict lives feel and know; and of which Men of loose and Godless lives can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made sensible; for spiritual things are spiritually discerned.</p>
                     <p>At his entrance into this place, his Friendship was much sought for by Doctor <hi>Hadrian Saravia,</hi> then one of the Prebends of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a German by birth, and sometimes a Pastor both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> where he had studied and well considered the controverted points concerning Episcopacy and Sacriledge, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66185:19"/>
in <hi>England</hi> had a just occasion to declare his Judgement concerning both, unto his Brethren Ministers of the Low Countryes, which was excepted against by <hi>Theodor Beza</hi> and others; against whose exceptions he rejoyned, and thereby became the happy Author of many Learned Tracts, writ in Latin, especially of three; one of the <hi>Degrees of Ministers,</hi> and <hi>of the Bishops Superiority above the Presbytery</hi>; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond against <hi>Sacriledge</hi>; and a third of <hi>Christian obedience to Princes</hi>; the last being occasioned by <hi>Gretzerus</hi> the Jesuit. And it is observable, that when in a time of Church tumults, <hi>Beza</hi> gave his reasons to the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of Episcopacy in that Nation, partly by Letters, and more fully in a Treatise of a three-fold Episcopacy (which he calls <hi>Divine, Humane,</hi> and <hi>Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>) this Doctor <hi>Saravia</hi> had by the help of Bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> made such an early dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their intentions, that he had almost as soon answered that Treatise as it became publique; and therein discovered how <hi>Beza</hi>'s opinion did contradict that of <hi>Calvins,</hi> and his adherents; leaving them to interfere with themselves in point of Episcopacy; but of these Tracts it will not concern me to say more, than that they were most of them dedicated to his and the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> watchful Patron <hi>Iohn Whitgift</hi> the Archbishop; and printed about the year in which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> also appeared first to the world in the Publication of his four Books of Ecclesiastical Polity.</p>
                     <p>This friendship being sought for by this Learned Doctor, you may believe was not denied by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who was by fortune so like him as to be engaged against Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and others of their Judgment in a controversie too like Doctor <hi>Saravia's</hi>; So that in this year of 1595. and in this place of <hi>Borne,</hi> these two excellent persons began a Holy Friendship, increasing dayly to so high and mutual affections, that their two wills seemed to be but one and the same, and designs both for the glory of God, and peace of the Church; still assisting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving each others vertues, and the desired comforts of a peaceable Piety; which I have willingly mentioned, because it gives a foundation to some things that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>This Parsonage of <hi>Borne,</hi> is from <hi>Canterbury</hi> three miles, and near to the common Road that leads from that City to <hi>Dover</hi>; in which Parsonage Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> had not been twelve moneths, but his Books, and the Innocency and Sanctity of his Life became so remarkable, that many turn'd out of the road, and others (Scholars especially) went purposely to see the Man, whose Life and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were so much admired; and alas, as our Saviour said of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist, what went they out to see! a Man Cloathed in Purple and fine Linen?</hi> no indeed; but an <hi>obscure harmless Man; a Man in poor Clothes, his Loynes usually girt in a course Gown or Canonical Coat; of a mean Stature, and stooping, and yet more lowly in the thoughts of his Soul; his body worn out, not with Age, but Study and Holy Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; his face full of Heat-Pimples, begot by his unactivity and sedentary life.</hi> And to this true Character of his Person, let me add this of his Disposition and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; God and Nature blest him with so blessed a hashfulness, that as in his younger days, his Pupils might easily look him out of countenance; so neither then, nor in his Age, <hi>did he ever willingly look any Man in the face: and was of so mild and humble a Nature, that his poor Parish Clark and he did never talk but with both their Hats on, or both off at the same time</hi>; and to this may be added, that though he was not purblind; yet, he was short or weak-sighted; and where be fixt his eyes at the beginning of his Sermon, there they continued till it was ended; and the Reader has a Liberty to believe that his Modesty and Dim sight were some of the reasons why he trusted <hi>Mistris Churchman</hi> to choose a Wife for him.</p>
                     <p>This Parish Clark lived till the third or fourth year of the late long Parliament; betwixt which time and Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Death, there had come many to see the place of his Burial, and the Monument dedicated to his memory by Sir <hi>William Cooper,</hi> (who still lives) and the poor Clark had many rewards for shewing Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Grave-place, and his said Monument, and did always hear Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> mentioned with Commendations and Reverence; to all which he added his own knowledge and observations of his Humility and Holiness: in all which Discourses, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66185:19"/>
poor man was still more confirm'd in his opinion of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Vertues and Learning; but it so fell out, that about the said third or fourth year of the long Parliament, the present Parson of <hi>Borne</hi> was Sequestred (you may guess why) and a <hi>Genevian</hi> Minister put into his good living. This, and other like Sequestrations, made the Clerk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press himself in a wonder, and say, <hi>They had Sequestred so many good Men, that he doubted if his good Master Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>had lived till now, they would have Sequestred him too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was not long before this intruding Minister had made a party in and about the said Parish, that were desirous to receive the Sacrament as in <hi>Geneva</hi>; to which end, the day was appointed for a Select Company, and Forms and Stools set about the Altar or Communion Table for them to sit and eat and drink; but when they went about this work, there was a want of some Joynd-stools, which the Minister sent the Clerk to fetch, and then to fetch Cushions. When the Clerk saw them begin to sit down, he began to wonder; but the Minister bade him <hi>cease wondering, and lock the Church door:</hi> To whom he replied, <hi>Pray take you the Keys and lock me out, I will never come more into this Church; for all men will say my Master</hi> Hooker <hi>was a good Man, and a good Scholar, and I am sure it was not used to be thus in his days:</hi> And report says, The old man went presently home, and died; I do not say died immediately, but within a few days after.</p>
                     <p>But let us leave this grateful Clerk in his quiet Grave, and return to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himself, continuing our observations of his Christian behavior in this place, where he gave a holy Valediction to all the pleasures and allurements of Earth; possessing his Soul in a vertuous quietness, which he maintained by constant Study, Prayers, and Meditations: His use was to Preach once every Sunday, and he or his Curate to Catechize after the Second Lesson in the Evening Prayer: His Sermons were neither long nor earnest, but uttered with a grave Zeal, and an humble Voice: His Eyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fixt on one place, to prevent his imagination from wandring; insomuch, that he seem'd to Study as he spake; the design of his Sermons (as indeed of all his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses) was to shew Reasons for what he spake: And with these Reasons such a kinde of Rhetorick, as did rather convince and perswade, then frighten men into Piety. Studying not so much for matter (which he never wanted) as for apt illustrations to inform and teach his unlearned hearers by familiar examples, and then make them better by convincing Applications; never laboring by hard words, and then by need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less distinctions and subdistinctions to amuse his hearers, and get glory to himself: But glory onely to God. Which intention he would often say, was as discernable in a Preacher, <hi>as an Artificial from a Natural Beauty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He never failed the Sunday before every <hi>Ember</hi> week, to give notice of it to his Parishioners, perswading them both to fast, and then to double their Devotions for a Learned and Pious Clergy, but especially for the last; saying often, <hi>That the life of a pious Clergy-man was visible Rhetorick, and so convincing, That the most godless men (though they would not deny themselves the enjoyment of their present Lusts) did get secretly wish themselves like those of the strictest lives.</hi> And to what he perswaded others, he added his own example of Fasting and Prayer; and did usually every <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> week, take from the Parish Clerk the Key of the Church door; into which place he retired every day, and lockt himself up for many hours; and did the like most Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and other days of Fasting.</p>
                     <p>He would by no means omit the customary time of Procession, perswading all, both rich and poor, if they desired the preservation of Love, and their Parish Rights and Liberties, to accompany him in his Perambulation, and most did so: In which Perambulation, he would usually express more pleasant discourse then at other times, and would then always drop some loving and facetious observations to be remembred against the next year, especially by the boys and young people; still inclining them, and all his present Parishioners, to meekness and mutual kindnesses and love; because <hi>Love thinks not evil, but covers a multitude of infirmities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was diligent to enquire who of his Parish were sick, or any way distressed, and would often visit them unsent for; supposing, that the fittest time to discover those Errors, to which health and prosperity had blinded them: And having by pious Reasons and Prayers, molded them into holy Resolutions for the time to come, he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66185:20"/>
would incline them to Confession, and bewailing their sins, with purpose to forsake them, and then to receive the Communion, both as a strengthning of those holy Resolutions; and as a Seal betwixt God and them of his mercies to their Souls, in case that present sickness did put a period to their lives.</p>
                     <p>And as he was thus watchful and charitable to the sick, so he was as diligent to prevent Law-sutes, still urging his Parishioners and Neighbors, to bear with each others infirmities, and live in love, because (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says) <hi>He that lives in love, lives in God, for God is Love.</hi> And to maintain this holy Fire of Love, constantly burning on the Altar, of a pure Heart, his advice was to watch and pray, and always keep themselves fit to receive the Communion, and then to receive it often; for it was both a confirming, and a strengthning of their Graces. This was his advice; and at his entrance or departure out of any house, he would usually speak to the whole Family, and bless them by name; insomuch, that as he seem'd in his youth to be taught of God, so he seem'd in this place to teach his Precepts, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, in all Holiness and Humility, making each day a step towards a blessed Eternity. And though in this weak and declining age of the World, such examples are become barren, and almost incredible; yet let his memory be blest with this true Recordation, because, he that praises <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> praises God, who hath given such gifts to men; and let this humble and affectionate Relation of him, become such a pattern as may invite Posterity to imitate his Vertues.</p>
                     <p>This was his constant behavior at <hi>Borne</hi>; thus as <hi>Enoch,</hi> so he walked with God; thus did he tread in the footsteps of Primitive Piety; and yet, as that great example of meekness and purity, even our Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> was not free from false accusations, no more was this Disciple of his. This most humble, most innocent holy Man; his was a slander parallel to that of chaste <hi>Susannaes</hi> by the wicked Elders; or that against St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as it is Recorded in his life (for that holy Man had Heretical enemies) and which this age calls <hi>Trepanning.</hi> The particulars need not a repetition, and that it was false, needs no other Testimony then the publick punishment of his accusers, and their open confession of his innocency: 'Twas said, that the accusation was contrived by a Dissenting Brother, one that indur'd not Church Ceremonies, hating him for his Books sake, which he was not able to Answer; and his name hath been told me: But I have not so much confidence in the Relation, as to make my Pen fix a scandal on him to Posterity; I shall rather leave it doubtful till the great day of Revelation. But this is certain, that he lay under the great charge, and the anxiety of this accusation, and kept it secret to himself for many moneths: And, being a helpless man, had lain longer under this heavy burthen, but that the Protector of the innocent gave such an accidental occasion as forced him to make it known to his two dear Friends, <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> and <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> who were so sensible of their Tutors sufferings, that they gave themselves no rest, till by their disquisitions and diligence they had found out the Fraud, and brought him the welcome news, that his accusers did confess they had wrong'd him, and begg'd his pardon: To which the good mans reply was to this purpose, <hi>The Lord forgive them</hi>; and, <hi>The Lord bless you for this comfortable news. Now I have a just occasion to say with</hi> Solomon, Friends are born for the days of Adversity, <hi>and such you have prov'd to me: And to my God I say, as did the Mother of St.</hi> John Baptist, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the day wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men. <hi>And, O my God, neither my life, nor my reputation, are safe in mine own keeping, but in thine, who didst take care of me, when I yet hanged upon my Mothers Brest. Blessed are they that put their trust in thee, O Lord; for, when false witnesses were risen up against me; when shame was ready to cover my face; when I was bowed down with an horrible dread, and went mourning all the day long; when my nights were restless, and my sleeps broken with a fear worse then death; when my Soul thirsted for a deliverance, as the Hart panteth after the Rivers of Waters: Then, thou Lord, didst bear my complaints, pitty my condition, and art new become my Deliverer; and as long as I live I will hold up my hands in this manner, and magnifie thy Mercies, who didst not give me over as a prey to mine enemies. O blessed are they that put their trust in thee; and no prosperity shall make me forget those days of sorrow, or to perform those vows that I have made to thee in the days of my fears and affliction; for with such sacrifices, thou, O God, art well pleased; and I will pay them.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66185:20"/>Thus did the joy and gratitude of this good Mans heart break forth; and 'tis observable, that as the invitation to this slander was his meek behavior and Dove like simplicity, for which he was remarkable; so his Christian Charity ought to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: For, though the Spirit of Revenge is so pleasing to mankinde, that it is never conquered but by a Supernatural Grace, being indeed so deeply rooted in Humane Nature, that to prevent the excesses of it (for men would not know Moderation) Almighty God allows not any degree of it to any man, but says, <hi>Vengeance is mine.</hi> And, though this be said by God himself, yet this revenge is so pleasing, that man is hardly perswaded to submit the menage of it to the Time, and Justice, and Wisdom of his Creator, but would hasten to be his own executioner of it. And yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, if any man ever did wholly decline, and leave this pleasing Passion to the time and measure of God alone, it was this <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> of whom I write: For when his slanderers were to suffer, he labored to procure their Pardon; and, when that was denied him, his Reply was, <hi>That however he would fast and pray, that God would give them Repentance and Patience to undergo their Punishment.</hi> And his Prayers were so for returned into his own bosom, that the first was granted, if we may believe a Penitent Behavior, and an open Confession. And 'tis observable, that after this time he would often say to Dr. <hi>Saravia, O with what quietness, did I enjoy my Soul after I was free from the fears of my slander! And how much more after a conflict and victory ever my desires of Revenge!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Year One thousand six hundred, and of his Age Forty six, he fell into a long and sharp sickness, occasioned by a Cold taken in his Passage betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Gravesend,</hi> from the malignity of which, he was never recovered; for, till his death he was not free from thoughtful days, and restless nights; but a submission to his Will that makes the sick mans bed easie, by giving rest to his Soul, made his very languishment comfortable: And yet all this time he was solicitous in his Study, and said often to Dr. <hi>Saravia,</hi> (who saw him daily, and was the cheif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> comfort of his life) <hi>That he did not beg a long life of God for any other reason, but to live to finish his three remaining Books of POLITY; and then, Lord, let thy Servant depart in peace,</hi> which was his usual expression. And God heard his Prayers, though he denied the Church the benefit of them as compleated by himself; and 'tis thought he hastned his own death, by hastning to give life to his Books. But this is certain, that the nearer he was to his death, the more he grew in <hi>Humility,</hi> in <hi>holy Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About a moneth before his death, this good man, that never knew, or at least, never consider'd the pleasures of the Palate, became first to lose his Appetite, then to have an aversness to all Food; insomuch, that he seem'd to live some intermitted weeks by the smell of meat onely; and yet still studied and writ. And now his Guardian Angel seem'd to foretel him, that his years were past away as a shadow, bidding him prepare to follow the Generation of his Fathers, for the day of his dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drew near; for which his vigorous Soul appear'd to thirst.</p>
                     <p>In this time of his sickness, and not many days before his death, his House was robb'd; of which, he having notice, his Question was, <hi>Are my Books and Written Papers safe?</hi> And being answered, <hi>That they were.</hi> His Reply was, <hi>Then it matters not, for no other loss can trouble me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About one day before his death, Dr. <hi>Saravia,</hi> who knew the very secrets of his Soul (for they were supposed to be Confessors to each other) came to him, and after a Conference of the Benefit, the Necessity, and Safety of the Churches Absolution, it was resolved the Doctor should give him both that and the Sacrament the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. To which end the Doctor came, and after a short retirement and privacy, they return'd to the company; and then the Doctor gave him and some of those friends that were with him, the Blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Jesus. Which being performed, the Doctor thought he saw a reverend gaity and joy in his face; but it lasted not long; for his bodily infirmities did return suddenly, and became more visible, insomuch, that the Doctor apprehended Death ready to seise him: Yet, after some amendment, left him at night, with a promise to return early the day following, which he did, and then found him better in appearance, deep in contemplation, and not inclinable to discourse; which gave the Doctor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66185:21"/>
to require his present thoughts: To which he replied, <hi>That he was meditating the number and nature of Angels, and their blessed Obedience and Order, without which, Peace could not be in Heaven; and oh that it might be so on Earth.</hi> After which words, he said, <hi>I have lived to see this World is made up of perturbations, and I have been long preparing to leave it, and gathering comfort for the dreadful hour of making my account with God, which I now apprehend to be near: And though I have by his Grace lov'd him in my youth, and fear'd him in mine age, and labor'd to have a Conscience void of offence to him, and to all men; yet, if thou, O Lord, be extream to mark what I have done amiss, who can abide it? And therefore, where I have failed, Lord shew mercy to me; for I plead not my Righteousness, but the forgiveness of my unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for his Merits who died to purchase a pardon for penitent sinners. And since I ow thee a death, Lord let it not be terrible, and then take thine own time, I submit to it: Let not mine, O Lord, but let thy Will be done.</hi> With which expression he fell into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous slumber, dangerous as to his recovery; yet recover he did, but it was to speak onely these few words, <hi>Good Doctor, God hath heard my daily Petitions; for I am at peace with all men, and he is at peace with me; and from which blessed assurance I feel that inward joy, which this World can neither give nor take from me.</hi> More he would have spoken, but his spirits failed him; and, after a short conflict betwixt Nature and Death, a quiet sigh put a period to his last breath, and so he fell asleep.</p>
                     <p>And here I draw his Curtain, till with the most glorious Company of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks and Apostles; the most noble Army of Martyrs and Confessors, this most Learned, most Humble, holy Man, shall also awake to receive an Eternal Tranquillity, and with it a greater degree of Glory then common Christians shall be made partakers of; In the mean time, <hi>Bless, O Lord, Lord bless his Brethren, the Clergy of this Nation with ardent desires, and effectual endeavors to attain, if not to his great Learning, yet to his remarkable meekness, his godly simplicity, and his Christian moderation: For these are praise-worthy; these bring peace at the last: And let the Labors of his life, his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Writings be bless with what he designed when he undertook them: Which was Glory to thee, O God on high, Peace in thy Church, and good will to mankinde.</hi>

                  <head>AN APPENDIX To the LIFE of Mr. Richard Hooker.</head>
                  <p>ANd now having by a long and Laborious search satisfied my self, and I hope my Reader by imparting to him the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Life: I am desirous also to acquaint him with some Observations that relate to it; and, which could not properly fall to be spoken till after his Death, of which my Reader may expect a brief and true account in the following Appendix.</p>
                  <p>And first it is not to be doubted but that he died in the forty-seventh, if not in the forty-sixth year of his Age; which I mention, because many have believed him to be more aged; but I have so examined it, as to be confident, I mistake not; and for the year of his death, Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> who in his Annals of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1599. mentions him with a high commendation of his Life and Learning, declares him to die in the year 1599. and yet in that Inscription of his Monument set up at the charge of Sir <hi>William Cooper</hi> in <hi>Borne Church,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was buried, his Death is said to be in <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. but doubtless both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; for I have it attested under the hand of <hi>William Somner</hi> the Archbishops Register for the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that <hi>Richard Hookers</hi> Will bears date <hi>October</hi> the 26. in <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. and that it was prov'd the third of <hi>December</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. And this attested also that at his Death he left four Daughters, <hi>Alice, Cicily, Iane,</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> that he gave to each of them a hundred pound, that he left <hi>Ione</hi> his Wife his sole Executrix, and that by his Inventory his Estate (a great part of it being in Books) came to 1092l. 91. 2d. which was much more than he thought himself worth; and, which was not got by his Care, much less by the good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery of his Wife, but saved by his trusty Servant <hi>Thomas Lane,</hi> that was wiser than his Master in getting Money for him, and more frugal than his Mistress in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; of which Will I shall say no more, but that his dear Friend <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Father of <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> of whom I have spoken, and shall have occasion to say more, was one of the Witnesses to it.</p>
                  <p>One of his elder Daughters was married to one <hi>Chalinor,</hi> sometime a Schoolmaster in <hi>Chichester,</hi> &amp; both dead long since, <hi>Margaret</hi> his youngest Daughter was married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ezekiel Chark,</hi> Batchelor in Divinity, and Rector of S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in <hi>Harbledown</hi> near <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> died about 16 years past, and had a Son <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> now living, and in Sacred Orders, being at this time Rector of <hi>Waldron</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> she left also a Daughter, with both whom I have spoken not many months past, and find her to be a widow in a condition that wants not, but far from abounding; and these two attested unto me, that <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> their Grandfather had a Sister, by name <hi>Elizabeth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66185:22"/>
Harvey,</hi> that liv'd to the Age of 121, years, and died in the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> 1663.</p>
                  <p>For his other two Daughters I can learn little certainty, but have heard they both died before they were Marriageable; and for his Wife, she was so unlike <hi>Iep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaes</hi> Daughter, that she staid not a comely time to bewail her Widdow-hood; nor liv'd long enough to repent her second Marriage, for which doubtless she would have found cause, if there had been but four months betwixt Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> and her death. But she is dead, and let her other infirmities be buried with her.</p>
                  <p>Thus much briefly for his Age, the year of his Death, his Estate, his Wife, and his Children. I am next to speak of his Books, concerning which I shall have a necessity of being longer, or shall neither do right to my self of my Reader, which is chiefly intended in this Appendix.</p>
                  <p>I have declared in his Life, that he proposed eight Books, and that his first four were Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1594. and his fifth Book first printed, and alone, <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. and that he liv'd to finish the remaining three of the proposed eight; but, whether we have the last three as finisht by himself, is a just and Material Question; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I do declare, That I have been told almost forty years past, by one that very well knew Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the affaires of his Family, that about a moneth after the death of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Bishop <hi>Whitgist,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> sent one of his Chaplains to enquire of Mrs. <hi>Hooker,</hi> for the three remaining Books of Polity, writ by her Husband; of which, she would not, or could not give any account; and I have been told that about three moneths after the Bishop procured her to be sent for to <hi>London,</hi> and then by his procurement she was to be examined, by some of her Majesties Council, concerning the disposal of those Books: but by way of preparation for the next days examination, the Bishop invited her to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and, after some friendly questions, she confessed to him, <hi>that one Mr.</hi> Charke <hi>and another Minister that dwelt near</hi> Canterbury, <hi>came to her, and desired that they might go into her Husbands Study, and look upon some of his Writings; and that there they two burnt and tore many of them, assuring her that they were writings not fit to be seen, and that she knew nothing more concerning them.</hi> Her lodging was then in <hi>Kingstreet</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> where she was sound next morning dead in her Bed, and her new Husband suspected and questioned for it; but was declared innocent of her Death.</p>
                  <p>And I declare also, that Doctor <hi>Iohn Spencer</hi> (mentioned in the Life of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>) who was of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Colledge, and of his time there, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom there was so friendly a friendship, that they continually advised to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in all their Studies, and particularly in what concern'd these Books of Polity: this Doctor <hi>Spencer,</hi> the three perfect Books being lost, had delivered into his hands (I think by Bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi>) the imperfect Books, or first rough draughts of them, to be made as perfect as they might be, by him, who both knew Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> hand-writing, and was best acquainted with his intentions. And a fair Testimony of this may appear by an Epistle first and usually printed before Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> five Books (but omitted, I know not why, in the last impression of the eight Printed together in <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. in which the Publishers seem to impose the three doubtful, as the undoubted Books of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>) with these two Letters <hi>I.S.</hi> at the end of the said Epistle, which was meant for this <hi>Iohn Spencer</hi>; in which Epistle the Reader may find these very words, which may give some Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to what I have here written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And though Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>hastened his own Death by hastening to give Life to his Books, yet he held out with his eyes to behold these</hi> Benjamins, <hi>these Sons of his right Hand, though to him they prov'd</hi> Benonics, <hi>Sons of pain and sorrow: But, some evil disposed minds, whether of Malice, or Covetousness, or wicked blind Zeal, it is uncertain, as soon as they were born and their Fathers dead, smother'd them, and, by conveying the perfect Copies, left unto us nothing but the old imperfect mangled droughts dismembred into pieces; no favour, no grace, not the shadow of themselves remaining in them; had the Father lived to behold them thus defaced, he might rightly have named them</hi> Benonies, <hi>the Sons of Sorrow; but being the learned will not suffer them to die and be buried, it is intended the world shall see them as they are: the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66185:22"/>
learned will find in them some shadows and resemblances of their Fathers face. God grant, that as they were with their Brethren dedicated to the Church for messengers of Peace; so, in the strength of the little breath of Life that remaineth in them, they may prosper in their work, and that by satisfying the Doubts of such as are willing to learn, they may help to give an end to the calamities of these our Civil Wars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. S.</p>
                  <p>And next the Reader may note, that this Epistle of Doctor <hi>Spencers</hi> was writ, and first Printed within four years after the death of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in which time, all diligent search had been made for the perfect Copies; and then granted not recoverable, and therefore indeavoured to be compleated out of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> rough draughts, as is exprest by the said Doctor <hi>Spencer,</hi> since whose death it is now fifty years.</p>
                  <p>And I do profess by the Faith of a Christian, that Doctor <hi>Spencers</hi> Wife (who was my Aunt, and Sister to <hi>George Cranmer</hi> of whom I have spoken) told me forty years since, in these, or in words to this purpose, <hi>that her Husband had made up or finisht Mr.</hi> Hookers <hi>last three Books; and that upon her Husbands Death-bed, or in his last sickness, he gave them into her hand, with a charge they should not be seen by any Man, but be by her delivered into the hands of the then Archbishop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>which was Doctor</hi> Abbot, <hi>or unto Doctor</hi> King, <hi>Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>and that she did as he injoyn'd her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do conceive, that from Doctor <hi>Spencers</hi> and no other Copy, there have been divers Transcripts, and wereto be found in several places, as namely in Sir <hi>Thomas Bodlies</hi> Library, in that of Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi> in the late Lord <hi>Conwayes,</hi> in the Archbishop of <hi>Canterburies,</hi> and in the Bishop of <hi>Armaghs,</hi> and in many others, and most of these pretended to be the Authors own hand, but much disagreeing, being indeed altered and diminisht as Men have thought fittest to make Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Judgment suit with their Fancies; or give authority to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt designs; and for proof of a part of this, take these following testimonies.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Barnard,</hi> sometime Chaplain to Doctor <hi>Usher</hi> late Lord Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> hath declar'd in a late Book called <hi>Clavi Trabales,</hi> Printed by <hi>Richard Hodgkinson, Anno</hi> 1661. that in his search and examination of the said Bishops Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, he there found the three written Books, which were the supposed sixth, seventh, and eighth of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Books of Ecclesiastical Polity; and, that in the said three Books (now printed as Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi>) there are so many Omissions that they amount to many Paragraphs; and, which cause many incoherencies; the Omissions are by him set down at large in the said Printed Book, to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader for the whole; but think fit in this place to insert this following short part of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, as there could be in Natural Bodies no Motion of any thing, unless there were some first which moved all things, and continued Unmoveable; even so in Politick Societies, there must be some unpunishable, or else no Man shall suffer punishment; for, sith punishments proceed always from Superiors to whom the administration of Iustice belongeth, which administration must have necessarily a Fountain that deriveth it to all others, and receiveth not from any, (because otherwise the course of Iustice should go infinitely in a Circle, every Superiour having his Superiour without end, which cannot be;) therefore, a well spring, it followeth, there is, a Supreme head of Iustice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all are subject, but it self in subjection to none. Which kinde of Preheminency if some ought to have in a Kingdom, who but the King shall have it? Kings therefore, or no man can have lawfull power to Iudge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Private men offend, there is the Magistrate over them which Iudgeth; if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, they have their Prince; if Princes, there is Heaven a Tribunal, before which they shall appear: on Earth they are not accomptable to any.</hi> Here says the Doctor, it breaks off abruptly.</p>
                  <p>And I have these words also attested under the hand of Mr. <hi>Fabian Phillips</hi> a man of note for his useful Books. <hi>I will make Oath if I shall be required, that Doctor</hi> Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>the late Bishop of</hi> Lincoln <hi>did a little before his Death affirm to me he had seen a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66185:23"/>
affirmed to him to be the hand-writing of Mr.</hi> Richard Hooker, <hi>in which there was no mention made of the King or Supreme Governors being accomptable to the People; this I will make Oath that that good Man attested to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fabian Phillips.</p>
                  <p>So that there appears to be both Omissions and Additions in the said last three printed Books; and this may probably be one Reason why Doctor <hi>Sanderson,</hi> the said Learned Bishop (whose writings are so highly and justly valued) gave a strict charge near the time of his Death, or in his last Will, <hi>that nothing of his that was not already Printed, should be Printed after his Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is well known how high a value our Learned King <hi>Iames</hi> put upon the Books writ by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> as also that our late King <hi>Charls</hi> (the Martyr for the Church) valued them the second of all Books, testified by his commending them to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Son <hi>Charls</hi> that now is our Gratious King; and you may suppose that this <hi>Charls</hi> the First was not a stranger to the pretended three Books, because in a discourse with the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> when the said Lord required the King to grant the truth of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, because it was the Judgement of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> (quoting him in one of the three written Books,) the King replyed, <hi>they were not allowed to be Mr,</hi> Hookers <hi>Books</hi>; but, however <hi>he would allow them to be Mr.</hi> Hookers, <hi>and consent to what his Lordship proposed to prove out of those doubtful Books if he would but consent to the Iudgment of Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>in the other five that were the undoubted Books of Mr.</hi> Hooker.</p>
                  <p>In this Relation concerning these three doubtful Books of Mr. <hi>Hookers,</hi> my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was to enquire, then set down what I observ'd and know, which I have done, not as an engaged Person, but indifferently, and now leave my Reader to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for their Legitimation, as to himself, but so, as to leave others the same Liberty of believing, or disbelieving them to be Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi>; and 'tis observable, that as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> advis'd with Doctor <hi>Spencer,</hi> in the design and manage of these Books, so also, and chiefly with this dear Pupil <hi>George Cranmer</hi> (whose Sister was the Wife of Doctor <hi>Spencer</hi>) of which this following Letter may be a Testimony; and doth also give authority to some things mentioned both in this Appendix, and in the Life of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>; and, is therefore added.</p>

                     <hi>GEORGE CRANMERS</hi> LETTER UNTO Mr. <hi>RICHARD HOOKER. February</hi> 1598.</head>
                  <p>WHat Posterity is likely to judge of these matters concerning Church Discipline, we may the better conjecture, if we call to mind what our own Age, within few years, upon better Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, hath already judged concerning the same. It may be remembred, that at first the greatest part of the Learned in the Land were either eagerly affected, or favourably inclined that way. The Books then written for the most part savoured of the Disciplinary Stile: it sounded everywhere in Pulpits, and in common phrase of mens speech: the contrary part began to fear they had taken a wrong course; many which impugned the Discipline, yet so impugned it, not as not being the better form of Government, but as not being so convenient for our State, in regard of dangerous Innovations thereby like to grow;<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.</note> one man alone there was, to speak of, (whom let no suspition of flattery deprive of his deserved Commendation,) w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o in the defiance of the one part, and courage of the other, stood in the gap, and gave others respite to prepare themselves to the defence, which by the sudden eagerness and violence of their Adversaries had otherwise been prevented; wherein God hath made good unto him his own Impress, <hi>Vincit qui patitur</hi>; for what contumelious indignities he hath at their hands sustained, the world is witness, and what reward of Honour above his Adversaries God hath bestowed upon him, themselves (though nothing glad thereof) must needs confess. Now of late years the heat of men towards the Discipline is greatly decayed, their Judgements begin to sway on the other side: the Learned have weighed it, and found it light; wise men conceive some fear, left it prove not only not the best kind of Government, but the very bane and destruction of all Government. The cause of this Change in Mens Opinions may be drawn from the general nature of Error, disguised and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the name of Truth; which is mightily and violently to possess men at first, but afterwards, the weakness thereof being by time discovered, to lose that reputation, which before it had gained; as by the outside of an House the passers by are oftentimes deceived, till they see the conveniencie of the Rooms within: so by the very name of Discipline and Reformation, Men were drawn at first to cast a fancy towards it, but now they have not contented themselves only to pass by and behold afar off the fore-front of this reformed house; they have entred in, even at the special request of Master-workmen and chief Builders thereof; they have perused the Roomes, the Lights, the Conveniencies, they find them not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that report which was made of them. nor to that opinion which upon report they had conceived: So as now the Discipline which at first triumphed over all, being unmasked, beginneth to droop and hang down her head.</p>
                  <p>This cause of change in opinion concerning the Discipline, is proper to the Learned, or to such as by them have been instructed; another cause there is more
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66185:24"/>
open, and more apparent to the view of all, namely, the course of Practice, which the Reformers have had with us from the beginning; the first degree was only some small difference about Cap and Surplice, but not such as either bred division in the Church, or tended to the ruine of the Government established. This was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the next degree more stirring. <hi>Admonitions</hi> were directed to the Parliament in peremptory sort against our whole Form of Regiment; in defence of them, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes were published in English, and in Latin; yet this was no more than writing, Devices were set on foot to erect the Practice of the Discipline without Authority: yet herein some regard of Modesty, some moderation was used; Behold, at length it brake forth into open outrage, first in writing by <hi>Martin,</hi> in whose kind of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things may be observed; first that whereas <hi>T. C.</hi> and others his great Masters had alwayes before set out the Discipline as a Queen, and as the Daughter of God; He contrariwise, to make her more acceptable to the people, brought her forth as a Vice upon the Stage. 2: This conceit of his was grounded (as may be supposed) upon this rare Polity, that seeing the Discipline was by writing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, in Parliament rejected, in secret corners hunted out and decried, it was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that by open rayling (which to the vulgar is commonly most plausible) the State Ecclesiastical might have been drawn into such contempt and hatred, as the overthrow thereof should have been most grateful to all Men, and in manner desired of the common people. 3. It may be noted (and this I know my self to be true) how some of them, although they could not for shame approve so lewd an Action, yet were content to lay hold on it to the advancement of their cause, acknowledging therein the secret judgements of God against the Bishops, and hoping that some good might be wrought thereby for his Church, as indeed there was, though not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their construction. For 4. Contrary to their expectation, that railing Spirit did not only not further, but extremely disgrace and prejudice their Cause, when it was once perceived from how low degrees of contradiction, at first, to what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Contumely and Slander they were at length proceeded; and were also likely further to proceed.</p>
                  <p>A further degree of outrage was in Fact; Certain<note n="*" place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> and <hi>Cappergot.</hi>
                     </note> Prophets did arise, who deeming it not possible that God should suffer that to be undone, which they did so fiercely desire to have done, Namely, that his holy Saints, the favourers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Discipline, should be enlarged, and delivered from persecution; and seeing no means of deliverance Ordinary, were fain to perswade themselves that God must needs raise some extraordinary means; and being perswaded of none so well as of themselves, they forthwith must need she the instruments of this great work. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they framed unto themselves an assured hope that upon their Preaching out of a Pease Cart, all the multitude would have presently joyned unto them, and in amazement of mind have asked them, <hi>Viri sratres, quid agimus</hi>? whereunto it is likely they would have returned an answer far unlike to that of St. Peter, <hi>Such and such are Men unworthy to govern, pluck them down; Such and such are the Dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, let them be advanced.</hi> Of two of these Men, it is meet to speak with all Commiseration, yet so that others by their example may receive instruction, and withall some light may appear, what stirring affections the Discipline is like to inspire, if it light upon apt and prepared minds.</p>
                  <p>Now if any Man doubt of what Society they were, or if the Reformers disclaim them, pretending that by them they were condemned, let these points be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 1. <hi>Whose associates were they before they entered into this frantick Passion; whose Sermons did they frequent? whom did they admire?</hi> 2. <hi>Even when they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it, whose advice did they require</hi>? and when they were in, <hi>whose approbation? whom advertised they of their purpose? whose assistance by Prayers did they request</hi>? But we deal injuriously with them to lay this to their charge; for they reproved and condemned it. How? did they disclose it to the Magistrate, that it might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed? or were they not rather content to stand aloof off, and see the end of it, and loth to quench the Spirit? No doubt these mad practitioners were of their society with whom before, and in the practice of their madness they had most affinity. Hereof, read Doctor <hi>Bancrofts</hi> Book.</p>
                  <p>A third inducement may be to dislike of the Discipline, if we consider not only
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66185:28"/>
how far the Reformers themselves have proceeded, but what others upon their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations have built. Here come the <hi>Brownists</hi> in the first rank, their lineal descendants, who have seised upon a number of strange opinions; whereof, although their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, the Reformers, were never actually possessed, yet by right and interest from them derived, the <hi>Brownists</hi> and <hi>Barrowists</hi> have taken possession of them: For if the Positions of the Reformers be true, I cannot see how the main and general Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Brownism</hi> should be false; for upon these two points, as I conceive, they stand.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That because we have no Church, they are to sever themselves from us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That without Civil Authority, they are to erect a Church of their own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the former of these be true, the latter, I suppose, will follow: For if above all things, Men be to regard their Salvation; and if out of the Church, there be no Salvation; it followeth, That if we have no Church, we have no means of Salvation: And therefore Separation from us, in that respect, is both lawful and necessary. As also, That men so separated from the false and counterfeit Church, are to associate themselves unto some Church; not to ours; to the Popish much less; therefore to one of their own making. Now the ground of all these Inferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, [<hi>That in our Church, there is no means of Salvation</hi>] is out of the Reformers Principles most clearly to be proved. For wheresoever any Matter of Faith unto Salvation necessary is denied, there can be no means of Salvation: But in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Discipline by them accounted a Matter of Faith, and necessary to Salvation, is not onely denied, but impugned, and the Professors thereof oppressed. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, (but this Reason perhaps is weak) Every true Church of Christ acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the whole Gospel of Christ: the Discipline, in their opinion, is a part of the Gospel, and yet by our Church resisted. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, The Discipline is essentially united to the Church: By which term <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially,</hi> they must mean either an essential part, or an essential property. Both which ways it must needs be, That where that Essential Discipline is not, neither is there any Church. If therefore between them, and the <hi>Brownists,</hi> there should be appointed a Solemn Disputation, whereof with us they have been oftentimes so earnest challengers: It doth not yet appear what other answer they could possibly frame to these and the like Arguments, wherewith they might be pressed, but fairly to deny the Conclusion (for all Premises are their own) or rather ingenuously to reverse their own Principles before laid, whereon so soul absurdities have been so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built.</p>
                  <p>What further proofs you can bring out of their high words, magnifying the Discipline, I leave to your better remembrance: But above all points, I am desirous this one should be strongly inforced against them, because it wringeth them most of all, and is of all others (for ought I see) the most unanswerable; you may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing say, That you would be heartily glad these their Positions might so be salved, as the <hi>Brownists</hi> might not appear to have issued out of their Loyns; but until that be done, they must give us leave to think <hi>that they have cast the Seed whereout these Tares are grown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another sort of Men there are, which have been content to run on with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers for a time, and to make them poor instruments of their own designs. These are a sort of Godless Politicks, who perceiving the Plot of Discipline to consist of these two parts, The overthrow of Episcopal, and erection of Presbyterial Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that this latter can take no place till the former be remov'd, are content to joyn with them in the Destructive part of Discipline, bearing them in hand, that in the other also, they shall finde them as ready. But when time shall come, it may be they would be as loth to be yoaked with that kinde of Regiment, as now they are willing to be released from this. These Mens ends in all their actions; is Distraction; their pretence and colour, Reformation. Those things which under this colour they have effected to their own good, are, 1. By maintaining a contrary Faction, they have kept the Clergy always in aw; and thereby made them more pliable and willing to buy their Peace. 2. By maintaining an opinion of Equality among Ministers, they have made way to their own purposes for devouring Cathedral Churches, and Bishops
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66185:29"/>
Livings. 3. By exclaiming against abuses in the Church, they have carried their own corrupt dealings in the Civil State more covertly; for such is the nature of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, they are not able to apprehend many things at once, so as being possessed with a dislike or liking of any one thing, many other, in the meantime, may escape them, without being perceived. 4. They have sought to disgrace the Clergy, in entertaining a conceit in mens minds, and confirming it by continual practice, that Men of Learning, and specially of the Clergy, which are imployed in the chiefest kinde of Learning, are not to be admitted, of sparingly admitted to Matters of State; contrary to the practice of all well-governed Commonwealths, and of our own, till these late years.</p>
                  <p>A third sort of Men there are, though not descended from the Reformers, yet in part raised and greatly strengthned by them, namely, the cursed crew of <hi>Atheists.</hi> This also is one of those Points which I am desirous you should handle most effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and strain your self therein to all points of motion and affection, as in that of the <hi>Brownists,</hi> to all strength and sinews of Reason. This is a sort most damnable, and yet by the general suspition of the World at this day most common. The causes of it, which are in the parties themselves, although you handle in the beginning of the Fift Book, yet here again they may be touched; but the occasions of help and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, which by the Reformers have been yielded unto them, are, as I conceive, two, <hi>Senseless Preaching,</hi> and <hi>disgracing of the Ministry:</hi> For how should not men dare to impugn that, which neither by force of Reason, nor by Authority of Persons is maintained? But in the parties themselves, these two causes. I conceive of <hi>Atheism,</hi> 1. More abundance of Wit then Judgment, and of Witty then Judicious Learning, whereby <hi>they are more inclined to contradict any thing, then willing to be informed of the truth.</hi> They are not therefore Men of sound Learning for the most part, but Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; neither is their kinde of Dispute so much by force Argument, as by Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing: Which humor of Scoffing, and turning Matters most serious into merriment, is now become so common, as we are not to marvel what the Prophet means by the <hi>

                        </gap>eat of Scorners,</hi> nor what the Apostles by foretelling of <hi>Scorners to come</hi>; our own Age hath verified their speech unto us; which also may be an Argument against these Scoffers and Atheists themselves, seeing it hath been so many Ages ago foretold, That such Men the latter days of the World should afford, which could not be done by any other Spirit, save that whereunto <hi>things future and present are alike.</hi> And even for the main question of the Resurrection, whereat they stick so mightily, was it not plainly foretold, that men should in the latter times say, <hi>Where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of his coming?</hi> Against the Creation, the Ark, and divers other Points, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are said to be taken; the ground whereof is superfluity of Wit, without ground of Learning and Judgment.</p>
                  <p>A second cause of <hi>Atheism,</hi> is <hi>Sensuality</hi>; which maketh men desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all stops and impediments of their wicked life; amongst which, because Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the chiefest, so as neither in this life without shame they can persist therein, nor (if that be true) without Torment in the life to come; they whet their Wits to annihilate the Joys of Heaven, wherein they see (if any such be) they can have no part; and likewise the pains of Hell, wherein their portion must needs be very great. They labor therefore, not that they may not deserve those pains, but that deserving them, there may be no such pains to seize upon them: But what conceit can be imagined more base, then that man should strive to perswade himself, even against the secret instinct (no doubt) of his own Minde, that his Soul is as the Soul of a Beast, Mortal and corruptible with the Body? Against which barbarous Opinion, their own <hi>Atheism</hi> is a very strong Argument; <hi>For were not the Soul a Nature separable from the Body, how could it enter into discourse of things meerly Spiritual, and nothing at all pertaining to the Body? Surely, the Soul were not able to conceive any thing of Heaven, no nor so much as to dispute against Heaven, and against God, if there were nor in it somewhat Heavenly, and derived from God.</hi>

                  <p>The last which have received strength and encouragement from the Reformers, are <hi>Papists</hi>; against whom, although they are most bitter enemies, yet unwittingly they have given them great advantage. For what can any enemy rather desire, then the breach and dissention of those which are Confederates against him? Wherein they are to remember, That if our Communion with <hi>Papists</hi> in some few Ceremonies do
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66185:29"/>
so much strengthen them, as is pretended, How much more doth this Division and Rent among our selves, especially seeing it is maintained to be, not in light Matters onely, but even in Matter of Faith and Salvation? Which over-reaching Speech of theirs, because it is so open to advantage for the <hi>Barrowist</hi> and the <hi>Papist,</hi> we are to wish and hope for, that they will acknowledge it to have been spoken rather in heat of affection, then with soundness of judgment; and that through their exceeding love that Creature of Discipline which themselves have bred, nourished, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, their mouth in commendation of her, did soon overflow.</p>
                  <p>From hence you may proceed (but the means of connexion I leave to your self) to another Discourse, which I think very meet to be handled, either here or els where at large; the parts whereof may be these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in this cause between them and us, Men are to sever the proper and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Points in Controversie, from those which are accidental. The most essential and proper are these two; Overthrow of <hi>Episcopal, Erection</hi> of <hi>Presbyterial Authority.</hi> But in these two Points whosoever joyneth with them, is a counted of their number; whosoever in all other Points agreeth with them, yet thinketh the <hi>Authority of Bishops</hi> not unlawful, and of <hi>Elders</hi> not necessary, may justly be severed from their retinue. Those things therefore which either in the Persons, or in the Laws and Orders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are faulty, may be complained on, acknowledged, and amended; yet they no whit the nearer their main purpose: For what if all Errors by them supposed in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> were amended, even according to their own hearts desire; if <hi>Non-Residence, Pluralities,</hi> and the like, were utterly taken away; are their <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> therefore presently authorised, or their <hi>Soveraign Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction</hi> established?</p>
                  <p>But even in their complaining against the outward and accidental Matters in Church-Government, they are many ways faulty. 1. In their end which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to themselves. For in declaiming against abuses, their meaning is not to have them redressed, but by disgracing the present State to make way for their own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. As therefore in <hi>Venice,</hi> if any Senator should discourse against the Power of their Senate, as being either too Soveraign or too weak in Government, with purpose to draw their Authority to a Moderation, it might well be suffered; but not so, if it should appear he spake with purpose to induce another State by depraving the present: So in all Causes belonging either to Church or Commonwealth, we are to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, what minde the Complaining part doth bear, whether of Amendment or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and accordingly, either to suffer or suppress it. Their Objection therefore is frivolous, <hi>Why may not Men speak against Abuses?</hi> Yes; but with desire to cure the Part affected, not to destroy the Whole. 2. A second fault is in their manner of Complaining, not onely because it is for the most part in bitter and reproachful terms, but also it is to the common people, <hi>Who are Iudges incompetent and insufficient, both to determine any thing amiss; and for want of skill and authority, to amend it.</hi> Which also discovereth their intent and purpose to be rather destructive then corrective. 3. Thirdly, Those very Exceptions which they take, are frivolous and impertinent. Some things indeed they accuse as impious, which if they may appear to be such, God forbid they should be maintained.</p>
                  <p>Against the rest it is onely alleged, That they are idle Ceremonies without use, and that better and more profitable might be devised; wherein they are doubly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd: For neither is it a sufficient Plea to say, This must give place, because a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be devised; because in our judgments of better and worse, we oftentimes conceive amiss, when we compare those things which are in device, with those which are in practice: <hi>For the Imperfections of the one are hid, till by time and tryal they be discovered</hi>; the others are already manifest and open to all. But last of all, (which is a Point in my Opinion of great regard, and which I am desirous to have enlarg'd) they do not see that for the most part when they strike at the <hi>State Ecclesiastical,</hi> they secretly wound the <hi>Civil State:</hi> For Personal Faults, <hi>What can be said against the Church, which may not also agree to the Commonwealth?</hi> In both Statesmen have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been, and will be always, Men, sometimes blinded with Error, most commonly perverted by Passions: Many unworthy have been and are advanced in both, many worthy not regarded. And as for abuses which they pretend to be in the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they inveigh against <hi>Non-Residence,</hi> do they take it a matter lawful or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66185:30"/>
expedient in the <hi>Civil State,</hi> for a Man to have a great and gainful Office in the <hi>North,</hi> himself continually remaining in the <hi>South? He that hath an Office, let him attend his Office.</hi> When they condemn <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Livings Spiritual</hi> to the Pit of Hell; what think they of <hi>Infinite</hi> of <hi>Temporal Promotions?</hi> By the <hi>Great Philosopher, Pol. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. it is forbidden as a thing most dangerous to Commonwealths, that by the same Man many great Offices should be exercised. When they deride our Ceremonies as vain and frivolous, were it hard to apply their Exceptions, even to those Civil Ceremonies which at the <hi>Coronation,</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all <hi>Courts of Iustice</hi> are used? Were it hard to argue, even against <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> as being a cruel Ceremony?

                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude: You may exhort the <hi>Clergy,</hi> (or, what if you direct your Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion not to the <hi>Clergy</hi> in general, but onely to the Learned in or of both <hi>Universities?</hi>) You may exhort them to a due consideration of all things, and to a right esteem and valuing of each thing in that degree wherein it ought to stand: <hi>For it oftentimes falleth out, that what Men have either devised themselves, or greatly delighted in; the price and the excellency thereof, they do admire above desert.</hi> The chiefest labor of a <hi>Christian</hi> should be know; of a <hi>Minister,</hi> to <hi>Preach Christ crucified:</hi> In regard whereof, not onely worldly things, but things otherwise precious, even the <hi>Discipline</hi> it self, is vile and base. Whereas now, by the heat of Contention and violence of Affection, the Zeal of Men towards the one, hath greatly decayed their love to the other. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto therefore they are to be exhorted, to <hi>Preach Christ crucified,</hi> the <hi>Mortification of the Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Renewing of the Spirit</hi>; not those things which in time of Strife seem precious, but (Passions being allayed) are vain and childish.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>MOst Reverend in Christ, the long continued,<note place="margin">The cause of Writing this General Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> and more then ordinary favor, which hither to your Grace hath been pleased to shew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, may justly claim at my hands some thankful acknowledgment thereof. In which consideration, as also for that I embrace willingly the ancient received course, and conveniency of that Discipline, which teacheth inferior Degrees and Orders in the Church of God, to submit their Writings to the same Authority, from which their allowable dealings whatsoever, in such affairs, must receive approbation, I nothing fear but that your accustomed clemency will take in good worth, the offer of these my simple and mean Labors, bestowed for the necessary justification of Laws heretofore made question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because, as I take it, they were not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: For surely, I cannot finde any great cause of just complaint, that good Laws have so much been wanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as we to them. To seek Reformation of evil Laws, is a commendable endeavor; but for us the more necessary, is a speedy redress of our selves. We have on all sides lost much of our first fervency towards God; and therefore concerning our own degenerated ways, we have reason to exhort with St. <hi>Gregory,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>although we continue the same we are, the harm is not great.</hi> These fervent Reprehenders of things established by Publick Authority, are always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and bold spirited men. But their confidence for the most part riseth from too much credit given to their own wits, for which cause they are seldom free from Error. The Errors which we seek to reform in this kinde of men, are such as both received at your own hands their first wound, and from that time to this present, have been proceeded in with that Moderation, which useth by Patience to suppress boldness, and to make them conquer that suffer. Wherein considering the nature and kinde of these Controversies, the dangerous sequels whereunto they were likely to grow, and how many ways we have been thereby taught Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I may boldly aver concerning the first, that as the weightiest conflicts the Church hath had, were those which touched the Head, the Person of our Savior Christ; and the next of importance, those questions which are at this day between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Actions of the Body of the Church of God; so these which have lastly sprung up from Complements, Rites, and Ceremonies of Church Actions, are in truth, for the greatest part, such silly things, that very easiness doth make them hard to be disputed of in serious manner. Which also may seem to be the cause, why divers of the Reverend Prelacy, and other most judicious men, have especially bestowed their pains about the Matter of Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding, led by your Graces example, my self have thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to wade through the whole Cause, following that method which searcheth the Truth by the causes of Truth. Now if any marvel, how a thing in it self so weak, could import any great danger, they must consider not so much how small the spark is that flieth up, as how apt things about it, are to take fire. Bodies Politick being subject as much as
<pb facs="tcp:66185:25"/>
Natural, to dissolution, by divers means; there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly more estates overthrown through diseases, bred within themselves, then through violence from abroad; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our manner is always to cast a doubtful and a more suspicious eye towards that; over which we know we have least power: And therefore, the fear of External dangers, causeth forces at home to be the more united. It is to all sorts a kinde of Bridle, it maketh vertuous Mindes watchful, it holdeth contrary Dispositions in suspense, and it setteth those Wits on work in better things, which could be else imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in worse; whereas on the other side, domestical Evils, for that we think we can master them at all times, are often permitted to run on forward, till it be too late to recal them. In the mean while, the Commonwealth is not onely through unsoundness so far impaired, as those evils chance to prevail; but farther also, through opposition arising between the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound parts and the sound, where each endeavoreth to draw evermore contrary ways, till destruction in the end, bring the whole to ruine.</p>
                  <p>To reckon up how many Causes there are, by force whereof Divisions may grow in a Commonwealth, is not here necessary. Such as rise from variety in Matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are not onely the farthest spred, because in Religion all men presume themselves interessed alike, but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the most part, hotlier prosecuted and pursued then other strifes; for as much as coldness, which in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, may be thought to proceed from Moderation, is not in these so favorably construed. The part which in this present quarrel, striveth against the Current and Stream of Laws, was a long while nothing feared, the wisest content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to call to minde how Errors have their effect, many times not proportioned to that little appearance of Reason, whereupon they would seem built, but rather to the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affection or fancy which is cast towards them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from other Causes. For there are divers Motives drawing men to favor mightily those Opinions, wherein their Perswasions are but weakly setled; and if the Passions
<pb facs="tcp:66185:26"/>
of the Minde be strong, they easily sophisticate the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they make it apt to believe upon very slender warrant, and to imagine infallible Truth, where scarce any probable shew appeareth.</p>
                  <p>Thus were those poor seduced Creatures, <hi>Hacquet</hi> and his other two adherents, whom I can neither speak nor think of, but with much commisseration and pity. Thus were they trained by fair ways first, accompting their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary love to his Discipline, a token of Gods more then ordinary love towards them. From hence they grew to a strong conceit, that God which had moved them to love his Discipline, more then the common sort of men did, might have a purpose by their means to bring a wonderful work to pass, beyond all mens expectation; for the advancement of the Throne of Discipline by some Tragical Execution, with the particularities, whereof it was not safe for their Friends to be made acquainted; of whom, they did therefore but covertly demand, what they thought of extraordinary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit in these days; and withal request to be commended unto God by their Prayers, whatsoever should be undertaken by Men of God, in meer Zeal to his Glory, and the good of his distressed Church. With this unusual and strange course they went on forward, till God, in whose heaviest worldly Judgments, I nothing doubt, but that there may lie hidden Mercy, gave them over their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and left them made, in the end, an example for Head-strong and Inconsiderate Zeal, no less fearful then <hi>Achitophel,</hi> for Proud and Irreligious Wisdom. If a spark of Error have thus far prevailed, falling even where the Wood was green, and farthest off, to all mens thinking, from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination unto furious Attempts, must not the peril thereof, be greater in men whose mindes are of themselves as dry sewel, apt beforehand unto Tumults, Seditions, and Broyls? But by this we see in a Cause of Religion, to how desperate adventures, men will strain themselves for relief of their own part, having Law and Authority against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66185:26"/>Furthermore, Let not any man think, that in such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, either part can free it self from inconveniencies, sustained not onely through a kinde of Truce; which Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue on both sides, doth make with Vice, during War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and Error; but also, in that there are hereby so fit occasions ministred for men to purchase to themselves welwillers by the colour, under which they oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute quarrels of Envy or Inveterate Malice, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because Contentions were as yet never able to prevent two Evils: The one a mutual exchange of unseemly and unjust disgraces, offered by men, whose Tongues and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are out of rule; the other, a common hazard of both, to be made a prey by such as study how to work upon all Occurents, with most advantage in private.

Such Proctors and Patrons the Truth might spare: Yet is not their grossness so intolerable, as on the contrary side, the scurrilous and more then Satyrical immodesty of Martinism; the first published Schedules whereof, being brought to the hands of a grave and a very Honorable Knight, with signification given, that the Book would refresh his spirits, he took it, saw what the Title was, read over an unsavory sentence or two, and delivered back the Libel with this Answer. <hi>I am sorry you are of the minde to be solaced with these sports, and sorrier you have herein thought mine affection to be like your own.</hi> But as these sores on all hands lie open, so the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est wounds of the Church of God, have been more softly and closely given. It being perceived, that the Plot of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline

did not onely bend it self to reform Ceremonies, but seek farther to erect a popular authority of Elders, and to take away Episcopal Jurisdiction, together with all other Ornaments and means, whereby any difference or inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is upheld in the Ecclesiastical Order; towards this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive part, they have found many helping hands, divers although peradventure not willing to be yoked with Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, yet contented (for what intent God doth know) to uphold opposition against Bishops, not without greater hurt to the course of their whole proceedings in the business of God and Her Majesties service, then otherwise much more weighty Adversaries had been able by their own power to have brought to pass. Men are naturally better contented to have their commendable actions supprest, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary much divulged. And because the Wits of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are such, that many things they cannot lay hold on at once, but being possest with some notable either dislike or liking of any one thing whatsoever, sundry other in the mean time may escape them unperceived: Therefore if men desirous to have their Vertues noted, do in this respect grieve at the same of others, whose glory obscureth and darkness theirs, it cannot be chosen, but that when the ears of the people are thus continually beaten with exclamations against abuses in the Church; these tunes come always most acceptable to them, whose odious and corrupt dealings in secular affairs, both pass by that mean the more covertly; and whatsoever happen, do also the least feel that scourge of vulgar imputation, which notwithstanding they most deserve.

At your hands, beloved in our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, (for in him the love which we bear unto all that would but seem to be born of him, it is not the Sea of your Gall and Bitterness that shall ever drown) I have no great cause to look for other, then the self-same portion and lot, which your manner hath been hitherto to lay on them that concur not in Opinion and Sentence with you. But our hope it, that the God of Peace shall (notwithstanding mans nature; too impatical of contumelious malediction) enable us quietly, and even gladly to suffer all things for that work sake, which we covet to perform. The wonderful seal and fervor wherewith ye have with stood the received Orders of this Church, was the first thing which caused me to enter into consideration, Whether (as all your published Books and Writings peremptorily maintain) every Christian man fearing God, stand bound to joyn with you for the furtherance of that which ye term <hi>The Lords Discipline.</hi> Wherein I must plainly confess unto you, that before I examined your sundry Declarations in that behalf, it could not settle in my head to think, but that undoubtedly such numbers of otherwise right well-affected and most religiously enclined minds, had some marvellous reasonable enducements which led them with so great earnestness that way, But when once, as near as my slender ability would serve, I had with travel and care performed that part of the Apostles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counsel in such cases, whereby be willeth to <hi>try all things,</hi> and was come at the length so far, that there remained only the other clause to be satisfied, wherein he concludeth, that <hi>what good is, must be held</hi>: There was in my poor understanding no remedy, but to set down this as my final resolute perswasion. <hi>Surely, the present Form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which the Laws of this Land have established, is such, as no Law of God, nor Reason of Man hath hitherto been alledged of force, sufficient to prove they do ill, who to the uttermost of their power, withstand the alteration thereof.</hi> Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>The other, which instead of it, we are required to accept, is onely by Error and misconceipt, named the Ordinance of Jesus Christ, no one Proof as yet brought forth, whereby it may clearly appear to be so in very deed.</hi> The Explication of which two things, I have here thought good to offer into your own hands; Heartily beseeching you,

even by the Meekness of Iesus Christ, whom I trust ye love, That, as ye tender the Peace and Quietness of this Church, if there be in you that gracious Humility which hath ever been the Crown and Glory of a Christianly disposed minde: If your own souls, hearts, and consciences, (the sound integrity whereof can but hardly stand with the refusal of Truth in personal respects) be, as I doubt not, but they are things most dear and precious unto you: <hi>Let not the Faith which ye have in our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>

A Founder it had, whom, for mine own part, I think incomparably the wisest man that ever the French Church did injoy, since the hour it injoyed him, His bringing up was in the study of the Civil Law. Divine knowledge he gathered not by hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much, as by teaching others. For though thousands were debters to him, as touching knowledge in that kinde, yet be to none but onely to God, the Author of that most blessed Fountain <hi>The Book of Life,</hi> and of the admirable dexterity of Wit, together with the helps of other learning which were his Guides; till being occasioned to leave <hi>France,</hi> he sell at the length upon <hi>Geneva.</hi> Which City, the Bishop and Clergy thereof, had a little before (as some affirm) forsaken, being of likelihood frighted with the peoples sudden attempt for abolishment of Popish Religion; the event of which enterprize, they thought it not safe for themselves to wait for in that place. At the coming of <hi>Calvin</hi> thither, the form of their Civil Regiment was popular, as it continueth at this day: Neither King, nor Duke, nor Nobleman of any authority or power over them, but Officers chosen by the people out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to order all things with publick consent. For Spiritual Government, they had no Laws at all agreed upon, but did what the Pastors of their Souls, by perswasion, could win them unto. <hi>Calvin</hi> being admitted one of their Preachers and a Divinity-Reader amongst them, considered how dangerous it was, that the whole estate of that Church should hang still on so slender a thred, as the liking of an ignorant multitude is, if it have power to change whatsoever it self listeth. Wherefore taking unto him two of the other Ministers, for more countenance of the action (albeit the rest were all against it) they moved, and in the end perswaded, with much ado, the people to binde themselves by solemn Oath, first, Never to admit the Papecy amongst them again; and secondly, To live in obedience unto such Orders concerning the Exercise of their Religion, and the Form of their Ecclesiastical Government, as those their true and faithful Ministers of Gods Word had agreeably to Scripture set down for that end and purpose. When these things began to be put in ure, the people also (what causes moving them thereunto, themselves best know) began to repent them of that they had done, and irefully to champ upon the Bit they had taken into their Mouths, the rather, for that they grew by means of this Innovation into dislike with some Churches near about them, the benefit of whose good friendship, their State could not well lack. It was the manner of those times, (whether through mens desire, to enjoy alone the glory of their own enterprises, or else, because the quickness of their occasions required pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent dispatch;) so it was, that every particular Church did that within it self, which some few of their own thought good, by whom the rest were all directed. Such number of Churches then being, though free within themselves, yet small common Conference before-hand might have eased them of much after trouble. But a great inconvenience it bred, That every later endeavored to be certain degrees more removed from Conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the rest before had been; whereupon grew marvellous great dissimilitudes, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof, jealousies, heart-burnings, jars, and discords amongst them. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing might have easily been prevented, if the Orders which each Church did think fit and convenient for it self, had not so peremptorily been established under that high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Form, which rendred them unto the people, as things everlastingly required by the Law of the Lord of Lords, against whose Statutes there is no exception to be taken. For by this mean it came to pass, that one Church could not but accuse and condemn another of disobedience to the Will of Christ, in those things where manifest difference was between
<pb facs="tcp:66185:31"/>
them; whereas the self-same Orders allowed, but yet established in more wary and suspence manner, as bring to stand in force till God should give the opportunity of some General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, what might be best for every of them afterwards to do: This, I say, had both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all occasion of just dislike which others might take, and reserved a greater liberty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Authors themselves, of entring into farther Consultation afterwards. Which though never so necessary, they could not easily now admit, without some fear of derogation from their credit: And therefore that which once they had done; they became for ever after resolute to maintain. <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore, and the other two his Associates, stifly refusing to administer the Holy Communion to such as would not quietly, without contradiction and murmur, submit themselves unto the Orders which their Solemn Oath had bound them to obey, were in that quarrel, banished the Town, A few years after (such was the levity of that people) the places of one or two of their Ministers being faln void, they were not before so willing to be rid of their Learned Pastor, as now importunate to obtain him again from them who had given him entertainment, and which were loth to part with him, had not unresistable earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness been used. One of the Town-Ministers that saw in what manner the people were bent for the Revocation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> gave him notice of their affection in this sort.<note place="margin">Epist.

                     <hi>was now made the Head of the Corner.</hi> The other two whom they had thrown out (together with <hi>Calvin</hi>) they were content should enjoy their exile. Many causes might lead them to be more desirous of him. First, It is yielding unto them in one thing, might happily put them in hope, that time would breed the like easiness of condescending further unto them: For in his absence be had perswaded them, with whom he was able to prevail; that albeit, himself did better like of Common Bread to be used in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> yet the other they rather should accept, then cause any trouble in the Church about it. Again, they saw that the name of <hi>Calvin</hi> wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day greater abroad, and that together with his fame, their infamy was spred, who had so rashly and childishly ejected him. Besides, it was not unlikely, but that his credit in the World, might many ways stand the poor Town in great stead: As the truth is, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Foreign estimation hitherto hath been the best stake in their Hedge. But whatsoever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret respects were likely to move them, for contenting of their mindes, <hi>Calvin</hi> returned (as it had been another <hi>Tully</hi>) to his old Home. He ripely considered how gross a thing it were for men of his quality, wise and grave men, to live with such a multitude, and to be Tenants at will under them; as their Ministers, both himself and others had been. For the remedy of which inconvenience, he gave them plainly to understand, That if he did become their Teacher again, they must be content to admit a compleat Form of Discipline, which both they and also their Pastors, should now be solemnly sworn to observe for ever after: Of which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, the Main and Principal parts were these. A standing Ecclesiastical Court to be established: Perpetual Iudges in that Court to be their Ministers; others of the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually chosen (twice so many in number as they) to be Iudges together with them in the same Court. These two sorts, to have the care of all Mens manners, power of determining of all kinde of Ecclesiastical Causes, and authority to Convent, to Controll, to Punish, as far as with Excommunication, whom soever they should think worthy, none either small or great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. This device, I see not, how the wisest at that time living, could have bettered, if we duly consider what the present State of <hi>Geneva</hi> did then require: For their Bishop and his Clergy being (as it is said) departed from them by Moon-light; or howsoever, being departed, to chuse in his room any other Bishop, had been a thing altogether impossible: And for their Ministers to seek, that themselves alone might have coercive power over the whole Church, would perhaps have been hardly construed at that time. But when so frank an offer was made; that for every one Minister, there should be two of the people to sit and give voice in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Consistory, what inconvenience could they easily finde which themselves might not be able always to remedy? Howbeit (as ever more the simpler sort are, even when they see no apparent cause, jealous, notwithstanding, over the secret intents and purposes of wiser men) this Proposition of his did somewhat trouble them. Of the Ministers, themselves which had staid behinde in the City when <hi>Calvin</hi> was gone, some, upon knowledge of the peoples earnest intent to recal him to his place again, had beforehand written their Letters of Submission,
<pb facs="tcp:66185:32"/>
and assured him of their alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>giance for ever after, if it should like him to hearken unto that Publick Suit: But yet misdoubting what might happen, if this Discipline did go forward, they objected against it, the example of other Reformed Churches, living quietly and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without it. Some of the chiefest place and countenance amongst the Laity, professed with greater stomach their judgments, that such a Discipline was little better then Popish Tyranny, disguised and tendered unto them under a new Form. This sort, it may be, had some fear that the filling up of the Seats in the Consistory with so great a member of Laymen; was but to please the mindes of the people, to the end, they might think their own sway somewhat, but when things came to tryal of practice, their Pastors learning, would be at all times of force to over-perswade simple men, who knowing the time of their own Presidentship to be but short, would always stand in fear of their Ministers perpetual authority. And among the Ministers themselves, one being so far in estimation above the rest, the voices of the rest were likely to be given for the most part respectively with a kinde of secret dependency and aw: So that in shew, a marvellous indifferently composed Senate, Ecclesiastical was to govern; but in effect one onely man should, as the Spirit and Soul of the residue, do all in all. But what did these vain surmises boot? Brought they were now to so strait an issue, that of two things, they must chuse one: Namely, Whether they would to their endless disgrace, with ridiculous lightness dismiss him, whose restitution they had in so impotent manner desired, or else condescend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that demand, wherein he was resolute, either to have it, or to leave them. They thought it better to be somewhat hardly yoked at home, then for ever abroad discredited. Wherefore, in the end, those Orders were on all sides assented unto, with no less alacrity of minde, then Cities unable to hold out longer,<note place="margin">An. Dom. 1541.</note> are wont to shew when they take conditions, such as liketh him to offer them, which hath them in the narrow streights of advantage. Not many years were over passed, before these twice-sworn men adventured to give their last and hottest assault to the Fortress of the same Discipline, childishly granting by common consent of their whole Senate, and that under their Town-Seal, a Relaxation to one <hi>Bertelier,</hi> whom the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship had Excommunicated: Further also decreeing, with strange absurdity, that to the same Senate, it should belong to give final judgment in Matter of Excommunication, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve whom it pleased them; clean contrary to their own former Deeds and Oaths. The report of which Decree, being fortwith brought unto <hi>Calvin; Before</hi> (saith he) <hi>this Decree take place, either my Blood or Banishment shall sign it.</hi> Again, two days before the Communion should be celebrated, this speech was publickly to like effect. <hi>Kill me, if ever this hand do teach forth the things that are holy, to them whom the Church hath judged despisers.</hi> Whereupon, for fear of tumult, the forenamed <hi>Bertelier</hi> was by his friends advised for that time, not to use the liberty granted him by the Senate, nor to present himself in the Church, till they saw somewhat further what would ensue. After the Communion quietly ministred, and some likelihood of peaceable ending of these troubles, without any more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>; that very day in the afternoon, besides all mens expectation, concluding his ordinary Sermon, he telleth them, That because he neither had learned nor taught to strive with such as are in Authority; <hi>therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>the case so standing, as now it doth, let me use these words of the Apostle unto you. I commend you unto God, and the Word of his Grace</hi>; and so bad them heartily <hi>Adieu.</hi> It sometimes cometh to pass, that the readiest way which a wise man hath to conquer, is to flie. This voluntary and unexpected mention of sudden departure, caused presently the Senate (for according to their wonted manner, they still continued onely constant in unconstancy) to gather themselves together, and for a time to suspend their own Decree, leaving things to proceed as before, till they had heard the judgment of Four Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian Cities, concerning the matter which was in strife. This to have done at the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave assent unto any order, had shewed some wit and discretion in them; but now to do it, was as much as to say in effect, That they would play their parts on a stage. <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore dispatcheth with all expedition his Letters unto some Principal Pastor in every of those Cities, craving earnestly at their hands, to respect this Cause as a thing whereupon the whole State of Religion and Piety in that Church did so much depend: That God and all good men, were now inevitably certain to be trampled under foot, unless those Four Cities by their good means, might be brought to give sentence with the Ministers of <hi>Geneva,</hi> when the Cause should be brought before them; yea, so to give it, that two things it might effectually contain: The one an Absolute Approbation of the Discipline of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as consonant unto the Word of God, without any cautions, qualifications, ifs, or ands; the other, an earnest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition not to innovate or charge the same. His vehement request herein, as touching both
<pb facs="tcp:66185:32"/>
points, was satisfied. For albeit, the said Helvetian Churches did never as yet observe that Discipline, nevertheless the Senate of <hi>Geneva</hi> having required their judgment concerning, these three Questions: <hi>First, After what manner, by Gods Commandment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist. 166:</note> 
                     <hi>according to the Scripture, and unspotted Religion, Excommunication is to be exercised: Secondly, Whether it may not be exercised some other way, then by the Consistory? Thirdly, What the use of their Churches was to do in this case?</hi> Answer was returned from the said Churches, <hi>That they had heard already of those Consistorial Laws, and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be godly Ordinances,</hi> drawing towards <hi>the prescript of the Word of God; for which cause that they did not think it good for the Church of</hi> Geneva, <hi>by innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to change the same, but rather to keep them as they were,</hi> Which answer, although not answering unto the former demands, but respecting what Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> had judged requisite for them to answer, was notwithstanding accepted without any further Reply; in as much as they plainly saw, that when stomach doth strive with wit, the match is not equal; and so the heat of their former contentions began to slake. The present inhabitants of <hi>Geneva,</hi> I hope, will not take it in evil part, that the faultiness of their people heretofore, is by us so far forth laid open, as their own Learned Guides and Pastors have thought necessary to discover it unto the World. For out of their Books and Writings it is, that I have collected this whole Narration, to the end, it might thereby appear in what sort amongst them, that Discipline was planted, for which so much contention is raised amongst our selves. The Reasons which moved <hi>Calvin</hi> herein to be so earnest, was, as <hi>Beza</hi> himself testifieth:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>For that he saw how needful these Bridles were to be put in the Jaws of that City.</hi> That which by Wisdom he saw to be requisite for that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was by as great wisdom compassed: But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. That which <hi>Calvin</hi> did for establishment of his Discipline, seemeth more commendable then that which he taught for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in us all, a love to our own Counsels: The contradiction of others is a fan to inflame that love. Our love set on fire to maintain that which once we have done, sharpneth the wit to dispute, to argue, and by all means to reason for it. Wherfore a marvel it were, if a man of so great capacity, having such incitements to make him desirous of all kinde of furtherances unto his cause, could espie in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority it self was the same way somewhat inclinable. And all which the wit even of <hi>Calvin</hi> was able from thence to draw, by sifting the very utmost sentence and syllable; is no more then, that certain speeches there are, which to him did seem to intimate; that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches ought to have their Elderships endued with power of Excommunication; and that a part of those Elderships every where, should be chosen out from amongst the Laity, after that Form which himself had framed <hi>Geneva</hi> unto. But what Argument are ye able to shew, whereby it was ever proved by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that any one sentence of Scripture doth necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force these things, or the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his against the Orders of your own Church? We should be injurious unto Vertue it self, if we did derogate from them whom their industry hath made great. Two things of principal moment there are, which have deservedly procured him honor throughout the World: The one his exceeding pains in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Institution of Christian Religion; the other, his no less industrious travels for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of holy Scripture, according unto the same Institutions. In which two things, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were that after him bestowed their labor, he gained the advantage of prejudice against them, if they gainsaid, and of glory above them, if they consented. His Writings, published after the question about that Discipline, was once begun, omit not any the least occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of extolling the use, and singular necessity thereof. Of what account the Master of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences was in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the same and more amongst the Preachers of Reformed Churches, <hi>Calvin</hi> had purchased: So that the perfectest Divines were judged they, which were skilfullest in <hi>Calvins</hi> Writings. His Books almost the very Canon to judge both Doctrine and Discipline by: <hi>French</hi> Churches, both under others abroad, and at home in their own Countrey, all cast according unto that mold which <hi>Calvin</hi> had made. The Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in erecting the Fabrick of their Reformation, took the self-same pattern; till at lenght the Discipline which was at the first so weak, that without the staff of their approbation, who were not subject unto it themselves, it had not brought others under subjection, began now to challenge Universal Obedience, and to enter into open conflict with those very Churches, which in desperate extremity had been relievers of it. To one of those Churches which lived in most peaceable sort, and abounded as well with men for their learning in other Professions singular, as also with Divines, whose equals were not elswhere to be found, a Church ordered by <hi>Gualters</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66185:33"/>
Discipline, and not by that which <hi>Geneva</hi> adoreth. Unto this Church of <hi>Heidelburgh,</hi> there cometh one who craving leave to dispute publickly, defendeth with open disdain of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that to a <hi>Minister, with his Eldership, power is given by the Law of God to Excommunicate whomsoever, yea, even Kings and Princes themselves.</hi> Here were the seeds sown of that controversie which sprang up between <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Erastus,</hi> about the Matter of Excommunication, Whether there ought to be in all Churches an Eldership, having power to Excommunicate, and a part of that Eldership to be of necessity certain, chosen out from amongst the Laity for that purpose. In which Disputation they have, as to me it seemeth, divided very equally the Truth between them: <hi>Beza</hi> most truly maintaining the necessity of Excommunication; <hi>Erastus</hi> as truly, the non-necessity of Lay-Elders to be Ministers thereof.

Under the happy Reign of Her Majesty, which now is, the greatest matter a while contended for, was the wearing of the Cap and Surpless, till there came Admonitions directed unto the High Court of Parliament, by men who concealing their names, thought it glory enough to discover their mindes and affections, which now were universally bent even against all the Orders and Laws, wherein this Church is found uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Platform of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Concerning the Defender of which Admonitions, all that I mean to say, is but this. <hi>There will come a time, when three words uttered with Charity and Meekness, shall receive a far more blessed Reward, then three thousand Volumns written with disdainful sharpness of Wit.</hi> But the manner of Mens Writings must not alienate our hearts from the Truth, if it appear they have the Truth, as the Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the same Defender do think he hath; and in that perswasion they follow him, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then himself doth <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and others; with the like perswasion that they in this cause had the Truth. We being as fully perswaded otherwise, it resteth, that some kinde of tryal be used to finde out which part is in error.</p>

                        <hi>The Author of the Petition directed to Her Majesty,</hi> pag. 3.</note> Weigh what doth move the common sort so much to favor this Innovation, and it shall soon appear unto you, that the force of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reasons, which for your several Opinions are alleaged, is a thing whereof the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude never did, nor could so consider as to be therewith wholly carried; but certain general Inducements are used to make saleable your Cause in gross: And when once men have cast a fancy towards it, any slight Declaration of Specialties will serve to lead forward mens inclineable and prepared mindes. The method of winning the peoples affection unto a general liking of the Cause (for so ye term it) hath been this. First, in the hearing of the multitude, the faults especially of higher Callings are ripped up with marvellous exceeding severity and sharpness of Reproof; which being oftentimes dont, begetteth a great good opinion of Integrity, zeal and Holiness, to such constant reprovers of sin, as by likelihood would never be so much offended at that which is evil, unless themselves were singularly good. The next thing hereunto is, to impute all Faults and Corruptions, wherewith the World aboundeth, unto the kinde of Ecclesiastical Government established. Wherein, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by reproving Faults, they purchased unto themselves, with the multitude, a name to be vertuous; so by finding out this kinde of Cause, they obtain to be judged wise above others, whereas in truth unto the Form even of Iewish Government, which the Lord himself (they all confess) did establish, with like shew of Reason they might impute those Faults which the Prophets condemn in the Governors of that Commonwealth; as to the English kinde of Regiment Ecclesiastical (whereof also God himself, though in another sort, is Author,) the stains and blemishes found in our State; which springing from the Root of Humane Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Corruption, not onely are, but have been always more or less, yea, and (for any thing we know to the contrary) will be till the Worlds end complained of, what Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment soever take place. Having gotten thus much sway in the hearts of men, a third step is to propose their own Form of Church Government, as the onely soveraign remedy of all Evils; and to adorn it with all the glorious Titles that may be. And the Nature, as of men that have sick bodies, so likewise of the people in the crazedness of their Mindes, possest with dislike and discontentment at things present, is to imagine, that any thing (the vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:66185:34"/>
they hear commended) would help them; but that most, which they least have tryed. The fourth degree of Inducements, is by fashioning the very notions and conceits of mens mindes in such sort, that when they read the Scripture, they may think that every thing soundeth towards the advancement of that Discipline, and to the utter disgrace of the contrary. <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> by bringing up his Schollars in speculative knowledge of numbers, made their conceipts therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation of things natural, they imagined that in every particular thing, they even beheld, as it were, with their eyes, how the Elements of Number gave Essence and Being to the Works of Nature: A thing in reason impossible, which notwithstanding through their misfashioned preconceit, appeared unto them no less certain, then if Nature had written it in the very Foreheads of all the Creatures of God. When they of the <hi>Family of Love</hi> have it once in their heads, that Christ doth not signifie any one Person, but a Quality whereof many are partakers; that to be raised, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but to be regenerated, or endued with the said quality; and that when Separation of them, which have if from them, which have it not, is here made, this is judgment: How plainly do they imagine, that the Scripture every where speaketh in the favor of that Sect? And assuredly, the very cause which maketh the simple and ignorant to think, they even see how the Word of God runneth currantly on your side, is, That their mindes are forestalled, and their conceits perverted beforehand, by being taught, that an Elder doth signifie a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, admitted onely to the Office of Rule or Government in the Church; a Doctor, one which may onely Teach, and neither Preach nor Administer the Sacraments; a Deacon, one which hath charge of the Alms-box, and of nothing else: That the Scepter, the Rod, the Throne and Kingdom of Christ, art a Form of Regiment, onely by Pastors, Elders, Doctors, and Deacons; that by Mystical Resemblance, Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are the Churches which admit; <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Churches which oppugne the said Form of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in like sort, they are taught to apply all things spoken of repairing the Walls and decayed parts of the City and Temple of God, by <hi>Esdras, Nehemias,</hi> and the rest: As if purposely the Holy Ghost had therein meant to fore-signifie, what the Authors of Admonitions to the Parliament, of Supplications to the Council, of Petitions to Her Majesty, and of such other-like Writs, should either do or suffer in behalf of this their Cause. From hence they proceed to an higher point, which is the perswading of men credulous and over-capable of such pleasing Errors, That it is the special illumination of the Holy Ghost, whereby they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern those things in the Word, which others reading, yet discern them not. <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi> saith St. <hi>John,</hi>

                     <hi>Give not credit unto every spirit.</hi> There are but two ways whereby the Spirit leadeth men into all Truth; the one extraordinary, the other common; the one belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but unto some few, the other extending it self unto all that are of God; the one, that which we call by a special divine excellency, <hi>Revelation</hi>; the other, <hi>Reason.</hi> If the Spirit by such Revelation, have discovered unto them the secrets of that Discipline out of Scripture, they must profess themselves to be all (even Men, Women, and Children,) Prophets: Or if Reason be the hand which the Spirit hath led them by; for as much as Perswasions grounded upon Reason, are either weaker or stronger, according to the force of those Reasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the same are grounded, they must every of them, from the greatest to the least, be able for every several Article, to shew some special Reason, as strong as their Perswasion therein is earnest: Otherwise how can it be, but that some other sinews there are, from which that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of strength in Perswasion doth arise? Most sure it is, That when Mens Affections do frame their Opinions, they are in defence of Error more earnest a great deal, then (for the most part) sound Believers in the maintenance of Truth, apprehended according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that evidence which Scripture yieldeth: Which being in some things plain, as in the Principles of Christian Doctrine; in some things, as in these Matters of Discipline, more dark and doubtful, frameth correspondently that inward assent which Gods most gracious Spirit worketh by it, as by his Effectual Instrument. It is not therefore the servent earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their perswasion, but the soundness of those Reasons, whereupon the same is built, which must declare their Opinions in these things, to have been wrought by the Holy Ghost, and not by the <hi>Fraud</hi> of that evil spirit which is even in his illusions strong.<note place="margin">

This hath bred high terms of Separation between such, and
<pb facs="tcp:66185:34"/>
the rest of the World; whereby the one sort are named The Brethren, the Godly, and so forth; the other, Worldlings, Time-servers, Pleasers of Men, not of God, with such like. From hence, they are easily drawn on to think it exceeding necessary; for fear of quenching that good Spirit, to use all means whereby the same may be both strengthned in themselves; and made manifest unto others. This maketh them diligent bearers of such as are known that way to incline; this maketh them eager to take and seek all occasions of secret Conference with such; this maketh them glad to use such as Counsellors and Directors in all their dealings, which are of weight, as Contracts, Testaments, and the like; this maketh them, through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariable desire of receiving instruction from the Masters of that Company, to cast off the care of those very affairs which do most concern their estate, and to think that then they are like unto <hi>Mary,</hi> commendable for making choice of the better part. Finally, This is it which maketh them willing to charge, yea, oftentimes even to over-charge themselves, for such Mens sustenance and relief, least their zeal to the Cause should any way be unwitnessed. For what is it, which poor beguiled souls, will not do through so powerful incitements? In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it is also noted, that most labor hath been bestowed to win, and retain towards this Cause, them whose judgments are commonly weakest by reason of their sex. And although not Women <hi>loaden with sins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</note> as the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, but (as we verily esteem of them for the most part) Women propense and inclinable to holiness, be otherwise edified in good things, rather then carried away as captives into any kinde of sin and evil, by such as enter into their houses with purpose to plant there a zeal, and a love towards this kinde of Discipline; yet some occasion is hereby ministred for Men, to think, that if the Cause which is thus furthered, did gain by the soundness of proof, whereupon it doth build it self, it would not most busily endeavor to prevail, where least ability of judgment is: And therefore that this so eminent industry in making Proselytes, more of that sex then of the other; groweth for that they are deemed apter to serve as instruments and helps in the Cause. Apter they are through the eagerness of their affection, that maketh them which way soever they take, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in drawing their Husbands, Children, Servants, Friends and Allies, the same way: Apter through that natural inclination unto pity, which breedeth in them a greater readiness then in men, to be bountiful towards their Preachers, who suffer want: Apter through sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry opportunities, which they especially have, to procure encouragements for their Brethren. Finally, Apter through a singular delight which they take, in giving very large and particular intelligence, how all near about them stand affected, as concerning the same Cause. But be they Women, or be they Men, if once they have tasted of that Cup, let any man of contrary opinion, open his mouth to perswade them, they close up their ears; his Reasons they weigh not, all is answered with rehearsal of the words of <hi>John,</hi>

For which purpose, Sentences out of the Word of God, ye alledge divers; but so, that when the same are aiscust, thus it always in a manner falleth out, That what things by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye urge upon us, as altogether necessary, are found to be thence collected onely by poor and marvellous slight conjectures.

C. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 97.</note> that men should be willed to seek for examples and patterns of Government in any of those times that have been before, Ye plainly hold, that from the very Apostles times till this present age wherein your selves imagine ye have sound out aright pattern of sound Discipline, there never was any time safe to be followed; which thing ye thus endeavor to prove.<note place="margin">Euseb. 3. l 32.</note> Out of <hi>Egesippus,</hi> ye say, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> writeth, How although as long as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles lived, the Church did remain a pure Virgin; yet after the death of the Apostles, and after they were once gone, whom God vouchsafed to make Hearers of the Divine Wisdom with their own ears,<note place="margin">Lib.

Hereupon ye conclude, that it is not safe to fetch our Government from any other then the Apostles times. Wherein by the way it may be noted, that in proposing the Apostles times as a pattern for the Church to follow, though the desire of you all be one, the drift and purpose of you all is not one. The chiefest thing which Lay-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers yawn for, is, that the Clergy may through Conformity in State and Condition, be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical, poor as the Apostles of Christ were poor. In which one circumstance, if they imagine so great perfection, they must think that Church which hath such store of Mendicant Fryers, a Church in that respect most happy. Were it for the glory of God, and the good of his Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Clergy should be left even as bare as the Apostles; when they had neither staff nor scrip; that God, which should lay upon them the condition of his Apostles; would I hope, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them with the self-same affection which was in that holy Apostle, whose words concerning his own right-vertuous contentment of heart,<note place="margin">

are a most fit Episcopal emprese. The Church of Christ is a Body Mystical. A Body cannot stand, unless the parts thereof be proportionable: Let it therefore be required on both parts, at the hands of the Clergy, to be in meanness of state like the Apostles; at the hands of the Laity, to be as they were who lived under the Apostles. And in this Reformation there will be, though little Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet some Indifferency: But your Reformation, which are of the Clergy (if yet it displease you not, that I should say ye are of the Clergy) seemeth to aim at a broader mark. Te think, that he which will perfectly reform, must bring the Form of Church-Discipline unto the State which then it was at. A thing neither possible, nor certain, nor absolutely convenient. Concerning the first, what was used in the Apostles times, the Scripture fully declareth not; so that making their times the Rule and Canon of Church Polity, ye make a Rule, which being not possible to be fully known, is as impossible to be kept. Again, Sith the later, even of the Apostles own times, had that which in the former, was not thought upon; in this general proposing of the Apostles times, there is no certainty which should be followed, especially seeing that ye give us great cause to doubt how far ye allow those times. For albeit, the lover of Antichristian building were not, ye say, as then set up, yet the Foundations thereof were secretly, and under the ground, laid in the Apostles times: So that all other times, ye plainly reject; and the Apostles own times, ye approve with marvellous great suspition, leaving it intricate and doubtful, wherein we are to keep our selves unto the pattern of their times. Thirdly, Whereas it is the error of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon multitude, to consider onely what hath been of old, and if the same were well, to see whether still it continue; if not, to condemn that presently, which is, and never to search upon what ground or consideration the Change might grow. Such rudeness cannot be in you so well born with, whom Learning and Iudgment hath enabled much more soundly to discern how far the times of the Church, and the Orders thereof, may alter without offence.

The Orders therefore which were observed in the Apostles times, are not to be urged as a Rule universally, either sufficient or necessary.

So that in faith, we may be bold to conclude, That besides these last times, which for insolency, pride, and egregious contempt of all good order, are the worst; there are none wherein ye can truly affirm, that the compleat Form of your Discipline, or the Substance thereof was practised.<note n="c" place="margin">

Wherein, as ye heap up the names of a number of men, not unworthy to be had in honor; so there are a number, whom when ye mention, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it serve ye to purpose, with the ignorant and vulgar sort, who measure by tale, and not by weight; yet surely, they who know what quality and value the men are of, will think ye draw very near the dregs.

If any chance to say,
<pb facs="tcp:66185:36"/>
it is probable that in the Apostles times there were Lay-Elders, or not to mislike the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them in the Church; or to affirm, that Bishops at the first were a name, but not a power distinct from Presbyters; or to speak any thing in praise of those Churches which are without Episcopal Regiment; or to reprove the fault of such as abuse that Calling. All these ye Register for Men, perswaded as you are, that every Christian Church standeth bound by the Law of God to put down Bishops, and in their rooms to erect an Eldership so authorized as you would have it for the Government of each Parish. Deceived greatly they are therefore, who think that all they whose names are cited amongst the Favorers of this Cause, are on any such verdict agreed. Yet touching some material points of your Discipline, a kinde of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we grant there is amongst many Divines of Reformed Churches abroad. For first, To do as the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> did, the Learned in some other Churches must needs be the more willing, who having used in like manner, not the slow and tedious help of proceeding by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority; but the peoples more quick endeavor for alteration, in such an exigent I see not well, how they could have staid to deliberate about any other Regiment, then that which already was devised to their hands; that which in like case had been taken, that which was easiest to be established without delay, that which was likeliest to content the people by reason of some kinde of sway which it giveth them. When therefore the example of one Church, was thus at the first almost through a kinde of constraint or necessity followed by many, their concurrence in perswasion about some material points belonging to the same polity is not strange. For we are not to marvel greatly, if they which have all done the same thing, do easily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the same opinion as concerning their own doings: Besides, mark I beseech you, that which <hi>Galen</hi> in matter of Philosophy noteth;<note place="margin">Galen. <hi>Clas.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.

Though ten persons be brought to give testimony in any cause, yet if the knowledge they have of the thing whereunto they come as witnesses, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have grown from some one amongst them, and to have spred it self from hand to hand, they all are in force but as one testimony; nor is it otherwise here, where the Daughter Churches do speak their Mothers Dialect; here, where so many sing one Song, by reason that he is the Guide of the Quire, concerning whose deserved authority, amongst even the gravest Divines,<note place="margin">

Notwithstanding, as though ye were able to say a great deal more then hitherto your Books have revealed to the World, earnest Challengers ye are of tryal by some publick Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; wherein, if the thing ye crave, be no more then onely leave to dispute openly about those Matters that are inquestion, the Schools in Universities (for any thing I know) are open unto you: They have their yearly Acts and Commencements, besides other Disputations, both ordinary and upon occasion, wherein the several parts of our own Ecclesiastical Discipline are oftentimes offered unto that kinde of Examination; the learnedst of you have been of late years, noted seldom or never absent from thence, at the time of those great Assemblies; and the favor of proposing there in convenient sort whatsoever ye can object (which thing, my self

have known them to grant of Scholastical courtesie unto Strangers) neither hath (as I think) nor ever will (I presume) be denied you. If your Suit be to have some great extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary confluence, in expectation whereof, the Laws that already are, should sleep and have no power over you; till in the hearing of thousands, ye all did acknowledge your error, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the further prosecution of your cause: Haply, they whose authority is required unto the satisfying of your demand, do think it both dangerous to admit such concourse of divided mindes, and unmeet that Laws, which being once solemnly established, are to exact obedience of all men, and to constrain thereunto; should so far stoop, as to hold themselves in suspence from taking any effect upon you, till some disputer can perswade you to be obedient. A Law is the Deed of the whole Body Politick, whereof if ye judge your selves to be any part, then is the Law even your Deed also. And were it reason, in things of this quality, to give men audience, pleading for the overthrow of that which their own very deed hath ratified? Laws that have been approved, may be (no man doubteth) again repealed, and to that end also disputed against, by the Authors thereof themselves: But this is when the whole doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate what Laws each part shall observe, and not when a part refuseth the Laws which the whole hath orderly agreed upon. Notwithstanding, for as much as the cause we maintain, is (God be thanked) such as needeth not to shun any tryal, might it please them on whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation the matter dependeth; to condescend so far unto you in this behalf, I wish heartily that proof were made even by solemn conference in orderly and quiet sort; whether you would your selves be satisfied, or else could by satisfying others, draw them to your party. Provided alway, first, In as much as ye go about to destroy a thing which is in force, and to draw in that which hath not as yet been received; to impose on us that which we think not our selves bound unto, and to overthrow those things whereof we are possessed; that therefore ye are not to claim in any conference, other then the Plaintiffs or Opponents part, which must consist altogether in proof and confirmation of two things: The one, that our Orders by you condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ought to abolish; the other, that yours, we are bound to accept in the stead thereof. Secondly, Because the Questions in Controversie between us, are many, if once we descend into particulars: That for the easier and more orderly proceeding therein, the most general be first discussed; nor any Question left off, nor in each Question the prosecution of any one Argument given over, and another taken in hand, till the issue whereunto, by Replies and Answers, both parts are come, be collected, read, and acknowledged, as well on the one side as on the other, to be the plain conclusion which they are grown unto. Thirdly, For avoiding of the manifold inconveniences whereunto ordinary and extemporal Disputes are subject, as also because, if ye should singly dispute one by one, as every mans own wit did best serve, it might be conceived by the rest, that haply some other would have done more; the chiefest of you do all agree in this action, that when ye shall then chuse your speaker, by him that which is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly brought into Disputation, be acknowledged by all your consents, not to be his allegation, but yours; such as ye all are agreed upon, and have required him to deliver in all your names: The true Copy whereof being taken by a Notary, that a reasonable time be allowed for return of Answer unto you in the like form. Fourthly, Whereas a number of Conferences have been had in other causes with the less effectual success, by reason of partial and untrue reports, published afterwards unto the World: That to prevent this evil, there be at the first a Solemn Declaration; made on both parts of their Agreement, to have that very Book and no other, set abroad, wherein their present authorized Notaries do write those things fully and onely; which being written, and there read, are by their own open testimony, acknowledged to be their own. Other circumstances hereunto belonging, whether for the choice of time, place, and language, or for prevention of impertinent and needless speech, or to any end and purpose else, they may be thought on when occasion serveth. In this sort, to broach my private conceit for the ordering of a publick action, I should be loth, (albeit, I do it not otherwise then under correction of them, whose gravity and wisdom ought in such cases to over-rule) but that so venturous boldness, I see is a thing now general, and am thereby of good hope, that where all men are licenced to offend, no man will shew himself a sharp Accuser.</p>

Are ye able to alledge any just and sufficient cause, wherefore absolutely ye should not condescend in this Controversie, to have your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments over-ruled by some such Definitive Sentence; Whether it fall out to be given with, or against you, that so these redious contentions may cease? Te will perhaps make answer, That being perswaded already, as touching the truth of your Cause, ye are not to hearken unto any sentence, no not, though Angels should define otherwise, as the blessed Apostles own example teacheth. Again, That Men, yea, Councils, may err, and that unless the judgment given, do satisfie your mindes, unless it be such as ye can, by no further argument oppugn; in a word, unless you perceive and acknowledge it your selves consonant with Gods Word, to stand unto it, not allowing it, were to sin against your own consciences. But consider, I beseech you, first, As touching the Apostle, how that wherein be was so resolute and peremptory, our Lord Iesus Christ made manifest unto him, even by Intuitive Revelation, wherein there was no possibility of error: That which you are perswaded of, ye have it no otherwise then by your own onely probable collection; and therefore such bold asseverations as in him were admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, should in your months but argue rashness. God was not ignorant, that the Priests and Iudges, whose sentence in Matters of Controversie he ordained should stand, both might and oftentimes would be deceived in their judgment. Howbeit, better it was in the eye of his understanding, that sometime an erronious sentence Definitive should prevail, till the same authority perceiving such oversight, might afterwards correct or reverse it, then that strifes should have respite to grow, and not come speedily unto some end: Neither wish we, that men should do any thing which in their hearts they are perswaded they ought not to do; but this perswasion ought (we say) to be fully setled in their hearts, that in litigious and controversed causes of such quality, the Will of God is to have them to do whatsoever the sentence of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and final Decision shall determine, yea, though it seem in their private opinion to swarve utterly from that which is right; as no doubt, many times the sentence amongst the Iews, did seem unto one part or other contending: And yet in this case, God did then allow them to do that which in their private judgment it seemed (yea, and perhaps truly seemed) that the Law did disallow. For if God be not the Author of confusion, but of peace, then can he not be the Author of our refusal, but of our contentment, to stand unto some Definitive Sentence; without which, almost impossible it is, that either we should avoid confusion, or ever hope to attain peace. To small purpose, had the Council of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> been assembled,
<pb facs="tcp:66185:37"/>
if one: their determination being set down, men might afterwards have defended their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinions. When therefore they had given their Definitive Sentence, all Controverso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was at an end: Things were disputed before they came to be determined; Men afterwards were not to dispute any longer, but to obey. The Sentence of Iudgment finished their strife, which their disputes before judgment, could not do. This was ground sufficient for any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Mans conscience to build the duty of Obedience upon, whatsoever his own opinion were as touching the matter before in question. So full of wilfulness and self-liking, is our nature, that without some Definitive Sentence, which being given, may stand, and a necessity of silence on both sides afterward imposed; small hope there is, that strifes thus for prosecuted, will in short time quietly end. Now it were in vain to ask you, Whether ye could be content that the Sentence of any Court already erected, should be so far authorized, as that among the Iews established by God himself, for the determining of all Controversies. <hi>That man which will do presumptuously, not hearkning unto the Priest that standeth before the Lord to minister there; nor unto the Judge, let him die.</hi> Ye have given us already to understand what your opinion is in part, concerning Her sacred Majesties Court of High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: the nature whereof is, the same with that amongst the Iews, albeit the power be not so great.<note place="margin">

Happier are they, whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall finde doing in these things, then disputing about Doctors, Elders, and Deacons: Or if there be no remedy, but somewhat needs ye must do, which may tend to the setting forward of your Discipline; do that which wisemen, who think some Statute of the Realm more fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed then to stand in force, are accustomed to do, before they come to Parliament, where the place of enacting is; that is to say, spend the time in re-examining more duly your cause, and in more throughly considering of that which ye labor to overthrow: As for the Orders which are established, sith Equity and Reason, the Law of Nature, God and Man, do all favor that which is in Being; till orderly Iudgment of Decision be given against it, it is but Iustice to exact of you, and perversness in you, it should be to deny thereunto your willing obedience. Not that I judge it a thing allowable for men to observe those Laws, which its their hearts, they are stredfastly perswaded to be against the Law of God: But your perswasion in this case; ye are all bound for the time to suspend, and in otherwise doing, ye offend against God, by troubling his Church without any just or necessary cause. Be it that there are some reasons inducing you to think hardly of our Laws: Are those reasons demonstrative, are they neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, or but meer probabilities onely? An Argument necessary and demonstrative is such, as being proposed unto any man, and understood; she minde cannot chase, but invardly assent; Any one such reason dischargeth, I grant the Gonscience, and setteth it at full liberty. For the publick approbation given by the Body of this whole Church, unto those things which are established, doth make it but probable, that they are good; And therefore unto a necessary proofe that they are not good, it must give place: But if the skilfullest amongst you can shew, that all the Books ye have hitherto written, be able to afford any one argument of this nature, let the instance be given. As for probabilities, What thing was there ever set down so agreeable with sound reason, but some probable shew against it might be made? It is meet, that when publickly things are received, and have taken place; General Obedience thereunto should cease to be exacted, in case, this or that private person, led with some probable conceit, should make open Protostation,<note place="margin">T.

                     </note>7. Nor is mine own intent, any other in these several Books of discourse, then to make it appear unto you; that for the Ecclesiastical Laws of this Land, we are led by great reason to observe them, and ye by no necessity bound to impugne them. It is no part of my secret meaning, to draw you hereby into hatred, or to set upon the face of this cause any fairer gloss, then the naked truth doth afford; but my whole endeavor is to resolve the Conscience, and to shew, as near as I can, what in this Controversie, the Heart is to think, if it will follow the light of sound and sincere judgment, without either cloud of prejudice, or mist of passionate affection. Wherefore, seeing that Laws and Ordinances in particular, whether such as we observe, or such as your selves would have established; when the minde doth sift and examine them, it must needs have often recourse to a number of doubts and questions, about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, kindes, and qualities of Laws in general; whereof, unless it be throughly informed, there will appear no certainty to stay our perswasion upon: I have for that cause set down in the first place, an Introduction on both sides needful to be considered; declaring therein, what Law is, how different kindes of Laws there are, and what force they are of, according unto each kinde. This done, because ye suppose the Laws, for which ye strive, are found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but those not, against which we strive: And upon this surmise, are drawn to hold it, as the very main Pillar of your whole cause, <hi>That Scripture ought to be the onely rule of all our actions</hi>; and consequently, that the Church Orders which we observe, being not commanded in Scripture, are offensive and displeasant unto God. I have spent the second Book in sifting of this point, which standeth with you for the first and chiefest principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ye build. Whereunto the next in degree is, That as God will have always a Church upon Earth, while the World doth continue, and that Church stand in need of Government; of which Government, it behoveth himself to be, both the Author and Teacher: So it cannot stand with duty, That man should ever presume in any wise to change and alter the same; and therefore. <hi>That in Scripture there must of necessity be found some particular Form of Ecclesiastical Polity, the Laws whereof, admit not any kinde of alteration.</hi> The first three Books being thus ended, the fourth proceedeth from the general Grounds and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of your cause, unto your general Accusations against us, as having in the orders of our Church (for so you pretend) <hi>Corrupted the right Form of Church Polity with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Popish Rites and Ceremonies, which certain Reformed Churches have banished from amongst them, and have thereby given us such example as</hi> (you think) <hi>we ought to follow.</hi> This your Assertion hath herein drawn us to make search, whether these be just Exceptions against the Customs of our Church, when ye plead, that they are the same which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, or that they are not the same which some other Reformed Churches have devised. Of those four Books which remain, and are bestowed about the Specialties of that Cause which little in Controversie, the first examineth the causes by you alledged; wherefore the publick duties of Christian Religion, as our Prayers, our Sacraments, and the rest, should not be ordered in such sort, as with us they are; nor that power whereby the persons of men are consecrated unto the Ministry, be disposed of in such manner as the Laws of this Church do allow. The second and third, are concerning the power of Iurisdiction; the one, Whether Laymen, such as your Governing Elders are, ought in all Congregations for ever, to be invested with that power? The other, Whether Bishops may have that power over other Pastors, and therewithal, that honor which with us they have? And because, besides the Power of Order, which all consecrated persons have, and the Power of Iurisdiction, which neither they all, nor they onely have: There is a third power, a Power of Ecclesiastical Dominion, communicable, as we think, unto persons not Ecclesiastical, and most fit to be restrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prince our Soveraign Commander over the whole Body Politick. The eighth Book we have allotted unto this Question, and have sifted therein your Objections against those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences Royal which thereunto appertain. Thus have I laid before you the Brief of these my Travels; and presented under your view, the Limbs of that Cause litigious between us; the whole intire Body whereof, being thus compact, it shall be no troublesome thing for any man to finde each particular Controversies resting place, and the coherance it hath with those things, either, on which it dependeth, or which depend on it.</p>

Ye sometime our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, Guides, and Familiars, with whom we have had most sweet Consultations, are now become our professed Adversaries, because we think the Statute-Congregation in <hi>England,</hi> to be no true Christian Churches; because we have severed our selves from them, and because without their leave or licence, that are in Civil Authority, we have secretly framed our own Churches according to the Platform of the Word of God: For of that point between you and us, there is no Controversie. Also, what would ye have us to do? At such time as ye were content to accept us in the number of your own, your Teaching we heard, weread your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: And though we would, yet able we are not to forget, with what zeal ye have ever profest, That in the English Congregations (for so many of them as be ordered according unto their own Laws,) the very Publick Service of God is fraught, as touching Matter, with heaps of intolerable Pollutions, and as concerning Form, borrowed from the Shop of Antichrist; hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both ways in the eyes of the most Holy; the kinde of their Government, by Bishops and Archbishops,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pref. against Dr.</hi> Baner.</note> Antichristian; that Discipline which Christ hath essentially tied, that is to say, so united unto his Church, that we cannot account it really to be his Church which hath not in it the same Discipline, that very Discipline no less there despised, then in the highest Throne of Antichrist. All such parts of the Word of God, as do any way concern that Discipline, no less unsoundly taught and interpreted by all authorized English Pastors, then by Antichrists Factors themselves: At Baptism, Crossing; at the Supper of the Lord. Kneeling; at both, a number of other the most notorious Badges of Antichristian Recognisance, usual. Being moved with these and the like, your effectual discourses, whereunto we gave most attentive ear, till they entred even into our souls, and were as fire within our bosoms; We thought we might hereof be bold to conclude, That sith no such Antichristian Synagogue may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a true Church of Christ, ye by accusing all Congregations ordered according to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> as Antichristian, did mean to condemn those Congregations, as not being any of them worthy the name of a true Christian Church. Ye tell us now, it is not your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But what meant your often threatnings of them, who professing themselves the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> were too loth to depart wholly as they should out of <hi>Babylon</hi>? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, our hearts being fearfully troubled, we durst not, we durst not continue longer so near her confines, lest her plagues might suddenly overtake us, before we did cease to be partakers with her sins; for so we could not chuse, but acknowledge with grief, that we were, when they doing evil, we by our presence in their Assemblies, seemed to like thereof; or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, not so earnestly to dislike, as became men heartily zealous of Gods glory. For adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to erect the Discipline of Christ, without the leave of the Christian Magistrate, haply ye may condemn us as fools, in that we hazard thereby our estates and persons, further then you which are that way more wise think necessary: But of any offence or sin therein committed against God, with what conscience can you accuse us, when your own positions are, That the things we observe, should every of them be dearer unto us, then ten thousand lives; that they are the peremptory Commandments of God; that no mortal man can dispense with them; and that the Magistrate grievously sinneth, in not constraining thereunto? Will ye blame any man for doing that of his own accord, which all men should be compelled to do that are not willing of themselves? When God commandeth, shall we answer, that we will obey, if so be <hi>Cesar</hi> will grant us leave? Is Discipline an Ecclesiastical Matter, or a Civil? If an Ecclesiastical, is must of necessity belong to the duty of the Minister; and the Minister (ye
<pb facs="tcp:66185:39"/>
say) holdeth all his Authority of doing whatsoever belongeth unto the Spiritual Charge of the House of God, even immediately from God himself, without dependency upon any Magistrate. Whereupon it followeth, as we suppose, that the hearts of the people being willing to be under the Scepter of Christ, the Minister of God, into whose hands the Lord himself hath put that Scepter, is without all excuse, if thereby he guide them not. Nor do we finde, that hitherto greatly ye have disliked those Churches abroad, where the people with direction of their godly Ministers, have even against the will of the Magistrate, brought in either the Doctrine or Discipline of Iesus Christ: For which cause, we must now think the very same thing of you, which our Saviour did sometime utter concerning false-hearted Scribes and Pharisees,<note place="margin">

Him therefore we leave to be satisfied by you, from whom he hath sprung: And if such, by your own acknowledgment, be persons dangerous, although as yet the alterations which they have made, are of small and tender growth; the changes likely to ensue, throughout all States and Vocations within this Land, in case your desire should take place, must be thought upon. First, Concerning the Supream Power of the Highest, they are no small Prerogatives, which now thereunto belonging, the Form of your Discipline will constrain it to resign; as in the last Book of this Treatise we have shewed at large. Again, it may justly be feared, whether our English Nobility, when the Matter came in tryal, would contentedly suffer themselves to be always at the Call, and to stand to the sentence of a number of mean persons, assisted with the presence of their poor Teacher; a man (as sometimes it hapneth) though better able to speak, yet little or no whit apter to judge, then the rest: From whom, be their dealings never so absurd (unless it be by way of Complaint to a Synod) no Appeal may be made unto any one of higher Power; is as much as the Order of your Discipline admitteth no standing in Equality of Courts, no Spiritual Iudge to have any ordinary Superior on Earth, but as many Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies as there are Parishes and several Congregations. Neither is it altogether without cause, that so many do fear the overthrow of all Learning, as a threatned sequel of this your Intended Discipline:<note place="margin">

To charge you, as purposely bent to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of that, wherein so many of you have attained no small perfection, were injurious. Onely therefore, I wish, that your selves did well consider, how opposite certain of your Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are unto the state of Collegiate Societies, whereon the two Universities consist. Those Degrees which their Statutes binde them to take, are by your Laws taken away, your selves who have sought them, ye so excuse; as that ye would have men to think ye judge them not allowable, but tolerable onely: and to be borne with, for some help which ye finde in them unto the furtherance of your purposes, till the corrupt estate of the Church may be better reformed. Your Laws forbidding Ecclesiastical Persons utterly the exercise of Civil Power, must needs deprive the Heads and Masters in the same Colledges of all such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as now they exercise, either at home, by punishing the faults of those, who not as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents by the Law of Nature, but altogether by Civil Authority are subject unto them; or abroad, by keeping Courts amongst their Tenants. Your Laws making perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inequality amongst Ministers, a thing repugnant to the Word of God, enforce those Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the Seniors whereof are all, or any part of them, Ministers under the Government of a Master in the same Vocation, to chuse, as oft as they meet together, a new President. For if so ye judge it necessary to do in Synods, for the avoiding of permanent inequality amongst Ministers; the same cause must needs, even in these Collegiate Assemblies, enforce the like: Except peradventure ye mean to avoid all such absurdities, by dissolving those Corporations,
<pb facs="tcp:66185:39"/>

Your opinion concerning the Law Civil, is That the knowledge thereof might be spared, as a thing which this Land doth not need. Professors in that kinde being few, ye are the bolder to spurn at them, and not to dissemble your mindes, as concerning their removal: In whose Studies, although my self have not much been conversant, nevertheless exceeding great cause, I see, there is to wish, that thereunto more encouragement were given, as well for the singular Treasures of Wisdom therein contained, as also for the great use we have thereof, both in Decision of certain kindes of causes arising daily within our selves, and especially for Commerce with Nations abroad, whereunto that knowledge is most requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.

For whereas the name of Divine Authority, is used to countenance these things, which are not the Commandments of God, but your own Erroneous Collections; on him ye must father whatsoever ye shall afterwards be led, either to do in withstanding the Adversaries of your Cause, or to think in maintenance of your doings. And what this may be, God doth know. In such kindes of Error, the Minde once imagining it self to seek the execution of Gods Will, laboreth forthwith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move both things and persons, which any way hinder it from taking place; and in such cases, if any strange or new thing seem requisite to be done, a strange and new opinion, concerning the lawfulness thereof, is withal received and broached under countenance of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. One example herein may serve for many, to shew, That false opinions touching the Will of God to have things done, are wont to bring forth mighty and violent practices against the hinderances of them; And those practices new opinions more pernicious then the first, yea, most extreamly sometimes opposite to that which the first did seem to intend. Where the people took upon them the Reformation of the Church, by casting out Popish Superstition, they having received from their Pastors a General Instruction, that whatsoever the Heavenly Father hath not planted,<note place="margin">

Amongst others, there sprang up presently one kinde of men, with whose zeal and forwardness, the rest being compared, were thought to be marvellous cold and dull. These grounding themselves on Rules more general; that whatsoever the Law of Christ commandeth not, thereof Antichrist is the Author; and that whatsoever Antichrist, or his adherents did in the World, the true Professors of Christ are to undo; found out many things more then others had done, the Extirpation whereof was in their conceit, as necessary as of any thing before removed. Hereupon they secretly made their doleful complaints e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where as they went, that albeit the World did begin to profess some dislike of that which

Touching the former, they boldly avouched, that themselves onely had the Truth, which thing upon peril of their lives, they would at all times defend; and that since the Apostles lived, the same was never before in all points sincerely taught. Wherefore, that things might again be brought to that ancient integrity which Iesus Christ by his Word requireth, they began to controll the Ministers of the Gospel, for attributing so much force and vertue unto the Scriptures of God read, whereas the Truth was, that when the Word is said to engender Faith in the Heart; and to convert the Soul of Man, or to work any such Spiritual Divine effect, these speeches are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appliable as it is read or preached, but as it is ingrafted in us by the power of the Holy Ghost, opening the eyes of our understanding, and so revealing the Mysteries of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which <hi>Jeremy</hi> promised before should be,<note place="margin">

When they and their Bibles were alone together, what strange phantastical opinion soever at any time entred into their heads, their use was to think the Spirit taught it them. Their phrensies concerning our Saviours Incarnation, the state of Souls departed, and such like, are things needless to be rehearsed.

The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end of their Civil Reformation, was, That Christ might have dominion over all; that all Crowns and Scepters might be thrown down at his feet; that no other might raign over Christian men, but he; no Regiment keep them in aw, but his Discipline; amongst them no Sword at all be carried besides his, the Sword of Spiritual Excommunication.

The hardest that men of sound understanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them, was but this, <hi>O quam honestâ voluntate miseri errant?</hi>

                        <hi>Page</hi> 420.</note> The means whereby they both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured and retained so great multitudes, were most effectual; First, A wonderful shew of zeal towards God, wherewith they seemed to be even rapt in every thing they spake:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 55.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, An hatred of sin, and a singular love of integrity, which men did think to be much more then ordinary in them, by reason of the custom which they had to fill the ears of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Invectives against their authorized Guides, as well Spiritual as Civil: Thirdly, The bountiful relief wherewith they eased the broken estate of such needy Creatures, as were in that respcit the more apt to be drawn away. Fourthly, A tender compassion which they were thought to take upon the miseries of the common sort, over whose heads their manner was even to pour down showres of tears in complaining, that no respect was had unto them, that their goods were devoured by wicked Cormorants, their persons had in contempt,<note place="margin">

Lastly, A cunning slight which they had to stroke and smoothe up the mindes of their followers, as well by appropriating unto them all the favorable Titles, the good words, and the gracious promises in Scripture; as also by
<pb facs="tcp:66185:41"/>
casting the contrary always on the heads of such as were severed from that retinue. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the peoples common aeclamation unto such deceivers was: These are verily the Men of God, these are his true and sincere Prophets. If any such Prophet or Man of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 7.</note> did suffer by order of Law, condign and deserved punishment, were it for Fellony, Rebellion, Murder; or what else; that people (so strangely were their hearts inchanted) as though Blessed St. <hi>Stephen</hi> had been again Martyred, did lament, that God took away his most dear servants from them. In all these things being fully perswaded, that what they did,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 27.</note> it was obedience to the Will of God, and that all men should do the like; there remained after speculation, Practice, whereby the whole World thereunto (if it were possible) might be framed. This they saw could not be done, but with mighty opposition and resistence; against which,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 6.</note> to strengthen themselves, they secretly entred into a League of Association. And peradventure considering, that although they were many, yet long Wars would in time waste them out; they began to think, whether it might not be, that God would have them do for their speedy and mighty increase, the same which sometime Gods own chosen people, the people of <hi>Israel</hi> did. Glad and fain they were to have it so; which very desire was it self apt to breed b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of possibility, and a willingness to gather Arguments of likelihood, that so God himself would have it. Nothing more clear unto their seeming, then that a <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> being often spoken of in Scipture, they undoubtedly were themselves that <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Old</hi> did by way of a certain Fegurative resemblance signifie what they should both be, and do. Here they drew in a Sea of Matter, by amplifying all things unto their own Company, which are any where spoken concerning Divine Favors and Benefits bestowed upon the Old Commonwealth of <hi>Israel</hi>; concluding, that as <hi>Israel</hi> was delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so they spiritually out of the <hi>Egypt</hi> of this Worlds servile thraldom unto Sin and Superstition: As <hi>Israel</hi> was to root out the Idolatrous Nations, and to plant instead of them, a people which feared God; so the same Lords good will and pleasure was now, that these new <hi>Israelites</hi> should under the conduct of other <hi>Joshua</hi>'s <hi>Sampsons,</hi> and <hi>Gideons,</hi> perform a work no less miraculous in casting out violently the wicked from the Earth, and establishing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ with perfect liberty: And therefore, as the cause why the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> took unto one Man many Wives, might be, lest the casualties of War should any way hinder the promise of God concerning their multitude, from taking effect in them; so it was not unlike that, for the necessary propagation of Christs Kingdom under the Gospel, the Lord was content to allow as much. Now whatsoever they did in such sort collect out of Scripture, when they came to justifie or perswade it unto others, all was the Heavenly Fathers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his commandment, his will and charge. Which thing is the very point, in regard whereof, I have gathered his Declaration. For my purpose herein is to shew, that when the mindes of men are once erroneously perswaded, that it is the Will of God to have those things done which they fancy; then Opinions are as Thorns in their sides, never suffering them to take rest till they have brought their speculations into practise. The lets and impediments of which practice, their restless desire and study to remove, leadeth them every day forth by the hand into other more dangerous opinions, sometimes quite and clean contrary to their first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended meanings.

But howsoever these and the like Speeches, be accounted as Arrows idlely shot at random, without either eye had to any Mark, or regard to their lighting place; hath not your longing desire for the practice of your Discipline, brought the Matter already unto this demurrer amongst you; whether the people and their Godly Pastors, that way affected, ought not to make Separation from the rest, and to begin the Exercise of Discipline, without the License of Civil Powers, which License they have sought for, and are not heard? Upon which question, as ye have now divided your selves, the warier sort of you taking the one part, and the forwarder in zeal, the other; so in case these earnest Ones should prevail, what other sequel can any wise man imagine but this, that having first resolved that Attempts for Discipline without Superiors are lawful, it will follow in the next place to be disputed. What may be attempted against Superiors, which will not have the Scepter of that Discipline to rule over them? Yea, even by you which have staid your selves from running head-long with the other sort, somewhat notwithstanding there hath been done without the leave or liking of your lawful Superiors, for the exercise of a part of your Discipline amongst the Clergy thereunto addicted. And lest Examination of Principal Parties therein should bring those things to light, which might hinder and let your proceedings; behold, for a Bar against that impediment, one Opinion ye have newly added unto the rest, even upon this occasion, an Opinion to exempt you from taking Oaths, which may turn to the molestation of your Brethren in that cause. The next Neighbor Opinions whereunto, when occasion requireth, may follow for Dispensation with Oaths already taken, if they afterwards be found to import a necessity of detecting ought which may bring such good men into trouble or damage, whatsoever the cause be.

Wherefore, if we any thing respect their Error, who being perswaded, even as ye are, have gone further upon that perswasion then ye allow, if we regard the present State of the highest Governor placed over us, if the quality and disposition of our Nobles, if the Orders and Laws of our famous Universities, if the Profession of the Civil, or the Practice of the Common Law amongst us, if the mischiefs whereinto, even before our eyes, so many others have faln head-long from no less plausible and fair beginnings then yours are: There is in every of these Considerations most just cause to fear, lest our hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence, should cause Posterity to feel those evils, which as yet are more easie for us to prevent, then they would be for them to remedy.</p>

The onely godliness we glory in, is to finde out somewhat whereby we may judge others to be ungodly. Each others faults we observe, as matter of exprobration, and not of grief. By these means we are grown hateful in the eyes of the Heathens themselves, and (which woundeth us the more deeply) able we are not to deny, but that we have deserved their hatred: With the better sort of our own, our fame and credit is clean lost. The less we are to marvel, if they judge vilely of us, who although we did well, would hardly allow thereof. On our backs they also build that are leud, and what we object one against another, the same they use, to the utter scorn and disgrace of us all. This we have gained by our mutual home-dissentions: This we are worthily rewarded with, which are more forward to strive, then becometh men of vertuous and milde disposition.</hi> But our trust in the Almighty is, that with us Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are now at the highest flote, and that the day will come (for what cause of despair is there?) when the Passions of former Enmity being allayed, we shall with ten times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled tokens of our unfeignedly reconciled love, shew our selves each towards other the same, which <hi>Joseph</hi> and the Brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> were at the time of their enterview in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Our comfortable expectation and most thirsty desire whereof, what man soever amongst you shall any way help to satisfie, (as we truly hope, there is no one amongst you, but some way or other will.) <hi>The blessings of the God of Peace, both in this World, and in the World to come, be upon him more then the Stars of the Firmament in number.</hi>

Hearers; because they know the manifold defects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto every kinde of Regiment is subject; but the secret lets and difficulties, which in publick proceedings, are innumerable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment to consider. And because such as openly reprove supposed disorders of State, are taken for Principal Friends to the Common Benefit of all, and for men that carry sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Freedom of Minde: Under this fair and plausible colour whatsoever they utter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66185:44"/>
passeth for good and currant. That which wanteth in the weight of their Speech, is supplied by the aptness of Mens mindes to accept and believe it. Whereas on the other side, if we maintain things that are established, we have not onely to strive with a number of heavy prejudices, deeply rooted in the hearts of men, who think that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we serve the time, and speak in favor of the present State, because thereby we either hold or seek preferment; but also to bear such Exceptions as Mindes so avetted before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, usually take against that which they are loth should be poured into them. Albeit therefore, much of that we are to speak in this present Cause, may seem to a number perhaps tedious, perhaps obscure, dark, and intricate, (for many talk of the Truth, which never sounded the depth from whence it springeth: And therefore when they are led thereunto, they are soon weary, as men drawn from those beaten paths wherewith they have been inured;) yet this may not so far prevail, as to cut off that which the matter it self requireth, howsoever the nice humor of some be therewith pleased, or no. They unto whom we shall seem tedious, are in no wise injured by us, because it is in their own hands to spare that labor which they are not willing to endure. And if any complain of obscurity, they must consider, that in these Matters it cometh no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to pass, then in sundry the works both of Art, and also of Nature, where that which hath greatest force in the very things we see, is notwithstanding itself oftentimes not seen. The stateliness of Houses, the goodliness of Trees, when we behold them delighteth the eye; but that Foundation which beareth up the one, that Root which ministreth unto the other nourishment and life, is in the bosome of the Earth concealed; and if there be occasion at any time to search into it, such labor is then more necessary then pleasant, both to them which undertake it, and for the lookers on. In like manner, the use and benefit of good Laws, all that live under them, may enjoy with delight and comfort, albeit the grounds and first original causes from whence they have sprung, be unknown, as to the greatest part of men they are. But when they who withdraw their obedience, pretend, That the Laws which they should obey, are corrupt and vicious: For better examination of their quality, it behoveth the very Foundation and Root, the highest Well-Spring and Fountain of them to be discovered. Which because we are not oftentimes accustomed to do, when we do it, the pains we take are more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a great deal then acceptable, and the Matters which we handle, seem by reason of newness, (till the minde grow better acquainted with them) dark, intricate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>familiar. For as much help whereof as may be in this case, I have endeavored through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body of this whole Discourse, that every former part might give strength unto all that follow, and every latter bring some light unto all before: So that if the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men do but hold themselves in suspence, as touching these first more General Meditations, till in order they have perused the rest that ensue; what may seem dark at the first, will afterwards be found more plain, even as the latter particular decisions will appear, I doubt not, more strong, when the other have been read before. The Laws of the Church, whereby for so many Ages together we have been guided in the Exercise of Christian Religion, and the Service of the true God, our Rites, Customs, and Orders of Ecclesiastical Government, are called in question: We are accused as men that will not have Christ Jesus to rule over them; but have wilfully cast his Statutes behinde their backs, hating to be reformed and made subject unto the Scepter of his Discipline. Behold therefore, we offer the Laws whereby we live, unto the General Tryal and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole World; heartily beseeching Almighty God, whom we desire to serve according to his own Will, that both we and others (all kinde of Partial affection being clean laid aside) may have eyes to see, and hearts to embrace the things that in his sight are most acceptable. And because the Point, about which we strive, is the Quality of our Laws, our first entrance hereinto cannot better be made, then with consideration of the Nature of Law in general, and of that Law which giveth Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the rest which are commendable, just, and good, namely, the Law whereby the Eternal himself doth work. Proceeding from hence to the Law, first of Nature, then of Scripture,<note place="margin">Of that Law which God from before the beginning hath set for himself to do all things by.</note> we shall have the easier access unto those things which come after to be debated, concerning the particular Cause and Question which we have in hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All things that are, have some operation not violent or casual: Neither doth any thing ever begin to exercise the same, without some fore-conceived end for which it worketh. And the end which it worketh for, is not obtained, unless the Work be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66185:44"/>
also fit to obtain it by; for unto every end, every operation will not serve: That which doth assign unto each thing the kinde, that which doth moderate the force and power, that which doth appoint the form and measure of working, the same we term a <hi>Law:</hi> So that no certain end could ever be attained, unless the Actions whereby it is attained, were regular; that is to say, Made suitable, fit, and correspondent unto their end, by some Canon Rule or Law. Which thing doth first take place in the Works, even of God himself. All things therefore do work after a sort, according to Law; all other things according to a Law, whereof some Superiors unto whom they are subject, is Author; onely the Works and Operations of God, have him both for their Worker, and for the Law whereby they are wrought. The Being of God, is a kinde of Law to his working; for that Perfection which God is, giveth Perfection to that he doth. Those Natural, Necessary, and Internal Operations of God, the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son, the <hi>Proceeding</hi> of the Spirit, are without the compass of my present intent; which is to touch onely such Operations as have their Beginning and Being by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary purpose, wherewith God hath eternally decreed, when, and how they should be; which Eternal Decree is that we term an <hi>Eternal Law.</hi> Dangerous it were for the feeble Brain of Man, to wade far into the doings of the most High; whom although to know be Life, and Joy to make mention of his Name; yet our soundest knowledge is, to know, that we know him not as indeed he is, neither can know him; and our safest elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence concerning him, is our silence, when we confess without confession, that his glory is inexplicable, his greatness above our capacity and reach. He is above, and we upon Earth; therefore it behoveth our words to be wary and few. Our God is One, or rather very Oneness, and meer Unity, having nothing but it Self in it Self, and not consisting (as all things do besides God) of many things. In which Essential Unity of God, a Trinity Personal nevertheless subsisteth, after a manner far exceeding the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of mans conceit. The works which outwardly are of God, they are in such sort of him being One, that each Person hath in them somewhat peculiar and proper. For being Three, and they all subsisting in the Essence of one Deity, from the Father, by the Son, through the Spirit, all things are.<note place="margin">John 16. 13, 14, 15.</note> That which the Son doth hear of the Father, and which the Spirit doth receive of the Father and the Son, the same we have at the hands of the Spirit, as being the last; and therefore the nearest unto us in order, although in power the same with one Second and the First. The wise and learned among the very Heathens themselves, have all acknowledged some first cause, whereupon ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally the Being of all things dependeth. Neither have they otherwise spoken of that Cause then as an Agent, which knowing <hi>what</hi> and <hi>why</hi> it worketh, observeth in working a most exact <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Law.</hi> Thus much is signified by that which <hi>Homer</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth,<note n="a" place="margin">

                     </gap>. Thus much confest by <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> terming the Maker of the World, an <hi>Intellectual Worker.</hi> Finally, the <hi>Stoiks,</hi> although imagining the first cause of all things to be Fire, held nevertheless, that the same Fire having Art, did<note n="c" place="margin">Proceed by a certain and a set way in the making of the World.</note> O <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. They all confess therefore, in the working of that first cause, that <hi>Counsel</hi> is used, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> followed, a <hi>Way</hi> observed, that is to say, Constant <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> is kept, whereof it self must needs be Author unto it self: Otherwise it should have some worthier and higher to direct it, and so could not it self be the first, being the first, it can have no other then it self to be the Author of that Law, which it willingly worketh by. God therefore is a Law both to himself, and to all other things besides. To himself, he is a Law in all those things whereof our Saviour speaks, saying,<note place="margin">John 5. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>My Father worketh as yet, so I.</hi> God worketh nothing without cause. All those things which are done by him, have some end, for which they are done; and the end for which they are done, is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Will to do them. His Will had not inclined to create Woman, but that he saw it could not be well, if she were not created.<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Non est bonum, It is not good man should be alone</hi>; therefore let us make an helper for him. That and nothing else is done by God, which to leave undone, were not so good. If therefore it be demanded, why God having power and ability infinite, the effects notwithstanding of that power are all so limited, as we see they are: The reason hereof is, the End which he hath proposed, and the Law whereby his Wisdom hath stinted the effects of his power in such sort, that it doth not work infinitely, but correspondently unto that end for which it worketh, even

Wherefore to come to the Law of Nature, albeit thereby we sometimes mean that manner of working which God hath set for each created thing to keep; yet for as much as those things are termed most properly <hi>Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> which keep the Law of their kinde unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Heavens and Elements of the World, which can do no otherwise then they do: And for as much as we give unto Intellectual Natures, the name of <hi>Voluntary Agents,</hi> that so we may distinguish them from the other, expedient it will be, that wesever the Law of Nature observed by the one, from that which the other is tied unto. Touching the former, their strict keeping of one Tenure, Statute, and Law is spoken of by all, but hath in it more then men have as yet attained to know, or perhaps ever shall attain, seeing the travel of wading herein, is given of God to the Sons of Men; that perceiving how much the least thing in the World hath in it, more then the wisest are able to reach unto, the may by this means learn humility. <hi>Moses,</hi> in describing the Work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, attributeth speech unto God: <hi>God said, Let there be light: Let there be a Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Let the Waters under the Heavens be gathered together into one place: Let the Earth bring forth: Let there be Lights in the Firmament of Heaven.</hi> Was this onely the intent of <hi>Moses,</hi> to signifie the infinite greatness of Gods Power, by the easiness of his accomplishing such effects, without travel, pain, or labor? Surely, it seemeth that <hi>Moses</hi> had herein, besides this, a further purpose, 'namely, first, to teach that God did not work as a necessary, but a voluntary Agent, intending beforehand; and decreeing with himself, that which did outwardly proceed from him. Secondly, to shew that God did then institute a Law natural to be observed by Creatures; and therefore according to the manner of Laws, the Institution thereof is described, as being established by solemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. His commanding those things to be which are, and to be in such sort as they are, to keep that tenure and course which they do, importeth the establishment of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Law. This Worlds first Creation, and the preservation since of things created, what is it, but onely so far forth a manifestation by execution, what the Eternal Law of God is concerning things natural? And as it cometh to pass in a Kingdom rightly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that after a Law is once published, it presently takes effect far and wide, all States framing themselves thereunto; even so let us think it fareth in the Natural course of the World: Since the time that God did first proclaim the Edicts of his Law upon it, Heaven and Earth have hearkned unto his voice, and their labor hath been to do his will: <hi>He made a Law for the Rain</hi>; He gave his <hi>Decree unto the Sea, that the Waters should not pass his Commandment.</hi> Now, if Nature should intermit her course, and leave altogether, though it were but for a while, the observation of her own Laws; if those Principal and Mother Elements of the World, whereof all things in this lower World are made, should lose the qualities which now they have; if the frame of that Heavenly Arch erected over our Heads, should loosen and dissolve it self; if Celestial Spheres should forget their wonted motions, and by irregular volubility turn themselves any way as it might happen; if the Prince of the Lights of Heaven,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 5.</note> which now as a Gyant doth run his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied course; should, as it were, through a languishing faintness, begin to stand, and to rest himself; if the Moon should wander from her beaten way, the times and seasons

of the year blend themselves, by disordered and confused mixture, the Winds breathe out their last gasp, the Clouds yield no Rain, the Earth be defeated of Heavenly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Fruits of the Earth pine away, as Children at the withered Brests of their Mother, no longerable to yield them relief: What would become of Man himself, whom these things now do all serve? See we not plainly, that obedience of Creatures unto the Law of Nature, is the stay of the whole World? Notwithstanding, with Nature it cometh sometimes to pass, as with art. Let <hi>Phidias</hi> have rude and obstinate stuff to carve, though his art do that it should, his work will lack that beauty which otherwise in fitter matter it might have had. He that striketh an Instrument with skill, may cause notwithstanding a very unpleasant sound, if the string whereon he striketh, chance to be uncapable of harmony.

                     <hi>Much of it is oftentimes such, as will by no means yield to receive that impression which were best and most perfect.</hi> Which defect in the matter of things natural, they who gave themselves unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of nature amongst the Heathen, observed often: But the true original cause thereof, Divine Malediction, laid for the sin of Man upon these Creatures, which God had made for the use of Man; this being an Article of that saving truth which God hath revealed unto his Church, was above thereach of their meerly natural capacity and understanding. But howsoever, these swervings are now and then incident into the course of Nature; nevertheless, so constantly the Laws of Nature, are by Natural Agents observed, that no man denieth, but those things which Nature worketh, are wrought either always, or for the most part, after one and the same manner. If here it be demanded,<note place="margin">

Although we are not of opinion therefore, as some are, that Nature in working, hath before her certain exemplary draughts or patterns, which subsisting in the bosom of the Highest, and being thence discovered, she fixeth her eye upon them, as Travellers by Sea upon the Pole-star of the World, and that according thereunto she guideth her hand to work by imitation: Although we rather embrace the Oracle of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>

As in number and order they are huge, mighty, and royal Armies, so likewise in perfection of obedience unto that Law, which the Highest, whom they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, love, and imitate, hath imposed upon them. Such observants they are thereof, that our Saviour himself being to set down the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of that which we are to pray and wish for on Earth, did not teach to pray or wish for more, then onely that here it might be with us, as with them it is in Heaven. God which moveth meer Natural Agents as an efficient onely, doth otherwise move Intellectual Creatures, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his holy Angels: For beholding the Face of God, in admiration of so great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, they all adore him; and being rapt with the love of his beauty, they cleave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably for ever unto him, Desire to resemble him in goodness, maketh them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearable, and even unsatiable in their longing, to do by all means, all manner of good unto all the Creatures of God, but especially unto the Children of Men. In the countenance of whose Nature looking downward, they behold themselves beneath themselves, even as upward in God, beneath whom themselves are, they see that character which is no where but in themselves and us, resembled. Thus far even the Painims have approached; thus far they have seen into the doings of the Angels of God; <hi>Orpheus</hi> confessing, that the Fiery Throne of God is attended on by those most industrious Angels, careful how all things are performed amongst men, and the Mirror of Humane Wisdom plainly teaching, That God moveth Angels, even as that thing doth stir Mans heart, which is thereunto presented amiable.

Of Angels, we are not to consider onely what they are, and do, in regard of their own Being, but that also which concerneth them as they are linked into a kinde of Corporation amongst themselves, and of Society or Fellowship with men. Consider Angels, each of them severally in himself, and their Law is that which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> mentioneth, <hi>All ye his Angels praise him.</hi> Consider the Angels of God associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their Law is that which disposeth them as an Army, one in order and degree above another. Consider finally the Angels, as having with us that communion which the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> noteth; and in regard whereof, Angels have not disdained to profess themselves our <hi>fellow servants.</hi> From hence there springeth up a third Law, which bindeth them to works of Ministerial employment: Every of which their several Functions, are by them performed with joy. A part of the Angels of God notwithstanding (we know) have faln, and that their fall hath been through the voluntary breach of that Law, which did require at their hands continuance in the exercise of their high and admirable vertue. Impossible it was, that ever their will should change or encline to remit any part of their duty, without some object having force to avert their conceit from God, and to draw it another way; and that before they attained that high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of bliss, wherein now the Elect Angels are without possibility of falling. Of any thing more then of God, they could not by any means like, as long as whatsoever they knew besides God, they apprehended it not in it self, without dependency upon God; because so long, God must needs seem infinitely better then any thing which they so could apprehend. Things beneath them, could not in such sort be presented unto their eyes, but that therein they must needs see always, how those things did depend on God. It seemeth therefore, that there was no other way for Angels to sin, but by reflex of their understanding upon themselves; when being held with admiration of their own sublimity and honor, the memory of their subordination unto God, and their dependency on him was drowned in this conceit, whereupon their adoration, love, and imitation of God, could not chuse but be also interrupted. The fall of Angels therefore, was Pride:<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These wicked spirits, the Heathens honored instead of Gods, both generally under the name of <hi>Dii inferi,</hi> Gods Infernal; and particularly, some in Oracles, some in Idols, some as Houshold Gods, some as Nymphs: In a word, No foul and wicked spirit, which was not one way or other honored of Men as God, till such time as Light appeared in the World, and dissolved the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.

Again, sith there can be no goodness desired, which proceedeth not from God himself, as from the supream cause of all things; and every effect doth after a sort contain, at leastwise resemble the cause from which it proceedeth: All things in the World are said, in some sort, to seek the highest, and to cover more or less the participation of God himself; yet this doth no where so much appear, as it doth in Man, because there are so many kindes of Perfections
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66185:47"/>
which Man seeketh! The first degree of Goodness, is, that General Perfection which all things do seek, in desiring the continuance of their Being; all things therefore coveting, as much as may be, to be like unto God in Being ever, that which cannot hereunto attain personally, doth seek to continue it self another way; that is, by Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring and Propagation. The next degree of Goodness is, that which each thing coveteth, by affecting resemblance with God, in the constancy and excellency of those operations which belong unto their kinde! The Immutability of God they strive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by working either always, or for the most part, after one and the same manner; his absolute exactness they imitate, by tending unto that which is most exquisite in every particular.

Vide Isal. 7. 16.</note> and the Children of Men this difference: Angels already have full and compleat knowledge in the highest degree that can be imparted unto them: Men, if we view them in their Spring, are at the first without understanding or knowledge at all. Nevertheless, from this utter vacuity they grow by degrees, till they come at length to be even as the Angels themselves are. That which agreeth to the one now, the other shall attain unto in the end, they are not so far disjoyned and severed, but that they comest length to meet. The Soul of Man being therefore at the first as a Book, wherein nothing is, and yet all things may be imprinted; we are to search by what steps and degrees it riseth unto Perfection of Knowledge. Unto that which hath been already set down, concerning Natural Agents, this we must add, That albeit therein we have comprised as well Creatures living, as void of life, if they be in degree of nature beneath Men; nevertheless, a difference we must observe between those Natural Agents that work altogether unwittingly; and those which have, though weak, yet some understanding what they do, as Fishes, Fowls, and Beasts, have. Beasts are in sensible capacity as ripe, even as men themselves, perhaps more ripe. For as Stones, though in dignity of Nature, inferior unto Plants, yet exceed them in firmness of strength, or durability of Being, and Plants, though beneath the excellency of Creatures endued with sense, yet exceed them in the Faculty of Vegetation, and of Fertility: So Beasts, though otherwise behinde Men, may notwithstanding in actions of Sense and Fancy go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, because the endeavors of Nature, when it hath an higher perfection to seek, are in lower the more remiss, not esteeming thereof so much as those things do, which have no better proposed unto them.

Instruments unto that which is greater; in the mean while, above the reach of meaner Creatures is ascendeth not. When once it comprehendeth any thing above this, as the differences of time, affirmations, negations, and contradiction in Speech, we then count it to have some use of Natural Reason. Whereunto, if afterwards there might be added the right helps of true Art and Learning (which helps, I must plainly confess, this age of the World, carrying the name of a Learned Age, doth neither much know, not greatly regard) there would undoubtedly be almost as great difference in maturity of judgment between men therewith inured, and that which now men are, as between men that are now, and Innocents. Which speech, if any condemn, as being over Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical, let them consider but this one thing: No Art is at the first finding out so perfect, as Industry may aftermake it; yet the very first Man, that to any purpose knew the way we speak of, and followed it, hath alone thereby performed more, very near, in all parts of Natural Knowledge, then sithence in any one part thereof the whole World besides hath done: In the poverty of that other new devised aid, two things there are notwithstanding singular.<note place="margin">Ramistry.</note> Of marvellous quick dispatch it is, and doth shew them that have it, as much almost in three days, as if it had dwelt threescore years with them. Again, because the curiosity of Mans wit doth many times with pers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wade farther in the search of things, then were convenient, the same is thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained unto such generalities, as every where offering themselves, are apparent unto men of the weakest conceit that need be: So as following the Rules and Precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we may finde it to be an Art, which teacheth the way of speedy Discourse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth the minde of Man, that it may not wax overwise. Education and Instruction are the means, the one by use, the other by precept, to make our Natural Faculty of Reason, both the better, and the sooner able to judge rightly between Truth and Error, Good and Evil. But at what time a man may be said to have attained so far forth the use of Reason, as sufficeth to make him capable of those Laws, whereby he is then bound to guide his actions: This is a great deal more easie for common sense to discern, then for any man by skill and learning to determine; even as it is not in Philosophers, who best know the nature both of Fire and Gold, to teach what degree of the one, will serve to purifie the other, so well as the Artizan (which doth this by fire) discerneth by Sense, when the fire hath that degree of heat which sufficeth for his purpose.</p>

By Reason, Man attaineth unto the knowledge of things that are, and are not sensible; it resteth therefore, that we search how Man attaineth unto the knowledge of such things unsensible, as are to be known, that they may be done. Seeing them that nothing can move, unless there be some end, the desire whereof provoketh unto motion: How should that Divine Power of the Soul, that <hi>Spirit of our Minde,</hi> as the Apostle termeth it, ever stir it self unto action, unless it have also the like spur: The end for which we are moved to work, is sometimes the goodness which we conceive of the very working it self, without any further respect at all; and the cause that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth action, is the meer desire of action, no other good besides being thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Of certain turbulent wits, it is said,<note place="margin">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Illis quieta movere magna merces vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur.</hi> They thought the very disturbance of things established, an hire sufficient to set them on work: Sometimes that which we do, is referred to a further end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the desire whereof, we would leave the same undone, as in their actions that gave Alms,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 2.</note> to purchase thereby the praise of men. Man in Perfection of Nature, being made according to the likeness of his Maker, resembleth him also in the manner of working; so that whatsoever we work as men, the same we do wittingly work, and freely: Neither are we, according to the manner of Natural Agents, any way so tied, but that it is in our power to leave the things we do undone. The good which either is gotten by doing, or which consisteth in the very doing it self, causeth not action, unless apprehending it as good, we so like and desire it. That we do unto any such end, the same we chuse and prefer before the leaving of it undone. Choice there is not, unless the thing which we take, be so in our power, that we might have refused and left it. If fire consume the stubble, it chuseth not so to do, because the nature thereof is such, that it can do no other: To chuse, is to will one thing before another; and to will, is to bend our Souls to the having or doing of that which they see to be good. Goodness is seen with the Eye of the Understanding, and the Light of that Eye,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66185:48"/>
is Reason: So that two Principal Fountains there are of Humane Action, <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; which Will, in things tending towards any end, is termed <hi>Choice.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Knowledge;<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, I have set before you this day, good end evil, life and death.</hi> Concerning Will, he addeth immediately <hi>Chuse life</hi>; that is to say, the things that tend unto Life, them chuse: But of one thing we must have special care, as being a matter of no small moment, and that is, How the Will properly and strictly taken, as it is of things which are referred unto the end that man desireth, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth greatly from that inferior natural desire, which we call Appetite. The object of Appetite is, whatsoever sensible good may be wished for; the object of Will is, that good which Reason doth lead us to seek. Affections, as Joy, and Grief, and Fear, and Anger, with such like, being, as it were, the sundry fashions and forms of Appetite, can neither rise at the conceit of a thing indifferent, nor yet chuse but rise at the sight of some things. Wherefore it is not altogether in our power, whether we will be stirred with Affections, or no. Whereas Actions which issue from the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Will, are in the Power thereof to be performed or stayed. Finally, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is the Wills Sollicitor, and the Will is Appetites Controuler; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often reject: Neither is any other desire term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed properly Will, but that where Reason and Understanding, or the shew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, prescribeth the thing desired. It may be therefore a question, Whether those operations of men are to be counted voluntary, wherein that good which is sensible, provoketh Appetite, and Appetite causeth Action, Reason being never called to counsel; as when we eat or drink, or betake ourselves unto rest, and such like. The truth is, that such actions in men having attained to the use of Reason, are voluntary: For as the Authority of higher Powers, bath force even in those things which are done without their privity, and are of so mean reckoning, that to acquaint them therewith it needeth not: In like sort, voluntarily we are said to do that also, which the Will, if it listed, might hinder from being done, although about the doing thereof, we do not expresly use our Reason or Understanding, and so immediately apply our Wills thereunto. In cases therefore of such facility, the Will doth yield her assent, as it were, with a kinde of silence, by not dissenting; in which respect, her force is not so apparent, as in express Mandates or Prohibitions, especially upon advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation going before. Where Understanding therefore needeth in those things, Reason is the Director of Mans Will, by discovering in Action what is good: For the Laws of Weldoing, are the Dictates of right Reason. Children which are not as yet come unto those years whereat they may have, again, Innocents, which are excluded by Natural Defect from ever having; thirdly, Mad-men, which for the present cannot possibly have the use of right Reason to guide themselves, have for their guide the Reason that guideth other men, which are Tutors over them, to seek and to procure their good for them. In the rest, there is that Light of Reason, whereby good may be known from evil; and which discovering the same rightly, is termed right. The Will notwithstanding, doth not incline to have, or do that which Reason teacheth to be good, unless the same do also teach it to be possible. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Appetite, being more general, may wish any thing which seemeth good, be it never so impossible;<note place="margin">O mihi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritos referat si <hi>Iupiter</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos! <gap reason="foreign">

Let Reason teach impossibility in any thing, and the Will of Man doth let it go, a thing impossible it doth not affect, the impossibility thereof being manifest. There is in the Will of Man, naturally that freedom, whereby it is apt to take or refuse any particular object whatsoever, being presented unto it. Whereupon it followeth, That there is no particular object so good, but it may have the shew of some difficulty or unpleasant quality annexed to it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in respect whereof, the Will may shrink and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it: Contrariwise (for so things are blended) there is no particular evil which hath not some appearance of goodness whereby to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inuate it self: For evil, as evil, cannot be desired; if that be desired which is evil, the cause is the goodness which is, or seemeth to be joyned with it. Goodness doth not move by being, but by being apparent; and therefore many things are neglected, which are most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, onely because the value of them lieth hid. Sensible Goodness is most apparent, neer, and present; which causeth the Appetite to be therewith strongly provoked. Now Pursuit and Refusal in the Will do follow, the one the Affirmation, the other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66185:49"/>
the Negation of Goodness; which the Understanding apprehendeth, grounding it self upon Sease, unless some higher Reason do chance to teach the contraty. And if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have taught it rightly to be good, yet not so apparently, that the Minde receiveth it with utter impossibility of being otherwise; still there is place left for the Will to take or leave. Whereas therefore, amongst so many things as are to be done, there are so few, the goodness whereof, Reason in such sort doth, or easily can discover, we are not to marvel at the choice of evil, even then when the contrary is probably known. Hereby it cometh to pass, that Custom inuring the Minde by long practice, and so leaving there a sensible Impression, prevaileth more then reasonable Perswasion what way soever. Reason therefore may rightly discern the thing which is good, and yet the Will of Man not incline it self thereunto, as oft as the prejudice of sensible Experience doth oversway: Nor let any Man think, that this doth make any thing for the just excuse of Iniquity; for there was never sin committed, wherein a less good was not preferred before a greater, and that wilfully; which cannot be done without the singular disgrace of Nature, and the utter disturbance of that Divine Order, whereby the preheminence of chiefest Acceptation, is by the best things worthily challenged. There is not that good which concerneth us, but it hath evidence enough for it self, if Reason were diligent to search it out. Through neglect thereof, abused we are with the shew of that which is not; sometimes the subrilty of Satan enveighling us, as it did <hi>Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore to return to our former intent of discovering the Natural way, whereby Rules have been found out concerning that Goodness wherewith the Will of Man ought to be moved in Humane Actions; as every thing naturally and necessarily doth desire the utmost good and greatest Perfection, whereof Nature hath made it capable, even so Man. Our felicity therefore being the object and accomplishment of our desire, we cannot chuse but wish and cover it. All particular things which are subject unto Action, the Will doth so far forth incline unto, as Reason judgeth them the better for us, and consequently the more available to our bliss. If Reason err, we fall into evil, and are so far forth deprived of the general Perfection we seek. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that for the framing of Mens actions, the knowledge of good from evil is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, it onely resteth, that we search how this may be had: Neither must we suppose, that there needeth one Rule to know the good,<note place="margin">

Goodness in Actions is like unto straightness, wherefore that which is done well, we term right: For as the straight way is most acceptable to him that travelleth, because by it he cometh soonest to his journeys end; so in Action, that which doth lie the evenest between us and the end we desire, must needs be the fittest for our use. Besides which fitness for use, there is also in rectitude, Beauty; as contrariwise in obliquity, deformity. And that which is good in the Actions of Men, doth not onely delight as profitable, but as

In which consideration, the <hi>Grecians</hi> most divinely have given to the Active perfection of Men, a name expressing both Beauty and Goodness; because Goodness in ordinary speech, is for the most part applied onely to that which is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial: But we in the name of Goodness,<note place="margin">

And of discerning Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, there are but these two ways; the one, the knowledge of the causes whereby it is made such; the other, the observation of those signs and tokens, which being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed always unto Goodness, argue, That where they are found, there also Goodness is, although we know not the cause by force whereof it is there. The former of these, is the most sure and infallible way, but so hard, that all shun it, and had rather walk as men do in the dark, by hap-hazard, then tread so long and intricate Mazes for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge sake. As therefore Physitians are many times forced to leave such Methods of curing, as themselves know to be the fittest, and being over-ruled by their Patients impatiency, are fain to try the best they can, in taking that way of cure, which the cured will yield unto: In like sort, considering how the case doth stand with this present Age full of Tongue, and weak of Brain, behold we yield to the stream thereof; into the Causes of Goodness we will not make any curious or deep inquiry; to touch them now and then it shall be sufficient, when they are so near at hand, that easily they may be conceived without any far removed discourse: That way we are contented to prove, which being the worse in it self,is notwithstanding now by reason of common imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the fitter and likelier to be brooked. Signs and tokens to know good by, are of sundry kindes; some more certain, and some less: The most certain token of evident Goodness is, if the general perswasion of all men do so account it. And therefore a common received Error, is never utterly overthrown, till such times as we go from Signs unto Causes, and shew some manifest Root or Fountain thereof common unto all, whereby it may clearly appear how it hath come to pass, that so many have been overseen. In which case, surmises and slight probabilities will not serve, because the universal consent of men, is the perfectest and strongest in this kinde, which comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely the signs and tokens of Goodness. Things casual do vary, and that which a man doth but chance to think well of, cannot still have the like hap. Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we know not the cause, yet thus much we may know, that some necessary cause there is, whensoever the judgments of all men generally, or for the most part, run one and the same way, especially in matters of that discourse: For of things necessarily and naturally done, there is no more affirmed but this.<note n="a" place="margin">

For a man to win the World, if it be with the loss of his Soul, what benefit or good is it? Axioms less general, yet so manifest, that they need no farther proof, are such as these, <hi>God to be worshipped; Parents to be honored</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth 15.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Others to be used by us, as we our selves would be by them.</hi> Such things, as soon as they are alledged, all men acknowledge to be good; they require no proof or further discourse to be assured of their goodness. Notwithstanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever such principle there is, it was at the first found out by discourse, and drawn from out of the very Bowels of Heaven and Earth: For we are to note, that things in the World are to us discernable, not onely so far forth as serveth for our vital preservation, but further also in a twofold higher respect. For first, if all other uses were utterly taken away; yet the Minde of Man being by Nature speculative and delighted with contemplation in it self, they were to be known even for meer Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings sake. Yea further, besides this, the knowledge of every the least thing in the World, hath in it a second peculiar benefit unto us, in as much as it serveth to minister Rules, Canons, and Laws for Men to direct those actions by, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly term Humane. This did the very Heathens themselves obscurely insinuate, by making <hi>Themis,</hi> which we call <hi>Ius</hi> or Right, to be the Daughter of Heaven and Earth. We know things either as they are in themselves, or as they are in mutual relation one to another. The knowledge of that which Man is in reference unto himself, and other things in relation unto Man, I may justly term the Mother of all those Principles, which are as it were Edicts, Statutes, and Decrees, in that Law of Nature, whereby Humane Actions are framed. First therefore, having observed that the best things where they are not hindred, do still produce the best Operations; (for which cause, where many things are to concur unto one effect, the best is in all congruity of Reason to guide the residue, that it prevailing most, the work principally done by it, may have greatest perfection;) when hereupon we come to observe in our selves, of what excellency our Souls are, in comparison of our Bodies, and the divine part in relation unto the baser of, our Souls; seeing that all these concur in producing Humane Actions, it cannot be well,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arist.</hi> Polit. 1. cap. 5.</note> unless the chiefest do command and direct the rest. The Soul then ought to conduct the Body, and the Spirit of our Mindes, the Soul. This is therefore the first Law, whereby the highest power of the Minde requireth general obedience at the hands of all the rest, concurring with it unto Action. Touching the several grand Mandates, which being imposed by the understanding Faculty of the Minde, must be obeyed by the Will of Man, they are by the same method found out, whether they import our duty towards God, or towards Man. Touching the one, I may not here stand to open, by

For seeing those things which are equal, must needs all have one measure; if I cannot but wish to receive all good, even as much at every mans hand, as any man can wish unto his own soul, how should I look to have any part of my desire herein satisfied, unless my self be careful to satisfie the like desire, which is undoubtedly in other men, we all being of one and the same Nature? To have any thing offered them repugnant to this desire, must needs in all respects grieve them as much as me: So that if I do harm, I must look to suffer; there being no reason that others should shew greater measure of love to me, then they have by me shewed unto them. My desire therefore to be loved of my equals in nature, as much as possible may be, imposeth upon me a natural duty of bearing to them-ward fully the like affection. From which relation of equality between our selves, and them that are as our selves, what several Rules and Canons Natural Reason hath drawn for direction of life, no man is ignorant; as namely,<note n="g" place="margin">Quod qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore the natural measure whereby to judge our doings, is the sentence of Reason, determining and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down what is good to be done. Which sentence is either mandatory, shewing what must be done; or else permissive, declaring onely what may be done; or thirdly, admonitory, opening what is the most convenient for us to do. The first taketh place, where the comparison doth stand altogether between doing, and not doing of one thing, which in it self is absolutely good or evil; as it had been for <hi>Ioseph</hi> to yield, or not to yield, to the impotent desire of his leud Mistress, the one evil, the other good simply. The second is, when of divers things evil, all being not evitable, we are permitted to take one; which one, saving onely in case of so great urgency, were not otherwise to be taken; as in the matter of Divorce amongst the Jews. The last, when of divers things good, one is principal and most eminent; as in their act who sold their possessions, and laid the price at the Apostles feet; which possessions they might have retained unto themselves without sin: Again, in the Apostle St. <hi>Pauls</hi> own choice, to maintain himself by his own labor; whereas in living by the Churches maintenance, as others did, there had been no offence committed. In goodness therefore, there is a latitude or extent, whereby it cometh to pass, that even of good actions, some are better then other some; whereas otherwise one man could not excel another, but all should be either absolutely good, as hitting jump that indivisible Point or Centre wherein goodness consisteth; or else missing it, they should be excluded out of the number of well-doers. Degrees of well-doing there could be none, except perhaps in the seldomness and oftenness of doing well: But the Nature of Goodness being thus ample, a Law is properly that which Reason in such sort defineth to be good, that it must be done. And the Law of Reason or Humane Nature is that, which men by discourse of Natural Reason, have rightly found out themselves to be all for ever bound unto in their actions. Laws of Reason have these marks to be known by: Such as keep them, resemble most lively in their voluntary actions, that very manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66185:51"/>
which Nature her self doth necessarily observe in the course of the whole World. The Works of Nature are all behoveful, beautiful, without superfluity or defect; even so theirs, if they be framed according to that which the Law of Reason teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Secondly, Those Laws are investigable by Reason, without the help of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Supernatural and Divine. Finally, In such sort they are investigable, that the knowledge of them is general, the World hath always been acquainted with them, according to that which one in <hi>Sophocles</hi> observeth,<note place="margin">

Again, there is nothing in it; but any man (having natural perfection of wit, and ripeness of judgment) may by labor and travel finde out. And to conclude principles, the general thereof are such, as it is not easie to finde men ignorant of them. Law Rational therefore, which men commonly use to call the Law of Nature, meaning thereby the Law which Humane Nature knoweth it self in Reason universally bound unto, which also for that cause may be termed most fitly, the Law of Reason; this Law, I say, comprehendeth all those things, which Men by the Light of their Natural Understanding evidently know, or at leastwise may know, to be beseeming or unbeseeming, vertuous or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, good or evil for them to do. Now, although it be true, which some have said, that whatsoever is done amiss, the Law of Nature and Reason thereby is transgrest, because even those offences which are by their special qualities, breaches of Supernatural Laws, do also, for that they are generally evil, violate in general that principle of Reason, which willeth universally to flie from evil; yet do we not therefore so far extend the Law of Reason, as to contain in it all manner of Laws whereunto reasonable Creatures are bound, but (as hath been shewed) we restrain it to those onely duties, which all men by force of Natural Wit, either do, or might understand to be such duties as concern all men.<note place="margin">Th. 1, 2. q. 94: art. 3.

Whereupon their Conclusion is, That seeing each sort of people hath a different kinde of right from other, and that which is right of it's own nature, must be every where one and the same; therefore in it self there is nothing right. These good folks</hi> (saith he, <hi>that I may not trouble their wits with the rehearsal of too many things) have not looked so far into the World as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that,</hi> Do as thou wouldst be done unto, <hi>is a sentence which all Nations under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are agreed upon. Refer this sentence to the love of God, and it extinguisheth all heinous crimes: Refer it to the love of thy Neighbor, and all grievous wrongs it banisheth out of the World.</hi> Wherefore, as touching the Law of Reason, this was (it seemeth) St. <hi>Augustines</hi> judgment; namely, that there are in it some things which stand as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples universally agreed upon; and that out of those Principles, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves evident, the greatest Moral duties we ow towards God or Man, may without any great difficulty be concluded. If then it be here demanded, by what means it should come to pass (the greatest part of the Law Moral being so easie for all men to know) that so many thousands of men notwithstanding have been ignorant, even of principal Moral Duties, not imagining the breach of them to be sin: I deny not, but leud and wicked custom, beginning perhaps at the first amongst few, afterwards spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into greater multitudes, and so continuing from time to time, may be of force even in plain things, to smother the light of Natural understanding, because men will not bend their wits to examine, whether things wherewith they have been accustomed, be good or evil. For examples sake, that grosser kinde of Heathenish Idolatry, whereby they worshipped the very works of their own hands, was an absurdity to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so palpable, that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> comparing Idols and Idolaters together, maketh almost no odds between them, but the one in a manner, as much without wit and sense as the other;<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>They that make them, are like unto them, and so are all that trust in them.</hi> That wherein an Idolater doth seem so absurd and foolish, is by the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thus exprest,<note place="margin">Wisd. 13.17.</note>

him that is weak, for health: He prayeth for life unto him which in dead; of him, which hath no experience, he requireth help: For his journey, he sueth to him which is not able to go: For gain, and work, and success in his affairs, he seeketh furtherance of him that hath no manner of power.</hi> The cause of which sensless stupidity, is afterwards imputed to custom.<note place="margin">Wisd. 14. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>When a Father mourned grievously for his son that was taken away suddenly, he made an image for him that was once dead, whom now he worshipped as a god, ordaining to his servants Ceremonies and Sacrifices.</hi> Thus by process of time this wicked custom prevailed, and was kept as a Law; the Authority of Rulers, the Ambition of Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and such like means, thrusting forward the ignorant, and encreasing their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. Unto this which the Wiseman hath spoken, somewhat besides may be added. For whatsoever we have hitherto taught, or shall hereafter, concerning the force of Mans natural understanding, this we always desire withal to be understood, that there is no kinde of faculty or power in Man, or any other Creature, which can rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Functions allotted to it, without perpetual aid and concurrence of that Supream Cause of all things. The benefit whereof, as oft as we cause God in his justice to withdraw, there can no other thing follow then that which the Apostle noteth, even men endued with the Light of Reason,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.17.</note> to walk notwithstanding <hi>in the vanity of their minde, having their cogitations darkned, and being strangers from the Life of God, through the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their hearts.</hi> And this cause is mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of the ignorance of Idolaters, who see not how the manifest Law of Reason condemneth their gross iniquity and sui; They have not in them,<note place="margin">Isai. 44. 18.19.</note> saith he, so much wit as to think, <hi>Shall I bow to the stock of a tree? All knowledge and understanding is taken from them; for God hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see.</hi> That which we say in this case of Idolatry, serveth for all other things, wherein the like kinde of general blindness hath prevailed against the manifest Laws of Reason. Within the compass of which Laws, we do not onely comprehend whatsoever may be easily known to belong to the duty of all men; but even whatsoever may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be known to be of that quality; so that the same be by necessary consequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of clear and manifest principles. For if once we descend unto probable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections what is convenient formen, we are then in the Territory where free and arbitrary Determinations, the Territory where Humane Laws take place, which Laws are after to be considered.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now the due observation of this Law which Reason teacheth us,<note place="margin">The benefit of keeping that Law which Reason teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> cannot but be effectual unto their great good that observe the same. For we see the whole World, and each part thereof so compacted, that as long as each thing performeth onely that work which is natural unto it, it thereby preserveth both other things, and also it self. Contrariwise, let any principal thing, as the Sun, the Moon, any one of the Heavens or Elements, but once cease, or fail, or swerve; and who doth not easily conceive, that the sequel thereof would be ruine both to it self, and whatsoever dependeth on it? And is it possible, that Man being not onely the noblest Creature in the World, but even a very World in himself, his transgressing the Law of his Nature should draw no manner of harm after it? Yes, <hi>Tribulation and anguish unto every soul that doth evil.</hi> Good doth follow unto all things by observing the course of their nature, and on the contrary side evil, by not observing it; but not unto Natural Agents that good which we call <hi>Reward,</hi> not that evil which we properly term <hi>Punishment.</hi> The reason whereof is, because amongst Creatures in this World, onely Mans observation of the Law of his Nature is <hi>Righteousness,</hi> onely Mans transgression <hi>Sin.</hi> And the reason of this is, the difference in his manner of observing or transgressing the Law of his Nature. He doth not otherwise then voluntarily the one, or the other. What we do against our wills, or constrainedly, we are not properly said to do it; because the motive cause of doing it, is not in our selves, but carrieth us; as if the Wind should drive a Feather in the Air, we no whit furthering that whereby we are driven. In such cases there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evil which is done, moveth compassion; Men are pittied for it, as being rather miserable in such respect then culpable. Some things are likewise done by Man, though not through outward force and impulsion, though not against, yet without their Wills; as in Alienation of Minde, or any the like inevitable utter absence of Wit and Judgment. For which cause, no Man did ever think the hurtful actions of furious Men and Innocents to be punishable. Again, some things we do neither against nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66185:52"/>
without, and yet not simply and meerly with our Wills; but with our Wills in such sort moved, that albeit there be no impossibility but that we might, nevertheless we are not so easily able to do otherwise. In this consideration, one evil deed is made more pardonable then another. Finally, that which we do being evil, is notwithstanding by so much more pardonable, by how much the exigence of so doing, or the difficulty of doing otherwise, is greater; unless this necessity or difficulty have originally risen from our selves. It is no excuse therefore unto him, who being drunk committeth incest, and alledgeth, that his wits were not his own; in as much as himself might have chosen, whether his wits should by that mean have been taken from him. Now Rewards and Punishments do always presuppose some thing willingly done well or ill; without which respect, though we may sometimes receive good or harm, yet then the one is onely a Benefit, and not a Reward; the other simply an Hurt, not a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. From the sundry dispositions of Mans will, which is the root of all his actions, there groweth variety in the sequel of Rewards and Punishments, which are by these and the like rules measured:<note place="margin">Voluntate sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larâ, omnem actum parem esse; lib. soedis. simam, de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult. Bonam voluntatem plerunque pro sacto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putari l. si quis in Testament.</note> 
                     <hi>Take away the will, and all acts are equal: That which we do not, and would do, is commonly accepted as done.</hi> By these and the like rules, Mens actions are determined of, and judged, whether they be in their own nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable or punishable. Rewards and Punishments are not received, but at the hands of such as being above us, have power to examine and judge our deeds. How men come to have this authority one over another in External Actions, we shall more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examine in that which followeth. But for this present, so much all do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that sith every mans heart and conscience doth in good or evil, even secretly committed and known to none but it self, either like or disallow it self, and accordingly either rejoyce, very Nature exulting, as it were, in certain hope of reward, or else grieve as it were,<note place="margin">Divos castè adeunto, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem adhi bento.

That which hitherto we have set down, is (I hope) sufficient to shew their brutishness, which imagine that Religion and Vertue are onely as Men will account of them; that we might make as much account, if we would, of the contrary, without any harm unto our selves, and that in Nature they are as indifferent one as the other. We see then how Nature it self reacheth Laws and Statutes to live by. The Laws which have been hitherto mentioned, do binde men absolutely, even as they are men, although they have never any setled Fellowship, never any solemn Agreement amongst themselves what to do, or not to do. But forasmuch as we are not by our selves suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to furnish our selves with competent store of things needful for such a life as our Nature doth desire, a life fit for the dignity of man: Therefore to supply those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections which are in us living single and solely by our selves, we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enduced to seek Communion and Fellowship with others. This was the cause of Mens uniting themselves at the first in Politick Societies, which Societies could not be without government, nor government without a distinct kinde of Law from that which hath been already declared. Two Foundations there are which beat up Publick Societies; the one, a Natural Inclination, whereby all men desire sociable life and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship; the other, an order expresly or secretly agreed upon, touching the manner of their Union in living together. The latter is that which we call the Law of a Commonweal, the very Soul of a Politick Body, the parts whereof are by Law animated, held together, and set on work in such Actions as the common good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. Laws Politick, ordained for External Order and Regiment amongst Men, are never framed as they should be, unless presuming the Will of Man to be inwardly obstinate, rebellious, and averse from all obedience unto the Sacred Laws of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: In a word, unless presuming Man to be in regard of his depraved minde, little better then a wilde beast, they do accordingly provide notwithstanding so to frame his outward actions, that they be no hindrance unto the common good, for which Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are instituted; unless they do this, they are not perfect. It resteth therefore,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66185:52"/>
that we consider how Nature findeth out such Laws of Government, as serve to direct even Nature depraved to a right end. All men desire to lead in this world an happy life: The life is led most happily, wherein all Vertue is exercised without impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or let.<note n="1" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 8.</note> The Apostle in exhorting men to contentment, although they have in this world no more then very bare Food and Rayment, giveth us thereby to understand, that those are even the lowest of things necessary, that if we should be stripped of all those things, without which we might possibly be, yet these must be left; that desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in these, is such an impediment, as till it be removed, suffereth not the minde of Man to admit any other care. For this cause first,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 29. &amp; 2. 17. &amp; 4. 2. &amp; 4. 20.</note> God assigned <hi>Adam</hi> maintenance of Life, and then appointed him a Law to observe: For this cause after Men began to grow to a number; the first thing we read they gave themselves unto, was the Tilling of the Earth, and the Feeding of Cattle. Having by this mean whereon to live, the principal actions of their life afterward, are noted by the Exercise of their Religion. True it is, that the Kingdom of God must be the first thing in our purposes and desires.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.33.</note> But in as much as a righteous life presupposeth life, in as much as to live vertuously, it is impossible except we live: Therefore the first impediment, which naturally we endeavor to remove, is penury and want of things, without which we cannot live. Unto life many implements are necessary; mo, if we seek (as all men naturally do) such a life as hath in it joy, comfort, delight, and pleasure. To this end we see how quickly sundry Arts Mechanical were found out in the very prime of the World.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.20,21, 22.</note> As things of greatest necessity are always first provided for, so things of greatest dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are most accounted of by all such as judge rightly. Although therefore Riches be a thing which every Man wisheth, yet no Man of judgment can esteem it better to be Rich, then Wise, Vertuous, and Religious. If we be both, or either of these, it is not because we are so born: For into the World we come as empty of the one, as of the other, as naked in Minde as we are in Body. Both which necessities of Man had at the first no other helps and supplies, then onely domestical; such as that which the Prophet implieth,<note place="margin">Isai. 4g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If therefore, when there was but as yet one onely family in the World, no means of instruction, Humane or Divine, could prevent effusion of blood: How could it be chosen, but that when Families were multiplied and encreased upon Earth;<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 8.</note> after Separation, each providing for it self, Envy, Strife, Contention, and Violence, must grow amongst them? For hath not Nature furnished Man with Wit and Valor, and as it were with Armor, which may be used as well unto extream evil as good? Yea, were they not used by the rest of the World unto evil? Unto the contrary onely,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. Gen. 5.</note> by <hi>Seth, Enoch,</hi> and those few the rest in that Line? We all make complaint of the iniquity of our times; not unjustly, for the days are evil. But compare them with those times wherein there were no civil Societies, with those times therein there was as yet no manner of Publick Regiment established, with those times wherein there were not above eight righteous persons living upon the face of the Earth:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note> And we have surely good cause to think, that God hath blessed us exceedingly, and hath made us behold most happy days. To take away all such mutual grievances, injuries, and wrongs, there was no way but onely by growing unto Composition and Agreement amongst themselves, by ordaining some kinde of Government publick, and by yielding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves subject thereunto; that unto whom they granted authority to rule and govern, by them the peace, tranquillity, and happy estate of the rest might be procured. Men always knew, that when Force and Injury was offered, they might be Defenders of themselves; they knew that howsoever men may seek their own commodity, yet if this were done with injury unto others, it was not to be suffered, but by all men, and by all good means to be withstood: Finally, they knew that no man might in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son take upon him to determine his own right, and according to his own determination proceed in maintenance thereof, in as much as every man is towards himself and them whom he greatly affecteth partial: And therefore that strifes and troubles would be endless, except they gave their common consent, all to be ordered by some whom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66185:53"/>

To Fathers within their Private Families, Nature hath given a supream power; for which cause we see throughout the World, even from the first Foundation thereof, all men have ever been taken as Lords and Lawful Kings in their own houses. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, over a whole grand multitude, having no such dependency upon any one, and consisting of so many Families, as every Politick Society in the World doth; impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that any should have compleat lawful power, but by consent of men, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate appointment of God, because not having the Natural Superiority of Fathers, their power must needs be either usurped, and then unlawful; or if lawful, then either granted or consented unto by them, over whom they exercise the same, or else given extraordinarily from God, unto whom all the World is subject. It is no improbable opinion therefore which the Arch-Philosopher was of,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arist.</hi> Polit. lib. 1. cap. 5. Vide &amp; lato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem in 3. de legibus.</note> That as the chiefest person in every houshold, was always as it were a King, so when numbers of housholds joyned themselves in civil Societies together, Kings were the first kinde of Governors amongst them. Which is also (as it seemeth) the reason, why the name of <hi>Father</hi> continued still in them, who of Fathers were made Rulers; as also the ancient custom of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to do as <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> and being Kings to exercise the Office of Priests, which Fathers did at the first, grew perhaps by the same occasion: Howbeit, not this the onely kinde of Regiment that hath been received in the World. The inconveniences of one kinde, have caused sundry other to be devised: So that in a word, all Publick Regiment, of what kinde soever, seemeth evidently to have risen from deliberate Advice, Consultation, and Composition between Men, judging it convenient and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful; there being no impossibility in Nature considered by it self, but that men might have lived without any Publick Regiment. Howbeit, the corruption of our nature being presupposed, we may not deny, but that the Law of Nature doth now require of necessity some kinde of Regiment; so that to bring things unto the first course they were in, and utterly to take away all kinde of Publick Government in the World, were apparently to overturn the whole World. The case of Mans nature standing therefore as it doth, some kinde of Regiment the Law of Nature doth require; yet the kindes thereof being many, Nature tieth not to any one, but leaveth the choice as a thing arbitrary. At the first, when some certain kinde of Regiment was once approved, it may be that nothing was then further thought upon for the manner of governing, but all permitted unto their Wisdom and Discretion which were to rule;<note n="a" place="margin">Cum preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur ini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first kinde therefore of things appointed by Laws Humane, containeth whatsoever being in it self naturally good or evil, is notwithstanding more secret then that it can be discerned by every mans present conceit, without some deeper discourse and judgment. In which discourse, because there is difficulty and possibility many ways to err, unless such things were set down by Laws, many would be ignorant of their duties, which now are not; and many that know what they should do, would never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless dissemble it, and to excuse themselves, pretend ignorance and simplicity, which now they cannot. And because the greatest part of Men, are such as prefer their own private good before all things; even that good which is Sensual, before whatsoever is most Divine: And for that the labor of doing good, together with the pleasure arising from the contrary, doth make men for the most part slower to the one, and proner to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66185:53"/>
the other, then that duty prescribed then by Law, can prevail sufficiently with them. Therefore unto Laws that Men do make for the benefit of Men, it hath seemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways needful to add Rewards, which may more allure unto good, then any hardness deterreth from it; and Punishments, which may more deter from evil, then any sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereto allureth. Wherein as the generality is Natural, <hi>Vertue rewardable, and Vice punishable</hi>; So the particular determination of the Reward or Punishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto them by whom Laws are made. Theft is naturally punishable, but the kinde of punishment is Positive; and such lawful, as Men shall think with discretion convenient by Law to appoint. In Laws, that which is Natural, bindeth universally; that which is Positive, not so. To let go those kinde of Positive Laws which Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon themselves, as by vow unto God, contract with Men, or such like; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what it will make unto our purpose, a little more fully to consider, what things are incident unto the making of the Positive Laws for the Government of them that live united in Publick Society. Laws do not onely teach what is good, but they enjoyn it, they have in them a certain constraining force; and to constrain Men unto any thing inconvenient, doth seem unreasonable. Most requisite therefore it is, that to devise Laws which all Men shall be forced to obey, none but Wisemen be admitted. Laws are Matters of Principal Consequence; Men of common Capacity, and but ordinary Judgment, are not able (for how should they?) to discern what things are fittest for each kinde and state of Regiment. We cannot be ignorant how much our obedience unto Laws, dependeth upon this point. Let a man, though never so justly, oppose himself unto them that are disordered in their ways, and what one among them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doth not stomach at such Contradiction, storm at Reproof, and hate such as would Reform them? Notwithstanding, even they which brook it worst, that Men should tell them of their duties, when they are told the same by a Law, think very well and reasonably of it. For why? They presume that the Law doth speak with all indifferency; that the Law hath no side respect to their persons; that the Law is as it were an Oracle proceeding from Wisdom and Understanding. Howbeit, Laws do not take their constraining force from the quality of such as devise them, but from that power which doth give them the strength of Laws. That which we spake before concerning the Power of Government, must here be applied unto the power of making Laws whereby to govern, which power God hath over all, and by the Natural Law, whereunto he hath made all subject, the lawful power of making Laws, to command whole Politick Societies of Men, belongeth so properly unto the same entire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate, of what kinde soever upon Earth, to exercise the same of himself, and not either by express Commission immediately and personally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God, or else by Authority derived at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose Laws, it is no better then meer tyranny. Laws they are not therefore which Publick Approbation hath not made so: But Approbation not onely they give who personally declare their assent, by voice, sign, or act; but also when others do it in their names, by right originally, at the least, derived from them. As in Parliaments, Councils, and the like Assemblies, although we be not personally our selves present, notwithstanding our Assent is by reason of other Agents there in our behalf. And what we do by others, no reason but that it should stand as our Deed, no less effectually to binde us, then if our selves had done it in person. In many things Assent is given, they that give it, not imagining they do so, because the manner of their assenting is not apparent. As for example, when an absolute Monarch command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Subjects that which seemeth good in his own discretion; hath not his Edict the force of a Law, whether they approve or dislike it? Again, that which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived long sithence, and is by custom now established, we keep as a Law which we may not transgress; yet, what consent was ever thereunto sought or required at our hands? Of this point therefore we are to note, that sith Men naturally have no full and perfect power to command whole Politick Multitudes of Men; therefore utterly without our consent, we could in such sort be at no Mans commandment living. And to be commanded, we do consent, when that Society whereof we are part, hath at any time before consented, without revoking the same after by the like Universal Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore, as any Mans Deed past is good as long as himself continueth; so the Act of a Publick Society of Men done Five hundred years sithence, standeth as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66185:54"/>
theirs, who presently are of the same Societies, because Corporations are Immortal; we were then alive in our Predecessors, and they in their Successors do live still. Laws therefore Humane of what kinde soever, are available by consent. If here it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how it cometh to pass, that this being common unto all Laws which are made, there should be found even in good Laws so great variety as there is; We must note the Reason hereof to be, the sundry particular ends whereunto the different disposition of that Subject or Matter for which Laws are provided, causeth them to have a special respect in making Laws.<note place="margin">

No man could ever have thought this reasonable, that had intended thereby onely to punish the injury commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the gravity of the Fact: For who knoweth not, that harm advisedly done, is naturally less pardonable, and therefore worthy of sharper punishment: But for as much as none did so usually this way offend as men in that case, which they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly fell into, even because they would be so much the more freely outragious: It was for their publick good where such disorder was grown, to frame a Positive Law for remedy thereof accordingly. To this appertain those known Laws of making Laws; as that Law-makers must have an eye to that place where, and to the men amongst whom; that one kinde of Laws cannot serve for all kinde of Regiment; that where the Multitude beareth sway, Laws that shall tend unto the preservation of that State, must make common smaller Offices to go by lot, for fear of strife and division likely to arise; by reason that ordinary qualities sufficing for discharge of such Offices, they could not but by many be desired, and so with danger contended for, and not missed without grudge and discontentment; whereas at an uncertain lot, none can finde themselves grieved, on whomsoever it lighteth. Contrariwise the greatest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but few are capable, to pass by Popular Election, that neither the people may envy such as have those Honors, in as much as themselves bestow them, and that the chiefest may be kindled with desire, to exercise all parts of rare and beneficial Vertue; knowing they shall not lose their labor by growing in fame and estimation amongst the people. If the Helm of chief Government be in the hands of a few of the wealthiest, that then Laws providing for continuance thereof, must make the punishment of contumely, and wrong offered unto any of the common sort, sharp and grievous; that so the evil may be prevented, whereby the rich are most likely to bring themselves into hatred with the people, who are not wont to take so great offence, when they are excluded from Honors and Offices, as when their persons are contumeliously trodden upon. In other kindes of Regiment, the like is observed concerning the difference of Positive Laws, which to be everywhere the same, is impossible, and against their Nature.

albeit the Law of Reason teach them, should notwithstanding be prescribed even by Humane Law. Which Law in this case we term <hi>Mixt,</hi> because the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it bindeth, is the same which Reason necessarily doth require at our hands, and from the Law of Reason it differeth in the manner of binding onely.

As for Laws which are <hi>Meerly Humane,</hi> the matter of them is any thing, which Reason doth but probably teach to be fit and convenient; so that till such time as Law hath passed amongst men about it, of it self it bindeth no man. One example whereof may be this, Lands are by Humane Law in some places, after the owners decease, divided unto all his Children; in some, all descendeth to the eldest Son. If the Law of Reason did necessarily require but the one of these two to be done, they which by Law have received the other, should be subject to that heavy sentence which denounceth against all that Decree wicked, unjust, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable things,<hi>Wo.</hi> Whereas now, which soever be received, there is no Law of Reason transgrest;<note place="margin">Isa. 10. 1.</note> because there is probable reason why either of them may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, and for either of them more then probable reason there is not to be found. Laws, whether mixtly, or meerly Humane, are made by Politick Societies; some onely, as those Societies are civilly united; some, as they are spiritually joyned, and make such a Body as we call the Church. Of Laws Humane in this latter kinde, we are to speak in the Third Book following: Let it therefore suffice thus far to have touched the force wherewith Almighty God hath graciously endued our Nature, and thereby enabled the same to finde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now besides that Law which simply concerneth men, as Men; and that which belongeth unto them, as they are Men linked with others in some Form of Politick Society, there is a third kinde of Law which toucheth all such several Bodies Politick, so far forth as one of them hath Publick Commerce with another. And this third is, <hi>The Law of Nations.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men and Beasts, there is no possibility or Sociable Communion, because the Welspring of that Communion is a Natural delight which Man hath to transfuse from himself into others, and to receive from others into himself, especially those things wherein the excellency of this kinde doth most consist.<note place="margin">

Again, as those Laws of Polity and Regiment, which would have

Now as there is great cause of Communion, and consequently of Laws, for the maintenance of Communion amongst Nations: So amongst Nations Christian, the like in regard even of Christianity, hath been always judged needful. And in this kinde of correspondence amongst Nations, the force of General Councils doth stand. For as one and the same Law Divine, whereof in the next place we are to speak, is unto all Christian Churches a rule for the chiefest things; by means whereof they all in that respect make one Church,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 5.</note> as having all but <hi>One Lord, one Faith, and one Baptism:</hi> So the urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Mutual Communion for Preservation of our Unity in these things; as also for Order in some other things convenient to be every where uniformly kept, maketh it requisite, that the Church of God here on Earth, have her Laws of Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between Christian Nations: Laws, by vertue whereof all Churches may enjoy freely the use of those Reverend, Religious and Sacred Consultations, which are term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Councils General. A thing whereof Gods own Blessed Spirit was the Author, a thing practised by the holy Apostles themselves,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 23.</note> a thing always afterwards kept and observed throughout the World; a thing never otherwise, then most highly esteemed of, till Pride, Ambition, and Tyranny began by factious and vile Endeavors, to abuse that Divine Invention, unto the furtherance of wicked purposes. But as the just Authority of Civil Courts and Parliaments is not therefore to be abolished, because sometimes there is cunning used to frame them according to the private intents of men over-potent in the Commonwealth: So the grievous abuse which hath been of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, should rather cause men to study how so gracious a thing may again be reduced to that first Perfection, then in regard of stains and blemishes sithence growing, be held for ever in extream disgrace. To speak of this matter as the cause requireth, would require very long discourse. All I will presently say, is this, Whether it be for the finding out of any thing whereunto Divine Law bindeth us; but yet in such sort, that Men are not thereof on all sides resolved; or for the setting down of some Uniform Judgment to stand touching such things, as being neither way matters of necessity, are notwithstanding offensive and scandalous, when there is open opposition about them: Be it for the ending of strifes, touching matters of Christian belief, wherein the one part may seem to have probable cause of dissenting from the other; or be it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of Policy, Order, and Regiment in the Church; I nothing doubt but that Christian men should much better frame themselves to those Heavenly Precepts, which our Lord and Saviour, with so great instancy gave, as concerning Peace and Unity,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 27.</note> if we did all concur in desire to have the use of Ancient Councils again renewed, rather then these proceedings continued, which either make all Contentions endless, or bring them to one onely Determination, and that of all other the worst, which is

In so much, as there is in the whole World no one thing great or small, but either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of knowledge or of use, it may unto our Perfection add somewhat. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever such Perfection there is, which our Nature may acquire, the same we properly term our good, our <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> or <hi>Blessedness</hi>; that wherein the highest degree of all our Perfection consisteth, that which being once attained unto, there can rest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to be desired; and therefore with it our souls are fully content and satisfied, in that they have, they rejoyce, and thirst for no more: Wherefore of good things desired, some are such, that for themselves, we cover them not, but onely because they serve as Instruments unto that for which we are to seek: Of this sort, are Riches: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kinde there is, which although we desire for it self, as Health, and Vertue, and Knowledge; nevertheless, they are not the last mark whereat we aim, but have their further end whereunto they are referred: So as in them we are not satisfied, as having attained the utmost we may, but our desires do still proceed. These things are linked, and as it were chained one to another. We labor to eat, and we eat to live, and we live to do good, and the good which we do,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8. <hi>He that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap Life Everlasting.</hi>
                     </note> is as seed sown with reference unto a future Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest. But we must come at the length to some pause: For if every thing were to be desired for some other without any stint, there could be no certain end proposed unto our actions, we should go on we know not whither; yea, whatsoever we do, were in vain, or rather nothing at all were possible to be done. For as to take away the first efficient of our Being, were to annihilate utterly our persons; so we cannot remove the last final cause of our working, but we shall cause whatsoever we work to cease. Therefore something there must be desired for it self simply, and for no other: That is, simply for it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable, unto the nature whereof it is opposite and repugnant to be desired, with relation unto any other. The Ox and the Ass desire their food, neither propose they unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any end wherefore; so that of them, this is desired for it self. But why? By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their imperfection, which cannot otherwise desire it; whereas that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired simply for it self, the excellency thereof is such as permitteth it not in any sort to be referred unto a further end. Now that which Man doth desire with reference to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, the same he desireth in such measure as is unto that end convenient; but what he covereth as good in it self, towards that his desire is ever infinite.<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Arist.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic. lib. 10. c. 10. &amp; Metaph. l. 12. cap. 5. &amp; cap. 4 &amp; cap. 20.</note> So that unless the last good of all which is desired altogether for it self, be also infinite; we do evil in making it our end, even as they who placed their felicity in wealth, or honor, or pleasure, or any thing here attained, because in desiring any thing as our final perfection, which is not so, we do amiss. Nothing may be infinitely desired, but that good which indeed is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: For the better, the more desireable; that therefore most desireable, wherein there is infinity of goodness: So that if any thing desireable may be infinite, that must needs be the highest of all things that are desired. No good is infinite, but onely God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is our felicity and bliss; moreover, desire tendeth unto union with that it desireth. If then in him we be blessed, it is by force of participation and conjunction with him. Again, it is not the possession of any good thing, can make them happy which have it, unless they enjoy the things wherewith they are possessed. Then are we happy therefore, when fully we enjoy God, as an object wherein the Powers of our Souls are satisfied, even with everlasting delight: So that although we be men, yet by being unto God united, we live as it were the Life of God. Happiness therefore is that estate whereby we attain, so far as possibly may be attained, the full possession of that which simply for it self is to be desired, and containeth in it after an eminent sort, the contentation of our desires, the highest degree of all our Perfection. Of such Perfection, capable we are not in this life: For while we are in the World, we are subject unto sundry<note n="*" place="margin">

exercise of them grievous, being continued without intermission; so as in those very actions, whereby we are especial'y perfected in this life, we are not able to persist; forced we are with very weariness, and that often, to interrupt them: Which rediousness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall into those operations that are in the state of bliss, when our union with God is compleat. Compleat union with him, must be according unto every power and faculty of our mindes, apt to receive so glorious an object. Capable we are of God, both by Understanding and Will: By Understanding, as he is that Soveraign Truth, which comprehends the Rich Treasures of all Wisdom: By Will, as he is that Sea of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereof, whoso tasteth, shall thirst no more. As the Will doth now work upon that object by desire, which is as it were a motion towards the end as yet unobtained, so likewise upon the same hereafter received, it shall work also by love. <hi>Appetitus inhian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis fit amor fruentis,</hi> saith St. <hi>Augustine. The longing disposition of them that thirst, is changed into the sweet affection of them that taste, and are replenished.</hi> Whereas we now love the thing that is good, but good especially, in respect of benefit unto us; we shall then love the thing that is good, onely or principally for the goodness of beauty in it self.

Under Man, no Creature in the World is capable of felicity and bliss: First, because their chiefest Perfection consisteth in that which is best for them, but not in that which is simply best, as ours doth. Secondly, because whatsoever Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Perfection they tend unto, it is not better then themselves, as ours is. How just occasion have we therefore even in this respect with the Prophet to admire the goodness of God:<note place="margin">Psal. 8.</note> Lord, what is man that thou shouldst exalt him above the works of thy hands, so far as to make thy self the Inheritance of his Rest, and the Substance of his Felicity! Now, if men had not naturally this desire to be happy, how were it possible that all men should have it? All men have: Therefore this desire in Man is natural. It is not in our power not to do the same, how should it then be in our power to do it coldly or remisly? So that our desire being natural, is also in that degree of earnestness whereunto nothing can be added. And is it probable that God should frame the hearts of all men so desirous of that which no man may obtain?<note place="margin">Comment in Procaem. 2. Metaph.</note> It is an Axiom of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that natural desire cannot utterly be frustrate. This desire of ours being natural, should be frustrate, if that which may satisfie the same, were a thing impossible for Man to aspire unto. Man doth seek a tripple Perfection; first, a sensual, consisting in those things which very life it self requireth, either as necessary Supplements, or as Beauties and Ornaments thereof; then an Intellectual, consisting in those things which none underneath Man, is either capable of, or acquainted with; lastly, a Spiritual and Divine, consisting in those things whereunto we tend by supernatural means here, but cannot here attain unto them. They that make the first of these three, the scope of their whole life,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> are said by the Apostle to have no God, but onely their Belly, to be earthly-minded men. Unto the second they bend themselves, who seek especially to excel in all such Knowledge and Vertue as doth most commend Men. To this branch belongeth the Law of Moral and Civil Perfection: That there is somewhat higher then either of these two, no other proof doth need then the very Process of Mans desire, which being natural, should be frustrate, if there were not some farther thing wherein it might rest at the length concented, which in the former it cannot do. For Man doth not seem to rest satisfied, either with fruition of that wherewith his life is preserved, or with performance of such actions as advance him most deservedly in estimation; but doth further covet, yea, oftentimes manifestly pursue with great sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and earnestness, that which cannot stand him in any stead for vital use; that which exceedeth the reach of Sense, yea, somewhat above capacity of Reason, somewhat Divine and Heavenly, which with hidden exultation, it rather surmiseth then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth; somewhat it seeketh, and what that is directly, it knoweth not; yet very intentive desire thereof doth so incite it, that all other known delights and pleasures
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66185:56"/>
are laid aside, they give place to the search of this but onely suspected desire. If the Soul of Man did serve onely to give him Being in this life, then things appertaining unto this life, would content him, as we see they do other Creatures; which Creatures enjoying what they live by, seek no further, but in his contentation do shew a kinde of acknowledgment, that there is no higher good which doth any way belong unto them. With us it is otherwise: For although the Beauties, Riches, Honors, Sciences, Vertues, and Perfections of all Men living, were in the present possession of one; yet somewhat beyond and above all this, there would still be sought and earnestly thirsted for. So that Nature, even in this life, doth plainly claim and call for a more Divine Perfection, then either of these two that have been mentioned. This last and highest estate of Perfection, whereof we speak, is received of Men in the nature of a<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 5. 12. <hi>Rejoyce and be glad, for great is your reward in Heaven. Aug.</hi> de Doct. <hi>Christ. cap.</hi> 6. Summa mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces est ut isto persruamur.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Rewards do always presuppose such duties performed as are rewardable: Our natural means therefore unto Blessedness, are our works; nor is it possible that Nature should ever finde any other way to Salvation, then onely this. But examine the works which we do, and since the first Foundation of the World, what one can say, My ways are pure? Seeing then all flesh is guilty of that for which God hath threatned eternally to punish, what possibility is there this way to be saved? There resteth therefore, either no way unto Salvation, or if any, then surely a way which is Supernatural, a way which could never have entred into the heart of man, as much as once to conceive or imagine, if God himself had not revealed it extraordinarily: For which cause, we term it the Mystery or Secret way of Salvation.

Howbeit, they both did fail of their purpose, and got not so much as to quit their charges; because Truth, which is the secret of the most High God, whose proper handy-work all things are, cannot be compassed with that wit and those senses which are our own. For God and Man should be very near Neighbors, if Mans cogitations were able to take a survey of the Counsels and Appointments of that Majesty Everlasting.

in as much as the dignity of this exceedeth so far the others value. But be it, that God of his great Liberality had determined in lieu of Mans endeavors to bestow the same, by the rule of that Justice which best beseemeth him, namely, the Justice of one that requireth nothing mincingly, but all with pressed, and heaped, and even over-enlarged measure; yet could it never hereupon necessarily be gathered, that such Justice should add to the nature of that Reward, the property of everlasting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; sith Possession of Bliss, though it should be but for a moment, were an abundant retribution. But we are not now to enter into this consideration, how gracious and bountiful our good God might still appear in so rewarding the Sons of Men, albeit they should exactly perform whatsoever duty their Nature bindeth them unto. Howsoever God did propose this Reward, we that were to be rewarded, must have done that which is required at our hands; we failing in the one, it were in Nature an impossibility that the other should be looked for. The Light of Nature is never able to finde out any way of obtaining the Reward of Bliss, but by performing exactly the Duties and Works of Righteousness. From Salvation therefore and Life, all flesh being excluded this way, behold how the Wisdom of God hath revealed a way Mystical and Supernatural, away directing unto the same end of life, by a course which groundeth it self upon the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin, and through sin, desert of condemnation and death. For in this way, the first thing is the tender compassion of God, respecting us drowned and swallowed up in misery: The next is Redemption out of the same, by the precious Death and Merit of a Mighty Saviour, which hath witnessed of himself, saying,<note place="margin">John 14. 6.</note>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, the principal object whereof is, that Eternal Verity which hath discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Treasures of hidden Wisdom in Christ. Concerning Hope, the highest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereof, is that Everlasting Goodness which in Christ doth quicken the dead. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Charity, the final object whereof is, that incomprehensible Beauty which shineth in the countenance of Christ the Son of the Living God. Concerning these Vertues, the first of which beginning here with a weak apprehension of things not seen, endeth with the intuitive Vision of God in the World to come; the second beginning here with a trembling expectation of things far removed, and as yet but onely heard of, endeth with Real and Actual Fruition of that which no Tongue can express; the third beginning herewith a weak in inclination of heart towards him, unto whom we are not able to approach, endeth with endless Union; the mystery whereof is higher then the reach of the thoughts of Men. Concerning that Faith, Hope, and Charity, without which there can be no Salvation; was there ever any mention made saving onely in that Law which God himself hath from Heaven revealed? There is not in the World a syllable muttered with certain truth concerning any of these three, more then hath been super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally received from the Mouth of the Eternal God. Laws therefore concerning these things are Supernatural, both in respect of the manner of delivering them, which is Divine; and also in regard of the things delivered, which are such as have not in Nature any cause from which they flow, but were by the voluntary appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God ordained, besides the course of Nature, to rectifie Natures obliquity withal.</p>

Wherefore, in as much as our actions are conversant about things beset with many circumstances, which cause men of sundry wits, to be also of sundry judgments concerning that which ought to be done: Requisit it cannot but seem the Rule of Divine Law should herein help our imbecillity, that we might the more infallibly understand what is good, and what evil.

Hereby we know even se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret concupiscence to be sin, and are made fearful to offend, though it be but in a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring cogitation. Finally, of those things which are for direction of all the parts of our life needful, and not impossible to be discerned by the Light of Nature it self; are there not many which few mens natural capacity, and some which no mans hath been able to finde out? They are, saith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> but a few, and they endued with great ripeness of wit and judgment, free from all such affairs as might trouble their Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, instructed in the sharpest and the subtilest points of Learning, who have, and that very hardly, been able to finde out but onely the Immortality of the Soul. The Resurrection of the Flesh, what Man did ever at any time dream of, having not heard it otherwise, then from the School of Nature? Whereby it appeareth, how much we are bound to yield unto our Creator, the Father of all Mercy, Eternal Thanks, for that he hath delivered his Law unto the World? a Law wherein so many things are laid open, clear, and manifest; as a Light, which otherwise would have been buried in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, not without the hazard; or rather not with the hazard, but with the certain loss of infinite thousands of Souls, most undoubtedly now saved. We see therefore that our soveraign good is desired naturally, that God the Author of that natural desire, had appointed natural means whereby to fulfil it; that Man having utterly disabled his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto those means, hath had other revealed from God, and hath received from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Law to teach him, how that which is desired naturally, must now supernaturally be attained. Finally, we see, that because those latter exclude not the former quite and clean as unnecessary, therefore together with such Supernatural duties as could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have been otherwise known to the World, the same Law that teacheth them, teacheth also with them such Natural duties, as could not by Light of Nature easily have been known.</p>

The singular benefit that hath grown unto the World by receiving the Laws of God, even by his own appointment committed unto writing, we are not able to esteem as the value thereof deserveth. When the question therefore is, whether we be now to seek for any revealed Law of God, otherwhere then onely in the Sacred Scripture; whether we do now stand bound in the sight of God to yield to Traditions urged by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the same obedience and reverence we do to his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law, honoring equally, and adoring both as Divine? Our answer is, No. They that so earnestly plead for the Authority of Tradition, as if nothing were more safely conveyed, then that which spreadeth it self by report, and descendeth by relation of former Generations, unto the Ages that succeed, are not all of them (surely a miracle it were, if they should be) so simple, as thus to perswade themselves; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, if the simple were so perswaded, they could be content perhaps very well to enjoy the benefit, as they account it, of that common Error. What hazard the Truth is in, when it passeth through the hands of report, how maimed and deformed it becometh; they are not, they cannot possibly be ignorant. Let them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of this minde, consider but onely that little of things Divine, which the <note n="*" place="margin">I mean those Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters concerning the ancient state of the first World, the Deluge, the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance one of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the life and doings of <hi>Moses</hi> their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with such like: The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth whereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is of the Heathen which had them onely by report, so in ermingled with fabulous vanities, that the most which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them to be seen, in the shew of dark and obscure steps, where some part of the Truth hath gone.</note>Heathen have in such sort received. How miserable had the State of the Church of God been long ere this, if wanting the Sacred Scripture, we had no Record of his Laws, but onely the memory of man, receiving the same by report and relation from his Predecessors? By Scripture, it hath in the Wisdom of God, seemed meet to deliver unto the World much, but personally expedient to be practised of certain men; many deep and profound points of Doctrine, as being the main original ground whereupon the Precepts of duty depend; many Prophecies, the clear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof might confirm the World in belief of things unseen; many Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to serve as Looking-glasses to behold the Mercy, the Truth, the Righteousness of God towards all that faithfully serve, obey and honor him; yea, many intire Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Piety, to be as Patterns and Precedents in cases of like Nature; many things needful for Explication, many for Application unto particular occasions, such as the Providence of God from time to time hath taken, to have the several Books of his holy Ordinance written. Be it then, that together with the principal neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Laws of God, there are sundry other things written, whereof we might haply be ignorant, and yet be saved: What? shall we hereupon think them needless? shall we esteem them as riotous Branches, wherewith we sometimes behold most pleasant Vines overgrown? Surely, no more then we judge our hands or our eyes super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, or what part soever; which if our Bodies did want, we might notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any such defect, retain still the compleat Being of Men. As therefore a compleat Man is neither destitute of any part necessary, and hath some parts, whereof, though the want could not deprive him of his essence, yet to have them, standeth him in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular stead in respect of the special uses for which they serve: In like sort, all those writings which contain in them the Law of God, all those venerable Books of Scripture, all those Sacred Tomes and Volumes of holy Writ; they are with such absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection framed, that in them there neither wanteth any thing, the lack whereof might deprive us of life; nor any thing in such wise aboundeth, that as being superfluous, unfruitful, and altogether needless, we should think it no loss or danger at all, if we did want it.</p>

If onely those things be necessary, as surely none else are, without the knowledge and practise whereof, it is not the will and pleasure of God to make any ordinary grant of salvation; it may be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, and oftentimes hath been demanded, how the Books of holy Scripture contain in them all necessary things, when of things necessary the very chief is to know what Books we are bound to esteem holy; which point is confest impossible for the Scripture it self to teach. Whereunto we may answer with truth, that there is not in the World any Art or Science, which proposing unto it self an end (as every one doth some end or other) hath been therefore thought defective, if it have not delivered sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply whatsoever is needful to the same end; but all kindes of knowledge have their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bounds and limits; each of them presupposeth many necessary things learned in other Sciences, and known beforehand. He that should take upon him to teach men how to be eloquent in pleading causes, must needs deliver unto them whatsoever Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are requisite unto that end; otherwise he doth not the thing which he taketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Seeing then no man can plead eloquently, unless he be able first to speak; it followeth, that ability of speech is in this case a thing most necessary. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man would think it ridiculous, that he which undertaketh by writing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct an Orator, should therefore deliver all the Precepts of Grammar; because his Profession is to deliver Precepts necessary unto eloquent speech; yet so, that they which are to receive them be taught beforehand, so much of that which is thereunto necessary, as comprehendeth the skill of speaking. In like sort, albeit Scripture do profess to contain in it all things which are necessary unto salvation; yet the meaning cannot be simply of all things which are necessary, but all things that are necessary in some certain kinde or form; as all things that are necessary, and either could not at all, or could not easily be known by the light of Natural discourse; all things which are necessary to be known, that we may be saved; but known with presupposal of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, concerning certain Principles, whereof it receiveth us already perswaded, and then instructeth us in all the residue that are necessary: In the number of these Principles, one is the Sacred Authority of Scripture. Being therefore perswaded by other means, that these Scriptures are the Oracles of God, themselves do then teach us the rest, and lay before us all the duties which God requireth at our hands, as necessary unto salvation. Further, there hath been some doubt likewise, whether <hi>containing in Scripture,</hi> do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port express setting down in plain terms, or else <hi>comprehending</hi> in such sort, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we may from thence conclude all things which are necessary. Against the former of these two constructions, instance hath sundry ways been given. For our belief in the Trinity, the Co-eternity of the Son of God with his Father, the proceeding of the Spirit from the Father and the Son, the duty of Baptizing Infants: These, with such other principal points, the necessity whereof is by none denied, are notwithstanding in Scripture no where to be found by express literal mention, onely deduced they are out of Scripture by collection. This kinde of comprehension in Scripture, being therefore received, still there is no doubt, how far we are to proceed by collection, before the full and compleat measure of things necessary be made up. For let us not think, that as long as the World doth endure, the wit of man shall be able to sound the bottom of that which may be concluded out of the Scripture; especially, if things contained by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection do so far extend, as to draw in whatsoever may be at any time out of Scripture, but probably and conjecturally surmized. But let necessary collection be made requisite, and we may boldly deny, that of all those things which at this day are with so great necessity urged upon this Church, under the name of Reformed Church Discipline, there is any one which their Books hitherto have made manifest to be contained in the Scripture. Let them, if they can, alledge but one properly belonging to their cause, and not common to them and us, and shew the deduction thereof out of Scripture to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66185:59"/>
necessary. It hath been already shewed, how all things necessary unto salvation, in such sort as before we have maintained, must needs be possible for men to know; and that many things are in such sort necessary, the knowledge whereof is by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture impossible to be attained. Whereupon it followeth, that either all flesh is excluded from possibility of salvation, which to think were most barbarous; or else, that God hath by supernatural means revealed the way of life so far forth as doth suffice. For this cause, God hath so many times and ways spoken to the sons of men: Neither hath he by speech onely, but by writing also instructed and taught his Church. The cause of writing hath been, to the end that things by him revealed unto the World, might have the longer continuance, and the greater certainty of assurance; by how much that which standeth on Record, hath in both those respects preheminence above that which passeth from hand to hand, and hath no Pens, but the Tongues; no Book, but the ears of Men to record it. The several Books of Scripture having had each some several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and particular purpose, which caused them to be written; the Contents thereof, are according to the exigence of that special end whereunto they are intended. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it groweth, that every Book of holy Scripture doth take out of all kindes of truth, <note n="a" place="margin">Ephes. 5.25.</note> Natural,<note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 3 8.</note> Historical,<note n="c" place="margin">Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for as much as there have been Reasons alledged sufficient to conclude, that all things necessary unto salvation must be made known, and that God himself hath therefore revealed his Will, because otherwise men could not have known so much as is necessary: his surceasing to speak to the World, since the publishing of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the delivery of the same in writing, is unto us a manifest token that the way of salvation is now sufficiently opened, and that we need no other means for our full instruction, then God hath already furnished us withal. The main drift of the whole New Testament,<note place="margin">John 23. 31.</note> is that which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> setteth down as the purpose of his own History, <hi>These things are written, that ye might believe, that Iesus is Christ the Son of God, and that in believing, ye might have life through his Name.</hi> The drift of the Old, that which the Apostle mentioneth to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>The holy Scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation.</hi> So that the general end, both of Old and New, is one; the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them consisting in this, That the Old did make wise by teaching salvation through Christ that should come; the New, by teaching that Christ the Saviour is come; and that Jesus whom the Jews did crucifie, and whom God did raise again from the dead, is he. When the Apostle therefore affirmeth unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the Old was able to make him wise to salvation, it was not his meaning, that the Old alone can do this unto us, which live sithence the publication of the New. For he speaketh with presupposal of the Doctrine of Christ, known also unto <hi>Timothy</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 14.</note> and therefore first it is said, <hi>Continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and art perswaded, knowing of whom thou hast been taught them.</hi> Again, those Scriptures he granteth, were able to make him wise to salvation;<note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note> but he addeth, <hi>through the Faith which is in Christ.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without the Doctrine of the New Testament, teaching that Christ hath wrought the Redemption of the World; which Redemption the Old did foreshew he should work; it is not the former alone, which can on our behalf, perform so much as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth avouch, who presupposeth this, when he magnifieth that so highly. And as his words concerning the Books of ancient Scripture, do not take place, but with presupposal of the Gospel of Christ embraced; so our own words also, when we extol the compleat sufficiency of the whole intire Body of the Scripture, must in like sort be understood with this caution, That the benefit of Natures Light be not thought excluded as unnecessary, because the necessity of a Diviner Light is magnified. There is in Scripture therefore no defect, but that any man, what place or cailing soever he hold in the Church of God, may have thereby the light of his Natural Understanding so perfected, that the one being relieved by the other, there can want no part of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful instruction unto any good work which God himself requireth, be it Natural, or Supernatural, belonging simply unto men, as men; or unto men, as they are united in whatsoever kinde of Society. It sufficeth therefore, that Nature and Scripture do serve in such full sort, that they both joyntly, and not severally either of thou, be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, that unto Everlasting felicity, we need not the knowlegde of any thing more then these two may easily furnish our mindes with on all sides: And therefore they which adde Traditions, as a part of Supernatural necessary Truth, have not the Truth, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66185:59"/>
are in Error: For they onely plead, that whatsoever God revealeth as necessary for all Christian men to do or believe, the same we ought to embrace, whether we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by writing or otherwise, which no man denieth; when that which they should confirm, who claim so great reverence unto Traditions, is, that the same Traditions are necessarily to be acknowledged divine and holy. For we do not reject them onely, because they are not in the Scripture, but because they are neither in Scripture, nor can otherwise sufficiently by any Reason be proved to be a God. That which is of God, and may be evidently proved to be so, we deny not but it hath in his kinde, although unwritten, yet the self same force and authority with the written Laws of God. It is by ours acknowledged, <hi>That the Apostles did in every Church institute and ordain some Rites and Customs, serving for the seemliness of Church Regiment; which Rites and Customs they have not committed unto writing.</hi>

Laws Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural do always binde; Laws Positive not so, but onely after they have been expresly and wittingly imposed. Laws Positive there are in every of those kindes beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. As in the first kinde, the Promises which we have past unto Men, and the Vows we have made unto God; for these ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Laws which we tie our selves unto, and till we have so tied our selves, they binde us not. Laws Positive in the second kinde, are such as the Civil Constitutions peculiar unto each particular Commonweal. In the third kinde, the Law of Heraldry in War, is Positive: And in the last, all the Judicials which God gave unto the people of <hi>Israel</hi> to observe. And although no Laws but Positive, be mutable; yet all are not mutable, which be Positive. Positive Laws are either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, or else changeable, according as the matter it self is, concerning which they were first made. Whether God or Man be the Maker of them, alteration they so far forth admit, as the Matter doth exact Laws that concern Supernatural duties, are all Positive; and either concern Men supernaturally, as Men, or else as parts of a Supernatural Society; which Society we call the Church. To concern Men as Men supernaturally, is to concern them as duties, which belong of necessity to all, and yet could not have been known by any to belong unto them, unless God had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them himself; in as much as they do not depend upon any Natural ground at all, out of which they may be deduced, but are appointed of God to supply the defect of those natural ways of salvation, by which we are not now able to attain thereunto. The Church being a Supernatural Society, doth differ from Natural Societies in this, that the persons unto whom we associate our selves, in the one, are Men, simply considered as Men: But they to whom we be joyned in the other, are God, Angels, and holy Men. Again, the Church being hoth a Society, and a Society Supernatural: Although as it is a Society, it have the self same original grounds which other Politick Societies have, namely, the Natural inclination which all men have unto sociable life, and consent to some certain Bond of Association; which Bond is the Law that appointeth what kinde of order they shall be associated in: Yet unto the Church, as it is a Society Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, this is peculiar; that part of the Bond of their Association which belongs to the Church of God, must be a Law Supernatural, which God himself hath revealed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that kinde of worship which his people shall do unto him. The substance of the service of God therefore, so far forth as it hath in it any thing more then the Law of Reason doth reach, may not be invented of Men, as it is amongst the Heathens; but must be received from God himself, as always it hath been in the Church, saving onely when the Church hath been forgetful of her duty. Wherefore to end with a general
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66185:60"/>
Rule concerning all the Laws which God hath tied men unto: Those Laws Divine that belong, whether naturally or supernaturally, either to men as men, or to men as they live in Politick Society, or to men as they are of that Politick Society which is the Church, without any further respect had unto any such variable accident; as the Estate of men, and of Societies of men, and of the Church it self in this World is subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; all Laws that so belong unto men,<note place="margin">Isai. 29. 13. <hi>Their fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, was taught by the precept of men.</hi>
                     </note> they belong for ever, yea, although they be Positive Laws, unless being Positive, God himself which made them, alter them. The reason is, because the subject or matter of Laws in general, is thus far forth constant: Which matter is that for the ordering whereof Laws were instituted, and being insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, are not changeable without cause: Neither can they have cause of change, when that which gave them their first institution, remaineth for ever one and the same. On the other side, Laws that were made for Men, or Societies, or Churches, in regard of their being such, as they do not always continue, but may perhaps be clean otherwise awhile after, and so may require to be otherwise ordered then before; the Laws of God himself, which are of this nature, no man endued with common sense, will ever deny to be of a different constitution from the former, in respect of the ones constancy, and the mutability of the other.

But that we may at the length conclude this first general introduction unto the Nature and Original Birth, as of all other Laws, so likewise of those which the Sacred Scripture containeth; concerning the Author whereof, even Infidels have confessed, that he can neither err nor deceive: Albeit, about things easie and manifest unto all men by common sense, there needeth no higher consultation, because as a man whose wisdom is in weighty affairs admired, would take it in some disdain to have his counsel solemnly asked about a toy; so the meanness of some things is such, that to search the Scripture of God for the ordering of them, were to derogate from the reverend Authority and Dignity of the Scripture, no less then they do by whom Scriptures are in ordinary talk very idly applied unto vain and childish trifles; yet better it were to be superstitious, then prophane: To take from thence our direction, even in all things great or small, then to wade through mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of principal weight and moment, without ever caring what the Law of God hath, either for or against our designs.

towards whom we profess all submission and aw? Surely there must be very manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity in Laws, against which we shall be able to justifie our contumelious Invectives. The chiefest root whereof, when we use them without cause, is ignorance, how Laws inferior are derived from that supream or highest Law. The first that receive impression from thence, are Natural agents. The Law of whose operations might be haply thought less pertinent, when the question is about Laws for Humane actions, but that in those very actions which most spiritually and supernaturally concern men, the Rules and Axioms of Natural operations have their force. What can be more immediate to our Salvation, then our perswasion concerning the Law of Christ towards his Church? What greater assurance of love towards his Church, then the knowledge of that Mystical Union, whereby the Church is become as near unto Christ, as any one part of his flesh is unto other? That the Church being in such sort his, he must needs protect it; what proof more strong, then if a manifest Law so require, which Law it is not possible for Christ to violate?

                     <hi>No man hateth his own flesh, but doth love and cherish it?</hi> The Axioms of that Law therefore, whereby Natural agents are guided, have their use in the Moral, yea, even in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual actions of men, and consequently in all Laws belonging unto men howsoever. Neither are the Angels themselves so far severed from us in their kinde and manner of working, but that between the Law of their Heavenly operations, and the Actions of men in this our state of mortality, such correspondence there is, as maketh it expedient to know in some sort the one, for the others more perfect direction.

Yea, so far hath the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to signifie that even about the outward Orders of the Church, which serve but for comeliness, some regard is to be had of Angels;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 10.</note> who best like us when we are most like unto them in all parts of decent demeanor. So that the Law of Angels we cannot judge altogether impertinent unto the affairs of the Church of God. Our largeness of speech, how men do finde out what things Reason bindeth them of necessity to observe, and what it guideth them to chuse in things which are left as Arbitary, the care we have had to declare the different Nature of Laws which severally concern all men, from such as belong unto men, either civilly or spiritually associated; such as pertain to the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which Nations, or which Christian Nations have amongst themselves; and in the last place, such as concerning every or any of these God himself hath revealed by his holy Word; all serveth but to make manifest, that as the Actions of men are of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry distinct kindes, so the Laws thereof must accordingly be distinguished. There are in men operations, some Natural, some Rational, some Supernatural, some Politick, some finally Ecclesiastical: Which if we measure not each by his own proper Law, whereas the things themselves are so different, there will be in our understanding and judgment of them, confusion. As that first Error sheweth whereon our opposites in this cause have grounded themselves: For as they rightly maintain, that God must be glorified in all things, and that the actions of men cannot tend unto his glory, unless they be framed after his Law: So it is their Error, to think that the onely Law which God hath appointed unto men in that behalf, is the Sacred Scripture. By that which we work naturally, as when we breath, sleep, move,<note place="margin">Psal. 148. 7, 8, 9.</note> we set forth the glory of God as Natural agents do, albeit we have no express purpose to make that our end, nor any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised determination therein to follow a Law, but do that we do (for the most part) not as much as thinking thereon.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Men do both, as the Apostle teacheth; yea, those men which have no written Law of God to shew what is good or evil,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> carry written
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66185:61"/>
in their hearts the Universal Law of Mankinde, the Law of Reason, whereby they judge as by a Rule which God hath given unto all Men for that purpose. The Law of Reason doth somewhat direct Men how to honor God as their Creator; but how to glorifie God in such sort as is required, to the end, he may be an Everlasting Saviour; this we are taught by Divine Law, which Law both ascertaineth the truth, and supplieth unto us the want of that other Law. So that in Moral actions, Divine Law helpeth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Law of Reason to guide Mans life; but in Supernatural, it alone guideth, Proceed we further, Let us place Man in some Publick Society with others, whether Civil or Spiritual; and in this case there is no remedy, but we must add yet a further Law. For although, even here likewise, the Laws of Nature and Reason be of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary use; yet somewhat over and besides them is necessary, namely, Humane and Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law, together with that Law which is of commerce between Grand Societies, the Law of Nations, and of Nations Christian. For which cause, the Law of God hath likewise said,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers.</hi> The Publick Power of all Societies, is above every Soul contained in the same Societies. And the principal use of that Power is to give Laws unto all that are under it; which Laws in such case we must obey, unless there be reason shewed, which may necessarily inforce, That the Law of Reason, or of God, doth enjoyn the contrary: Because except our own private, and but probable resolutions, be by the Law of Publick Determinations over-ruled, we take away all possibility of sociable life in the World. A plainer example whereof, then our selves, we cannot have. How cometh it to pass, that we are at this present day so rent with mutual contentions, and that the Church is so much troubled about the Polity of the Church? No doubt, if men had been willing to learn how many Laws their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this life, are subject unto, and what the true force of each Law is, all these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies might have died the very day they were first brought forth. It is both commonly said, and truly, That the best men otherwise are not always the best in regard of Society. The reason whereof is, for that the Law of Mens actions is one, if they be respected onely as Men; and another, when they are considered as parts of a Politick Body. Many men there are, then whom nothing is more commendable when they are singled:<note place="margin">

Yea, I am perswaded, that of them, with whom in this cause we strive, there are whose betters among men would be hardly found, if they did not live amongst men, but in some Wilderness by themselves. The cause of which, their disposition so unframable unto Societies wherein their live, is, for that they discern not aright, what place and force these several kindes of Laws ought to have in all their actions. Is there question either concerning the Regiment of the Church in general, or about Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between one Church and another, or of Ceremonies, Offices, Powers, Jurisdictions in our own Church? Of all these things, they judge by that rule which they frame to themselves with some shew of probability; and what seemeth in that sort convenient, the same they think themselves bound to practice, the same by all means they labor mightily to uphold; whatsoever any Law of Man to the contrary hath determined, they weigh it not. Thus by following the Law of Private Reason, where the Law of Publick should take place, they breed disturbance. For the better inuring therefore of Mens mindes with the true distinction of Laws, and of their several force, according to the different kinde and quality of our actions, it shall not peradventure be amiss to shew in some one example, how they all take place. To seek no further,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 3. Psal. 145. 19, 16.</note> let but that be considered, then which there is not any thing more familiar unto us, our food. What things are food, and what are not, we judge naturally by sense, neither need we any other Law to be our Directer in that behalf, then the self-same which is common unto us with Beasts. But when we come to consider of food, as of a benefit which God of his bounteous goodness hath provided for all things living; the Law of Reason doth here require the duty of Thankfulness at our hands towards him, at whose hands we have it. And lest Appetite in the use of Food, should lead us beyond that which is meet, we ow in this case obedience to that Law of Reason, which teacheth mediocrity in meats and drinks. The same things Divine Law teacheth also, as at large we have shewed it, doth all parts of Moral duty, whereunto we all of necessity stand bound, in regard of the life to come. But of certain lendes of food the Jews sometime had, and we our selves likewise have a Mystical, Religious, and Supernatural use; they of their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66185:62"/>
Paschal Lamb and Oblations; we of our Bread and Wine in the Eucharist: Which use none but Divine Law could institute. Now as we live in Civil Society, the State of the Commonwealth wherein we live, both may and doth require certain Laws concerning food; which Laws, saving onely that we are Members of the Commonwealth, where they are of force, we should not need to respect as Rules of Action; whereas now in their place and kinde, they must be respected and obeyed. Yea, the self-same matter is also a subject wherein sometime Ecclesiastical Laws have place; so that unless we will be Authors of Confusion in the Church, our private discretion, which otherwise might guide us a contrary way; must here submit it self to be that way guided, which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judgment of the Church hath thought better. In which case, that of <hi>Zonaras</hi> concerning Fasts may be remembred.<note place="margin">

Wherefore that here we may briefly end, Of Law there can be no less acknowledge, then that her Seat is the Bosom of God, her Voice the Harmony of the World: All things in Heaven and Earth do her homage, the very least as feeling her care, and the greatest as not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her Power: Both Angels, and Men, and Creatures of what condition soever, though each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent, admiring her as the Mother of their Peace and Joy.</p>

                  <p>AS that which in the Title hath been proposed for the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat is only the Ecclesiastical Law whereby we are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; So neither is it my purpose to maintain any other thing, then that which therein Truth and Reason shall approve. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dealings of men, who administer Government, and unto whom the Execution of that Law belongeth, they have their Judge who sitteth in Heaven, and before whose Tribunal Seat they are accountable for whatsoever abuse or corruption, which (being worthily mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked in this Church) the want either of Care or of Conscience in them hath bred. We are no Patrons of those things therefore; the best defence whereof is speedy redress and amendment. That which is of God we defend, to the uttermost of that ability which he hath given: that which is otherwise, let it wither even in the root from whence it hath sprung. Wherefore all these abuses being severed and set apart, which use from the corruption of men, and not from the Laws themselves: Come we

to those things which in the very whole entire form of our Church-Polity have been (as we perswade our selves) injuriously blamed by them who indeavour to overthrow the same, and instead thereof to establish a much worse, onely through a strong mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit they have, that the same is grounded on Divine Authority. Now, whether it be that through an earnest longing desire to see things brought to a peaceable end; I do but imagine the matters whereof we contend, to be fewer then indeed they are; or else for that in truth they are fewer when they come to be discust by Reason, then otherwise they seem when by heat of contention they are divided into many slips, and of every Branch an heap is made: Surely, as now we have drawn them together, choosing out those things which are requisite to be severally all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cust, and omitting such mean Specialities as are likely (without any great labour) to fall afterwards of themselves; I know no cause why either the number or the length of these Controversies should diminish our hope of seeing them end with concond and love on all sides; which of his infinite love and goodness, the Father of all peace and unity grant. Unto which Scope that our endeavour may the more directly tend, it seemeth fittest that first those things be examined, which are as seeds from whence the rest that ensue have grown. And of such the most general is, that, wherewith we are here to make our entrance: A Question not moved (I think) any where in other Churches, and therefore in ours the more likely to be soon (I trust) determined: the rather for that it hath grown from no other root then only a desire to enlarge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use of the Word of God; which desire hath begotten an Error inlarging it further then (as we are perswaded) soundness of truth will bear. For whereas God hath left sundry kindes of Laws unto men, and by all those Laws the actions of men are in some sort directed:<note place="margin">

This whole Question which hath been moved about the kinde of Church Regiment, we could not but for our own resolution sake, endeavour to unrip and sist; following therein as near as we might, the conduct or that judicial Method which serveth best for invention of Truth. By means whereof, having found this the Head Theorem of all their Discourses, who plead for the change of Ecclesiastical Government in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> namely, <hi>That the Scripture of God is in such sort the rule of humane actions, that simply whatsoever we do, and are not by it directed thereunto, the same is sin</hi>; we hold it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66185:63"/>
necessary that the proofs hereof be weighed: Be they of weight sufficient or otherwise, it is not ours to judge and determine; onely what difficulties there are, which as yet with-hold our assent, till we be further and better satisfied, I hope, no indifferent amongst them will scorn or refuse to hear. First, therefore whereas they alledge, <hi>That Wisdom</hi> doth teach men <hi>every good way</hi>; and have thereupon inferred, that no way is good in any kinde of action, unless Wisdom do by Scripture lead unto it: See they not plainly how they restrain the manifold ways which Wisdom hath to teach men by, unto one onely way of teaching, which is by Scripture? The bounds of Wisdom are large; and within them much is contained. Wisdom was <hi>Adams</hi> Instructor in Paradise: Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom endued the Fathers who lived before the Law, with the knowledge of holy things; by the wisdom of the Law of God. <hi>David</hi> attained to excel others in understanding;<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 95.</note> and <hi>Solomon</hi> likewise to excel <hi>David,</hi> by the self-same wisedome of God, teaching him many things besides the Law. The ways of well-doing are in number even as many, as are the kindes of voluntary actions: so that whatsoever we do in this World, and may do it ill, we shew our selves therein by well-doing to be wise. Now if wisdom did teach men by Scripture not only all the ways that are right and good in some certain kinde, according to that of<note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>The whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is given by inspiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to teach, to improve, to correct, and to instruct in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that the man of God may be absolute, being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto all good works.</hi> He meaneth all and only those good works which belong unto us as we are Men of God, and which unto salvation are necessary. Or if we understand by men of God. God's Ministers, there is not required in them an universal skill of every good work or way, but an hability to teach whatsoever men are bound to do that they may be saved: And with this kinde of knowledge the Scripture sufficeth to furnish them as touching matter.</note> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the use of Scripture; but did simply without any manner of exception, restraint, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, teach every way of doing well: There is no Art but Scripture should teach it, because every Art doth teach the way how to do something or other well: To teach men therefore Wisdom professeth, and to teach them every good way: but not every good way by one way of teaching. Whatsoever either men on Earth, or the Angels of Heaven do know, it is as a drop of that unemptiable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Wisdom; which Wisdom, hath diversly imparted her treasures unto the World. As her ways are of sundry kinds, so her manner of teaching is not meerly one and the same. Some things she openeth by the Sacred Books of Scripture; some things by the glorious works of Nature: with some things she inspireth them from above by spiritual influence; in some things she leadeth and traineth them onely by worldly experience and practice. We may not so in any one special kinde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire her, that we disgrace her in any other; but let all her ways be according unto their place and degree adored.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>all things be done to the glory of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>second</hi> Proof out of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>T. C. l.</hi> 1 <hi>p.</hi>26. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That whether we eat or drink or whatsoever we do, we must do it to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God</hi>; but no man can glorifie God in any thing but by obedience; and there is no obedience but in respect of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and word of God therefore it followeth that the Word of God directeth a man to all his actions.</note> the blessed Apostle (it is true) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth. The glory of God is the admirable excellency of that Vertue Divine, which being made manifest, causeth Men and Angels to extol his greatness, and in regard thereof to fear him. By being glorified, it is not meant, that he doth receive any augmentation of glory at our hands; but his Name we glorifie, when we testifie our acknowledgement of his glory. Which albeit we most effectually do by the vertue of obedience; nevertheless it may be perhaps a Question, Whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> did mean that we sin as oft as ever we go about any thing, without an express intent and purpose to obey God therein. He saith of himself, <hi>I do in all things please all men, seeking not mine own commodity, but</hi> rather the good <hi>of many, that they may be saved.</hi> Shall it hereupon be thought, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not move either hand or foot, but with express intent even thereby to further the common salvation of men? We move, we sleep, we take the cup at the hand of our friend, a number of things we oftentimes do, only to satisfie some natural desire, without present, express and actual reference unto any Commandment of God. Unto his glory even these things are done which we naturally perform, and not only that which morally and spiritually we do. For by every effect proceeding from the most concealed instincts of Nature, his power is made manifest. But it doth not therefore follow, that of necessity we shall sin, unless we expresly intend this in every such particular. But be it a thing which requireth no more then onely our general presupposed willingness to please God in all things, or be it a matter wherein we cannot so glorifie the Name of God as we should, without an actual intent to do him in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar some special obedience; yet for any thing there is in this sentence alledged to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66185:64"/>
the contrary, God may be glorified by obedience, and obeyed by performance of his will, and his will be performed with an actual intelligent desire to fulfil that Law which maketh known what his will is, although no special clause or sentence of Scripture be in every such action set before mens eyes to warrant it. For Scripture is not the onely Law whereby. God hath opened his will touching all things that may be done; but there are other kinde of Laws which notifie the will of God, as in the former Book hath been proved at large: nor is there any Law of God, whereunto he doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our obedience his glory. <hi>Do therefore all things unto the glory of God,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>be inoffensive both to the Iews and Grecians, and the Church of God; even as I please all then in all things, not seeking mine own commodity, but manies, that they may be saved.</hi> In the least thing done disobediently towards God, or offensively against the good of men, whose benefit we ought to seek for as for our own, we plainly shew that we do not acknowledge God to be such as indeed he is, and consequently that we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him not. This the blessed Apostle teacheth; but doth any Apostle teach that we cannot glorifie God otherwise then onely in doing what we finde that God in Scripture commandeth us to do? The Churches dispersed amongst the Heathen in the East part of the World, are by the Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> to have their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation honest amongst the Gentiles, that they which spake evil of them as of evil doers, might by the good works which they should see, glorifie God in the day of visitation.</hi> As long as that which Christians did was good, and no way subject unto just reproof, their vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conversation was a mean to work the Heathens conversion unto Christ. Seeing therefore this had been a thing altogether impossible, but that Infidels themselves did discents, in matters of life and conversation, when believers did well, and when otherwise; when they glorified their Heavenly Father, and when not: It followeth, that somethings wherein God is glorified, may be some other way known then onely but the sacred Scripture, of which Scripture the Gentiles being utterly ignorant, did notwithstanding judge rightly of the quality of Christian mens actions. Most certain it is, that nothing but onely sin doth dishonoar God.

For might not the Jews have been fully perswaded that they did well to think (if they had so thought) that in Christ God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, although the only ground of this, their Faith, had been the wonderful works they saw him do? Might not, yea, did not <hi>Thomas</hi> fully in the end per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himself, that he did well to think that body which now was raised, to be the same which had been crucified?<note place="margin">John 20.21.</note> That which gave <hi>Thomas</hi> this assurance was his sense; <hi>Thomas; Because thou hast seen, thou believest,</hi> saith our Saviour. What Scripture had <hi>Tully</hi> for his assurance? Yet I nothing doubt, but that they who alledge him think he did well to set down in Writing, a thing so consonarie unto truth. Finally, We all believe that the Scriptures of God are Sacred, and that they have proceeded from God, our selves we assure that we do right well in so belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. We have for this point a Demoustration sound and infallible. But it is not the Word of God which doth or possibly can assure us, that we do well to think it his Word. For if any one Book of Scripture did give testimony to all, yet sell that Scripture which giveth credit to the rest, would require another Scripture to give credit unto it neither could we ever come unto any pause whereon to rest our assurance this way: so that unless beside Scripture, there were something which might assure us that we do well, we could nor think we do well; no, not in being assured that Scripture is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and holy Rule of well-doing. On which determination we, might be contented to stay our selves, without further proceeding herein, but that we are drawn on into a larger speech, by reason of their so great earnestness, who beat more, and more upon these last alledged words, as being of all other most pregnant. Whereas, therefore they still argue,<note place="margin">T.C. 1. 2. p. 58.</note> That <hi>wheresoever faith is wanting, there is sin</hi>; and <hi>in every action not commanded, faith is wanting</hi>; Ergo, <hi>in every action not commanded, there is sin</hi>: I would demand of them; First, forasmuch, as the nature of things indifferent, is neither to be commanded, nor forbidden, but left free and arbitrary; how there can be any thing indifferent, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for want of Faith, sin be committed, when any thing not commanded is done. So that of necessity they must adde somewhat, and at least wise thus, set it down: In every action not commanded of God, or permitted with approbation, Faith
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66185:65"/>
is wanting, and for want of Faith there is sin. The next thing we are to enquire is, What those things be which God permitteth with approbation, and how we may know them to be so permitted? When there are unto one end sundry means; as for example, for the sustenance of our bodies many kindes of food, many sorts of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cloath our nakedness, and so in other things of like condition: Here the end it self being necessary, but not so any one mean thereunto; necessary that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies should he both fed and cloathed, howbeit no one kinde of food or raiment neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; therefore we hold these things free in their own nature and indifferent. The choice is left to our own discretion, except a principal Bond of some higher duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the indifferency that such things have in themselves. Their indifferency is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, if either we take away our own liberty,<note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> as <hi>Ananias</hi> did, for whom to have sold or held his Possessions it was indifferent, till his Solemn Vow and Promise into God had strictly bound him one only way: or if God himself have precisely abridged the same, by restraining us unto, or by barring us from some one or more things of many, which otherwise were in themselves altogether indifferent. Many fashions of Priestly Attire there were, whereof <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons might have had their free choice without sin,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.43. Levit. 11.</note> but that God expresly tied them unto one. All meats indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent unto the Jew, were it not that God by name excepted some, as Swines flesh. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible therefore it is we should otherwise think, then that what things God doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command nor forbid, the same he permitteth with approbation either to be done or left undone.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12.</note> 
                     <hi>All things are lawful unto me,</hi> saith the Apostle, speaking as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in the person of the Christian Gentile, for maintenance of liberty in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: whereunto his answer is, that nevertheless, <hi>All things are not expedient</hi>; in things indifferent there is a choice, they are not always equally expedient. Now in things although not commanded of God, yet lawfull, because they are permitted, the Question is, What light shall shew us the conveniency which one hath above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For answer, their final Determination is, That <hi>whereas the Heathen did send men for the difference of good and evil to the light of reason, in such things the Apostle send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to the school of Christ in his Word, which onely is able through faith to give us as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance and resolution in our doings.</hi> Which word <hi>Onely,</hi> is utterly without possibility of ever being proved. For what if it were true concerning things indifferent, that unless the Word of the Lord had determined of the free use of them, there could have been no lawful use of them at all; which notwithstanding is untrue; because it is not the Scriptures setting down such things as indifferent, but their not setting down as necessary, that doth make them to be indifferent; yet this to our present purpose serveth nothing at all. We enquire not now, Whether any thing be free to be used, which Scripture hath nor set down as free? but concerning things known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be indifferent, whether particularly in chusing any one of them before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we sin, if any thing but Scripture direct us into this our choice. When many meats are set before me, all are indifferent, none unlawful; I take one as most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. If Scripture require me so to do, then is not the thing indifferent, because I must do what Scripture requireth. They are all indifferent; I might take any, Scripture doth not require of me to make any special choice of one: I do notwithstanding make choice of one, my discretion teaching me so to do. A hard case, that hereupon I should be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned of sin. Not let any man think that following the judgement of natural discretion in such cases, we can have no assurance that we please God. For to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and God of our nature, how shall any operation proceeding in natural sort, he in that respect unacceptable? The nature which himself hath given to work by, he cannot but be delighted with, when we exercise the same any way without Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his to the contrary. My desire is, to make this cause so manifest, that if it were possible, no doubt or scruple concerning the same, might remain in any mans cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some truths there are, the verity whereof time doth alter: As it is now true that Christ is risen from the dead; which thing was not true at such time as Christ was living on earth, and had not suffered. It would be known therefore, whether this which, they teach concerning the sinful stain of all actions not commanded of God, be a truth that doth now appertain unto us onely, or a perpetual truth, in such sort that from the first beginning of the world, unto the last consummation thereof, it neither hath been, nor can be otherwise. I see not how they can restrain this unto any particular time, how
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66185:65"/>
they can think it true now, and not always true, that in every action not commanced there is for want of Faith sin. Then let them cast back their eyes unto former genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, and mark what was done in the prime of the World: <hi>Seth, Enoch, Noah, Sem, Abraham, Iob,</hi> and the rest that lived before any syllable of the Law of God was written, did they not sin as much as we do in every action not commanded? That which God is unto us by his Sacred Word, the same he was unto them by such like means as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Iob</hi> describeth.<note place="margin">Job 2. 10.</note> If therefore we sin in every action which the Scripture commandeth us not, it followeth that they did the like in all such actions as were not by Revelation from Heaven exacted at their hands: Unless God from Heaven did by vision still shew them what to do, they might do nothing; not eat, not drink, not sleep, not move. Yea, but even as in darkness, candle light may serve to guide mens steps, which to use in the day were madness; so when God had once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Law in writing, it may be, they are of opinion, that then it must needs be sin for men to do any thing, which was not there commanded them to do, whatsoever they might do before. Let this be granted, and it shall hereupon plainly ensue, either that the light of Scripture once shining in the world, all other light of Nature is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in such sort drowned, that now we need it not, neither may we longer use it; or if it stand us in any stead, yet, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaketh of men whom nature hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the state of servitude, saying,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>They have reason so far forth as to conceive when others direct them,</hi> but little or none in directing themselves by themselves; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our natural capacity and judgement must serve us onely for the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which the sacred Scripture teacheth. Had the Prophets who succeeded <hi>Moses,</hi> or the blessed Apostles which followed them, been setled in this perswasion, never would they have taken so great pains in gathering together natural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thereby to teach the faithful their Duties. To use unto them any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive then <hi>Scriptures est, Thou it is written,</hi> had been to teach them other grounds of their Actions then Scripture; which I grant, they alledge commonly, but not onely. Onely Scripture they should have alledged, had they been thus perswaded, that so far forth we do sin, as we do any thing otherwise directed then by Scripture. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was resolute in points of Christianity to credit none, how godly and learned soever he were, unless he confirmed his sentence by the Scriptures, <hi>or by some reason not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them.</hi> Let them therefore with S. <hi>Augustine</hi> reject and condemn that which is not grounded either on the Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>August. Ep.</hi> 18.</note> or on some reason not contrary to Scripture, and we are ready to give them our hands in token of friendly consent with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But against this it may be objected,<note place="margin">The First As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be proved by the use of taking Arguments Negatively from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture: which kinde of disputing is mual in the Fathers.</note> and is, That the Fathers do nothing more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Books, then draw Arguments from the Scripture negatively in reproof of that which is evil; <hi>Scriptures teach it not, avoid it therefore</hi>: these disputes with the Fathers are ordinary, neither is it hard to shew that the Prophets themselves have so reasoned. Which Arguments being sound and good, it should seem that it cannot be unsound or evil to hold still the same Asserrion, against which hitherto we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. For if it stand with reason thus to argue, Such a thing is not taught us in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, therefore we may not receive or allow it: how should it seem unreasonable to think, that whatsoever we may lawfully do, the Scripture by commanding it must make it lawful? But how far such Arguments do reach, it shall the better appear by considering the matter wherein they have been urged. First therefore this we constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny, that of so many Testimonies as they are able to produce for the strength of Negative Arguments, any one doth generally (which is the point in question) condemn either all opinions as false, or all actions as unlawful, which the Scripture teacheth us not. The most that can be collected out of them is onely, that in some cases a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. Argument taken from Scripture is strong, whereof no man endued with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can doubt. But doth the strength of some Negative Argument prove this kinde of Negative Argument strong, by force whereof, all things are denied which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture affirmeth not, or all things which Scripture prescribeth not condemned? The Question between us is concerning matter of Action, what things are lawful, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for men to do. The Sentences alledged out of the Fathers, are as peremptory, and as large in every respect for matter of Opinion, as of action; which argueth that in truth they never meant any otherwise to tie the one then the other unto Scripture, both being thereunto equally tied, as far as each is required in the same kinde of necessity unto
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66185:66"/>
Salvation. If therefore it be not unlawful to know, and with full perswasion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve much more then Scripture alone doth teach; if it be against all Sense and Reason to condemn the knowledge of so many Arts and Sciences as are otherwise learned then in Holy Scripture, notwithstanding the manifest Speeches of ancient Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which seem to close up within the bosom thereof all manner good and lawful knowledge; wheresore should their words be thought more effectual to shew that we may not in deeds and practice, then they are to prove that in speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and knowledge, we ought not to go any further then the Scripture? Which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture being given to teach matters of belief, no less then of action; the Fathers must needs be, and are even as plain against credit, besides the relation, as against practice, without the injunction of the Scripture.

Let Christian Religion read this one Word, and meditate upon this Commandment, and out of this Scriptrue it shall finde the Rules of all Learning to have spring, and from hence to have risen, and hither to return, whatsoever the Ecclesiastical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline containeth; and that in all things it is vain and bootless which Charity confirmeth not.</hi> Was this a sentence (trow you) of so great force to prove that Scripture is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule of all the actions of men? Might they not hereby even as well prove, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66185:66"/>
one Commandment of Scripture is the onely rule of all things, and so exclude the rest of the Scripture, as now they do all means besides Scripture? But thus it fareth, when too much desire of contradiction causeth our speech rather to pass by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then to stay for weight. Well, but <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth in this case speak yet more plainly: <hi>The Scripture</hi> (saith he) <hi>denieth what it noteth not:</hi> which are indeed the words of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> But what? the Scripture reckoneth up the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and amongst those Kings, <hi>David</hi>; the Scripture reckoneth up the sons of <hi>David,</hi> and amongst those sons,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Solomon.</hi> To prove that amongst the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> there was no <hi>David</hi> but only one; no <hi>Solomon</hi> but one in the sons of <hi>David, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> Argument will fitly prove. For inasmuch as the Scripture did propose to reckon up all; if there were moe, it would haue named them. In this case the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth deny the thing it noteth not.</hi> Howbeit I could not but think that man to do me some piece of manifest injury, which would hereby fasten upon me a general Opinion, as if I did think the Scripture to deny the very Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, because it no where noteth that any such King did reign. <hi>Tertullians</hi> speech is probable concerning such matter as he there speaketh of. There was, saith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> no second <hi>Lamech,</hi> like to him that had two wives; the Scripture denieth what it noteth not. As therefore it noteth one such to have been in that Age of the World; so had there been moe, it would by likelihood as well have noted many as one. What infer we now hereupon? <hi>There was no second</hi> Lamech; <hi>the Scripture denieth what it noteth not.</hi> Were it consonant unto reason to divorce these two Sentences, the former of which doth shew how the latter is retrained, and not marking the former, to conclude by the latter of them, that simply whatsoever any man at this day doth think true, is by the Scripture denied, unless it be there affirmed to be true? I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a case so weak and feeble hath been so much persisted in. But to come unto those their Sentences, wherein matters of action are more apparently touched, the Name of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is as before, so here again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; who writing unto his Wife two Books,<note place="margin">

And to come yet neerer, where he disputeth against the wearing of crown or garland (which is indifferent in it self) to those which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting asked. Where the Scripture saith, There man might nor wear a Crown? He answereth, by asking where the Scripture saith that they may wear? And unto them replying that it is permitted, which is not forbidden, He answereth, that it is forbidden, which is not permitted. Whereby appeareth, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Scriptures negatively holdeth nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Doctrine and Ecclesiastical Discipline, but even in matters arbitrary and variable by the advice of the Church. Where it is not enough that they be not forbidden, unless there be some Word which doth permit the use of them: It is not enough that the Scripture speaketh one against them, unless it speak for them; And finally, where it displeaseth the Lord which pleaseth him not, we must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity have the Word of his mountain declare his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> it will be found as the rest are. The Roman Emperors custom was at certain Solemn times to bestow on his Souldiers a Donative; which Donative they received, wearing Garlands upon their heads. There were in the time of the Emperors <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> many who being Souldiers had been converted unto Christ, and notwithstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still in that Military course of life. In which number, one man there was amongst all the rest, who at such a time coming to the Tribune of the Army to receive his Donative, came but with a Garland in his hand, and not in such sort as others did. The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune offended hereat, demanded what this great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity would mean: To whom the Souldier, <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus sum, I am a Christian.</hi> Many there were so besides him, which yet did otherwise at that time, whereupon grew a Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Christian Souldier might herein do as the unchristian did, and wear as they wore. Many of them which were very sound in Christian belief, did rather commend the zeal of this man, then approve his action. <hi>Tertullian</hi> was at the same time a <hi>Moutanist,</hi> and an enemy unto the Church for condemning that Prophetical Spirit, which <hi>Montanus</hi> and his followers did boast they had received; as it in them Christ had performed his last promise; as if to them he had sent the Spirit that should be their Perfecter and final Instructer in the mysteries of Christian truth. Which exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of mind made him apt to take all occasions of contradiction. Wherefore in honour of that action, and to gall their mindes who did not so much commend it, he wrote his Book <hi>de Corona Militis,</hi> not dissembling the stomach wherewith he wrote it.<note place="margin">Tent de <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

I doubt not but serue of them send the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, truss up bag and baggage, make themselves in a readiness, that they may fly from City to City; for that is the only point of the Gospel, which they are careful not to forget. I know even their Pastors very well what men they are; in peace Lions, Harts in time of trouble and fear:</hi> Now these men, saith <hi>Tertullian, They must be answered, Where do we finde it written in Scripture,</hi> that a Christian man may not wear a Garland <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> bewray this weakness in striking only, but also in repelling their strokes with whom he contendeth. They ask, saith he, <hi>What Scripture is there which doth teach that we should not be crowned? And what Scripture is there which doth teach that we should? For in requiring on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part the aid of Scripture, they do give sentence beforehand that their part ought also by Scripture to be aided:</hi> Which answer is of no great force. There is no necessity, that if I confess I ought not to do that which the Scripture forbiddeth me, I should thereby acknowledge my self bound to do nothing which the Scripture command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me not. For many inducements beside Scripture may lead me to that, which if Scripture be against, they all give place, and are of no value; yet otherwise are strong and effectual perswade. Which thing himself well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and being not ignorant that Scripture in many things doth neither
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66185:67"/>
command nor forbid, but use silence; his resolution in fine, is, that in the Church a number of things are strictly observed, whereof no Law of Scripture maketh mention one way or other; that of things once received and confirmed by use, long usage is a Law sufficient; that in Civil affairs, when there is no other Law, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom it self doth stand for Law, that inasmuch as Law doth stand upon Reason, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Reason serveth as well as to cite Scripture; that whatsoever is reasonable, the same is lawful, whosoever is the Author of it; that the authority of custom is great, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the custom of Christians was then, and had been a long time, not to wear Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and therefore that undoubtedly they did offend, who presumed to violate such a custom, by not observing that thing, the very inveterate Observation whereof was a Law sufficient to binde all men to observe it, unless they could shew some higher Law, some Law of Scripture to the contrary. This presupposed, it may stand then very well with strength and soundness of reason, even thus to answer, <hi>Whereas they ask what Scripture forbiddeth them to wear a Garland? we are in this case rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, What Scripture commandeth them? they cannot here alledge, that that is permitted which is not forbidden them: no, that is forbidden them which is not permitted.</hi> For long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived custom forbidding them to do as they did (if so be it did forbid them) there was no excuse in the world to justifie their act, unless in the Scripture they could shew some Law that did license them thus to break a received custom. Now whereas in all the Books of <hi>Tertullian</hi> besides, there is not so much found as in that one, to prove not only that we may do, but that we ought to do sundry things which the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth not; out of that very Book these Sentences are brought to make us believe that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was of a clean contrary mind. We cannot therefore hereupon yield; we cannot grant, that hereby is made manifest the Argument of Scripture negative to be of force, not only in Doctrine and Ecclesiastical Discipline, but even in matters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth plainly hold even in that Book, that neither the matter which he entreateth of was arbitrary, but necessary, inasmuch as the received custom of the Church did tie and binde them not to wear Garlands as the Heathens did; yea, and further also he reckoneth up particularly a number of things whereof he expresly concludeth, <hi>Haram &amp; aliaram ejusmodi disciplinarum si legem expostules Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, nullam invenies</hi>; which is as much as if he had said in express words, Many things thereare which concern the Discipline of the Church, and the duties of men, which to abrogate and take away, the Scriptures negatively urged may not in any case perswade us, but they must be observed, yea, although no Scripture be found which requireth any such thing. <hi>Tertullian</hi> therefore undoubtedly doth not in this Book shew himself to be of the same minde with them, by whom his name is pretended.</p>

And where he condemneth them, <hi>because they have not asked counsel at the mouth of the Lord,</hi> Isai. 30.2. And it may be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the same kinde of Argument hath been used in things which are not of the substance of Salvation or Damnation, and whereof there was no Commandment to the contrary (as in the former there was, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 31. and 30, 3. Deut. 17. 16.) In <hi>Ioshua</hi> the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> are charged by the Prophet, that they asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord, when they entred into Covenant with the <hi>Gibeanites, Ioshua</hi> 19. 14. And yet that Covenant was not made contrary unto any Commandment of God. Moreover, We read that when <hi>David</hi> had taken this counsel, to build a Temple unto the Lord, albeit the Lord had revealed before in his Word, that there should be such a standing place, where the Ark of the Covenant and the Service should have a certain abiding: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there was no Word of God which forbad <hi>David</hi> to build the Temple; yet the Lord (with commendation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> his good affection and zeal he had to the advancement of his glory) concludeth against Davids Resolution to build the Temple, with this Reason: Namely, That he had given no Commandment of this who should build it. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The Lord hath commanded, therefore it must be:</hi> And again, in like sort, <hi>He hath not, therefore it must not be</hi>; some certainty concerning this point seemeth requisite to be set down: God himself can neither possibly err, nor lead into error. For this cause his Testimonies, whatsoever he affirmeth, are always truth, and most infallible certainty. Yea, further, because the things that proceed from him are perfect without any manner of defect or maim; it cannot be but that the words of his mouth are absolute, and lack nothing which they should
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66185:68"/>
have, for performance of that thing whereunto they tend. Whereupon it followeth, that the end being known whereunto he directeth his speech, the Argument nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively is evermore strong and forcible, concerning those things that are apparently requisite unto the same end. As for example, God intending to set down sundry times that which in Angels is most excellent, hath not any where spoken so highly of them as he hath of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; therefore they are not in dignity equal unto him. It is the Apostle S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument. The purpose of God was to teach his people, both unto whom they should offer sacrifice, and what sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was to be offered. To burn their sons in fire unto <hi>Baal</hi> he did not command them, he spake no such thing, neither came it into his minde: therefore this they ought not to have done. Which Argument the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> useth more then once, as being so effectual and strong, that although the thing he reproveth were not only not commanded, but forbidden them, and that expresly; yet the Prophet chooseth rather to charge them with the fault of making a Law unto themselves,<note place="margin">Levit. 18. 21 and 2. 3. Deut. 28. 10.</note> than the crime of transgressing a Law which God had made. For when the Lord had once himself pecisely set down a form of executing that wherein we are to serve him, the fault appeareth greater to do that which we are not, then not to do that which we are commanded. In this we seem to charge the Law of God with hardness onely, in that with foolishness; in this we shew our selves weak and unapt to be doers of his Will, in that we take upon us to be Controllers of his Wisdom: in this we fail to perform the thing which God seeth meet, convenient, and good, in that we presume to see what is meet and convenient better then God himself. In those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore, the whole form whereof God hath of purpose set down to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, we may not otherwise do then exactly, as he hath prescribed: In such things Negative Arguments are strong. Again, with a Negative Argument <hi>David</hi> is pressed concerning the purpose he had to build a Temple unto the Lord: <hi>Thus saith the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 17.6.</note> Thou shalt not build me an House to dwell in. Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I one word to any of the Iudges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isai. 30. 1.</note> The Jews urged with a negative ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument touching the aid which they sought at the hands of the King of <hi>Egypt; We to those rebellious children</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>which walk forth to go down into Egypt, and have not asked counsel at my mouth, to strengthen themselves with the strength of Pharaoh.</hi> Finally, the league of <hi>Ioshua</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> is likewise with a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argument touched. It was not as it should be: And why? the Lord gave them not that advice: <hi>They sought not counsel at the mouth of the Lord.</hi> By the vertue of which examples,<note place="margin">Josh 9.14.</note> if any man should suppose the force of Negative Arguments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, when they are taken from Scripture, in such sort as we in this question are pressed therewith, they greatly deceive themselves. For unto which of all these was it said, that they had done amiss in purposing to do, or in doing any thing at all which the Scripture commanded them not? Our Question is, Whether all be sin which is done without direction by Scripture, and not, whether the <hi>Israelites</hi> did at any time amiss by following their own mindes, without asking counsel of God. No, it was that peoples singular priviledge, a favour which God vouchsafed them above the rest of the world, that in the affairs of their estate, which were not determinable one way or other by the Scripture, himself gave them extraordinary direction and counsel, as oft as they sought it at his hands. Thus God did first by speech unto <hi>Noses,</hi> after by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> unto Priests; lastly, by dreams and visions unto Prophets, from whom in such cases they were to receive the answer of God. Concerning <hi>Ioshua</hi> therefore, thus spake the Lord unto <hi>Moses</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Num. 27.21</note> 
                     <hi>He shall stand before</hi> Eleazer <hi>the Priest, who shall ask counsel for him by the judgement of</hi> Urim <hi>before the Lord:</hi> whereof had <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> been mindeful, the fraud of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> could not so smoothly have past un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>espied till there was no help. The Jews had Prophets to have resolved them from the mouth of God himself whether Egyptian aids should profit them, yea, or no: but they thought themselves wise enough, and him unworthy to be of their counsel. In this respect therefore was their reproof, though sharp, yet just, albeit there had been no charge precisely given them that they should always take heed of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But as for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> to think that he did evil in determining to build God a Temple, because there was in Scripture no Commandment that he should build it, were very injurious: the purpose
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66185:68"/>
of his heart was religious and godly, the act most worthy of honour and renown; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could <hi>Nathan</hi> chuse but admire his vertuous intent, exhort him to go forward, and beseech God to prosper him therein. Put God saw the endless troubles which <hi>David</hi> should be subject unto, during the whole time of his Regiment, and therefore gave charge to defer so good a work till the days of tranquillity and peace, wherein it might without interruption be performed. <hi>David</hi> supposed that it could not stand with the duty which he owed unto God, to set himself in an house of Cedar-trees,<note place="margin">1 Chron 17.

himself a Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and writing against the Title of Universal Bishop, saith thus, None of all my Predecessors ever consented to use this ungodly Title; No Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>ever took upon him this name of singularity.

For concerning Arguments Negative taken from Humane Authority, they are here proved to be in some cases very strong and forcible. They are not in our estimation idle reproofs, when the Authors of needless Innovations are opposed with such Negatives, as that of <hi>Leo, How are these new devices brought in which our Fathers never knew?</hi> When their grave and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Superiors do reckon up unto them, as <hi>Augustin</hi> did to the <hi>Donatists,</hi> large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Fathers, wondred at for their wisdom piety and learning, amongst whom for so many Ages before us, no one did ever so think of the Churches affairs, as now the World doth begin to be perswaded; surely by us they are not taught to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception hereat, because such Arguments are Negative. Much less when the like are taken from the sacred authority of Scripture, if the matter it self do bear them. For in truth the question is not, Whether an Argument from Scripture negatively may be good, but whether it be so generally good, that in all actions men may urge it? The Fathers, I grant, do use very general and large terms, even as <hi>Hiero</hi> the King did in speaking of <hi>Archimedes, From henceforward whatsoever</hi> Archimedes <hi>speaketh, it must be believed.</hi> His meaning was not that <hi>Archimedes</hi> could simply in nothing be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but that he had in such fort approved his skill, that he seemed worthy of credit for ever after in matters appertaining unto the science he was skilful in. In speaking thus largely it is presumed, that mens speeches will be taken according to the matter whereof they speak. Let any man therefore that carrieth indifferency of judgement, peruse the Bishops speeches, and consider well of those negatives concerning Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he produceth out of <hi>Irenaeus Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> which three are chosen from among the residue, because the sentences of the others (even as one of theirs also) do make for defence of negative Argments taken from humane Authority, and not from divine onely. They mention no more restraint in the one then in the other: yet I think themselves will not hereby judge, that the Fathers took both to be strong, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint unto any special kind of matter, wherein they held such Argument for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. Nor doth the Bishop either say or prove any more, then that an Argument in some kinds of matter may be good, although taken negatively from Scripture.</p>

And therefore this argument neither affirmatively nor negatively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth the hearer, but only induceth him to some liking or disliking of that for which it is brought, and is rather for an Orator to perswade the simpler sort, then for a Disputer to enforce him that is learned. 1 Cor.1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore to say that simply an Argument taken from mans Authority, doth hold no way, neither Affirmatively nor Negatively, is hard. By a mans Authority we here understand the force which his word hath for the assurance of anothers mind that buildeth upon it; as the Apostle somewhat did upon their report of the house of <hi>Chloe,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in a matter of far greater moment, upon the report of a simple Woman. For so it is said in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel, <hi>Many of the Samaritans of that City believed in him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He hath told me all things that ever I did.</hi> The strength of mans Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is Affirmatively such, that the weightiest affairs in the world depend thereon,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66185:69"/>
In judgement and justice are not hereupon proceedings grounded? Saith not the Law, that <hi>in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word shall be confirmed?</hi> This the Law of God would not say,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.15. Matth. 18. 16.</note> if there were in a mans testimony no force at all to prove any thing. And if it be admitted that in matter of Fact, there is some credit to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the testimony of man, but not in matter of opinion and judgment, we see the contrary both acknowledged and universally practised also throughout the world. The sentences of wise and expert men were never but highly esteemed. Let the title of a mans right be called in question, are we not bold to relie and build upon the judgement of such as are famous for their skill in the Laws of this Land? In matter of State, the weight many times of some one mans authority is thought reason suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent even to sway over whole Nations. And this is not only with the simple sort, but the learneder and wiser we are, the more such Arguments in some cases prevail with us. The Reason why the simpler sort are moved with Authority, is the conscience of their own ignorance; whereby it cometh to pass, that having learned men in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, they rather fear to dislike them, then know wherefore, they should allow and follow their judgements. Contrariwise with them that are skilful, authority is much more strong and forcible; because they only are able to discern how just cause there is why to some mens Authority, so much should be attributed. For which cause the name of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (no doubt) were more effectual to perswade even such men as <hi>Galen</hi> himself, then to move a silly Emperick. So that the very self-same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this kind which doth but induce the vulgar sort to like, may constrain the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser to yield. And therefore not Orators only with the people, but even the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest Disputers in all faculties have hereby often with the best learned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed most. As for Arguments taken from humane Authority, and that negatively, for example sake, if we should think the assembling of the people of God together by the sound of a Bell, the presenting of Infants at the Holy Font, by such as we commonly call their Godfathers, or any other the like received custom to be impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, because some men of whom we think very reverently, have in their Books and Writings no where mentioned or taught that such things should be in the Church, this reasoning were subject unto just reproof; it were but feeble, weak, and unsound. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding even negatively an Argument from humane Authority may be strong; as namely thus: The Chronicles of <hi>England</hi> mention no more then only six Kings bearing the name of <hi>Edward,</hi> since the time of the last Conquest; therefore it cannot be there should be more. So that if the question be of the authority of a mans te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, we cannot simply avouch, either that affirmatively, it doth not any way hold, or that it hath only force to induce the simpler sort, and not to constrain men of understanding and ripe judgement to yield assent, or that negatively it hath in it no strength at all. For unto every of these the contrary of most plain. Neither doth that which is alledged concerning the infirmity of men, overthrow or disprove this. Men are blinded with ignorance and error; many things escape them, and in many things they may be deceived; yea, those things which they do know, they may either forget, or upon sundry indirect considerations let pass, and although themselves do not erre, yet may they through malice or vanity, even of purpose deceive others. Howbeit, infinite cases there are wherein all these impediments and lets are so manifestly excluded, that there is no shew or colour whereby any such Exception may be taken, but that the testimony of man will stand as a ground of infallible assurance. That there is a City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Pins Quintus</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, and others have been Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> I suppose we are certainly enough perswaded. The ground of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, who never saw the place nor persons before named, can be nothing but mans testimony. Will any man here notwithstanding alledge those mentioned humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities as Reasons, why these things should be mistrusted or doubted of? yea, that which is more, utterly to infringe the force and strength of mans testimony, were to shake the very Fortress of Gods truth. For whatsoever we believe concerning Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ, although the Scripture be therein the ground of our belief, yet the authority of man is, if we mark it, the key which openeth the door of entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the Scripture. The Scripture doth not teach us the things that are of God, unless we did credit men who have taught us that the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture do signifie those things. Some way therefore, notwithstanding mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,

yet his Authority may inforce assent. Upon better advice and deliberation so much is perceived, and at the length confest, that Arguments taken from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men, may not only so far forth as hath been declared, but further also be of some force in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sciences</hi>;<note place="margin">

But in <hi>Matters Divine</hi> it is still maintained stifly that they have no manner force at all. Howbeit, the very self same reason, which causeth to yield that they are of some force in the one, will at the length constrain also to acknowledge that they are not in the other altogether unforcible. For it the natural strength of mans wit may by experience and stucie attain unto such ripeness in the knowledge of things hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, that men in this respect may presume to build somewhat upon their judgement; what reason have we to think but that even in matters Divine, the like wits furnisht with necessary helps, exercised in Scripture with like diligence, and assisted with the grace of Almighty God, may grow unto so much perfection of knowledge, that men shall have just cause, when any thing pertinent unto Faith and Religion is doubted of, the more willingly to encline their mindes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which the sentence of so grave, wise, and learned in that faculty shall judge most sound? For the controversie is of the weight of such mens judgements. Let it therefore be suspected, let it be taken as gross, corrupt, repugnant unto the truth, whatsoever concerning things divine above nature shall at any time be spoken as out of the mouths of meer natural men, which have not the eyes wherewith heavenly things are discerned: For this we contend not. But whom God hath endued with principal gifts to aspire unto knowledge by; whose exercises, labours, and divine studies he hath so blest, that the World for their great and rate skill that way hath them in singular admiration; may we reject even their judgement likewise, as being utterly of no moment? For mine own part, I dare not so lightly esteem of the Church, and of the principal Pillars therein. The truth is, that the minde of man desireth evermore to know the truth, according to the most infallible certainty which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things can yield. The greatest assurance generally with all men, is that which we have by plain aspect and intuitive beholding. Where we cannot attain unto this there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> what appeareth to be true, by strong and invincible demonstration, such as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is not by any way possible to be deceived, thereunto the minde doth necessarily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, neither is it in the choice thereof to do otherwise. And in case these both do fail, then which way greatest probability leadeth, thither the minde doth evermore incline. Scripture with Christian men being received as the Word of God; that for which we have probable, yea, that which we have necessary reason for, yea, that which we see with out eyes, is not thought so sure as that which the Scripture of God teacheth; because we hold that his speech revealeth there what himself seeth, and therefore the strongest proof of all, and the most necessarily assented unto by us (which do thus receive the Scripture) is the Scripture. Now it is not required, nor can be exacted at our hands, that we should yield unto any thing other assent, then such as doth answer the evidence which is to be had of that we assent unto. For which cause even in matters Divine, concerning some things we may lawfuly doubt and suspend our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, enclining neither to one side or other; as namely, touching the time of the fall both of man and Angels; of some things we may very well retain an opinion that they are probable and not unlikely to be true, as when we hold that men have their souls rather by creation then propagation, or that the Mother of our Lord lived always in the state of Virginity as well after his birth as before (for of these two, the one, her virginity before, is a thing which of necessity we must believe; the other, her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the same state always, hath more likelihood of truth then the contrary;) finally, in all things then are our Consciences best resolved, and in a most agreeable sore unto God and Nature setled, when they are so far perswaded as those grounds of

Which thing I do so much the rather set down, for that I see how a number of souls are, for want of right Information in this Point, oftentimes grievously vexed. When bare and unbuilded Conclusions are put into their mindes, they finding not themselves to have thereof any great certainty, imagine that this proceedeth only from lack of Faith, and that the Spirit God doth not work in them, as it doth in true Believers; by this means their hearts are much troubled, they fall into anquish and perplexity: whereas the truth is, that how bold and confident soever we may be in words, when it cometh to the point of trial, such as the evidence is, which the Truth hath either in it self, or through proof, such is the hearts assent thereunto; neither can it be stronger, being grounded as it should be. I grant that proof derived from the authority of mans judgement, is not able to work that assurance which doth grow by a stronger proof; and therefore although ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand General Councils would set down one and the same definitive sentence concerning any Point of Religion whatsoever, yet one Demonstrative Reason alledged, or one Manifest Testimony cited from the mouth of God himself to the contrary, could not choose but over-weigh them all; inasmuch as for them to have been deceived, it is not impossible; it is, that demonstrative Reason or Testimony Divine should deceive. Howbeit, in defect of proof infallible, because the minde doth rather follow probable perswasions, then approve the things that have in them no likelihood of truth at all; surely if a Question concerning matter of Doctrine were proposed,<note place="margin">

And whereas it is thought, that especially with the Church, and those that are called, and perswaded of the Authority of the Word of God, mans authority with them especially should not prevail; it must and doth prevail even with them, yea, with them especially as far as equity requireth, and farther we maintain it not. For men to be tied and led by Authority, as it were with a kind of captivity of judgement, and though there be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the contrary not to listen unto it, but to follow like Beasts the first in the Herd, they know not, nor care not whither, this were brutish. Again, that authority of men should prevail with men either against or above Reason, is no part of our belief. Companies of learned men, be they never so great and reverend are to yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Reason, the weight whereof is no whit prejudiced by the simplicity of his person which doth alledge it, but being found to be sound and good, the bare opinion of men to the contrary, must of necessity stoop and give place. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> writing against <hi>Marcion,</hi> which held one God Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Old-Testament, and another of the New; to prove that the Apostles preached the same God which was known before to the Jews, he copiously al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth sundry their Sermons and Speeches uttered concerning that matter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture. And lest any should be wearied with such store of Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the end he concludeth,. <hi>While we labour for these Demonstrations out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and do summarily, declare the things which many ways have been spoken, be contented quietly to hear, and do not think my speech redious:</hi> Quoniam oftensiones quae sunt in Scripturis, non possunt oftendi nisi ex ipsis Scripturis; <hi>Because demonstrations that art in Scripture may not otherwise be shewed, then by citing them out of the Scriptures themselves where they are.</hi> Which words make so little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the purpose, that they seem, as it were offended at him which hath called them

                        </gap>gustine</hi> exhorteth not to hear men, but to hearken what God speaketh. His purpose is not (I think) that was we should stop our ears against his own exhortation, and therefore he cannot mean simply that audience should altogether be denied unto men; but either that if men speak one thing, and God himself teach another, then he, not they, to be obeyed; or if they both speak the same thing, yet then also mans speech unworthy of hearing, not simply, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that which proceedeth from the mouth of God. Yea, but we doubt what the will of God is. Are we in this case forbidden to hear what men of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment think it to be? If not, then this Allegation also might very well have been spared. In that ancient strife which was between the Catholick Fathers and <hi>Arrians, Donatists,</hi> and others, of like perverse and froward disposition, as long as to Fathers or Councils alledged on the one side, the like by the contrary side were opposed, impossible it was that ever the Question should by this mean grow unto any issue or end. The Scripture they both believed; the Scripture they knew could not give sentence on both sides; by Scripture the controversie between them was such as might be determined. In this case what madness was it with such kindes of proofs to nourish their contention, when there were such effectual means to end all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie that was between them? Hereby therefore it doth not as yet appear that an Argument of Authority of man affirmatively, is in matters Divine nothing worth. Which Opinion being once inserted into the mindes of the vulgar sort, what it may grow unto God knoweth. Thus much we see, it hath already made thousands so headstrong, even in gross and palpable Errors, that a man whose capacity will scarce serve him to utter five words in sensible manner, blusheth not in any doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of Scripture to think his own bare <hi>Yea,</hi> as good as the <hi>Nay</hi> of all the wise, grave and learned judgements that are in the whole world: Which insolency must be represt, or it will be the very bane of Christian Religion. Our Lords Disciples marking what speech he uttered unto them, and at the same time calling to minde a common opinion held by the Scribes, between which opinion and the words of their Master, it seemed unto them that there was some contradiction, which they could not themselves answer,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.10.</note> with full satisfaction of their own mindes; the doubt they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to our Saviour, saying, <hi>Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?</hi> They knew that the Scribes did err greatly, and that many ways even in matters of their own profession. They notwithstanding thought the judgement of the very Scribes in matters Divine to be of some value; some probability they thought there was that <hi>Elias</hi> should come, inasmuch as the Scribes said it. Now no truth can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict any truth; desirous therefore they were to be taught, how both might stand together; that which they knew could not be false, because Christ spake it; and this which to them did seen true, only because the Scribes had said it. For the Scripture from whence the Scribes did gather it, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not then in their heads. We do not finde that our Saviour reproved them of Error, for thinking the judgement of the Scribes to be worth the objecting, for esteeming it to be of any moment or value, in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God. We cannot therefore be perswaded that the will of God is, we should so far reject the authority of men, as to reckon it nothing. No, it may be a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that urge us unto this be themselves so perswaded indeed. Men do sometimes bewray that by deeds, which to confess they are hardly drawn. Mark then if this be not general with all men for the most part. When the judgements of learned men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against them, what do they but either elevate their credit, or oppose unto them the judgements of others as learned? Which thing doth argue that all men acknowledge in them some force and weight, for which they are loth the cause they maintain should be so much weakned, as their Testimony is available. Again, what reason is there why alledging Testimonies as Proofs, men give them some title of credit, honour and estimation whom they alledge, unless beforehand it be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known who they are? what reason hereof but onely a common engrafted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66185:71"/>
that in some men there may be found such qualities as are able to countervail those exceptions which might be taken against them, and that such mens autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not lightly to be shaken off? Shall I add further, that the force of Arguments drawn from the Authority of Scripture it self, as Scriptures commonly are alledged, shall (being sifted) be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound to depend upon the strength of this so much despised and debased authority of man? Surely it doth, and that oftner then we are aware of. For although Scripture be of God, and therefore the proof which is taken from thence, must needs be of all other most invincible; yet this strength at hath not, unless it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch the self-same thing, for which it is brought. If there be either undeniable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence that so it doth, or reason such as cannot deceive, then Scripture-proof (no doubt) in strength and value exceedeth all. But for the most part, even such as are readiest to cite for one thing Five hundred sentences of holy Scripture; what warrant have they, that any one of them doth mean the thing for which it is alledged? Is not their surest ground most commonly, either some probable conjecture of their own, or the judgment of others taking those Scriptures as they do? Which notwithstanding to mean otherwise then they take them, it is not still altogether impossible. So that now and then they ground themselves on Humane authority, even when they most pretend Divine. Thus it fareth even clean throughout the whole controversie about that Discipline which is so earnestly urged and labored for. Scriptures are plentifully alledged to prove that the whole Christian World for ever ought to embrace it. Hereupon men term it, <hi>The Discipline of God.</hi>

Is this a warrant sufficient for any mans conscience to build such proceedings upon, as have been, and are put in ure for the establishment of that cause? But to conclude, I would gladly understand how it cometh to pass, that they which so peremptorily do maintain that Humane Authority is nothing worth, are in the cause which they favor so careful to have the common sort of men perswaded, that the wisest, the godliest, and the best learned in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are that way given, seeing they judge this to make nothing in the World for them? Again, how cometh it to pass, they cannot abide that Authority should be alledged on the other side, if there be no force at all in Authorities on one side or other? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labor they to strip their Adversaries of such furniture as doth not help? Why take they such needless pains to furnish also their own cause with the like? If it be void and to no purpose, that the names of men are so frequent in their Books, what did move them to bring them in, or doth to suffer them there remaining? Ignorant I am not how this is salved, <hi>They do it but after the truth made manifest, first by Reason, or by Scripture: They do it not, but to controul the enemies of truth, who bear themselves bold upon Humane Authority, making not for them, but against them rather.</hi> Which answers are nothing: For in what place, or upon what consideration soever it be they do it, were it in their own opinion of no force being done, they would undoubtedly refrain to do it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But to the end it may more plainly appear,<note place="margin">A Declaration what the truth is in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> what we are to judge of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and of the cause it self wherein they are alledged; first, it may not well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that all actions of men endued with the use of reason, are generally either good or evil. For although it be granted, that no action is properly termed good or evil, unless it be voluntarily; yet this can be no let to our former Assertion, That all actions of men endued with the use of reason, are generally either good or evil; because even those things are done voluntarily by us, which other Creatures do naturally, in as much as we might stay our doing of them if we would. Beasts naturally do take their food and rest, when it offereth it self unto them. If men did so too, and could not do otherwise of themselves, there were no place for any such reproof as that of our Saviour Christ unto his Disciples,<note place="margin">Matth. 86. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> That which is voluntarily performed in things tending to the end, if it be well done, must needs be done with deliberate consideration of some reasonable cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we rather should do it then not. Whereupon it seemeth, that in such actions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66185:72"/>
onely those are said to be good or evil, which are capable of deliberation: So that many things being hourly done by men, wherein they need nor use with themselves any manner of consultation at all, it may perhaps hereby seem that well or ill doing belongeth onely to our weightier affairs, and to those deeds which are of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that they require advice. But thus to determine were perillous, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound also. I do rather incline to think, that seeing all the unforced actions of men are voluntary; and all voluntary actions tending to the end have choice; and all choice presupposeth the knowledge of some cause wherefore we make it; where the reasonable cause of such actions so readily offereth it self, that it needeth not be sought for; in those things though we do not deliberate, yet they are of their nature apt to be deliberated on, in regard of the will which may encline either way, and would not any one way bend it self, if there were not some apparent motive to lead it. Deliberation actual we use, when there is doubt what we should encline our wills unto. Where no doubt is, deliberation is not excluded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent unto the thing, but as needless in regard of the Agent, which seeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready what to resolve upon. It hath no apparent absurdity therefore in it to think, that all actions of men endued with the use of reason, are generally either good or evil. Whatsoever is good, the same is also approved of God; and according unto the sundry degrees of goodness, the kinds of Divine approbation are in like sort mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. Some things are good, yet in so mean a degree of goodness, that men are onely not disproved nor disallowed of God for them.<note place="margin">Ephis. 5. 29.

Some things in such sort are allowed, that they be also required as necessary unto salvation, by way of direct, immediate and proper necessity final; so that without performance of them we cannot by ordinary course be saved, nor by any means be excluded from life observing them. In actions of this kind our chiefest direction is from Scripture; for Nature is no sufficient Teacher what we should do that we may attain unto life everlasting.

The testimonies of God are true, the Testimonies of God are perfect, the Testimonies of God are all-sufficient unto that end for which they were given. Therefore accordingly we do receive them, we do not think that in them God hath omitted any thing needful unto his purpose, and left his intent to be accomplished by our devisings. What
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66185:72"/>
the Scripture purposeth, the same in all points it doth perform. Howbeit, that here we swerve not in judgement, one thing especially we must observe, namely, That the absolute perfection of Scripture is seen by relation unto that end whereto it tendeth. And even hereby it cometh to pass, the first such as imagine the general and main drift of the body of sacred Scripture not to be so large as it is, nor that God did thereby intend to deliver, as in truth he doth, a full instruction in all things unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation necessary, the knowledge whereof man by nature could not otherwise in this life attain unto: They are by this very mean induced, either still to look for new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from Heaven, or else dangerously to add to the Word of God uncertain Tradition, that so the Doctrine of mans Salvation may be compleat; which Doctrine we constantly hold in all respects without any such thing added to be so compleat, that we utterly refuse as much as once to acquaint our selves with any thing further. Whatsoever, to make up the Doctrine of mans Salvation, is added as in supply of the Scriptures unsufficiency, we reject it: Scripture purposing this, hath perfectly and fully done it. Again, the scope and purpose of God in delivering the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, such as do take more largely then behoveth, they on the contrary side racking and stretching it further then by him was meant, are drawn into sundry as great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.

We count those things perfect which want nothing requisite for the end whereto they were instituted: As therefore God created every part and particle of man exactly perfect, that is to say, in all points sufficient unto that use for which he appointed it; so the Scripture, yea, every sentence thereof is perfect, and wanteth nothing requisite unto that purpose for which God delivered the same. So that if hereupon we conclude, that because the Scripture is perfect, therefore all things lawful to be done are comprehended in the Scripture; we may even as well conclude so of every sentence, as of the whole sum and body thereof, unless we first of all prove that it was the drift, scope and purpose of Almighty God in holy Scripture, to comprize all things which man may practise. But admit this, and mark, I beseech you, what would follow. God in delivering Scripture to his Church, should clean have abrogated amongst them the Law of Nature, which is an infallible knowledge imprinted in the minds of all the children of men, whereby both general principles for directing of humane actions are comprehended, and conclusions derived from them; upon which conclusions grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in particularity the choice of good and evil in the daily affairs of this life. Admit this, and what shall the Scripture be but a snare and a torment to weak Consciences, filling them with infinite perplexities, scrupulosities, doubts insoluble, and extreme despairs? Not that the Scripture it self doth cause any such thing (for it tendeth to the clean contrary, and the fruit thereof is resolute assurance and certainty in that it teacheth:) but the necessities of this life urging men to do that which the light of Nature, common discretion, and judgement of it self directeth them unto; on the other side, this Doctrine teaching them that so to do were so sin against their own souls, and that they put forth their hands to iniquity, whatsoever they go about, and have not first the sacred Scripture of God for direction; how can it chuse but bring the simple a thousand times to their wits end, how can it chuse but vex and amaze them? For in every action of common life to since out some se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tence clearly and infallibly setting before our eyes what we ought to do (seem we in Scripture never so expert) would trouble us more then we are aware. In weak and tender minds we little know what misery this strict opinion would breed, besides the stops it would make in the whole course of all mens lives and actions; make all things sin which we do by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Natures light, and by the rule of common discretion without thinking at all upon Scripture. Admit this Position, and Parents shall cause their children to sin, as oft as they cause them to do any thing before they come to years of capacity and be ripe for Knowledge in the Scripture. Admit this, and it shall not be with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as it was with him him in the Gospel; but servants being commanded to go,<note place="margin">Luke 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which as it standeth with Christian duty in some cases, so in common affairs to require it, were most unfit. Two opinions therefore there are concerning sufficiency of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, each extreamly opposit unto the other, and both repugnant unto truth. The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66185:73"/>
Schools of <hi>Rome</hi> teach Scripture to be unsufficient, as if, except Traditions were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it did not contain all revealed and supernatural Truth, which absolutely is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the children of men in this life to know, that they may in the next be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Others justly condemning this opinion, grow likewise unto a dangerous extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if Scripture did not only contain all things in that kinde necessary, but all things simply, and in such sort, that to do any thing according to any other Law, were not only unnecessary, but even opposite unto salvation, unlawful and sinful. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is spoken of God, or things appertaining to God, otherwise then as the truth is, though it seem an honour, it is an injury. And as incredible praises given unto men, do often abate and impair the credit of their deserved commendation; so we must likewise take great heed, lest in attributing unto Scripture more then it can have, the incredibility of that, do cause even those things which indeed it hath most abundantly, to be less reverendly esteemed. I therefore leave it to themselves to consider, Whether they have in this First Point overshot themselves, or not; which, God doth know, is quickly done, even when our meaning is most sincere, as I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perswaded, theirs in this case was.</p>

for mens more clear and plain understanding, in what respect Laws of Polity or Government are necessary thereunto. That Church of Christ, which we properly term his body Mystical, can be but one; neither can that one be sensibly discerned by any man, inasmuch as the parts thereof are some in Heaven already with Christ, and the rest that are on earth (albeit their natural persons be visible) we do not discern under this property whereby they are truly and infallibly of that body. Only our minds by intellectual conceit are able to apprehend, that such a real body there is, a body collective, because it containeth an huge multitude; a body mystical, because the mystery of their conjunction is removed altogether from sense. Whatsoever we read in Scripture, concerning the endless love, and the saving mercy, which God sheweth towards his Church, the only proper subject thereof is this Church. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Flock it is that our Lord and Saviour hath promised,<note place="margin">John 10. 22.</note>

                     <hi>a good conscience, and a faith unfeigned,</hi> who can pronounce, saving only the searcher of all mens hearts, who alone intuitively doth known in this kind who are his? And as those everlasting promises of Love, Mercy, and Blessedness, belong to the mystical Church; even so on the other side, when we read of any duty which the Church of God is bound unto, the Church whom this doth concern is a sensible known company. And this Visible Church in like sort is but one, continued from the first beginning of the World to the last end. Which company being divided into two moyeties, the one before the other since the coming of Christ, that part which since the coming of Christ, partly hath embraced, and partly shall hereafter embrace the Christian Religion, we term as by a more proper name the Church of Christ. And therefore the Apostle affirmeth plainly of all men Christian, that be they Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, bond or free, they are all incorporated into one company, they all make but(<note n="a" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 16.

As for those Vertues that belong unto Moral Righteousness, and honesty of life, we do not mention them, because they are not proper unto Christian Men, as they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but do concern them as they are Men. True it is, the want of these Vertues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from Salvation. So doth much more the absence of inward belief of heart; so doth despair and lack of Hope; so emptiness of Christian Love and Charity. But we speak now of the Visible Church, whose Children are signed with this mark, <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.</hi> In whomsoever these things are, the Church doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for her Children; them onely she holdeth for Aliens and Strangers, in whom these things are not found. For want of these it is, that Saracens, Jews, and Infidels, are excluded out of the bounds of the Church: Others we may not deny to be of the Visible Church, as long as these things are not wanting in them. For appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it is, that all Men are of necessity either Christians, or not Christians. If by Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profession they be Christians, then are they of the Visible Church of Christ; and Christians by External Profession they are all, whose mark of Recognisance hath in it those things which we have mentioned, yea, although they be impious Idolaters, wicked Hereticks, Persons excommunicable, yea, and cast out for notorious improbity.

that to reform our selves, if at any time we have done amiss, is not to sever our selves from the Church we were of before. In the Church we were, and we are so still. Other diffcrence between our estate before and now, we know none, but onely such as we see in <hi>Iudah</hi>; which having sometime been Idolatrous, became afterwards more soundly religious,<note place="margin">Hos. 14. 15, &amp; 17.</note> by renouncing Idolatry and Superstition. <hi>If</hi> Ephraim <hi>be joyned to Idols,</hi> the counsel of the Prophet is, <hi>Let him alone. If</hi> Israel <hi>play the Harlot, let not</hi> Judah <hi>sin.</hi> If it seem evil unto you,<note place="margin">Josh. 14. 15.</note> saith <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to serve the Lord, <hi>chuse you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods whom your Fathers served beyond the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose Land ye dwell: But I and mine house will serve the Lord.</hi> The indisposition therefore of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to reform her self, must be no stay unto us from performing our duty to God; even as desire of retaining Conformity with them, could be no excuse, if we did not perform that duty. Notwithstanding so far as lawfully we may, we have held and do hold Fellowship with them. For even as the Apostle doth say of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.28.</note> that they are in one respect enemies, but in another beloved of God: In like sort with <hi>Rome,</hi> we dare not communicate concerning sundry her gross and grievous abominations; yet touching those main parts of Christian truth wherein they constantly still persist, we gladly acknowledge them to be of the Family of Jesus Christ; and our hearty prayer unto God Almighty is, that being conjoyned so far forth with them, they may at the length (if it be his will) so yield to frame and reform themselves, that no distraction remain in any thing, but that we all may with one heart and one mouth, glorifie God the Father of our Lord and Saviour, whose Church we are. As there are which make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> utterly no Church at all, by reason of so many, so grievous Errors in their Doctrines: So we have them amongst us, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of imagined corruptions in our Discipline, do give even as hard a judgment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> it self. But whatsoever either the one sort or the other teach, we must acknowledge even Hereticks themselves to be, though a maimed part, yet a part of the Visible Church. If an Infidel should pursue to death an Heretick professing Christianity, onely for Christian Profession sake, could we deny unto him the honor of Martyrdom? Yet this honor all men know to be proper unto the Church. Hereticks therefore are not utterly cut off from the Visible Church of Christ. If the Fathers do any where, as oftentimes they do, make the true Visible Church of Christ, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terical companies opposite; they are to be construed as Separating Hereticks, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from the company of Believers, but from the fellowship of sound Believers. For whereprofest unbelief is, there can be no Visible Church of Christ; there may be, where sound belief wanteth. Infidels being clean without the Church, deny directly, and utterly reject the very Principles of Christianity; which Hereticks embrace, and err onely by misconstruction: Whereupon their opinions, although repugnant indeed to the Principles of Christian Faith, are notwithstanding by them held otherwise, and maintained as most consonant thereunto. Wherefore being Christians in regard of the general Truth of Christ which they openly profess; yet they are by the Fathers every where spoken of, as men clean excluded out of the right believing Church, by reason of their particular Errors, for which all that are of a sound belief must needs condemn them. In this consideration, the answer of <hi>Calvin</hi> unto <hi>Farell,</hi> concerning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Popish Parents doth seem crazed.<note place="margin">Calvin. Epish. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Whereas,</hi> saith he, <hi>you ask our judgment about a matter, whereof there is doubt amongst you, whether Ministers of our Order, professing the pure Doctrine of the Gospel, may lawfully admit unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism an Infant whose Father is a stranger unto our Churches, and whose Mother hath salm from us unto the Papacy, so that both the Parents are Popish. Thus we have thought good to answer; namely, that it is an absurd thing for us to baptize them which cannot be reckoned Members of our Body. And sith Papists children are such, we see not how it should be lawful to Minister Baptism unto them.</hi> Sounder a great deal is the answer of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Colledge of <hi>Geneva</hi> unto <hi>Knox,</hi> who having signified unto them, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did not think it lawful to Baptize bastards, or the children of Idolaters (he meaneth Papists) or of Persons Excommunicate, till either the Parents had by repentance sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves unto the Church, or else their children being grown unto the years of understanding,<note place="margin">Epist. 283.</note> should come and sue for their own Baptism. <hi>For thus thinking,</hi> saith he, <hi>I am thought to be over severe,</hi>

herein they controuled. Their Sentence was, <hi>Wheresoever the Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity hath not utterly perished and been extinct, Infants are beguiled of their right, if the Common Seal be denied them.</hi> Which conclusion in it self is sound, although it seemeth the ground is but weak whereupon they build it: For the reason which they yield of their Sentence, is this; <hi>The promise which God doth make to the faithful concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Seed, reacheth unto a thousand Generations; it resteth not onely in the first degree of Descent. Infants therefore whose Great Grandfathers have been holy and godly, do in that respect belong to the Body of the Church, although the Fathers and Grandfathers of whom they descend, have been Apostates: Because the tenure of the Grace of God which did adopt them Three hundred years ago, and more in their Ancient Predecessors, cannot with justice be defeated and broken off by their Parents impiety coming between.</hi> By which reason of theirs, although it seem that all the World may be baptized, in as much as no man living is a thousand descents removed from <hi>Adam</hi> himself; yet we mean not at this time, either to uphold, or to overthrow it; onely their alledged conclusion we embrace, so it be construed in this sort: <hi>That for as much as men remain in the Visible Church, till they utterly renounce the Profession of Christianity, we may not deny unto Infants their right, by withholding from them the publick sign of holy Baptism, if they be born where the outward acknowledgment of Christianity is not clean gone and extinguished.</hi> For being in such sort born, their Parents are within the Church, and therefore their birth doth give them interest and right in Baptism. Albeit not every Error and Fault, yet Heresies and Crimes which are not actually repented of, and forsaken, exclude quite and clean from that Salvation which belongeth unto the Mystical Body of Christ; yea, they also make a Separation from the Visible sound Church of Christ; altogether from the Visible Church, neither the one nor the other doth sever. As for the Act of Excommunication, it neither shutteth out from the Mystical, nor clean from the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but onely from Fellowship with the Visible in holy duties. With what congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deny, that her enemies, whom she holdeth always for Hereticks, do at all appertain to the Church of Christ; when her own do freely grant, that albeit the Pope (as they say) cannot teach Heresie, nor propound Error, he may notwithstanding himself worship Idols, think amiss concerning matters of Faith, yea, give himself unto Acts Diabolical, even being Pope? How exclude they us from being any part of the Church of Christ, under the colour and pretence of Heresie, when they cannot but grant it possible, even for him to be as touching his own personal perswasion Heretical, who in their opinion not onely is of the Church, but holdeth the chiefest place of Authority over the same? But of these things we are not now to dispute. That which already we have set down, is for our present purpose sufficient. By the Church therefore, in this question, we understand no other then onely the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church. For preservation of Christianity there is not any thing more needful, then that such as are of the Visible Church, have mutual Fellowship and Society one with another. In which consideration, as the main Body of the Sea being one, yet within divers Precincts hath divers names; so the Catholick Church is in like sort divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a number of distinct Societies, every of which is termed a Church within it self. In this sense the Church is always a Visible Society of Men; not an Assembly, but a Society. For although the name of the Church be given unto Christian Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, although any number of Christian men congregated, may be termed by the name of a Church, yet Assemblies properly are rather things that belong to a Church. Men are assembled for performance of Publick Actions; which Actions being ended, the Assembly dissolveth it self, and is no longer in being; whereas the Church which was assembled, doth no less continue afterwards, then before.<note place="margin">Tertul.

manner, even the several Societies of Christian men, unto every of which the name of a Church is given, with addition betokening severally, as the Church of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, England,</hi> and so the rest, must be endued with correspondent general properties belonging unto them, as they are Publick Christian Societies. And of such properties common unto all Societies Christian, it may not be denied, that one of the very cheifest is Ecclesiastical Polity. Which word I therefore the rather use, because the name of Government, as commonly men understand it in ordinary speech, doth not comprise the largeness of that whereunto in this question it is applied. For when we speak of Government, what doth the greatest part conceive thereby, but onely the exercise of Superiority peculiar unto Rulers and Guides of others? To our purpose therefore the name of Church-Polity will better serve, because it containeth both Government, and also whatsoever besides belongeth to the ordering of the Church in publick. Neither is any thing in this degree more necessary then Church-Polity, which is a Form of ordering the Publick Spiritual Affairs of the Church of God.</p>

Of God it must be; either as those things sometimes were, which God supernaturally revealed, and so deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto <hi>Moses</hi> for Government of the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel</hi>; or else as those things which men finde out by help of that light, which God hath given them unto that end. The very Law of Nature it self, which no man can deny but God hath instituted, is not of God, unless that be of God, whereof God is the Author as well this latter way as the former. But forasmuch as no form of Church-Polity is thought by them to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or to be of God, unless God be so the Author of it, that it be also set down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they should tell us plainly, whether their meaning be that it must be there set down in whole, or in part. For if wholly, let them shew what one form of Polity ever was so. Their own to be so taken out of Scripture, they will not affirm; neither deny they that in part, even this which they so much oppugn is also from thence taken. Again, they should tell us, whether onely that be taken out of Scripture, which is actually and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly there set down; or else that also, which the general Principles and Rules of Scripture potentially contain. The one way they cannot so much as pretend, that all the parts of their own Discipline are in Scripture; and the other way their mouths are stopped, when they would plead against all other Forms besides their own; seeing the general Principles are such, as do not particularly prescribe any one, but sundry may equally be consonant unto the general Axioms of the Scripture. But to give them some larger scope, and not to close them up in these streights: Let their Allegations be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, wherewith they earnestly bend themselves against all, which deny it necessary that any one compleat Form of Church-Polity should be in Scripture. First therefore, whereas it hath been told them, that matters of Faith, and in general, matters neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary unto Salvation, are of a different nature from Ceremonies, Order, and the kinde of Church Government; and that the one is necessary to be expresly contained in the Word of God, or else manifestly collected out of the same, the other not so; that it is necessary not to receive the one, unless there be something in Scripture for them; the other free, if nothing against them may thence be alledged. Although there do not appear any just or reasonable cause to reject or dislike of this; nevertheless, as it is not easie to speak to the contentation of mindes exulcerated in themselves, but that somewhat there will be always which displeaseth; so herein for two things we are reproved.<note n="*" place="margin">Two things misliked; the one, that we distinguish matters of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline or Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from matters of Faith, and necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation: The other, that we are injurious to the Scripture of God, in abridging the large and rich Continks thereof. Their words are these: You which distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these, and say, that matters of Faith and necessary unto Salvation, may not be tolerated in the Church, unless they be expresly contained in the Word of God, or manifestly gathered; but that Ceremonies, Order, Discipline, Government in the Church, may not be received against the Word of God, and consequently may be received if there be no word against them, although there be none for them. You (I say) distinguishing or dividing after this sort, do prove your self an evil divider. As though matters of Discipline and kinde of Government, were not matters necessary to Salvation, and of Faith. It is no small injury which you do unto the Word of God, to pin it in so narrow room, as that it should be able to direct us but in the Principal Points of our Religion; or as though the Substance of Religion, or some rude and unfashioned mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Building of the Church were uttered in them; and those things were left out that should pertain to the Form and Fashion of it; or, as if there were in the Scriptures onely to cover the Churches nakedness, and not also Chains, and Bracelets, and Rings, and other Jewels to adorn her and set her out: or that to conclude, There were sufficient to quench her thirst, and kill her hunger, but not to minister unto her a more liberal, and (as it were) a more delicious and dainty diet. These things you seem to say, when you say, that matters necessary to Salvation, and of Faith, are contained in Scripture, especially when you oppose these things to Ceremonies, Order, Discipline, and Goverment. <hi>T. C.</hi> lib. 1. pag. 26.</note> The first is, <hi>Misdistinguishing,</hi> because matters of Discipline and Church-Government are (as they say) matters necessary to Salvation, and of Faith, whereas we put a difference betwixt the one and the other. Our second fault is <hi>Injurious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with the Scripture of God, as if it contained onely the Principal Points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, some rude and unfashioned matter of Building the Church, but had lest out that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66185:77"/>
which belongeth unto the form and fashion of it; as if there were in the Scripture no more then onely to cover the Churches nakedness, and not Chains, Bracelets, Rings, Jewels to adorn her; sufficient to quench her thirst, to kill her hunger, but not to minister a more liberal, and (as it were) a more delicous and dainty diet. In which case our Apology shall not need to be very long.</p>

The mixture of those things by speech, which by Nature are divided, is the Mother of all Error. To take away therefore that Error which Confusion breedeth, distinction is requisite. Rightly to distinguish, is by conceit of minde to sever things different in Nature, and to discern wherein they differ. So that if we imagine a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence where there is none, because we distinguish where we should not, it may not be denied that we misdistinguish. The only trial whether we do so, yea or no, dependeth upon comparison between our conceit, and the nature of things conceived. Touching matters belonging to the Church of Christ, this we conceive, that they are not of one sute. Some things are meerly of Faith, which things it doth suffice, that we know and believe; some things not onely to be known, but done, because they concern the actions of men. Articles about the Trinity, are matters of meer Faith, and must be believed. Precepts concerning the Works of Charity, are matters of Action; which to know, unless they be practised, is not enough. This being so clear to all mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, I somewhat marvel that they especially should think it absurd to oppose Church Government, a plain matter of Action, unto matters of Faith, who know that themselves divide the Gospel into Doctrine and Discipline. For if matters of<note place="margin">

Do not they under Doctrine comprehend the same, which we intend by matters of Faith? Do not they under Discipline, comprise the Regiment of the Church? When they blame that in us, which themselves follow, they give men great cause to doubt, that some other thing then judgment doth guide their speech. What the Church of God standeth bound to know or do, the same in part Nature teacheth. And because Nature can teach them but onely in part, neither so fully as is requisite for mans salvation; not so easily, as to make the way plain and expedite enough, that many may come to the knowledge of it, and so be saved; therefore in Scripture hath God both collected the most necessary things, that the School of Nature teacheth unto that end; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth also whatsoever we neither could with safety be ignorant of, nor at all be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in, but by Supernatural Revelation from him. So that Scripture containing all things that are in this kinde any way needful for the Church, and the principal of the other sort: This is the next thing wherewith we are charged as with an Error. We teach, that whatsoever is unto Salvation termed <hi>necessary</hi> by way of excellency; whatsoever it standeth all men upon to know or do, that they may be saved; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever there is, whereof it may truly be said, <hi>This not to believe, is eternal death and damnation</hi>; or, <hi>This every soul that will live, must duly observe:</hi> Of which sort the Articles of Christian Faith, and the Sacraments of the Church of Christ are. All such things, if Scripture did not comprehend, the Church of God should not be able to measure out the length and the breadth of that way wherein for ever she is to walk: Hereticks and Schismaticks never ceasing, some to abridge, some to enlarge, all to pervert and obscure the same. But as for those things that are accessary hereunto,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66185:77"/>
those things that so belong to the way of Salvation, as to alter them, is no otherwise to change that way, then a path is changed by altering onely the uppermost face thereof; which be it laid with Gravel, or set with Grass, or paved with stones, remaineth still the same path: In such things, because discretion may teach the church what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, we hold not the Church further tied herein unto Scripture, then that against Scripture nothing be admitted in the Church, lest that path which ought always to be kept even, do thereby come to be overgrown with Brambles and Thorns.<note place="margin">Matth 23. 23.</note> If this be unfound, wherein doth the point of unsoundness lie? Is it not that we make some things necessary, some things accessory and appendent onely? For our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himself doth make that difference, by terming Judgment, and Mercy, and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with other things of like nature, <hi>The greater and weightier matters of the Law.</hi> Is it then in that we account Ceremonies, (wherein we do not comprise Sacraments, or any other the like substantial duties in the exercise of Religion, but onely such Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rites as are usually annexed unto Church actions) is it an oversight, that we reckon these things and<note n="*" place="margin">The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Christ grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Fenner</hi> himself, to be thought a matter of great moment, yet not of the substance of Religion.

The one to that Food which the Church doth live by, the other to that which maketh her Diet liberal, dainty, and more delicious? Is dainty fare a thing necessary to the sustenance, or to the cloathing of the Body rich attire? If not, how can they urge the necessity of that which themselves resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by things not necessary? Or by what construction shall any man living be able to make those comparisons true, holding that distinction untrue, which putteth a difference between things of External Regiment in the Church, and things necessary unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>

Wherein seeing that no more is by us maintained, then onely that Scripture must needs teach the Church whatsoever is in such sort necessary, as hath been set down; and that it is no more disgrace for Scripture to have left a number of other things free to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the discretion of the Church, then for Nature to have lest it unto the wit of man to devise his own attire, and not to look for it as the Beasts of the field have theirs.

What is to add to the Law of God, if this be not? When that which the Word of God doth but deliver Historically, we construe without any warrant, as if it were legally meant, and so urge it further then we can prove that it was intended; do we not add to the Laws of God, and make them in number seem more then they are?

The Rules are these, <hi>Nothing scandalous</hi> or offensive unto any, especially unto the Church of God; <hi>All things</hi> in order and with seemliness; <hi>All unto edification</hi>; finally, <hi>All to the glory of God.</hi> Of which kinde, how many might be gathered out of the Scripture, if it were necessary to take so much pains? Which Rules they that urge, minding thereby to prove, that nothing may be done in the Church, but what Scripture commandeth, must needs hold that they tie the Church of Christ no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then onely because we finde them there set down by the Finger of the Holy Ghost. So that unless the Apostle by writing had delivered those Rules to the Church, we should by observing them, have sinned, as now by not observing them. In the Church of the Jews, is it not granted, <hi>That the appointment of the hour for daily Sacrifices</hi>; the building of <hi>Synagogues</hi> throughout the Land, to hear the Word of God, and to pray in, when they came not up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; the erecting of <hi>Pulpits</hi> and <hi>Chairs</hi> to teach in; the order of <hi>Burial</hi>; the <hi>Rites of Marriage,</hi> with such like, being matters appertaining to the Church; yet are not any where prescribed in the Law, but were by the Churches discretion instituted? What then shall we think? Did they hereby add to the Law, and so displease God by that which they did? None so hardly perswaded of them. Doth their Law deliver unto them the self-same general Rules of the Apostle, that framing thereby their Orders, they might in that respect clear themselves from doing amiss? St. <hi>Paul</hi> would then of likelihood have cited them out of the Law, which we see he doth not. The truth is, they are Rules and Canons of that Law which is written in all mens hearts; the Church had for ever no less then now stood bound to observe them, whether the Apostle had mentioned them, or no. Seeing therefore those Canons do binde as they are Edicts of Nature, which the Jews observing as yet unwritten, and thereby framing such Church Orders as in their Law were not prescribed, are notwithstanding in that respect unculpable: It followeth, that sundry things may be lawfully done in the Church, so as they be not done against the Scripture, although no Scripture do command them; but the Church onely following the Light of Reason, judge them to be in discretion meet. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, unto our purpose, and for the question in hand, Whether the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God in Scripture, be general or special, it skilleth not? For if being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly applied, they have in regard of such particulars, a force constraining us to take some one certain thing of many, and to leave the rest; whereby it would come to pass, that any other particular, but that one being established, the general Rules them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that case would be broken; then is it utterly impossible, that God should leave any thing great or small free for the Church to establish, or not. Thirdly, if so be they shall grant, as they cannot otherwise do, that these Rules are no such Laws as require any one particular thing to be done, but serve rather to direct the Church in all things which she doth; so that free and lawful it is to devise any Ceremony, to receive any Order, and to authorise any kinde of Regiment, no special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment being thereby violated; and the same being thought such by them to whom the judgment thereof appertaineth; as that it is not scandalous, but decent, tending unto edification, and setting forth the glory of God; that is to say, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the general Rules of holy Scripture; this doth them no good in the World, for the furtherance of their purpose. That which should make for them, must prove, that men ought not to make Laws for Church Regiment, but onely keep those Laws which in Scripture they finde made. The plain intent of the Books of Ecclesiastical Discipline is to shew, that men may not devise Laws of Church Government; but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66185:79"/>
are bound for ever to use and to execute onely those, which God himself hath already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised and delivered in the Scripture. The self-same drift the Admonitioners also had, in urging, that nothing ought to be done in the Church, according unto any Law of Mans devising, but all according to that which God in his Word hath commanded. Which not remembring, they gather out of Scripture General Rules to be followed in making Laws; and so in effect they plainly grant, that we our selves may lawfully make Laws for the Church, and are not bound out of Scripture onely to take Laws already made, as they meant who first alledged that principle whereof we speak. One particular Plat-form it is which they respected, and which they labored thereby to force upon all Churches; whereas these general Rules do not let, but that there may well enough be sundry. It is the particular Order established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which thereby they did intend to alter, as being not commanded of God; whereas unto those general Rules they know, we do not defend, that we may hold any thing unconformable. Obscure it is not what meaning they had, who first gave out that grand Axiom; and according unto that meaning, it doth prevail far and wide with the Favorers of that part. Demand of them, wherefore they conform not themselves unto the Order of our Church? and in every particular, their answer for the most part is, <hi>We finde no such thing commanded in the Word.</hi> Whereby they plainly require some special Commandment for that which is exacted at their hands; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they content to have matters of the Church examined by general Rules and Canons. As therefore in controversies between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that which they practise, is many times even according to the very grossness of that which the vulgar sort conceiveth; when that which they teach, to maintain it, is so nice and subtil, that hold can very hardly be taken thereupon: In which cases we should do the Church of God small benefit, by disputing with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the finest points of their dark conveyances, and suffering that sense of their Doctrine to go uncontrouled, wherein by the common sort, it is ordinarily received and practised. So considering what disturbance hath grown in the Church amongst our selves, and how the Authors thereof do commonly build altogether on this as a sure Foundation, <hi>Nothing ought to be established in the Church, which in the Word of God is not commanded:</hi> Were it reason, that we should suffer the same to pass without controulment,<note place="margin">Another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the former Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the meaning thereof is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this sort. All Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders must be commanded in the Word, that is to say. Grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word, and made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, at the least wise unto the general Rules of holy Scripture. As for such things as are found out by any Star or Light of Reason, and are in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect received, so they be not against the Word of God, all such things it holdeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> in that current meaning whereby every where it prevaileth, and stay till some strange construction were made thereof, which no man would lightly have thought on, but being driven thereunto for a shift?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The last refuge in maintaining this Position, is thus to construe it, <hi>Nothing ought to be established in the Church, but that which is commanded in the Word of God</hi>; that is to say, All Church Orders must be <hi>grounded upon the Word of God,</hi> in such sort grounded upon the Word, not, that being sound out by some <hi>Star, or Light of Reason, or Learning, or other help,</hi> they may be received, so they be not against the Word of God, but according at leastwise unto the general Rules of Scripture they must be made. Which is in effect as much as to say, <hi>We know not what to say wel in defence of this Position: And therefore lest we should say it is false, there is no remedy but to say, that in some sense or other it may be true, if we could tell how.</hi> First, that <hi>Scholy</hi> had need of a very favorable Reader, and a tractable, that should think it plain construction, when to be <hi>commanded in the Word,</hi> and <hi>grounded upon the Word,</hi> are made all one. If when a man may live in the state of Matrimony, seeking that good thereby which Nature principally desireth, he make rather choice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary life in regard of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> judgment<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor 7.</note>: That which he doth, is manifestly <hi>grounded</hi> upon the Word of God, yet <hi>not commanded</hi> in his Word, because without breach of any Commandment he might do otherwise. Secondly, whereas no man in Justice and Reason, can be reproved for those actions which are framed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto that known Will of God, whereby they are to be judged, and the Will of God which we are to judge our actions by, no sound Divine in the World ever denied to be in part made manifest even by the Light of Nature, and not by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone: If the Church being directed by the former of these two (which God hath given, who gave the other, that man might in different sort be guided by them both) if the Church, I say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arist.</hi> Polit. 1.</note> do approve and establish that which thereby it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66185:79"/>
judgeth meet, and sindeth not repugnant to any word or syllable of holy Scripture, who shall warrant our presumptuous boldness, controuling herein the Church of Christ? But so it is, the name of the Light of Nature is made hateful with men, the <hi>Star of Reason and Learning,</hi> and all other such like helps, beginneth no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be thought of, then if it were an unlucky Comet; or as if God had so accursed it, that it should never shine or give light in things concerning our duty any way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, but be esteemed as that <hi>Star</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> called <hi>Wormword</hi>;<note place="margin">Apoc. 8. 10.</note> which being faln from Heaven, maketh Rivers and Waters in which it falleth, so bitter, that men tasting them, die thereof. A number there are, who think they cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire as they ought, the power and authority of the Word of God, if in things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine they should attribute any force to Mans reason. For which cause they never use reason so willingly as to disgrace Reason. Their usual and common Discourses are unto this effect. First,<note place="margin">1 Cor 2. 14</note> 
                     <hi>The Natural Man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: For they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually discerned.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Col 2. 8</note> It is not for nothing that St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth charge to <hi>beware of Philosophy,</hi> that is to say, such knowledge as Men by Natural Reason attain unto. Thirdly, Consider them that have from time to time opposed themselves against the Gospel of Christ, and most troubled the Church with Heresie. Have they not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been great admirers of Humane Reason? Hath their deep and profound skill in Secular Learning, made them the more obedient to the Truth, and not armed them rather against it? Fourthly, They that fear God will remember how heavy his sentences are in this case:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will cast away the Understanding of the Prudent. Where is the Wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this World? Hath not God made the Wisdom of this World foolishness? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World by Wisdom know not God: In the Wisdom of God, it pleased God by the foolishness of Preaching to save Believers.</hi> Fifthly, The Word of God in it self is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, exact, and perfect. The Word of God is a two-edged sword; as for the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Natural Reason, they are as the Armor of <hi>Saul,</hi> rather cumbersome about the Soldier of Christ, then needful. They are not of force to do that, which the Apostles of Christ did by the power of the Holy Ghost, <hi>My Preaching,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> therefore saith <hi>Paul, hath not been in the inticing speech of Mans wisdom, but in plain evidence of the Spirit of Power; that your Faith might not be in the Wisdom of men, but in the Power of God.</hi> Sixthly, If I believe the Gospel, there needeth no reasoning about it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me: If I do not believe, it must be the Spirit of God, and not the Reason of Man that shall convert my heart unto him. By these and the like Disputes, an opinion hath spred it self very far in the World; as if the way to be ripe in Faith, were to be raw in Wit and Judgment; as if Reason were an enemy unto Religion, childish sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity the Mother of Ghostly and Divine Wisdom. The cause why such Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prevail so greatly, is, For that men suffer themselves in two respects to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded; one is, that the Wisdom of Man being debased, either in comparison with that of God, or in regard of some special thing, exceeding the reach and compass there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it seemeth to them (not marking so much) as if simply it were condemned; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, That Learning, Knowledge, or Wisdom, falsly so termed, usurping a name whereof they are not worthy; and being under that name controuled, their reproof is by so much the more easily misapplied, and through equivocation, wrested against those things, whereunto so precious names do properly and of right belong. This duly observed, doth to the former Allegations it self make sufficient answer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, for all Mens plainer and fuller satisfaction; First, Concerning the inability of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Reason, to search out, and to judge of things Divine, if they be such as those proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God, and those duties of Men towards him, which may be conceived by atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive consideration of Heaven and Earth; We know that of meer Natural Men, the Apostle testifieth, <hi>How they knew both God, and the Law of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.31.</note> Other things of God there be, which are neither so found, nor though they be shewed, can ever be approved without the special operation of Gods good Grace and Spirit. Of such things sometime spake the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> declaring how Christ had called him to be a Witness of his Death and Resurrection from the Dead, according to that which the Prophets and <hi>Moses</hi> had foreshewed. <hi>Festus,</hi> a meer Natural man, an Infidel,<note place="margin">Acts 25. 19.</note> a <hi>Roman</hi>; one whose ears were unacquainted with such matter, heard him, but could
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66185:80"/>
not reach unto that whereof he spake; the suffering,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 24.</note> and the rising of Christ from the dead, he rejected as idle superstitious fancies, not worth the hearing. The Apostle that knew them by the Spirit, and spake of them with Power of the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">I Cor. 2. 14</note> seemed in his eyes but learnedly mad. Which example maketh manifest what els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the same Apostle teacheth, namely, that Nature hath need of Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> I hope we are not opposit, by holding, that Grace hath use of Nature. Secondly, Philosophy we are warned to take heed of; not that Philosophy, which is true and sound Knowledge, attained by Natural discourse of Reason; but that Philosophy, which to bolster Heresie or Error, casteth a fraudulent shew of Reason upon things which are indeed unreasonable; and by that mean, as by a stratagem, spoileth the simple which are not able to withstand such cunning.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Take heed lest any spoil you through Philosophy, and vain deceit.</hi> He that exhorteth to beware of an enemies policy, doth not give counsel to be impolitick; but rather to use all prudent foresight and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, lest our simplicity be over-reached by cunning sleights. The way not to be inveighled by them that are so guileful through skill, is throughly to be instructed in that which maketh skilful against guile, and to be armed with that true and sincere Philosophy, which doth teach against that deceitful and vain, which spoileth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> But many great Philosophers have been very unsound in belief; and many sound in belief, have been also great Philosophers. Could Secular Knowledge bring the one sort unto the love of Christian Faith? Nor Christian Faith, the other sort out of love with Secular Knowledge. The harm that Hereticks did, they did it unto such as were unable to discern between sound and deceitful reasoning; and the remedy against it, was ever the skill which the Ancient Fathers had to discry and discover such deceit. Insomuch, that <hi>Cresconius</hi> the Heretick complained greatly of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> as being too full of Logical subtilties. Heresie prevaileth onely by a counterfeit shew of Reason; whereby notwithstanding it becometh invincible, unless it be convicted of Fraud by manifest Remonstrance, clearly true, and unable to be withstood. When therefore the Apostle requireth hability to convict Hereticks,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9, 11.</note> can we think he judgeth it a thing unlawful, and not rather needful to use the Principal Instrument of their Conviction, the Light of Reason? It may not be denied, but that in the Fathers writings, there are sundry sharp invectives against Hereticks, even for their very Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical reasonings. The cause whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi> confesseth, not to have been any dislike conceived against the kinde of such reasonings, but the end.<note place="margin">Tert. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Carnis.</note> 
                     <hi>We may</hi> (saith he) <hi>even in matters of God, be made wiser by Reasons drawn from the Publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions which are grafted in Mens mindes; So they be used to further the Truth, not to bolster Error, so they make with, not against that which God hath determined. For there are some things even known by Nature, as the Immortality of the Soul to many, our God unto all. I will therefore my self also, use the sentence of some such as</hi> Plato, <hi>pronouncing every Soul Immortal. I my self too will use the secret acknowledgment of the communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bearing Record of the God of gods: But when I hear men alledge, That which is dead, is dead; and, While thou art alive, be alive; and, After death an end of all, even of death it self: Then will I call to minde both, that the heart of the people with God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted dust, and that the very Wisdom of the World, is pronounced Folly. If then an Heretick flie also unto such vicious, popular, and secular conceits, my answer unto him shall be; Thou Heretick, avoid the Heathen, although in this ye be one, that ye both belie God; yet thou that dost his under the Name of Christ, differest from the Heathen, in that thou seemest to thy self a Christian. Leave him therefore his conceits, seeing that neither will be learn thine. Why dost thou, having sight, trust to a blind guide? Thou which hast put on Christ, take raiment of him that is naked? If the Apostle have armed thee, why dost thou borrow a strangers shield? Let him rather learn of thee to acknowledge, then thou of him to renounce the Resurrection of the Flesh.</hi> In a word, the Catholick Fathers did good unto all by that Knowledge, whereby Hereticks hindering the Truth in many, might have furthered therewith themselves; but that obstinately following their own ambitious, or otherwise corrupted affections, instead of framing their wills to maintain that which Reason taught, they bent their wits to finde how Reason might seem to teach that which their Wills were set to maintain. For which cause the Apostle saith of them justly, that they are for the most part <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> men condemned even in, and of themselves. For though they be not all perswaded, that it is truth which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66185:80"/>
they withstand; yet that to be error which they uphold, they might undoubtedly the sooner a great deal attain to know, but that their study is more to defend what once they have stood in, then to finde out sincerely and simply, what truth they ought to persist in for ever. Fourthly, there is in the World no kinde of knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> any part of Truth is seen, but we justly account it precious; yea, that Principal Truth, in comparison whereof, all other knowledge is vile, may receive from it some kinde of light; whether it be that <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Caldean</hi> wisdom, Mathematical, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were furnished; or that Natural, Moral,<note place="margin">Acts 7. 22. Dan. 1. 17. 1 Kings 4. 29, 30. Acts 22. 13.</note> and Civil wisdom wherewith <hi>Solomon</hi> excelled all Men; or that Rational and Oratorial wisdom of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> brought from <hi>Tarsus</hi>; or that Judaical, which he learned in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> sitting at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> To detract from the dignity thereof, were to injure even God himself, who being that Light which none can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto, hath sent out these lights whereof we are capable, even as so many sparkles resembling the Bright Fountain from which they rise. But there are that bear the title of Wisemen, and Scribes, and great Disputers of the World, and are nothing indeed less then what in shew they most appear. These being wholy addicted unto their own wills, use their wit, their learning, and all the wisdom they have, to maintain that which their obstinate hearts are delighted with, esteeming in the frantick error of their mindes, the greatest madness in the World to be Wisdom, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Wisdom foolishness. Such were both Jews and Grecians which professed, the one sort Legal, and the other Secular skill, neither enduring to be taught the Mystery of Christ: Unto the glory of whose most blessed Name, who so study to use both their Reason, and all other Gifts, as well which Nature, as which Grace hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them with; let them never doubt, but that the same God, who is to destroy and confound utterly that wisdom falsly so named in others, doth make reckoning of them as of true Scribes; Scribes by Wisdom instructed to the Kingdom of Heaven;<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 52.</note> Scribes against that Kingdom, hardned in a vain opinion of Wisdom; which in the end being proved folly, must needs perish; true Understanding, Knowledge, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Reason, continuing for evermore. Fifthly, Unto the Word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> in respect of that end for which God ordained it, perfect, exact, and absolute in it self, we do not add Reason as a Supplement of any maim or defect therein, but as a necessary Instrument, without which, we could not reap by the Scriptures perfection, that fruit and benefit which it yieldeth. The Word of God is a two-edged sword,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> put in the hands of reasonable men; and Reason as the weapon that flew <hi>Goliah,</hi> if they be as <hi>David</hi> was that use it. Touching the Apostles, he which gave them from above such Power for miraculous confirmation of that which they taught, endued them also with Wisdom from above, to teach that which they so did confirm. Our Saviour made choice of Twelve simple and unlearned Men, that the greater their lack of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wisdom was, the more admirable that might appear which God supernaturally endued them with from Heaven. Such therefore as knew the poor and silly estate wherein they had lived, could not but wonder to hear the Wisdom of their speech, and be so much the more attentive unto their teaching. They studied for no Tongue they spake withal; of themselves they were rude, and knew not so much as how to premeditate; the Spirit gave them speech and cloquent utterance: But because with St. <hi>Paul</hi> it was otherwise, then with the rest, in as much as he never conversed with Christ upon Earth as they did; and his education had been scholastical altogether, which theirs was not: Hereby occasion was taken by certain Malignants, secretly to undermine his great Authority in the Church of Christ, as though the Gospel had been taught him by others, then by Christ himself, and as if the cause of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles conversion and belief, through his means, had been the learning and skill which he had by being conversant in their Books, which thing made them so willing to hear him, and him so able to perswade them; whereas the rest of the Apostles prevailed, because God was with them, and by a miracle from Heaven confirmed his Word in their mouths. They were mighty in deeds: As for him, being absent, his Writings had some force; in presence, his Power not like unto theirs. In sum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Preaching, their very by-word was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>addle speech, empty talk.</hi> His Writings full of great words, but in the Power of miraculous Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; His presence, not like the rest of the Apostles. Hereupon it ariseth, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66185:81"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was so often driven to make his Apologies. Hereupon it ariseth, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever time he had spent in the study of Humane Learning, he maketh earnest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation to them of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that the Gospel which he had preached amongst them, did not by other means prevail with them, then with others the same Gospel taught by the rest of the Apostles of Christ.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>My Preaching,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath not been in the perswasive speeches of Humane Wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of Power; that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the Power of God.</hi> What is it which the Apostle doth here deny? Is it denied that his speech amongst them had been <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive?</hi> No; for of him the sacred History plainly restifieth,<note place="margin">Acts 18. 4. 11.</note> that for the space of a year and a half, he spake in their Synagogue every Sabbath, and <hi>perswaded</hi> both Jews and Grecians. How then is the speech of men made perswasive? Surely there can be but two ways to bring this to pass, the one Humane, the other Divine. Either St. <hi>Paul</hi> did onely by art and natural industry cause his own speech to be credited; or else God by miracle did authorise it, and so bring credit thereunto, as to the speech of the rest of the Apostles. Of which two, the former he utterly denieth. For why? If the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rest had been effectual by miracle, his onely by force of his own learning; so great inequality between him and the other Apostles in this thing, had been enough to subvert their Faith. For might they not with reason have thought, that if he were sent of God, as well as they, God would not have furnished them and not him, with the power of the Holy Ghost? Might not a great part of them, being simple haply have feared, lest their assent had been cunningly gotten unto his doctrine, rather through the weakness of their own wits, then the certainty of that Truth which he had taught them? How unequal had it been, that all Believers through the Preaching of other Apostles, should have their Faith strongly built upon the evidence of Gods own miraculous approbation; and they whom he had converted, should have their perswasion built onely upon his skill and wisdom who perswaded them? As therefore calling from men may authorise us to teach, although it could not authorise him to teach as other Apostles did: So although the wisdom of man had not been sufficient to enable him such a Teacher as the rest of the Apostles were, unless Gods miracles had strengthned both the one and the others Doctrine; yet unto our ability, both of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and learning the Truth of Christ, as we are but meer Christian men, it is not a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> little which the wisdom of man may add. Sixthly, Yea, whatsoever our hearts be to God and to his Truth, believe we, or be we as yet faithless, for our Conversion or Confirmation, the force of Natural Reason is great. The force whereof unto those effects, is nothing without grace. What then? To our purpose it is sufficient, that whosoever doth serve, honor, and obey God, whosoever believeth in him; that man would no more do this then innocents and infants do, but for the Light of Natural Reason that shineth in him, and maketh him apt to apprehend those things of God, which being by grace discovered, are effectual to perswade reasonable mindes, and none other, that honor, obedience, and credit, belong aright unto God. No man cometh unto God to offer him Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Reb. 11. 16.</note> to pour out Supplications and Prayers before him, or to do him any service, which doth not first believe him both to be, and to be a rewarder of them who in such sort seek unto him. Let men be taught this either by Revelation from Heaven, or by Instruction upon Earth; by Labor, Study, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or by the onely secret Inspiration of the Holy Ghost; whatsoever the mean be they know it by, if the knowledge thereof were possible without discourse of Natural Reason; why should none be found capable thereof but onely men, nor men till such time as they come unto ripe and full ability to work by reasonable understanding? The whole drift of the Scripture of God, what is it, but onely to teach Theology? Theology, what is it, but the Science of things Divine? What Science an be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto, without the help of Natural Discourse and Reason?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Iudge you of that which I speak,</hi> saith the Apostle. In vain it were to speak any thing of God, but that by Reason. Men are able somewhat to judge of that they hear, and by discourse to discern how consonant it is to Truth. Scripture indeed teacheth things above Nature, things which our Reason by it self could not reach unto. Yet those things also we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. knowing by Reason, that the Scripture is the Word of God. In the presence of <hi>Festus,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> and of King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a Jew, St. <hi>Paul</hi> omitting the one, who neither knew the Jews Religion, not the Books whereby they were taught it, speaks

unto the other of things foreshewed by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and performed in Jesus Christ, intending thereby to prove himself so unjustly accused, that unless his Judges did condemn both <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, him they could not chuse but acquit, who taught onely that fulfilled, which they so long since had foretold. His cause was easie to be discerned; what was done, their eyes were witnesses; what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did speak, their Books could quickly shew: It was no hard thing for him to compare them, which knew the one, and believed the other.<note place="margin">Acts 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>believest thou the Prophets? I know thou dost.</hi> The question is, how the Books of the Prophets came to be credited of King <hi>Agrippa.</hi> For what with him did authorise the Prophets, the like with us doth cause the rest of the Scripture of God to be of credit. Because we maintain, That in Scripture we are taught all things necessary unto Salvation; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon very childishly it is by some demanded, What Scripture can teach us the Sacred Authority of the Scripture, upon the knowledge whereof our whole Faith and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation dependeth? As though there were any kinde of Science in the World, which leadeth men unto knowledge, without presupposing a number of things already known. No Science doth make known the first Principles whereon it buildeth; but they are always either taken as plain and manifest in themselves, or as proved and granted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, some former knowledge having made them evident. Scripture teacheth all supernaturally revealed Truth; without the knowledge whereof, Salvation cannot be attained. The main principal whereupon, our belief of all things therein contained, dependeth, is, That the Scriptures are the Oracles of God himself. This in it self we cannot say is evident. For then all men that hear it, would acknowledge it in heart, as they do when they hear that <hi>every whole is more then any part of that whole,</hi> because this in it self is evident. The other we know, that all do not acknowledge when they hear it. There must be therefore some former knowledge presupposed, which doth herein assure the hearts of all Believers. Scripture teacheth us that saving Truth which God hath discovered unto the World by Revelation; and it presumeth us taught otherwise, that it self is Divine and Sacred. The question then being, By what means we are taught this: some answer, That to learn it we have no other way then onely Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as namely, that so we believe, because both we from our Predecessors, and they from theirs have so received. But is this enough? That which all mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth them, may not in any wise be denied. And by experience we all know, that the first outward Motive leading men so to esteem of the Scripture, is the authority of Gods Church. For when we know the whole Church of God hath that opinion of the Scripture, we judge it even at the first an impudent thing for any man bred and brought up in the Church, to be of a contrary minde without cause. Afterwards the more we bestow our labor in reading or hearing the Mysteries thereof, the more we finde that the thing it self doth answer our received opinion concerning it. So that the former enducement prevailing somewhat with us before, doth now much more prevail, when the very thing hath Ministred further Reason. If Infidels or Atheists chance at any time to call it in question, this giveth us occasion to sift what reason there is, whereby the testimony of the Church concerning Scripture, and our own perswasion which Scripture it self hath confirmed, may be proved a truth infallible. In which case the ancient Fathers being often constrained to shew, what warrant they had so much to relie upon the Scriptures, endeavored still to maintain the authority of the Books of God by Arguments, such as unbelievers themselves must needs think reasonable, if they judged thereof as they should. Neither is it a thing impossible, or greatly heard, even by such kinde of proofs so to manifest and clear that point, that no man living shall be able to deny it, without denying some apparent Principle, such as all men acknowledge to be true. Wherefore if I believe the Gospel, yet is reason of singular use, for that it confirmeth me in this my belief the more: If I do not as yet believe, nevertheless to bring me into the number of Believers, except Reason did somewhat help, and were an Instrument which God doth use unto such purposes, what should it boot to dispute with Infidels, or godless persons for their conversion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion in that point? Neither can I think that, when grave and learned men do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hold, that of this Principle there is no proof but by the testimony of the Spirit, which assureth our hearts therein, it is their meaning to exclude utterly all force which any kinde of Reason may have in that behalf; but I rather incline to interpret such
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66185:82"/>
their speeches, as if they had more expresly set down, that other motives and enduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be they never so strong and consonant unto Reason, are notwithstanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual of themselves to work Faith concerning this Principle, if the special Grace of the Holy Ghost concur not to the enlightning of our mindes. For otherwise, I doubt not but men of wisdom and judgment will grant, That the Church in this point espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is furnished with Reason, to stop the mouths of her impious Adversaries; and that, as it were altogether bootless to alledge against them, what the Spirit hath taught us, so likewise, that even to our own selves it needeth Caution and Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how the testimony of the Spirit may be discerned, by what means it may be known, lest men think that the Spirit of God doth testifie those things which the spirit of error suggesteth. The operations of the Spirit, especially these ordinary which be common unto all true Christian men, are, as we know, things secret and undiscernable even to the very soul where they are, because their nature is of another, and an higher kinde, then that they can be by us perceived in this life. Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Spirit lead us into all truth, and direct us in all goodness; yet because these workings of the Spirit in us, are so privy and secret, we theresore stand on a plainer ground, when we gather by Reason from the quality of things believed or done, that the Spirit of God hath directed us in both, then if we settle our selves to believe, or to do any certain particular thing, as being moved thereto by the Spirit. But of this enough.<note place="margin">Acts 13. 36. &amp; 2. 34.</note> To go from the Books of Scripture, to the sense and meaning thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sentences which are by the Apostles recited out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> to prove the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, did not prove it, if so be the Prophet <hi>David</hi> meant them of himself: This Exposition therefore they plainly disprove, and shew by manifest Reason, that of <hi>David</hi> the words of <hi>David</hi> could not possibly be meant. Exclude the use of Natural reasoning about the sense of holy Scripture, concerning the Articles of our Faith, and then that the Scripture doth concern the Articles of our Faith, who can assure us?

Is it possible they should both believe, and be able without the use of Reason, to render a Reason of their belief, a Reason sound and sufficient to answer them that demand it, be they of the same Faith with us, or enemies thereunto? May we cause our Faith without Reason, to appear reasonable in the eyes of men? This being required even of Learners in the School of Christ, the duty of their Teachers in bringing them unto such ripeness, must needs be somewhat more then onely to read the Sentences of Scripture, and then Paraphrastically to scholy them, to vary them with sundry Forms of speech, without arguing or disputing about any thing which they contain. This method of teaching, may commend it self unto the World, by that easiness and facility which is in it; but a Law or a Pattern it is not, as some do imagine, for all men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that will do good in the Church of Christ. Our Lord and Saviour himself did hope by disputation to do some good, yea, by disputation not onely of, but against the truth, albeit with purpose for the truth. That Christ should be the Son of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 43.</note> was truth, yet against this truth, our Lord in the Gospel objecteth, If Christ be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> how doth <hi>David</hi> call him Lord? There is as yet no way known how to dispute, or to determine of things disputed, without the use of Natural Reason. If we please to adde unto Christ their example, who followed him as near in all things as they could, the Sermon of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> set down in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the people would have offered unto them Sacrifice; in that Sermon, what is there, but onely Natural Reason to disprove their act?<note place="margin">Acts 13. 15.</note>

as unto you.</hi> The light therefore, which the Star of Natural Reason and Wisdom cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is too bright to be obscured by the mist of a word or two, uttered to diminish that opinion which justly hath been received concerning the force and vertue thereof, even in matters that touch most nearly the principal duties of men, and the glory of the Eternal God. In all which hitherto hath been spoken, touching the force and use of Mans Reason in things Divine, I must crave, that I be not so understood or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, as if any such thing, by vertue thereof, could be done without the aid and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods most blessed Spirit. The thing we have handled according to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moved about it; which question is, Whether the Light of Reason be so pernicious, that in devising Laws for the Church, men ought not by it to search what may be fit and convenient? For this cause therefore we have endeavored to make it appear, how in the Nature of Reason it self, there is no impediment, but that the self-same Spirit which revealeth the things that God hath set down in his Law, may also be thought to aid and direct men in finding out by the Light of Reason, what Laws are expedient to be made for the guiding of his Church, over and besides them that are in Scripture. Herein therefore we agree with those men, by whom Humane Laws are defined to be Ordinances, which such as have lawful Authority given them for that purpose, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably draw from the Laws of Nature and God, by discourse of Reason, aided with the influence of Divine Grace: And for that cause, it is not said amiss touching Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons,<note place="margin">

For although it were in vain to make Laws which the Scripture hath already made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause what we are already there commanded to do, on our parts there resteth nothing but onely that it be executed; yet because both in that which we are commanded, it concerneth the duty of the Church by Law to provide, that the loosness and slackness of men may not cause the Commandments of God to be unexecuted; and a number of things there are, for which the Scripture hath not provided by any Law, but left them unto the careful discretion of the Church; we are to search how the Church in these cases may be well directed, to make that provision by Laws which is most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and fit. And what is so in these cases, partly Scripture, and partly Reason must teach to discern. Scripture comprehending Examples and Laws; Laws, some Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and some Positive; Examples neither are there for all cases which require Laws to be made, and when they are, they can but direct as Precedents onely. Natural Laws direct in such sort, that in all things we must for ever do according unto them; Positive so, that against them, in no case, we may do any thing, as long as the Will of God is, that they should remain in force. Howbeit, when Scripture doth yield us Precedents, how far forth they are to be followed; when it giveth Natural Laws, what particular order is thereunto most agreeable; when Positive, which way to make Laws unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant unto them; yea, though all these should want, yet what kinde of Ordinances would be most for that good of the Church which is aimed at, all this must be by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son found out.

And the truth is, that all our controversie in this cause concerning the Orders of the Church,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66185:83"/>
is, What particulars the Church may appoint. That which doth finde them out, is the force of Mans Reason. That which doth guide and direct his Reason, is first, the general Law of Nature; which Law of Nature, and the Moral Law of Scripture, are in the substance of Law all one. But because there are also in Scripture a number of Laws particular and positive, which being in force, may not by any Law of Man be violated, we are in making Laws to have thereunto an especial eye. As for example, it might perhaps seem reasonable unto the Church of God, following the general Laws concerning the nature of Marriage, to ordain in particular that Cosin-Germans shall not marry. Which Law notwithstanding ought not to be received in the Church, if there should be in the Scripture a Law particular to the contrary, forbidding utterly the Bonds of Marriage to be so far forth abridged. The same <hi>Thomas</hi> therefore, whose definition of Humane Laws we mentioned before, doth add thereunto this Caution concerning the Rule and Canon whereby to make them:<note place="margin">1.2. Quest 95. Act 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Humane Laws are Measures</hi> in respect of Men, whose actions they must direct; howbeit such Measures they are, as have also their higher Rules to be measured by, <hi>Which Rules are two, the Law of God, and the Law of Nature.</hi> So that Laws Humane must be made according to the General Laws of Nature, and without contradiction unto any Positive Law in Scripture; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are ill made. Unto Laws thus made and received by a whole Church, they which live within the bosom of that Church, must not think it a matter indifferent, either to yield, or not to yield obedience. Is it a small offence to despise the Church of God?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Let us not say we keep the Commandments of the one, when we break the Law of the other: For unless we observe both, we obey neither. And what doth let, but that we may observe both, when they are not the one to the other in any sort repugnant? For of such Laws onely we speak, as being made in form and manner already declared, can have in them no contradiction unto the Laws of Almighty God. Yea, that which is more, the Laws thus made, God himself doth in such sort authorize; that to despise them, is to despise in them him. It is a loose and licentious opinion which the Anabaptists have embraced, holding, That a Christian Mans liberty is lost, and the Soul which Christ hath redeemed unto himself, injuriously drawn into servitude under the yoke of Humane Power, if any Law be now imposed besides the Gospel of Jesus Christ: In obedience whereunto the Spirit of God, and not the constraint of man is to lead us, according to that of the blessed Apostle, <hi>Such as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> and not such as live in thraldom unto men. Their judgment is therefore, that the Church of Christ should admit no Law-Makers, but the Evangelists. The Author of that which causeth another thing to be, is Author of that thing also which thereby is caused. The light of Natural Understanding, Wit, and Reason, is from God;<note place="margin">John 1. 5.</note> he it is which thereby doth illuminate every man entring into the World. If there proceed from us any thing afterwards corrupt and naught, the Mother thereof is our own dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, neither doth it proceed from any such cause whereof God is the Author. He is the Author of all that we think or do, by vertue of that Light which himself hath given. And therefore the Laws which the very Heathens did gather to direct their actions by, so far forth as they proceed from the Light of Nature, God himself doth acknowledge to have proceeded even from himself,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 6. &amp; 2. 15</note> and that he was the Writer of them in the Tables of their Hearts. How much more then is he the Author of those Laws which have been made by his Saints, endued further with the Heavenly Grace of his Spirit, and directed as much as might be with such instructions as his Sacred Word doth yield? Surely, if we have unto those Laws, that dutiful regard which their Dignity doth require, it will not greatly need, that we should be exhorted to live in obedience unto them.

Wherein we are to note, that this question about the changing of Laws, concerneth onely such Laws as are Positive, and do make that now good or evil, by being commanded or forbidden, which otherwise of it self were not simply, the one or the other. Unto such Laws it is expresly sometimes added, how long they are to continue in force. If this be no where exprest, then have we no light to direct our judgments, concerning the changeableness or immutability of them, but by considering the nature and quality of such Laws. The nature of every Law must be judged of by the end for which it was made, and by the aptness of things therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto the same end. It may so fall out, that the reason why some Laws of God were given, is neither opened, nor possible to be gathered by the Wit of Man. As why God should forbid <hi>Adam</hi> that one Tree, there was no way for <hi>Adam</hi> ever to have certainly understood. And at <hi>Adams</hi> ignorance of this point Satan took advantage, urging the more securely a false cause, because the true was unto <hi>Adam</hi> unknown. Why the Jews were forbidden to Plough their Ground with an Ox and an Ass;<note place="margin">Deut. 22. 10, 11.</note> why to cloath themselves with mingled attire of Wooll and Linnen, it was both unto them, and to us it remaineth obscure. Such Laws perhaps cannot be abrogated, saving onely by whom they were made; because the intent of them being known unto none but the Author, he alone can judge how long it is requisite they should endure. But if the reason why things were instituted may be known, and being known, do appear manifestly to be of perpetual necessity; then are those things also perpetual, unless they cease to be effectual unto that purpose, for which they were at the first instituted. Because when a thing doth cease to be available unto the end which gave it being, the continuance of it must then of necessity appear superfluous. And of this we cannot be ignorant, how sometimes that hath done great good which afterwards when time hath changed the ancient course of things, doth grow to be either very hurtful, or not so greatly profitable and necessary. If therefore, the end for which a Law provideth, be perpetually necessary, and the way whereby it provideth perpetually also most apt, no doubt but that every such Law ought for ever to remain unchangeable. Whether God be the Author of Laws, by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising that power of men whereby they are made, or by delivering them made immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from himself, by word onely, or in writing also, or howsoever; notwithstanding the Authority of their Maker, the mutability of that end for which they are made, maketh them also changeable. The Law of Ceremonies came from God. <hi>Moses</hi> had commandment to commit it unto the Sacred Records of Scripture, where it continueth even unto this very day and hour, in force still as the Jew surmiseth, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was Author of it; and for us to abolish what he hath established, were presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most intolerable.<note place="margin">Quod pro ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesirate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris Slatutum est. ressante nece. litate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet cessare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter quod ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebar. 1.q. 1.</note> But (that which they in the blindness of their obdurate hearts are not able to discern) sith the end for which that Law was ordained, is now fulfilled, past, and gone; how should it but cease any longer to be, which hath no longer any cause of being in force as before? <hi>That which necessity of some special time doth cause to be enjoyned, bindeth no longer, then during that time, but doth afterward become free.</hi> Which thing is also plain, even by that Law which the Apostles assembled at the Council of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> did from thence deliver unto the Church of Christ; the Preface whereof to authorise it, was,<note place="margin">Quod prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessit.

                     <hi>To the Holy Ghost, and to us it hath seemed good:</hi> Which style they did not use as matching themselves in Power with the Holy Ghost, but as testifying the Holy Ghost to be the Author, and themselves, but onely Utterers of that Decree. This Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue proceeded from God as the Author thereof, no faithful man will deny. It was of God, not onely because God gave them the power whereby they might make Laws, but for that it proceeded even from the holy Motion and Suggestion of that secret Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, whose sentence they did but onely pronounce. Notwithstanding, as the Law of Ceremonies delivered unto the Jews, so this very Law which the Gentiles received from the Mouth of the Holy Ghost, is in like respect abrogated by decease of the end for which it was given.<note place="margin">Countery. p. 8.</note> But such as do not stick at this point, such as grant that what hath been instituted upon any special cause, needeth not to be observed, that cause ceasing, do notwithstanding herein fail; they judge the Laws of God onely by the Author and main end for which they were made, so that for us to change that which he hath established, they hold it execrable pride and presumption, if so be the end and purpose for which God by that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66185:84"/>
mean provideth, be permanent. And upon this they ground those ample Disputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Orders and Offices, which being by him appointed for the Government of his Church, if it be necessary always that the Church of Christ be governed, then doth the end for which God provided, remain still; and therefore in those means which he by Law did establish as being fittest unto that end, for us to alter any thing, is to lift up our selves against God, and as it were to countermand him. Wherein they mark not, that Laws are Instruments to rule by, and that Instruments are not onely to be framed according unto the general end for which they are provided, but even according unto that very particular which riseth out of the matter whereon they have to work. The end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Laws were made may be permanent, and those Laws nevertheless require some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, if there be any unfitness in the means which they prescribe as tending unto that end and purpose. As for example, a Law that to bridle theft, doth punish Theeves with a quadruple restitution, hath an end which will continue as long as the World it self continueth. Theft will be always, and will always need to be bridled. But that the mean which this Law provideth for that end, namely, the punishment of quadruple restitution, that this will be always sufficient to bridle and restrain that kinde of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, no man can warrant. Insufficiency of Laws doth sometimes come by want of judgment in the Makers. Which cause cannot fall into any Law termed properly and immediately Divine, as it may and doth into Humane Laws often. But that which hath been once most sufficient, may wax otherwise by alteration of time and place; that punishment which hath been sometimes forcible to bridle sin, may grow afterwards too week and feeble. In a word, we plainly perceive by the difference of those three Laws which the Jews received at the hands of God, the Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial, that if the end for which, and the matter according whereunto God maketh his Laws, continue always one and the same, his Laws also do the like, for which cause the Moral Law cannot be altered. Secondly, That whether the Matter whereon Laws are made, continue or continue not, if their end have once ceased, they cease also to be of force; as in the Law Ceremonial it fareth. Finally, That albeit the end continue, as in that Law of Theft specified, and in a great part of those ancient Judicials it doth; yet for as much as there is not in all respects the same subject or matter remaining, for which they were first instituted, even this is sufficient cause of change. And therefore Laws, though both ordained of God himself, and the end for which they were ordained, continuing, may notwithstanding cease, it by alteration of persons or times, they be found unsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to attain unto that end. In which respect, why may we not presume, that God doth even call for such change or alteration, as the very condition of things themselves doth make necessary? They which do therefore plead the Authority of the Law-maker, as an argument wherefore it should not be lawful to change that which he hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and will have this the cause why all the Ordinances of our Saviour are immutable; they which urge the Wisdom of God as a proof, that whatsoever Laws he hath made, they ought to stand, unless himself from Heaven proclaim them disannulled, because it is not in man to correct the Ordinance of God; may know, if it please them to take notice thereof, that we are far from presuming to think that men can better any thing which God hath done, even as we are from thinking that men should presume to undo some things of men, which God doth know they cannot better. God never ordained any thing that could be bettered. Yet many things he hath, that have been changed, and that for the better. That which succeedeth as better now when change is requisite, had been worse, when that which now is changed was instituted. Otherwise God had not then left this to chuse that, neither would now reject that to chuse this, were it not for some new-grown occasion, making that which hath been betterworse. In this case therefore men do not presume to change Gods Ordinance, but they yield thereunto,<note place="margin">We offer to shew the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to be a part of the Gospel, and therefore to have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cause; so that in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of the Discipline, the Gospel receives a check. And again, I speak of the Discipline as of a part of the Gospel; and therefore neither under nor above the Gospel, but the Gospel. <hi>T. C.</hi> l. 1. p. 14. <hi>Tert.</hi> De Veland. Virg. Mart. n 1. Sam. 14. Acts 15.</note> requiring it self to be changed. Against this it is objected, that to abrogate or innovate the Gospel of Christ, if Men or Angels should attempt, it were most heinous and cursed sacriledge. And the Gospel, as they say, containeth not onely doctrine instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men how they should believe, but also Precepts concerning the Regiment of the Church. Discipline therefore is a part of the Gospel, and God being the Author of the whole Gospel, as well of Discipline as of Doctrine, it cannot be but that both of them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66185:84"/>
have a Common Cause. So that as we are to believe for ever the Articles of Evangelical Doctrine, so the Precepts of Discipline we are in like sort bound for ever to observe. Touching Points of Doctrine, as for example, the Unity of God, the Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Salvation by Christ, the Resurrection of the Body, Life Everlasting, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and such like, they have been since the first hour that there was a Church in the World, and till the last they must be believed: But as for Matters of Regiment, they are for the most part of another nature. To make new Articles of Faith and Doctrine, no Man thinketh it lawful; new Laws of Government, what Commonwealth or Church is there which maketh not either at one time or another? <hi>The Rule of Faith,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian, is but one, and that alone immoveable, and impossible to be framed or cast a new.</hi> The Law of outward Order and Polity not so. There is no reason in the World wherefore we should esteem it as necessary always to do, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to believe the same things; seeing every man knoweth, that the Matter of Faith is constant, the Matter contrariwise of Action daily changeable, especially the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Action belonging unto Church Polity. Neither can I finde that Men of sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est judgment have any otherwise taught, then that Articles of Belief, and things which all men must of necessity do, to the end they may be saved, are either expresly set down in Scripture, or else plainly thereby to be gathered. But touching things which belong to Discipline and outward Polity, the Church hath Authority to make Canons, Laws and Decrees, even as we read, that in the Apostles times it did.<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> Which kinde of Laws (for as much as they are not in themselves necessary to Salvation) may after they are made, be also changed as the difference of times or places shall require. Yea, it is not denied, I am sure, by themselves, that certain things in Discipline are of that nature, as they may be varied by times, places, persons, and other the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. Whereupon I demand, are those changeable Points of Discipline commanded in the Word of God, or no? If they be not commanded, and yet may be received in the Church, how can their former Position stand, condemning all things in the Church, which in the Word are not commanded? If they be commanded, and yet may suffer change: How can this latter stand, affirming all things immutable which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God? Their distinction touching Matters of Substance and of Circumstance, though true, will not serve. For be they great things, or be they small, if God have commanded them in the Gospel, and his commanding them in the Gospel do make them unchangeable, there is no reason we should more change the one, then we may the other. If the Authority of the Maker do prove unchangeableness in the Laws which God hath made, then must all Laws which he hath made, be necessarily for ever permanent, though they be out of Circumstance onely, and not of Substance. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that neither Gods being Author of Laws for Government of his Church, nor his committing them unto Scripture, is any reason sufficient, wherefore all Churches should for ever be bound to keep them without change. But of one thing we are here to give them warning by the way: For whereas in this Discourse, we have oftentimes profest, that many parts of Discipline or Church Polity are delivered in Scripture, they may perhaps imagine that we are driven to confess their Discipline to be delivered in Scripture; and that having no other means to avoid it, we are in fain to argue for the changeableness of Laws ordained even by God himself, as if otherwise theirs of necessity should take place, and that under which we live be abandoned. There is no remedy therefore, but to abate this Error in them, and directly to let them know, that if they fall into any such conceit, they do but a little flatter their own cause. As for us, we think in no respect so highly of it. Our perswasion is, that no age ever had knowledge of it, but onely ours; that they which defend it, devised it; that neither Christ nor his Apostles, at any time taught it, but the contrary. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did seek to maintain that which most advantageth our own cause, the very best way for us, and the strongest against them, were to hold even as they do, that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there must needs be found some particular Form of Church Polity which God hath instituted, and which <note n="*" place="margin">Disciplina est Christianae Ecclesae Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, à Den cius re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit therefore we do not finde any cause, why of right there should be necessarily an Immutable Form set down in holy Scripture; nevertheless, if indeed there have been at any time a Church Polity so set down, the change whereof the sacred Scripture doth forbid; surely for Men to alter those Laws which God for perpetuity hath established, were presumption most intolerable.

An Heathen Philosopher there is, who considering how many things Beasts have, which Men have not, how naked in comparison of them, how impotent, and how much less able we are to shift for our selves a long time after we enter into this World, repiningly concluded hereupon, that Nature being a careful Mother for them, is towards us a hard-hearted Step-dame. No, we may not measure the affection of our gracious God towards his by such differences. For even herein shineth his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that though the ways of his Providence be many, yet the end which he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all at the length unto, is one and the self-same.

Contrariwise the Laws of Christ, we finde rather mentioned by occasion in the writings of the Apostles, then any solemn thing directly written to comprehend them in legal sort. Again, the Positive Laws which <hi>Moses</hi> gave, they were given for the greatest part, with restraint to the Land of <hi>Iury: Behold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 5.</note> saith <hi>Moses, I have taught you Ordinances and Laws, as the Lord my God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, that ye should do so even within the Land whither ye go to possess it.</hi> Which Laws and Ordinances Positive, he plainly distinguished afterward from the Laws of the Two Tables which were Moral.<note place="margin">Vers. 12, 13, 14.</note>

And the Lord commanded me that same time, that I should teach you Ordinances and Laws which ye should observe in the Land, whither ye go to possess it.</hi> The same difference is again set down in the next Chapter following.

                     <hi>These words the Lord spake unto all your multitude in the Mount, out of the midst of the fire, the cloud and the darkness, with a great voice, and added no more, and wrote them upon two Tables of Stone, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto me.</hi> But concerning other Laws, the people give their consent to receive them at the hands of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                     <hi>I have heard the voice of the words of this people; they have spoken well. O that there were such an heart in them to fear me, and to keep all my Commandments always, that it might go well with them, and with their Children for ever! Go, say unto them, Return you to your Tents: But stand thou here with me, and I will tell thee all the Commandments and the Ordinances, and the Laws which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the Land which I have given them to possess.</hi> From this latter kinde the former are plainly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in many things. They were not both at one time delivered, neither both after one sort, nor to one end. The former uttered by the voice of God himself in the hearing of Six hundred thousand men; the former written with the Finger of God; the former termed by the name of a Covenant; the former given to be kept without either mention of time how long, or of place where. On the other side, the latter given after, and neither written by God himself, nor given unto the whole multitude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, but unto <hi>Moses,</hi> and from him to them both by word and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; Finally, The latter termed Ceremonies, Judgments, Ordinances, but no where Covenants. The observation of the latter restrained unto the Land where God would establish them to inhabite. The Laws Positive are not framed without regard had to the place and persons, for the which they are made. If therefore Almighty God in framing their Laws, had an eye unto the nature of that people, and to the Countrey where they were to dwell; if these peculiar and proper considerations were respected in the making of their Laws, and must be also regarded in the Positive Laws of all other Nations besides; then seeing that Nations are not all alike, surely the giving of one kinde of Positive Laws unto one onely people, without any liberty to alter them, is but a slender proof, that therefore one kinde should in like sort be given to serve everlastingly for all.

And in this point much more is granted us then we ask, namely, that for one thing which we have left to the Order of the Church, they had twenty which were undecided by the express Word of God; and that as their Ceremonies and Sacraments were multiplied above ours, even so grew the number of those cases which were not determined by any express word. So that if we may devise one Law, they by this reason might devise twenty; and if their devising so many, were not forbidden, shall their example prove us forbidden to devise as much as one Law for the ordering of the Church? We might not devise, no not one, if their example did prove, that our Saviour hath utterly forbidden all alteration of his Laws, in as much as there can be no Law devised; but needs it must either take away from his, or add thereunto more or less, and so make some kinde of alteration: But of this so large a grant, we are content not to take advantage.<note place="margin">

Such occasions as these, are rare: And for such things as do fall scarce once in many ages of men, it did suffice to take such order as was requisite when they fell. But if the case were such, as being not already determined by Law, were notwithstanding likely oftentimes to come into question, it gave occasion of adding Laws that were not before. Thus it fell out in the case of those men polluted, and of the daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> whose causes <hi>Moses</hi> having brought before the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Laws to serve for the like in time to come.<note place="margin">Numb. 9.

Shall we then hereupon argue even against our own experience and knowledge? Shall we seek to perswade men, that of necessity it is with us, as it was with them, that because God is ours in all respects, as much as theirs, therefore either no such way of direction hath been at any time; or if it hath been, it doth still continue in the Church; or if the same do not continue, that yet it must be at the least supplied by some such mean as pleaseth us to account of equal force? A more dutiful and religious way for us, were to admire the Wisdom of God, which shineth in the beautiful variety of all things?

Upon the safety therefore of their very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state and condition for so long, the after good of the whole World, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all did depend. Unto their so long safety, for two things it was necessary to provide, namely, the preservation of their state against foreign resistance, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66185:86"/>
the continuance of their peace within themselves. Touching the one, as they received the Promise of God to be the Rock of their Defence, against which, who so did vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently rush, should but bruise and batter themselves; so likewise they had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in all their affairs that way, to seek direction and counsel from him. Mens Consultations are always perillous. And it falleth out many times, that after long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, those things are by their wit even resolved on, which by trial are found most opposite to publick safety. It is no impossible thing for States, be they never so well established, yet by over-sight in some one act or treaty between them, and their potent opposites, utterly to cast away themselves for ever. Wherefore lest it should so fall out to them, upon whom so much did depend; they were not permitted to enter into War, not conclude any League of Peace, nor to wade through any act of moment between them and foreign States, unless the Oracle of God, or his Prophets, were first consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. And lest domestical disturbance should waste them within themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was nothing unto this purpose more effectual, then if the Authority of their Laws and Governors were such, as none might presume to take exception against it, or to shew disobedience unto it, without incurring the hatred and detestation of all men that had any spark of the fear of God; therefore he gave them even their Positive Laws from Heaven, and as oft as occasion required, chose in like sort Rulers also to lead and govern them. Notwithstanding some desperately impious there were, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to try what harm it could bring upon them, if they did attempt to be Authors of Confusion, and to resist both Governors and Laws. Against such Monsters God maintained his own, by fearful execution of extraordinary judgment upon them. By which means it came to pass, that although they were a people infested and mightily hated of all others throughout the World, although by Nature hard-hearted, queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, wrathful, and impatient of rest and quietness; yet was there nothing of force, either one way or other, to work the ruine and subversion of their State, till the time before mentioned was expired.

                     <hi>That albeit in Civil Matters and things pertaining to this present life, God hath used a greater particularity with them, then amongst us, framing Laws according to the quality of that People and Countrey; yet the leaving of us at greater liberty in things civil, is so far from proving the like liberty in things pertaining to the Kingdom of Heaven, that it rather proves a straiter bond. For even as when the Lord would have his favor more appear by Temporal Blessings of this life, towards the people under the Law, then towards us, he gave also Politick Laws most exactly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might both most easily come into, and most stedfastly remain in possession of those earthly benefits: Even so at this time, wherein he would not have his favor so much esteemed by those outward commodities, it is required, That as his care inprescribing Laws for that purpose hath somewhat faln, in leaving them to mens Consultations, which may be deceived; so his care for Conduct and Government of the life to come, should (if it were possible) rise, in leaving less to the order of men then in times past.</hi> These are but weak and feeble Disputes for the Inference of that Conclusion which is intended. For saving onely in such consideration as hath been shewed, there is no cause wherefore we should think God more desirous to manifest his savor by Temporal Blessings towards them, then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. Godliness had unto them, and it hath also unto us, the promises both of this life, and the life to come. That the care of God hath faln in earthly things, and therefore should rise as much in Heavenly; that more is left unto mens consultations in the one, and therefore less must be granted in the other; that God having used a greater particularity with them then with us, for matters pertaining unto this life, is to make us amends by the more exact delivery of Laws for Government of the life to come. These are proportions, whereof if there be any rule, we must plainly confess that which truth is, we know it not. God which spake unto them by his Prophets, hath unto us by his onely begotten Son; those Mysteries of Grace and Salvation which were but darkly disclosed unto them, have unto us more clearly shined. Such differences between them and us, the Apostles of Christ have well acquainted us withal. But as for matter belonging to the outward Conduct or Government of the Church; seeing that even in sense it is manifest, that our Lord and Saviour hath not by Positive Laws descended so far into particularities with us, as <hi>Moses</hi> with them; neither doth by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66185:87"/>
extraordinary Means, Oracles, and Prophets, direct us, as them he did, in those things which rising daily by new occasions, are of necessity to be provided for; doth it not hereupon rather follow, that although not to them, yet to us there should be freedom and liberty granted to make Laws? Yea, but the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth fearfully charge <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim 6. 14. Job. 18. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Even in the sight of God who quickneth all, and of Christ Iesus who witnessed that famous Confession before</hi>Pontius Pilate, <hi>to keep what was commanded him, safe and sound till the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> This doth exclude all liberty or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of Christ, whether by abrogation or addition, or howsoever: For in <hi>Timothy</hi> the whole Church of Christ receiveth charge concerning her duty. And that charge is to keep the Apostles Commandment; and his Commandment did contain the Laws that concerned Church Government: And those Laws he straightly requireth to be observed without breach or blame, till the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Scripture we grant every one Mans lesson, to be the common instruction of all men, so far forth as their cases are like, and that religiously to keep the Apostles Commandments in whatsoever they may concern us, we all stand bound. But touching that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Timothy</hi> was charged with, we swerve undoubtedly from the Apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise meaning, if we extend it so largely that the Arms thereof shall reach unto all things which were commanded him by the Apostle. The very words themselves do restrain themselves unto some special Commandment among many. And therefore it is not said, <hi>Keep the Ordinances, Laws, and Constitutions which thou hast received; but <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>I have kept the Faith; for the residue, there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Iudge, shall in that day render unto me.</hi> If they that labor in this Harvest, should respect but the present fruit of their painful Travel, a poor encouragement it were unto them, to continue therein all the days of their life. But their reward is great in Heaven; the Crown of Righteousness which shall be given them in that day, is honorable. The fruit of their industry then shall they reap with full contentment and satisfaction, but not till then. Wherein the greatness of their reward is abundantly sufficient to countervail the tediousness of their expectation. Wherefore till then, they that are in labor, must rest in hope. O <hi>Timothy,</hi> keep that which is committed unto thy charge; that great Commandment which thou hast received, keep, till the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Lord Jesus Christ. In which sense, although we judge the Apostles words to have been uttered; yet hereunto we do not require them to yield, that think any other construction more sound. If therefore it be rejected, and theirs esteemed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, which hold, That the last words do import perpetual observation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Commandment, imposed necessarily for ever upon the Militant Church of Christ: Let them withal consider, That then his Commandment cannot so largely be taken, to comprehend whatsoever the Apostle did command <hi>Timothy.</hi> For themselves do not all binde the Church unto some things, whereof <hi>Timothy</hi> received charge, as namely, unto that Precept concerning the choice of Widows. So as they cannot hereby main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all things positively commanded concerning the affairs of the Church, were commanded for perpetuity. And we do not deny that certain things were commanded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66185:87"/>
to be, though positive, yet perpetual in the Church. They should not therefore urge against us places that seem to forbid change, but rather such as set down some measure of alteration; which measure, if we have exceeded, then might they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with charge us justly: Whereas now they themselves both granting, and also using liberty to change, cannot in reason dispute absolutely against all change. Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered no inconvenient, or unmeet Laws: Sundry of ours they hold inconvenient. Therefore such Laws they cannot possibly hold to be Christs. Being not his, they must of necessity grant them added unto his.

For it all External Discipline were Arbitrary, and in the choice of the Church. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication also. (Which is a part of it) might be cast away; which I think you will not say. <hi>And in the very next words before.</hi> Where you will give to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that Ceremonies and External Discipline are not prescribed particularly by the Word of God; and therefore lest to the Order of the Church: You must understand, that all External Discipline is not lest to the Orders of the Church, being particularly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Scriptures, no more then all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are less to the Order of the Church, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.</note> and of Rites appertaining to Burial. Their own Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, that they plead against the inconvenience, not the unlawfulness of Popish Apparel; and against the inconvenience, not the unlawfulness of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Burial. Therefore they hold it a thing not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to add to the Laws of Jesus Christ; and so consequently they yield, That no Law of Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth Addition unto Church Laws. The Judgment of <hi>Calvin</hi> being alledged against them, to whom, of all men, they attribute most; whereas his words be plain, That for Ceremonies and External Discipline, the Church hath power to make Laws: The answer which hereunto they make, is, That indefinitely the speech is true, and that so it was meant by him; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That some things belonging unto External Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Ceremonies, are in the Power and Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; but neither was it meant, neither is it true generally, That all External Discipline, and all Ceremonies, are left to the Order of the Church, in as much as the Sacraments of Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord are Ceremonies, which yet the Church may not therefore abrogate. Again, Excommunication is a part of External Discipline, which might also be cast away; if all External Discipline were Arbitrary, and in the choice of the Church. By which their answer it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that touching the names of Ceremony and External Discipline, they gladly would have us so understood, as if we did herein contain a great deal more then we do. The fault which we finde with them, is, That they over-much abridge the Church of her power in these things. Whereupon they recharge us, as if in these things we gave the Church a liberty, which hath no limits or bounds; as if all things which the name of Discipline containeth, were at the Churches free choice. So that we might either have Church Governors and Government, or want them; either retain or reject Church Censures as we lift. They wonder at us as at men which think it so indifferent what the Church doth in Matter of Ceremonies, that it may be feared lest we judge the very Sacraments themselves to be held at the Churches pleasure. No, the name of Ceremonies we do not use in so large a meaning, as to bring Sacraments within the compass and reach thereof; although things belonging unto the outward form and seemly Administration of them, are contained in that name, even as we use it. For the name of Ceremonies we use as they themselves do, when they speak after this sort:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>T. C.</hi> lib. 3. p. 171.</note> 
                     <hi>The Doctrine and Discipline of the Church, as the weightiest things, ought especially to be looked unto; but the Ceremonies also, as Mint and Cummin, ought not to be neglected.</hi> Besides, in the Matter of External Discipline, or Regiment it self, we do not deny but there are some things whereto the Church is bound till the Worlds end. So as the question is onely, how far the bounds of the Churches Liberty do reach. We hold, that the power which the Church hath lawfully to make Laws and Orders for it self, doth extend unto sundry things of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and such other Matters, whereto their opinion is, That the Churches Authority and Power doth not reach. Whereas therefore in Disputing against us about this point, they take their compass a great deal wider then the truth of things can afford, producing Reasons and Arguments by way of generality, to prove, that Christ hath set down all things belonging any way unto the Form of ordering his Church, and hath obsolutely forbidden change by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66185:88"/>
or Diminution, great or small (for so their manner of disputing is:) We are constrained to make our Defence, by shewing, That Christ hath not deprived his Church so far of all Liberty, in making Orders and Laws for it self, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do not think he hath so done. For are they able to shew that all particular Customs,<note place="margin">T C. lib. 1. p. 27.

No; They grant, that in Matter of Circumstance they alter that which they have received; but in things of Substance, they keep the Laws of Christ without change. If we say the same in our own behalf (which surely we may do with a great deal more truth) then must they cancel all that hath been before alledged, and begin to enquire afresh, Whether we retain the Laws that Christ hath delivered concerning Matters of Substance, yea, or no. For our constant perswasion in this point is as theirs, That we have no where altered the Laws of Christ, further then in such Particularities onely, as have the nature of things changeable according to the difference of times, places, persons, and other the like circumstances. Christ hath commanded Prayers to be made, Sacraments to be ministred, his Church to be carefully taught and guided. Concerning every of these, somewhat Christ hath commanded, which must be kept till the Worlds end. On the contrary side, in every of them, somewhat there may be added, as the Church shall judge it expedient. So that if they will speak to purpose, all which hitherto hath been disputed of, they must give over, and stand upon such particulars onely, as they can shew we have either added or abrogated, otherwise then we ought in the Matter of Church Poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y. Whatsoever Christ hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever to be kept in his Church, the same we take not upon us to abrogate; and whatsoever our Laws have thereunto added besides, of such quality we hope it is, as no Law of Christ doth any where condemn. Wherefore, that all may be laid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> together, and gathered into a narrow room. First, So far forth as the Church is the Mystical Body of Christ, and his Invisible Spouse, it needeth no External Polity. That very part of the Law Divine, which teacheth Faith and Works of Righteousness, is it self alone sufficient for the Church of God in that respect. But as the Church is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> a Visible Society, and Body Politick, Laws of Polity it cannot want. Secondly, Whereas therefore is cometh in the second place to be enquired, what Laws are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best for the Church; they who first embraced that rigorous and strict opinion, which depriveth the Church of Liberty,<note place="margin">

Howbeit, they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66185:88"/>
which had once taken upon them to condemn all things done in the Church, and not commanded of God to be done, saw it was necessary for them (continuing in defence of this their opinion) to hold, that needs there must be in Scripture set down a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat particular Form of Church Polity, a Form prescribing how all the affairs of the Church must be ordered, a Form in no respect lawful to be altered by Mortal Men. For Reformation of which over-sight and error in them, there were that thought it a part of Christian love and charity to instruct them better, and to open unto them the difference between Matters of perpetual necessity to all Mens salvation, and Matters of Ecclesiastical Polity: The one both fully and plainly taught in holy Scripture; the other not necessary to be in such sort there prescribed: The one not capable of any Diminution or Augmentation at all by Men, the other apt to admit both. Hereupon the Authors of the former opinion were presently seconded by other wittier and better learned, who being loth that the Form of Church Polity which they sought to bring in, should be otherwise then in the highest degree accounted of, took first an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> against the difference between Church Polity and Matters of necessity to Salvation. Secondly, Against the Restraint of Scripture, which (they say) receiveth injury at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> our hands, when we teach that it teacheth not as well Matters of Polity, as of Faith and Salvation. Thirdly, Constrained thereby we have been therefore, both to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> that distinction, as a thing not onely true in it self, but by them likewise so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, though unawares. Fourthly, And to make manifest that from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> we offer not to derogate the least thing that Truth thereunto doth claim, in as much as by us it is willingly confest, That the Scripture of God is a Store-house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with inestimable Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge in many kindes, over and above things in this one kinde barely necessary; yea, even that Matters of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Polity are not therein omitted, but taught also, albeit not so taught as those other things before mentioned. For so perfectly are those things taught, that nothing ever can need to be added, nothing ever cease to be necessary: These on the contrary side, as being of a far other nature and quality, not so strictly nor everlastingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture; but that unto the compleat Form of Church Polity, much may be requisite, which the Scripture teacheth not; and much which it hath taught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unrequisite, sometime because we need not use it, sometimes also because we cannot. In which respect, for mine own part, although I see that certain Reformed Churches, the Scotish especially and French, have not that which best agreeth with the Sacred Scripture, I mean the Government that is by Bishops, in as much as both those Churches are faln under a different kinde of Regiment; which to remedy it, is for the one altogether too late, and too soon for the other, during their present affliction and trouble: This their defect and imperfection I had rather lament in such a case then exagitate, considering that men oftentimes without any fault of their own, may be driven to want that kinde of Polity or Regiment which is best; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with that, weich either the irremediable Error of former times, or the necessity of the present hath cast upon them. Fifthly, Now, because that Position <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> first mentioned, which holdeth it necessary that all things which the Church may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do in her own Regiment be commanded in holy Scripture, hath by the latter Defenders thereof been greatly qualified; who, though perceiving it to be over-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, are notwithstanding loth to acknowledge any oversight therein, and therefore labor what they may to salve it up by construction; we have for the more perspicuity delivered what was thereby meant at the first. Sixthly, How injurious a thing it were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> unto all the Churches of God for men to hold it in that meaning. Seventhly, And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> how unperfect their Interpretations are, who so much labor to help it, either by dividing Commandments of Scripture into two kindes, and so defending, that all things must be commanded, if not in special, yet in general Precepts. Eightly, Or by taking it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> as meant, that in case the Church do devise any new Order, she ought therein to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the direction of Scripture onely, and not any Star-light of Mans Reason. Nineth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Both which evasions being cut off, we have in the next place declared after what sort the Church may lawfully frame to her self Laws of Polity, and in what reckoning such Positive Laws both are with God, and should be with Men.

Discip.</note> so wise as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi>) must needs have set down in holy Scripture, some certain, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and unchangeable Form of Polity; and partly a coloured shew of some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where change of that sort of Laws may seem expresly forbidden, although in truth nothing less be done. I might have added hereunto their more familiar and popular disputes, as, The Church is a City, yea, the City of the Great King, and the life of a City, is Polity: The Church is the House of the Living God; and what house can there be without some order for the government of it? In the Royal House of a Prince, there must be Officers for Government, such as not any Servant in the House but the Prince, whose the House is, shall judge convenient: So the House of God must have Orders for the Government of it, such as not any of the Houshold, but God himself hath appointed. It cannot stand with the Love and Wisdom of God, to leave such Order untaken, as is necessary for the due Government of his Church. The numbers, degrees, orders, and attire of <hi>Solomons</hi> servants, did shew his Wisdom; therefore he which is greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> hath not failed to leave in his House such Orders for Government thereof, as may serve to be as a Looking-glass for his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, care, and wisdom to be seen in. That little spark of the Light of Nature which remaineth in us, may serve us for the affairs of this life: But as in all other Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdom of Heaven, so principally in this which concerneth the very Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Kingdom, needful it is we should be taught of God. <hi>As long as Men are perswaded of any Order, that it is onely of Men, they presume of their own understanding, and they think to devise another, not onely as good, but better then that which they have received. By severity of punishment, this presumption and curiosity may be restrained. But that cannot work such chearful Obedience as is yielded, where the Conscience hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to God as the Author of Laws and Orders. This was it which countenanced the Laws of</hi> Moses, <hi>made concerning outward Polity for the Administration of holy things. The like some Law-givers of the Heathens did pretend, but falsly; yet wisely discerning the use of this perswasion. For the better obedience sake therefore it was expedient, that God should be Author of the Polity of his Church. But to what issue doth all this come? A man would think that they which hold out with such discourses, were of nothing more fully perswaded then of this, That the Scripture hath set down a compleat Form of Church Polity, Universal, Perpetual, altogether Unchangeable.</hi> For so it would follow, if the premises were sound and strong to such effect as is pretended. Notwithstanding, they which have thus formally maintained Argument in defence of the first oversight, are by the very evidence of Truth, themselves constrained to make this in effect their conclusion, That the Scripture of God hath many things concerning Church Polity; that of those many, some are of greater weight, some of less; that what hath been urged as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Immutability of Laws, it extendeth in Truth no further then onely to Laws where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in things of greater moment are prescribed. Now these things of greater moment, what are they?<note place="margin">The Defence of godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters against Dr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> 133.</note> Forsooth, <hi>Doctors, Pastors, Lay-Elders, Elderships compounded of these three: Synods, consisting of many Elderships, Deacons, Women Church-servants, or Widows; free consent of the people unto actions of greatest moment, after they be by Churches or Synods orderly resolved.</hi> All <hi>this Form of Polity</hi> (if yet we may term that a form of building, when men have laid a few Rafters together, and those not all of the foundest neither) but howsoever, all <hi>this Form</hi> they conclude is prescribed in such sort, that to adde to it any thing as of like importance (for so I think they mean) or to abrogate of it any thing at all, is unlawful. In which resolution, if they will firmly and constantly persist, I see not but that concerning the points which hitherto have been disputed of, they must agree, that they have molested the Church with needless opposition; and henceforward, as we said before, betake themselves wholly unto the tryal of particulars, whether every of those things which they esteem as principal,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66185:89"/>
be either so esteemed of, or at all established for perpetuity in holy Scripture; and whether any particular thing in our Church Polity be received other then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alloweth of, either in greater things, or in smaller. The Matters wherein Church Polity is conversant, are the Publick Religious Duties of the Church, as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Word and Sacraments, Prayers, Spiritual Censures, and the like. To these the Church standeth always bound. Laws of Polity, are Laws which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in what manner these duties shall be performed. In performance whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all that are of the Church cannot joyntly and equally work, the first thing in Polity required, is, A difference of Persons in the Church, without which difference those Functions cannot in orderly sort be executed. Hereupon we hold, That Gods Clergy are a State, which hath been and will be, as long as there is a Church upon Earth, necessarily by the plain Word of God himself; a State whereunto the rest of Gods people must be subject, as touching things that appertain to their Souls health. For where Polity is, it cannot but appoint some to be Leaders of others, and some to be led by others.<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>If the blinde lead the blinde, they both perish.</hi> It is with the Clergy, if their persons be respected, even as it is with other men; their quality many times far beneath that which the dignity of their place requireth. Howbeit, according to the Order of Polity, they being <hi>The lights of the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 14.</note> others (though better and wiser) must that way be subject unto them. Again, for as much as where the Clergy are any great multitude, order doth necessarily require that by degrees they be distinguished; we hold, there have ever been, and ever ought to be in such case, at leastwise, two sorts of Ecclesiastical Persons, the one subordinate unto the other; as to the Apostles in the beginning, and to the Bishops always since, we finde plainly both in Scripture, and in all Ecclesiastical Records, other Ministers of the Word and Sacraments have been. Moreover, it cannot enter into any Mans conceit to think it lawful, that every man which listeth, should take upon him charge in the Church; and therefore a solemn admittance is of such necessity, that without it there can be no Church Polity. A number of Particularities there are, which make for the more convenient Being of these Principal and Perpetual parts in Ecclesiastical Polity, but yet are not of such constant use and necessity in Gods Church. Of this kinde are, times and places appointed for the Exercise of Religion; Specialties belonging to the Publick Solemnity of the Word, the Sacraments and Prayer; the Enlargement or Abridgement of Functions Ministerial, depending upon those two Principals beforementioned. To conclude, even whatsoever doth by way of Formality and Circumstance concern any Publick Action of the Church. Now although that which the Scripture hath of things in the former kinde be for ever permanent; yet in the latter, both much of that which the Scripture teacheth, is not always needful; and much the Church of God shall always need which the Scripture teacheth not. So as the Form of Polity by them set down for perpetuity, is three ways faulty. Faulty in omitting some things which in Scripture are of that nature, as namely, the difference that ought to be of Pastors, when they grow to any great multitude: Faulty in requiring Doctors, Deacons, Widows, and such like, as things of perpetual necessity by the Law of God, which in Truth are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less: Faulty also in urging some things by Scripture Immutable; as their Lay-Elders, which the Scripture neither maketh Immutable, nor at all teacheth, for any thing either we can as yet finde, or they have hitherto been able to prove. But hereof more in the Books that follow. As for those marvellous Discourses, whereby they adventure to argue, That God must needs have done the thing which they imagine was to be done: I must confess, I have often wondred at their exceeding boldness herein. When the question is, Whether God have delivered in Scripture (as they affirm he hath) a compleat particular Immutable Form of Church Polity; why take they that other, both presumptuous and superfluous labor, to prove he should have done it; there being no way in this case to prove the Deed of God, saving onely by producing that evidence wherein he hath done it? But if there be no such thing apparent upon Record, they do as if one should demand a Legacy by force and vertue of some Written Testament, wherein there being no such thing specified, he pleadeth, That there it must needs be, and bringeth arguments from the love or good will which always the Testator bore him, imagining, that these or the like proofs will
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66185:90"/>
convict a Testament to have that in it, which other men can no where by reading finde. In matters which concern the Actions of God, the most dutiful way on our part, is to search what God hath done, and with meekness to admire that, rather then to dispute what he in congruity of Reason ought to do. The ways which he hath whereby to do all things for the greatest good of his Church, are more in number then we can search, other in Nature, then that we should presume to determine which of many should be the fittest for him to chuse, till such time as we see he hath chosen of many some one; which one, we then may boldly conclude to be the fittest, because he hath taken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rest. When we do otherwise, surely we exceed our bounds; who, and where weare, we forget. And therefore needful it is, that our Pride in such cases be contrould, and our Disputes beaten back with those Demands of the blessed Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13.</note>

Here we are to discuss onely those general exceptions, which have been taken at any time against them. First, therefore to the end that their nature and use, whereunto they serve may plainly appear, and so afterwards their quality the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be discerned; we are to note, that in every grand or main publique duty, which God requireth at the hands of his Church, there is, besides that matter and form wherein the essence thereof consisteth, a certain outward fashion, whereby the same is in decent sort administred. The substance of all religious actions is delivered from God himself in few words. For example sake in the Sacraments, <hi>Unto the Element let the Word be added; and they both do make a Sacrament,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is given by the Element of Water, and that prescript form of words, which the Church of Christ doth use; the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ is administred in the Elements of Bread and Wine, if those mystical words be added thereunto. But the due and decent form of administring those holy Sacraments, doth require a great deal more. The end which is aimed at in setting down the outward form of all religious actions, is the edification of the Church. Now men are edified, when either their understanding is taught somewhat whereof in such actions it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all men to consider, or when their hearts are moved with any affection suitable thereunto; when their mindes are in any sort stirred up unto that reverence, devotion, attention, and due regard, which in those cases seemeth requisite. Because therefore unto this purpose not onely speech, but sundry sensible means besides have always been thought necessary, and especially those means which being object to the eye, the liveliest and the most apprehensive sense of all other, have in that respect seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the sittest to make a deep and strong impression; from hence have risen not only a number of Prayers, Readings, Questionings, Exhortings, but even of visible signs also, which being used in perfomance of holy actions, are undoubtedly most effectual to open such matter, as men when they know and remember carefully, must needs be a great deal the better informed to what effect such duties serve. We must not think but that there is some ground of Reason even in Nature, whereby it cometh to pass, that no Nation under Heaven either doth or ever did suffer publike actions which are of weight, whether they be Civil and Temporal, or else Spiritual and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, to pass without some visible solemnity: The very strangeness whereof, and difference from that which is common doth cause Popular eyes to observe and to mark the same. Words, both because they are common, and do not so strongly move the phansie of man, are for the most part but slightly heard; and therefore with singular wisdom it hath been provided, that the deeds of men which are made
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66185:91"/>
in the presence of Witnesses, should pass not only with words, but also with certain sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible actions, the memory whereof is far more easie and durable then the memory of speech can be. The things which so long experience of all Ages hath confirmed and made profitable, let not us presume to condemn as follies and toys, because we sometimes know not the cause and reason of them. A wit disposed to scorn whatsoever it doth not conceive, might ask wherefore <hi>Abraham</hi> should say to his servant,<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Put thy hand under my thigh, and swear:</hi> was it not sufficient for his servant to shew the Religion of an Oath, by naming the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, unless that strange Ceremony were added? In Contracts, Bargains and Conveyances, a mans word is a token sufficient to express his will.<note place="margin">Ruth 4. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Yet this was the ancient manner in Israel concerning redeeming and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing, to establish all things; A man did pluck off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was a sure witness in Israel.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> in their making of a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man free, was it not wondred wherefore so great a do should be made? The Master to present his Slave in some Court, to take him by the hand, and not only to say in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the publike Magistrate, <hi>I will that this man become free</hi>; but after these solemn words uttered, to strike him on the cheek, to turn him round, the hair of his head to be shaved off, the Magistrate to touch him thrice with a rod, in the end a cap and a white garment to be given him: To what purpose all this circumstance? Among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> how strange and in outward appearance almost against reason,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 6.</note> that he which was minded to make himself a perpetual servant, should not only testifie so much in the presence of the Judge, but for a visible token thereof have also his ear bored thorow with an awl?

The First thing blamed about the kinde of ours, is, That in many things we have departed from the ancient simplicity of Christ and his Apostles; we have imbraced more outward stateliness, we have those Orders in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Religion, which they who best pleased God, and served him most devoutly never had. For it is out of doubt, that the first state of things was best, that in the prime of Christian Religion faith was foundest, the Scriptures of God were then best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by all men, all parts of godliness did then most abound; and therefore it must needs follow, that Customs, Laws, and Ordinances devised since, are not so good for the Church of Christ; but the best way is to cut off later inventions, and to reduce things unto the ancient state wherein at the first they were. Which Rule or Canon we hold to be either uncertain, or at least wise unsufficient, if not both.

But is it necessary that all the Orders of the Church which were then in use, should be contained in their Books? Surely no. For if the tenor of their Writings be well observed, it shall unto any man easily appear, that no more of them are there touched, then were needfull to be spoken of sometimes by one occasion, and sometimes by another. Will they allow then of any other Records besides? Well assured I am they are far enough from acknowledging that the Church ought to keep any thing as Apostolical, which is not found in the Apostles Writings, in what other Records soever it be found. And therefore whereas St. <hi>Augustine</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that those things which the whole Church of Christ doth hold, may well be thought to be Apostolical, although they be not found written;<note place="margin">

                     </note> this his judgement they utterly condemn. I will not here stand in defence of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion, which is, that such things are indeed Apostolical; but yet with this exception, unless the Decree of some General Councel have haply caused them to be received; for of Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws and Orders received throughout the whole Christian world, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> could imagine no other Fountain save these two. But to let pass S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> they who condemn him herein, must needs confess it a very uncertain thing what the Orders of the Church were in the Apostles times, seeing the Scriptures doe not mention them all, and other Records thereof besides they utterly reject. So that in tying the Church to the Orders of the Apostles times, they tye it to a marvellous uncertain rule; unless they require the observation of no Orders but only those which are known to be Apostolical by the Apostles own Writings. But then is not this their rule of such sufficiency, that we should use it as a touchstone to try the Orders of the Church by for ever? Our end ought always to be the same; our ways and means thereunto not so. The glory of God, and the good of the Church was the thing which the Apostles aimed at, and therefore ought to be the mark whereat we also level. But seeing those Rites and Orders may be at one time more, which at another are less available unto that purpose: what reason is there in these things to urge the state of our only age, as a pattern for all to follow? It is not, I am right sure, their meaning, that we should now assemble our People to serve God in close and secret Meetings; or that common Brooks or Rivers should be used for places of Baptism; or that the Eucharist should be ministred after meat; or that the custom of Church-feasting should be renewed: or that all kind of standing provision for the Ministry should be utterly taken away, and their Estate made again dependent upon the voluntary devotion of men. In these things they easily perceive how unfit that were for the present, which was for the first Age convenient enough. The Faith, Zeal, and Godliness of former times is worthily had in honour; but doth this prove that the Orders of the Church of Christ must be still the self-same with theirs, that nothing may be which was not then, or that nothing which then was may lawfully since have ceased? They who recall the Church unto that which was at the first, must necessarily set bounds and limits unto their speeches. If any thing have been received repugnant unto that which was first delivered, the first things in this case must stand, the last give place unto them. But where difference is without repugnancy, that which hath been can be no prejudice to that which is. Let the state of the People of God when they were in the House of Bondage, and their manner of serving God in a strange Land, be compared with that which <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did afford, and who seeth not what huge difference there was between them? In Egypt it may be, they were right glad to take some corner of a poor Cottage, and there to serve God upon their knees, peradventure covered in dust and straw sometimes. Neither were they therefore the less accepted of God; but he was with them in all their afflictions, and at the length by working of their admirable deliverance, did testifie that they served him not in vain. Notwithstanding in the very desert they are no sooner possest of some little thing of their own, but a Tabernacle is required at their hands. Being planted in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and having <hi>David</hi> to be their King, when the Lord had given him rest from all his Enemies, it grieved his religious mind to consider the growth of his own estate and dignity, the Affairs of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing still in the former manner:<note place="margin">

O, saith</hi> Tertullian, <hi>better is the Religion of the Heathen: for they use no solemnity of the Christians, neither the Lords day, neither the Pentecost, and if they knew them, they would have nothing to do with them: for they would be afraid lest they should seem Christians: but we are not afraid to be called Heathens. The same</hi> Tertullian <hi>would not have Christians to sit after they had payed, because the Idolaters did so. Whereby it appeareth, that both of Particular men and of Counsels, in making or abolishing of Ceremonies, heed had been taken that the Christians should not be like the Idolaters, no not in those things which of themselves are most indifferent to be used or not used. The same conformity is not lesse oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site unto reason, first inasmuch as contraries must be cured by their contraries, and therefore Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery being Antichristianity, is not healed but by establishment of Orders thereunto opposite.

To rectifie a crooked stick, we bend it on the contrary side, as far as it was at the first on that side from whence we draw it: and so it cometh in the end to a middle between both, which is perfect straightness. Utter inconformity therefore with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in these things, is the best and surest Policy which the Church can use. While we use their Ceremonies, they take occasion to blaspheme, saying that our Religion cannot stand by it self, unless it lean upon the staff of their Ceremonies.</hi>

For the Ceremonies in use amongst us, being in no other respect retained, saving onely for that to retain them is to our seeming, good and profitable, yea so profitable and so good, that if we had either simply taken them clean away, or else removed them so as to place in their stead others, we had done worse: the plain and direct way against us herein had been onely to prove, that all such Ceremonies as they require to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, are retained by us to the hurt of the Church, or with lesse benefit then the abolishment of them would bring. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they saw how hardly they should be able to perform this; they took a more compendious way, traducing the Ceremonies of our Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of being Popish. The cause why this way seemed better unto them, was, for that the name of Popery is more odious then very Paganism a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst divers of the more simple sort; so whatsoever they hear named Popish, they presently conceive deep hatred against it, imagining there can be nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that name, but needs it must be exceeding detestable. The ears of the People they have therefore filled with strong clamours. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>is fraught with Popish Ceremonies: they that favour the cause of Reformation, maintain nothing but the sincerity of the Gospel of</hi> Jesus Christ: <hi>All such as withstand them, fight

What an open untruth is it, that this is one of our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not to be lawful to use the same Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which the Papists did, when as I have both before declared the contrary, and even here have expresly added, that they are not to be used when as good or better may be established? <hi>Eccles. discip. sol.</hi> 100.</note> whether it be lawful for us to use any such Ceremonies as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> useth, although the same be not commanded in the Word of God; being driven to see that the use of some such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies must of necessity be granted lawful, they go about to make us believe that they are just of the same Opinion, and that they only think such Ceremonies are not to be used when they are unprofitable, or when as good or better may be established. Which Answer is both idle in regard of us, and also repugnant to themselves. It is, in regard of us, very vain to make this answer, because they know that what Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies we retain common unto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we therefore retain them, for that we judge them to be profitable, and to be such that others instead of them would be worse. So that when they say that we ought to abrogate such Romish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as are unprofitable, or else might have other more profitable in their stead, they trisle and they beat the Air about nothing which toucheth us, unless they mean that we ought to abrogate all Romish Ceremonies, which in their judgment have either no use, or less use than some other might have. But then must they shew some commission, whereby they are authorized to sit as Judges, and we required to take their judgment for good in this case. Otherwise, their sentences will not be greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, when they oppose their <hi>Me thinketh,</hi> unto the Orders of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> as in the Question about Surplesses one of them doth; <hi>If we look to the colour, black methinks is the more decent; if to the form, a garment down to the foot hath a great deal more comeliness in it.</hi> If they think that we ought to prove the Ceremonies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious which we have retained, they do in this Point very greatly deceive themselves. For in all right and equity, that which the Church hath received and held so long for good, that which publike approbation hath ratified, must carry the benefit of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption with it to be accounted meet and convenient. They which have stood up as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday to challenge it of defect, must prove their challenge. If we being Defendents do answer, that the Ceremonies in question, are godly, comely, decent, profitable for the Church; their reply is childish and unorderly to say,<note place="margin">

For on our part this must be the Answer, which orderly proceeding doth require. The burden of proving doth rest on them. In them it is frivolous to say, we ought not to use bad Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and presume all such bad, as it pleaseth themselves to dislike, unless we can perswade them the contrary. Besides, they are herein opposite also to themselves. For what one thing is so common with them, as to use the custome of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that such and such Ceremonies cannot be good and profitable for us, inasmuch as that Church useth them? Which usual kind of disputing, sheweth that they do not disallow onely those Romish Ceremonies which are unprofitable, but count all unprofitable, which are Romish, that is to say, which have been devised by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or which are used in that Church, and not prescribed in the Word of God. For this is the onely limitation which they can use sutable unto their other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. And therefore the cause which they yield, why they hold it lawful to retain in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and in <hi>Discipline</hi> some things as good, which yet are common to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is, for that those good things are perpetual Commandments, in whose place no other can come: but Ceremonies are changeable. So that their judgement in truth, is, that whatsoever by the Word of God is not changeable in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Churches using is a cause why Reformed Churches ought to change it, and not to think it good or profitable. And lest we seem to father any thing upon them more then is properly their own, let them read even their own words, where they complain, That we <hi>are thus constrained to be like unto the Papists in any their Ceremonies</hi>; yea, they urge that this cause, although it were alone, ought to move them to whom that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth,

Our conformity with them in such things as have been proposed, is not proved as yet unlawful by all this.

This Consequent were good, if so be it were granted, that only the custom of the people of God, and the Decrees of our forefathers are in such case to be observed. But then should no other kind of latter Laws in the Church be good, which were a gross absurdity to think. S. <hi>Augustines</hi> speech therefore doth import, that where we have no divine Precept, if yet we have the custom of the people of God, or a Decree of our forefathers, this is a Law and must be kept. Notwithstanding it is not denied, but that we lawfully may observe the positive constitutions of our own Churches, although the same were but yesterday made by our selves alone.

Nay, doth it not seem a thing very probable, that God doth purposely add, <hi>Do after my judgement,</hi> as giving thereby to understand that his meaning in the former sentence was but to bar similitude in such things as were repugnant unto the Ordinances, Laws, and Statutes, which he had given? <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> are for example sake named unto them, because the Customs of the one they had been, and of the other they should be best acquainted with. But that wherein they might not be like unto either of them, was such peradventure as had been no whit less unlawfull, although those Nations had never been.

                     <hi>Ye shall not cut round the corners of your Heads, neither shalt thou tear the tafis of thy Board.</hi> These things were usual amongst those Nations, and in themselves they are indifferent. But are they indifferent being used as signs of immoderate and hopeless lamentation for the dead? In this sense it is that the Law forbiddeth them.

                     <hi>Ye shall not cut your Flesh for the dead, nor make any print of a mark upon you, I am the Lord.</hi> The like in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where speech is of mourning for the dead, <hi>They shall not make bald parts upon their Head, nor shave off the locks of their Beard, nor make any cutting in their Flesh.</hi> Again,<note place="margin">Deut. 14. 1.</note> in <hi>Deut.

                     <hi>Sorrow not as they do who have no hope</hi>? The very light of Nature it self was able to see herein a fault; that which those Nations did use, having been also in use with others, the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> laws do forbid. That sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore and cutting which the Law doth mention, was not a matter in it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and forbidden only because it was in use amongst such Idolaters as were Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the people of God; but to use it had a been crime, though no other people or Nation under Heaven should have done it saving only themselves.

Levit. 11.</note> But yet even here they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fail of that they intend. For it doth not appear that the consideration in regard
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66185:95"/>
whereof the Law forbiddeth these things, was because those Nations did use them. Likely enough it is that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> used to feed as well on Sheep as on Swines-flesh;<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 19.</note> and therefore if the forbidding of the latter had no other reason then dissimilitude with that people, they which of their own heads alledge this for reason, can shew I think some reason more then we are able to find, why the former was not also forbidden. Might there not be some other mystery in this Prohibition then they think of? Yes,<note place="margin">Deut. 14.

For what reason is there, which should but induce, and therefore much less inforce us to think, that care of dissimilitude between the People of God and the Heathen Nations about them, was any more the cause of forbidding them to put on Garments of sundry stuff, then of charging the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Men being either led by reason, or by imitation of other mens examples; if their Persons be odious whose example we chuse to follow, as namely, if we frame our opinions to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Hereticks think, or direct our Actions according to that which is practised and done by them; it lyes as an heavy prejudice against us, unless somewhat mightier then their bare example, did move us to think or do the same things with them. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men therefore having besides the common light of all men, so great help of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly direction from above, together with the Lamps of so bright examples at the Church of God doth yield, it cannot but worthily seem reproachful for us, to leave both the one and the other, to become Disciples unto the most hateful sort that live, to do as they do, only because we see their example before us, and have delight to follow it. Thus we may therefore safely conclude, that it is not evil simply to concur with the Heathens either in opinion or in action: and that conformity with them is only then a disgrace, when either we follow them in that they think and do amiss, or follow them generally in that they do, without other reason than only the liking we have to the pattern of their example: which liking doth intimate a more universal approbation of them than is allowable. <hi>Faustus</hi> the Manichee therefore objecting against the Jews, that they forsook the Idols of the Gentiles; but their Temples, and Oblations, and Altars, and Priest hoods and all kind of Ministry of holy things, they exercised even as the Gentiles did, yea more superstituosly a great deal; against the Catholick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians likewise, that between them and the Heathens there was in many things little difference;<note place="margin">Tom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For so they infer upon the premises, that as great difference as commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously may be, there should be in all outward Ceremonies between the People of God, and them which are not his People. Again, they teach as hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there is not as great a difference as may be between them, except the one do avoid whatsoever Rites and Ceremonies uncommanded of God the other doth embrace.

That extreme dissimilitude which they urge upon us, is now commended as our best and safest policy for establishment of sound Religion. The ground of which politick Position is, That <hi>Evils must be cured by their contraries</hi>; and therefore the cure of the Church infected with the poyson of Antichristianity, must be done by that which is thereunto as contrary as may be. A medled estate of the Orders of the Gospel, and the Ceremonies of Popery, is not the best way to banish Popery.

The first thing therefore in skilful cures, is the knowledge of the part affected; the next is of the evil which doth affect it; the last is not onely of the kind, but also of the measure of contrary things whereby to remove it. They which measure Religion by dislike of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> think every man so much the more sound, by how much he can make the corruptions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to seem more large. And therefore some there are, namely the <hi>Arrians</hi> in reformed Churches of <hi>Poland,</hi> which imagine the Canker to have eaten so far into the very Bones and Marrow of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if it had not so much as a sound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; no, not concerning God himself, but that the very belief of the Trinity, were a part of Antichristian corruption; and that the wonderful providence of God did bring to pass, that the Bishop of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> should be famous for his tripple Crown; a sensible mark whereby the world might know him to be that Mystical Beast spoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to be that great and notorious Antichrist in no one respect so much as in this, that he maintaineth the Doctrine of the Trinity. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom therefore and skill is requisite to know, what parts are sound in that Church, and what corrupted. Neither is it to all men apparent, which complain of unsound parts, with what kind of unsoundness every such part is possessed. They can say, that in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in <hi>Discipline,</hi> in <hi>Prayers,</hi> in <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath (as it hath indeed) very foul and gross corruptions: the nature whereof notwithstanding because they have not for the most part exact skill and knowledge to discern, they think that amiss many times which is not, and the salve of Reformation they mightily call for; but where and what the sores are which need it, as they wot full little, so they think it not greatly material to search; such mens contentment must be wrought by stratagem: the usual method of Art is not for them. But with those that profess more than ordinary and common knowledge of good from evil, with them that are able to put a difference between things naught, and things indifferent in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we are yet at controversie about the manner of removing that which is naught: whether it may not be perfectly helpt, unless that also which is indifferent be cut off with it, so far till no Rite or Ceremony remain which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, being not found in the Word of God. If we think this too extreme, they reply, that to draw

But how can these comparisons stand them in any stead? When they urge us to extreme opposition against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do they mean we should be drawn unto it only for a time, and afterwards return to a mediocrity? Or was it the purpose of those Reformed Churches, which utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished all Popish Ceremonies, to come in the end back again to the middle point of evenness, and moderation? Then have we conceived amiss of their meaning. For we have always thought their Opinion to be, that utter inconformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not an extremity whereunto we should be drawn for a time; but the very mediocrity it self wherein they meant we should ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. Now by these comparisons it seemeth clean contrary, that howsoever they have bent themselves at first to an extreme contrariety against the Romish Church, yet therein they will continue no longer, then onely till such time as some more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate course for establishment of the Church may be concluded. Yea, albeit this were not at the first their intent, yet surely now there is great cause to lead them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. They have seen that experience of the former Policy; which may cause the Authors of it to hang down their heads. When <hi>Germany</hi> had stricken off that which appeared corrupt in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but seemed nevertheless in Discipline still to retain therewith very great conformity: <hi>France,</hi> by that rule of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, which hath been before mentioned, took away the Popish Orders which <hi>Germany</hi> did retain. But process of time hath brought more light into the world; whereby men perceiving that they of the Religion in <hi>France,</hi> have also retained some Orders which were before in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are not commanded in the Word of God; there hath arisen a Sect in <hi>England,</hi> which following still the very self-same Rule of policy, seeketh to reform even the <hi>French</hi> Reformation, and purge out from thence also dregs of Popery. These have not taken as yet such root that they are able to establish any thing. But if they had, what would spring out of their stock, and how far the unquiet wit of man might be carried with rules of such policy, God doth know. The trial which we have lived to see, may somewhat teach us what posterity is to fear.

If desire of weakning the hope of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should turn us away from the course we have taken; how much more the care of preventing our own fear, with-hold us from that we are urged unto? Especially seeing that our own fear we know, but we are not so certain what hope the Rites and Orders of our Church have bred in the hearts of others. Fort it is no sufficient Argument therefore to say, that in maintaining and urging these Ceremonies, none are so clamorous as Papists, and they whom Papists suborn; this speech being more hard to justifie than the former, and so their proof more doubtfull then the thing it self, which they prove. He that were certain that this is true, must have marked who they be that speak for Ceremonies, he must have noted, who amongst them doth speak oftenest, or is most earnest, he must have been both acquainted thorowly with the Religion of such, and also privy to what conferences or compacts are passed in secret between them and others; which kind of notice are not wont to be vulgar and common. Yet they which alleadge this, would have it taken as a thing that needeth no proof, a thing which all men know and see. And if so be it were granted them as true, what gain they by it? Sundry of them that be Popish, are eager in maintenance of Ceremonies. Is it so strange a matter to find a good thing furthered by ill men of a smister intent

But to remedy their grief, lyeth not so much in us as in themselves. They do not wish to be made glad with the hurt of the Church: and to remove all out of the Church, whereat they shew themselves to be sorrowful, would be, as we are perswaded, hurtful, if not pernicious thereunto. Till they be able to perswade the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they must and will, I doubt not, find out some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good mean to chear up themselves. Amongst which means the example of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> may serve for one. Have not they the old Popish custom of using God-fathers and God-mothers in Baptism? the old Popish custom of administring the blessed Sacrament of the holy Eucharist with Wafer-cakes? These things then the Godly there can digest. Wherefore should not the Godly here learn to do the like, both in them, and in therest of the like nature? Some further mean peradventure it might be to asswage their grief, if so be they did consider the revenge they take on them, which have been, as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, the workers of their continuance in so great grief so long. For if the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Ceremonies be a corrosive to such as oppugn them; undoubtedly to such as maintain them, it can be no great pleasure, when they behold how that which they reverence is oppugned. And therefore they that judge themselves Martyrs, when they are grieved, should think withal what they are whom they grieve. For we are still to put them in mind, that the cause doth make no difference, for that it must be presumed as good at the least on our part as on theirs, till it be in the end decided, who have stood for Truth, and who for Error, So that till then the most effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and withal the most sound, to ease their grief, must not be (in our opinion) the taking away of those things whereat they are grieved, but the altering of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion which they have concerning the same. For this we therefore both pray and labour; the more because we are also perswaded, that it is but conceit in them to think, that those <hi>Romish</hi> Ceremonies, whereof we have hitherto spoken, are like<note place="margin">

Thus they say: but because they say it only, and the World hath not as yet had so great experience of their Art, in curing the Diseases of the Church, that the bare authority of their word should perswade in a cause so weighty, they may not think much if it be required at their hands to shew; First, by what means so deadly Infection can grow from similitude between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in these things indifferent: Secondly, for that it were infinite, if the Church should provide against every such Evil as may come to pass, it is not sufficient that they shew possibilitie of dangerous Event, unless there appear some likely-hood also of the same to follow in us, except we prevent it. Nor is this enough, unless it be more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over made plain, that there is no good and sufficient way of prevention, but by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating clean, and by emprying the Church of every such Rite and Ceremony, as is presently called in question. Till this be done, their good affection towards the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66185:98"/>
of the Church is acceptable, but the way they prescribe us to preserve it by, must rest in suspense. And lest hereat they take occasion to turn upon us the speech of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> used against <hi>Babylon, Rebold we have done our endeavour to cure the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases of</hi> Babylon, <hi>but she through her wilfulness doth rest uncured</hi>: let them consider into what straits the Church might drive it self, in being guided by this their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. Their axiom is, that the sound believing Church of Jesus Christ, may not be like Heretical Churches in any of those indifferent things, which men make choyce of, and do not take by prescript appointment of the Word of God. In the word of God the use of Bread is prescribed, as a thing without which the Eucharist may not be celebrated: but as for the kind of Bread, it is not denyed to be a thing indifferent. Being indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of it self, we are by this axiom of theirs to avoid the use of unleavened Bread in their Sacrament, because such bread the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being Heretical useth. But doth not the self-same axiom bar us even from leavened Bread also, which the Church of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> useth, the opinions whereof are in a number of things the same, for which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and in some things erroneous, where the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is acknowledged to be found; as namely in the Article of the Holy Ghosts proceeding? and lest here they should say that because the Greek Church is farther off, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> nearer, we are in that respect rather to use that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> useth not; let them imagine a reformed Church in the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> where a Greek Church and Popish both are. And when both these are equally near, let them consider what the third shall do. Without leavened or unleavened Bread, it can have no Sacrament: the word of God doth tye it to neither; and their axiom doth exclude it from both. If this constrain them, as it must, to grant that their axiom is not to take any place, save in those things only where the Church hath larger scope; it resteth that they search out some stronger reason then they have as yet alledged; otherwise they constrain not us to think that the Church is tyed unto any such rule axiom, not then when she hath the widest field to walk in, and the greate: store of choyce.</p>

The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they say, being ashamed of the simplicity of the Gospel, did almost out of all Religions take whatsoever had any fair and gorgeous shew, borrowing in that respect from the Jews sundry of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished Ceremonies. Thus by foolish and tidiculous imitation, all their Massing furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture almost they took from the Law, lest having an Altar and a Priest, they should want Vestments for their Stage; so that whatsoever we have in common with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the same be of this kind, we ought to remove it. <hi>Constantine the Emperor speaking of the keeping of the Feast of</hi> Easter, saith, <hi>That it is an unworthy thing to have any thing common with that most spiteful company of the Iews. And a little after he saith, That it is most absurd and against reason, that the Iews should vann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and glory that the Christians could not keep those things without their Doctrine. And in another place it is said after this sort; It is convenient so to order the matter, that we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common with that Nation. This Councel of</hi> Laodicea, <hi>which was afterward confirmed by the first General Councel, decreed that the Christians should not take anleavened Briad of the Iews, or communicate with their impiety.</hi> For the easier manifestation of truth in this point, two things there are which must be considered, namely the causes wherefore the Church should decline from <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies; and how far it ought so to do. One cause is, that the Jews were the deadliest and spitefullest Enemies of Christianity that were in the world, and in this respect their Orders so far forth to be shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66185:98"/>
as we have already set down in handling the Matter of Heathenish Ceremonies. For no enemies being so venemous against Christ as Jews, they were of all other, most odious, and by that mean, least to be used as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it Church Patterns for Imitation. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cause is, the Solemn Abrogation of the Jews Ordinances; which Ordinances, for us to resume, were to chock our Lord himself which hath disannulled them. But how far this second cause doth extend, it is not on all sides, fully agreed upon. And touching those things whereunto it reacheth not, although there be small cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church should frame it self to the Jews example, in respect of their persons which are most hateful; yet God himself having been the Author of their Laws, herein they are (notwithstanding the former consideration) still worthy to be honored, and to be followed above others, as much as the state of things will bear. Jewish Ordinances had some things Natural, and of the perperuity of those things no man doubteth. That which was Positive, we likewise know to have been by the coming of Christ, partly necessary not to be kept, and partly indifferent to be kept, or not. Of the former kinde, Circumcision and Sacrifice were. For this point, <hi>Stephen</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, and the Evidence which his Accusers brought against him in judgment, was, <hi>This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy Place, and the Law</hi>;<note place="margin">Acts 6. 13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>for we have heard him say, That this Iesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>shall destroy this place, and shall change the Ordinances that</hi> Moses <hi>gave us.</hi> True it is, that this Doctrine was then taught, which Unbelievers condemning for Blasphemy, did therein commit that which they did condemn.

The Christian Jews did think at the first, not onely themselves, but the Christian Gentiles also bound, and that necessarily, to observe the whole Law.<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> There went forth certain of the Sect of Pharisees which did believe; and they, coming unto <hi>Antioch,</hi> taught, that it was necessary for the Gentiles to be circumcised, and to keep the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Whereupon there grew dissention, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> disputing against them.<note place="margin">Acts 21.25.</note> The determination of the Council held at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> concerning this Matter, was finally this; <hi>Touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and determined, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no such thing:</hi> Their Protestation by Letters, is, <hi>For as much as we have heard, that certain which departed from us, have troubled you with words, and cumbred your mindes, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keep the Law; know, that we gave them no such Commandment. Paul</hi> therefore continued still teaching the Gentiles, not onely that they were not bound to observe the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> but that the observation of those Laws which were necessarily to be abrogated, was in them altogether unlawful. In which point, his Doctrine was mis-reported, as though he had every where Preached this, not onely concerning the Gentiles, but also touching the Jews. Wherefore coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iames,</hi> and the rest of the Clergy at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they told him plainly of it, saying, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 21. 20.</note>
                     <hi>Thou seest, Brother, how many thousand Iews there are which believe, and they are all zealous of the Law. Now they are informed of thee, that thou reachest all the Iews which are amongst the Gentiles, to forsake</hi> Moses, <hi>and sayest, that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to live after the Customs.</hi> And hereupon they gave him counsel to make it apparent in the eyes of all men, that those flying reports were untrue, and they himself being a Jew, kept the Law, even as they did. In some things therefore we see the Apostles did teach, That there ought not to be Conformity between the Christian Jews and Gentiles. How many things this Law of Inconformity did comprehend, there is no need we should stand to examine. This general is true, That the Gentiles were not made conformable unto the Jews, in that which was necessarily to cease at the coming of Christ. Touching things Positive,<note place="margin">Acts. 19. 20.</note> which might either cease or continue as occasion should require, the Apostles tendring the zeal of the Jews, thought it necessary to binde even the Gentiles for a time, to abstain as the Jews did, from things offered unto Idols, from Blood, from Strangled.<note place="margin">Acts 16.4.</note> These Decrees were every where delivered unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to be straightly observed and kept. In the other Matters where the Gentiles were free, and the Jews in their own opinion, still tied, the Apostles Doctrine unto the Jews,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66185:99"/>
was, <hi>Condemn not the Gentile</hi>; unto the Gentile, <hi>Despise not the Iew:</hi> The one sort,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> they warned to take heed, that scrupulosity did not make them rigorous, in giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised sentence against their Brethren which were free; the other, that they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come scandalous, by abusing their liberty and freedom to the offence of their weak Brethren which were scrupulous. From hence therefore, two Conclusions there are, which may evidently be drawn; the first, That whatsoever Conformity of Positive Laws, the Apostles did bring in between the Churches of Jews and Gentiles, it was in those things onely, which might either cease or continue a shorter or a longer time, as occasion did most require; the second, That they did not impose upon the Churches of the Gentiles, any part of the Jews Ordinances with Bond of necessary and perpetual observation (as we all, both by doctrine and practice, acknowledge) but onely in respect of the conveniency and fitness for the present state of the Church, as then it stood. The words of the Councils Decree, concerning the Gentiles, are, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no more burden, saving onely these things of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; Abstinence from Idol-off rings, from strangled, and Blood, and from Fornication.</hi> So that in other things Positive, which the coming of Christ did not necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish, the Gentiles were left altogether free. Neither ought it to seem unreasonable, that the Gentiles should necessarily be bound and tied to Jewish Ordinances, so far forth as that Decree importeth. For to the Jew, who knew, that their difference from other Nations, which were Aliens and Strangers from God, did especially consist in this, That Gods People had Positive Ordinances given to them of God himself; it seemed marvellous hard, that the Christian Gentiles should be incorporated into the same Commonwealth with Gods own chosen People, and be subject to no part of his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, more then onely the Law of Nature, which Heathens count themselves bound unto. It was an opinion constantly received amongst the Jews,<note place="margin">Lib. qui Seder Olam inscribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> that God did deliver unto the sons of <hi>Noah</hi> seven Precepts: Namely, To live in some Form of Regiment under; First,<note place="margin">

And peradventure hereupon, the Council saw it expedient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that the Gentiles should according unto the third, the seventh, and the fifth of those Precepts, abstain from things sacrificed unto Idols, from Strangled and Blood, and from Fornication. The rest, the Gentiles did of their own accord observe,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4. 1 Cor. 5. 11. Gal. 5. 19.</note> Nature leading them thereunto.

Words must be taken, according to the matter whereof they are uttered. The Apostles command to abstain from Blood. Construe this according to the Law of Nature, and it will seem that Homicide onely is forbidden. But construe it in reference to the Law of the Jews, about which the question was, and it shall easily appear to have a clean other sense, and in any mans judgment, a truer, when we expound it of eating, and not of shedding blood: So it we speak of Fornication, he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no Law, but onely the Law of Nature, must needs make thereof a narrower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, then he which measureth the same by a Law, wherein sundry kindes, even of Conjugal Copulation are prohibited as impure, unclean, unhonest.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.1.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself doth term Incestuous Marriage, Fornication. If any do rather think, that the Christian Gentiles themselves, through the loose and corrupt Custom of those times, took sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fornication for no Sin, and were in that respect offensive unto believing Jews, which by the Law had been better taught; Our proposing of another conjecture,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66185:99"/>
is unto theirs no prejudice. Some things therefore we see there were, wherein the Gentiles were forbidden to be like unto the Jews; some things wherein they were commanded not to be unlike. Again, some things also there were, wherein no Law of God did let, but that they might be either like or unlike; as occasion should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

                     <hi>Apostolical Ordinance (beloved) knowing that our Lord Iesus Christ came not into this world to undo the Law, hath in such sort distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished the Mysteries of the Old Testament, that certain of them it hath chosen one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit Evangelical knowledge withal, and for that purpose appointed, that those things which before were Iewish, might now be Christian Customs.</hi> The cause why the Apostles did thus conform the Christians as much as might be, according to the pattern of the Jews, was to rein them in by this mean the more, and to make them cleave the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Church of Christ, hath had in no one thing, so many and so contrary occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of dealing, as about Judaism; some having thought the whole Jewish Law wicked and damnable in it self; some not condemning it as the Former sort absolutely, have notwithstanding judged it, either sooner necessary to be abrogated, or further unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be observed then truth can bear; some of scrupulous simplicity urging per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and universal observation of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> necessary, as the Christian Jews at the first in the Apostles times; some as Hereticks, holding the same no less even after the contrary determination set down by consent of the Church at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; finally, some being herein resolute through meer infidelity; and with open profest enmity against Christ, as unbelieving Jews. To controul slanderers of the Law and Prophets, such as <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> were, the Church in her Liturgies hath intermingled with Readings out of the New Testament, Lessons taken out of the Law and Prophets; whereunto <hi>Tertullian</hi> alluding, saith of the Church of Christ,<note place="margin">

What an abusing also is it to affirm, the mangling of the Gospels and Epistles to have been brought into the Church by godly and learned Men? <hi>T. C.</hi> lib. 1. p. 216. Seeing that the office and function of Priests was after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christs Ascension naught and ungodly; the name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were called, which did exercise that ungodly function, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taken, then in the evil part.</note> 
                     <hi>It intermingleth with Evangelical and Apostolical Writings, the Law and the Prophets; and from thence it drinketh in that Faith which with Water is sealeth, cloatheth with the Spirit, nourisheth with Eucharist, with Martyrdom setteth forward.</hi> They would have wondred in those times to hear, that any man being not as Favorer of Heresie, should term this by way of disdain, <hi>Mangling of the Gospels and Epistles.</hi> They which honor the Law as an Image of the Wisdom of God himself, are notwithstanding to know that the same had an end in Christ. But what? Was the Law so abolished with Christ, that after his Ascension the Office of Priests, became immediately wicked, and the very name hateful, as importing the exercise of an ungodly function? No, as long as the glory of the Temple continued, and till the time of that final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation was accomplished, the very Christian Jews did continue with their Sacrifices, and other parts of Legal Service. That very Law therefore which our Saviour was to abolish, did not <hi>so soon</hi> become unlawful to be observed as some imagine; nor was it afterward unlawful <hi>so far,</hi> that the very name of Altar, of Priests, of Sacrifice it self, should be banished out of the World. For though God do now hate Sacrifice, whether it be Heathenish or Jewish, so that we cannot have the same things which they had, but with impiety; yet unless there be some greater let then the onely evacuation of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the names themselves may (I hope) be retained without sin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that proportion, which things established by our Saviour have unto them which by him are abrogated. And so throughout all the writings of the Ancient Fathers, we see that the words which were, do continue; the onely difference it, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had a literal, they now have a metaphorical use; and are as so many notes of remembrance unto us, that what they did signifie in the Letter, is accomplished in the Truth. And as no man can deprive the Church of this liberty, to use names where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Law was accustomed; so neither are we generally forbidden the use of things which the Law hath, though it neither command us any particularity, as it did the Jews a number; and the weightiest which it did command them, are unto us in the Gospel prohibited. Touching such, as through simplicity of error, did urge universal and perpetual observation of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> at the first, we have spoken already. Against Jewish He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and false Apostles teaching afterwards the self-same, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in every Epistle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly either disputeth or giveth warning. Jews that were zealous for the Law but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Infidels in respect of Christianity, and to the name of Jesus Christ most spightful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, did while they flourished, no less persecute the Church then Heathens; and after their Estate was overthrown, they were not that way so much to be feared. Howbeit, because
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66185:100"/>
they had their Synagogues in every famous City almost throughout the World. and by that means great opportunity to withdraw from the Christian Faith, which to do, they spared no labor; this gave the Church occasion to make sundry Laws against them. As, in the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>

For so they did from the first beginning till <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time. For in these two things, the East and West Churches did interchangeably both confront the Jews, and concur with them; the West Church using Unleavened Bread, as the Jews in their Passover did, but differing from them in the day whereon they kept the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi>; contrariwise, the East Church celebrating the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> on the same day with the Jews, but not using the same kinde of Bread which they did.

Difference in Rites should breed no controversie, between one Church and another; but if controversie be once bred, it must be ended. The Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> being therefore litigious in the days of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who honored of all other Churches most, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which Church was the Mother, from whose Brests he had drawn that food which gave him nourishment to eternal life; fith Agreement was necessary, and yet impossible, unless the one part were yielded unto; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was, that of the two, the Eastern Church should rather yield.

Concerning this point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are first to note, What properly it is, to be scandalous or offensive. Secondly, What kinde of Ceremonies are such. And thirdly, When they are necessarily for remedy thereof, to be taken away, and when not. The common conceit of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort is, Whensoever they see any thing which they mislike and are angry at, to think that every such thing is scandalous, and that themselves in this case are the men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom our Saviour spake in so fearful manner, saying,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 6.</note>

At good things evil men may take occasion to do evil; and so Christ himself was a Rock of Offence in <hi>Israel,</hi> they taking occasion at his poor estate, and at the ignominy of his Cross, to think him unworthy the Name of that Great and Glorious <hi>Mesias,</hi> whom the Prophets describe in such ample and stately terms. But that which we therefore term offensive, because it inviteth men to offend, and by a dumb kinde of provocation, encourageth, moveth, or any way leadeth unto sin, must of necessity be acknowledged actively scandalous. Now some things are so even by their very essence and nature, so that wheresoever they be found, they are not, neither can be without this force of provocation unto evil; of which kinde, all examples of sin and wickedness are. Thus <hi>David</hi> was scandalous, in that bloody act, whereby he caused the enemies of God to be blasphemous: Thus the whole state of <hi>Israel</hi> was scandalous; when their publick disorders caused the Name of God to be ill spoken of amongst the Nations: It is of this kinde that <hi>Tertullian</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Offence or scandal, if I be not deceived,</hi> saith he, <hi>is when the example not of a good, but of an evil thing, doth set men forward to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Yet that which is of it own nature, either good, or at least not evil; may by some accident become scandalous at certain times, and in certain places, and to certain men; the open use thereof, nevertheless, being otherwise without danger. The very Nature of some Rites and Ceremonies therefore is scandalous, as it was in a number of those which the <hi>Manichees</hi> did use, and is in all such as the Law of God doth forbid. Some are offensive onely through the Agreement of Men to use them unto evil, and not else; as the most of those things indifferent, which the Heathens did to the service of their false gods; which another, in heart condemning their Idolatry, could not do with them in shew and token of Approbation, without being guilty of scandal given. Ceremonies of this kinde, are either devised at the first unto evil; as the <hi>Eunomian</hi> Hereticks in dishonor of the Blessed Trinity, brought in the laying on of Water but once, to cross
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66185:101"/>
the custom of the Church, which in Baptism did it thrice: Or else having had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable use, they are afterwards interpreted and wrested to the contrary; as those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks which held the Trinity to be three distinct, not Persons, but Natures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused the Ceremony of three times laying on Water in Baptism, unto the strengthning of their Heresie. The Element of Water is in Baptism necessary; once to lay it on, or twice, is indifferent.

                     <hi>To dive an Insant, either thrice, or but once in Baptism, can be no way a thing reproveable; seeing that both in three times washing, the Trinity of Persons; and in one, the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head may be signified.</hi> So that of these two Ceremonies, neither being hurtful in it self, both may serve unto good purpose; yet one was devised, and the other convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto evil. Now whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> certain Ceremonies are said to have been shamefully abused unto evil, as the ceremony of Crossing at Baptism, of Kneeling at the Eucharist, of using Wafer-Cakes, and such like; the question is, Whether for remedy of that evil, wherein such Ceremonies have been scandalous, and perhaps may be still unto some, even amongst ourselves, whom the presence and sight of them may confirm in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are these, or any other Ceremonies we have common with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> scandalous and wicked in their very nature? This no man objecteth.

That which hath been ordained impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously at the first, may wear out that impiety in tract of time; and then, what doth let, but that the use thereof may stand without offence? The names of our Moneths and of our Days, we are not ignorant from whence they came, and with what dishonor unto God, they are said to have been devised at the first. What could be spoken against any thing more effectual to stir hatred, then that which sometime the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers in this case speak? Yet those very names are at this day in use through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christendom, without hurt or scandal to any.

So that customs once established and confirmed by long use, being presently without harm, are not in regard of their corrupt original to be held scandalous. But concerning those our Ceremonies which they reckon for most Popish, they are not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch that any of them was otherwise instituted, then unto good; yea, so used at the first. It followeth then, that they all are such as having served to good purpose, were afterwards converted unto the contrary. And sith it is not so much as objected against us, that we retain together with them, the evil wherewith they have been infected in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I would demand, Who they are whom we scandalize, by using harmless things unto that good end, for which they were first instituted. Amongst our selves that agree in the approbation of this kinde of good use, no man will say, that one of us is offensive and scandalous unto another. As for the favorers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they know how far we herein differ and dissent from them; which thing neither we conceal, and they by their publick writings also profess daily, how much it grieveth them: So that of them, there will not many rise up against us, as witnesses unto the Inditement of Scandal, whereby we might be condemned and cast, as having strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in that evil, wherewith they pollute themselves in the use of the same Ceremonies. And concerning such as withstand the Church of <hi>England</hi> herein, and hate it because it doth not sufficiently seem to hate <hi>Rome</hi>; they (I hope) are far enough from being by this mean drawn to any kinde of Popish Error. The multitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of them, unto whom we are scandalous through the use of abused Ceremonies, is not so apparent, that it can justly be said in general of any one sort of men or other, we cause them to offend. If it be so, that now or then some few are espied, who having been accustomed heretofore to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not so scoured of their former rust, as to forsake their antient perswasion which they have had, howsoever they frame themselves to outward obedience of Laws and Orders; because such may misconster the meaning of our Ceremonies, and so
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66185:101"/>
take them, as though they were in every sort the same they have been, Shall this be thought a reason sufficient whereon to conclude, that some Law must necessarily be made to abolish all such Ceremonies? They answer, that there is no Law of God which doth binde us to retain them. And St. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule is, that in those things from which without hurt we may lawfully abstain, we should frame the usage of our Liberty, with regard to the weakness and imbecillity of our Brethren. Wherefore unto them which stood upon their own defence, saying, <hi>All things are lawful unto me</hi>; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>But all things are not expedient</hi> in regard of others. All things are clean, all Meats are lawful; but evil unto that man that eateth offensively. If for thy meats sake, thy Brother be grieved, thou walkest no longer according to Charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. Dissolve not for foods sake the work of God. We that are strong, must bear the imbecillity of the impotent, and not please ourselves. It was a weakness in the Christian Jews, and a maim of judgment in them, that they thought the Gentiles polluted by the eating of those meats, which themselves were afraid to touch, for fear of transgressing the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; yea, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at their hearts did so much rise, that the Apostle had just cause to fear, lest they would rather forsake Christianity, then endure any fellowship with such, as made no conscience of that which was unto them abominable.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. &amp; 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> And for this cause mention is made of destroying the weak by meats, and of dissolving the work of God, which was his Church, a part of the Living Stones whereof, were believing Jews. Now those weak Brethren before mentioned are said to be as the Jews were, and our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which have been abused in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be as the scandalous Meats, from which the Gentiles are exhorted to abstain in the presence of Jews, for fear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting them from Christian Faith. Therefore as Charity did binde them to refrain from that, for their Brethrens sake, which otherwise was lawful enough for them; so it bindeth us for our Brethrens sake likewise, to abolish such Ceremonies, although we might lawfully else retain them. But between these two cases there are great odds. For neither are our weak Brethren as the Jews, nor the Ceremonies which we use as the meats which the Gentiles used. The Jews were known to be generally weak in that respect; whereas contrariwise the imbecillity of ours is not common unto so many, that we can take any such certain notice of them. It is a chance, if here and there some one be found; and therefore seeing we may presume men commonly otherwise, there is no necessity, that our practice should frame it self, by that which the Apostle doth prescribe to the Gentiles. Again, their use of meats was not like unto our Ceremonies;<note place="margin">Vile <hi>Harme.</hi> nop. lib. 1. cit. 1. sect. 28.</note> that being a matter of private action in common life, where every man was free to order that which himself did; but this a publick constitution for the ordering of the Church: And we are not to look, that the Church should change her publick Laws and Ordinances, made according to that which is judged ordinarily and commonly fittest for the whole, although it chance that for some particular men, the same be found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, especially when there may be other remedy also against the sores of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular incoveniences. In this case therefore, where any private harm doth grow, we are not to reject instruction, as being an unmeet plaister to apply unto it; neither can we say, that he which appointeth Teachers for Physicians in this kinde of evil, is,<note place="margin">

But the Ceremonies which Children do abuse, if we remove quite and clean, as it is by some required that we should; then are they not taken from Children onely, but from others also; which is as though, because Children may perhaps hurt themselves with Knives, we should conclude, that therefore the use of Knives is to be taken quite and clean even from men also. Those particular Ceremonies which they pretend to be so scandalous, we shall in the next Book have occasion more throughly to sift, where other things also traduced in the publick duties of the Church, whereunto each of these appertaineth, are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with these to be touched, and such Reasons to be examined as have at any time been brought, either against the one, or the other.<note n="*" place="margin">

For as much therefore as all the Churches</hi> (so far as they know which plead after this manner) <hi>of our Confession in Doctrine, agree in the Abrogation of divers things which we retain: Our Church ought, either to shew that they have done evil, or else she is found to be in fault that doth not conform her self in that, which she cannot deny to be well abrogated.</hi> In this Axiom, that Preservation of Peace and Unity amongst Christian Churches should be by all good means procured, we joyn most willingly and gladly with them. Neither deny we, but that, to the avoiding of Dissention, it availeth much, that there be amongst them an Unity as well in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66185:102"/>
Ceremonies as in Doctrine. The onely doubt is, about the manner of their Unity; How far Churches are bound to be Uniform in their Ceremonies, and what way they ought to take for that purpose. Touching the one, the Rule which they have set down, is, That in Ceremonies indifferent, all Churches ought to be, one of them unto another, as like as possibly they may be. Which possibly, we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise conster, then that it doth require them to be, even as like as they may be, without breaking any Positive Ordinance of God. For the Ceremonies whereof we speak, being Matter of Positive Law; they are indifferent, if God have neither himself commanded nor forbidden them, but left them unto the Churches discretion; so that if as great Uniformity be required as is possible in these things, seeing that the Law of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not any one of them; it followeth, that from the greatest unto the least, they must be in every Christian Church the same, except meer impossibility of so having it, be the hindrance. To us this Opinion seemeth over-extream and violent: We rather incline to think it a just and reasonable cause for any Church, the State whereof is free and independent; if in these things it differ from other Churches, onely for that it doth not judge it so fit and expedient, to be framed therein by the pattern of their example, as to be otherwise framed then they. That of <hi>Gregory</hi> unto <hi>Leander,</hi> is a charitable Speech, and a peaceable; <hi>In una side, nil officit Ecclesiae sancta consuetudo diversa. Where the Faith of the Holy Church is one, a difference in Customs of the Church doth no harm.</hi> That of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> to <hi>Cassulanus,</hi> is somewhat particular, and toucheth, what kinde of Ceremonies they are, wherein one Church may vary from the example of another, without hurt. <hi>Let the Faith of the whole Church, how wide soever it hath spred it self, be always one, although the Unity of Belief be famous for variety of certain Ordinances, whereby that which is rightly believed, suffereth no kinde of let or impediment. Calvin</hi> goeth further,<note place="margin">Respon. ad Med.</note> 
                     <hi>As concerning Rites in particular, let the sentence of</hi> Augustine <hi>take place, which leaveth it free unto all Churches to receive their own Custom. Yea, sometime it profiteth, and is expedient that there be difference, lest men should think that Religion is tyed to outward Ceremonies. Always provided, that there be not any emulation, nor that Churches, delighted with novelty, affect to have that which others have not.</hi> They which grant it true, That the diversity of Ceremonies in this kinde, ought not to cause dissension in Churches, must either acknowledge, that they grant in effect nothing by these words; or, if any thing be granted, there must as much be yielded unto, as we affirm against their former strict Assertion. For, if Churches be urged by way of duty, to take such Ceremonies as they like not of, How can dissension be avoided? Will they say, that there ought to be no dissension, because such as are urged, ought to like of that whereunto they are urged? If they say this, they say just nothing. For how should any Church like to be urged of duty, by such as have no authority or power over it, unto those things which being indifferent, it is not of duty bound unto them? Is it their meaning, that there ought to be no dissension, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that which Churches are not bound unto, no man ought by way of duty to urge upon them? And if any man do, he standeth in the sight both of God and Men most justly blameable, as a needless Disturber of the Peace of Gods Church, and an Author of Dissension. In saying this, they both condemn their own practice, when they press the Church of <hi>England</hi> with so strict a bond of duty in these things; and they overthrow the ground of their practice, which is, That there ought to be in all kinde of Ceremonies Uniformity, unless impossibility hinder it. For Proof whereof, it is not enough to alledge what St. <hi>Paul</hi> did about the Matter of Collections, or what Noblemen do in the Liveries of their Servants, or what the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did for Standing in time of Prayer on certain days: Because, though St. <hi>Paul</hi> did will them of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>

And seeing Churches are rather in this case like divers Families, then like divers servants of one Family, because every Church, the state whereof is independent upon any other, hath authority to appoint orders for it self in things indifferent; therefore of the two, we may rather infer, That as one Family is not abridged of liberty to be cloathed in Friers Gray, for that another doth wear Clay colour; so neither are all Churches bound to the self-same indifferent Ceremonies which it liketh sundry to use. As for that Canon in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> let them but read it, and weigh it well. The ancient use of the Church throughout all Christendom, was, for fifty days after <hi>Easter</hi> (which fifty days were called <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> though most commonly the last day of them, which is Whitsunday, he so called) in like sort, on all Sundays throughout the whole year, their manner was to stand at Prayer: Whereupon their meetings unto that purpose on those days, had the name of Stations given them. Of which Custom <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh in this wise, <hi>It is not with us thought sit, either to fast on the Lords day, or to pray kneeling. The same immunity from Fasting and Kneeling, we keep all the time which is between the Feasts of Easter and Pentecost.</hi> This being therefore an order generally received in the Church; when some began to be singular and different from all others, and that in a Ceremony which was then judged very convenient for the whole Church, even by the whole, those few excepted which break out of the common Pale; the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> thought good to enclose them again with the rest, by a Law made in this sort: <hi>Because there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which will needs kneel at the time of Prayer on the Lords day, and in the fifty days after Easter; the holy Synod judging it meet, that a convenient custom be observed throughout all Churches, hath decreed, That Standing we make our Prayers to the Lord.</hi> Whereby it plainly appeareth, that in things indifferent, what the whole Church doth think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the whole, the same if any part do wilfully violate, it may be reformed and inraised again by that general authority whereunto each particular is subject, and that the Spirit of singularity in a few, ought to give place unto publick judgment; this doth clearly enough appear, but not that all Christian Churches are bound in every indifferent Ceremony to be uniform; because where the whole Church hath not tyed the parts unto one and the same thing, they being therein left each to their own choice, may either do as others do, or else otherwise, without any breach of duty at all. Concerning those indifferent things, wherein it hath been heretofore thought good, that all Christian Churches should be uniform, the way which they now conceive to bring this to pass was then never thought on. For till now it hath been judged, that seeing the Law of God doth not prescribe all particular Ceremonies which the Church of Christ may use, and in so great variety of them as may be found out; it is not possible, That the Law of Nature and Reason should direct all Churches unto the same things, each deliberating by it self, what is most convenient: The way to establish the same things indifferent throughout them all, must needs be the judgment of some Judicial authority drawn into one onely sentence, which may be a rule for every particular to follow. And because such authority over all Churches, is too much to be granted unto any one mortal man; there yet remaineth that which hath been always followed, as the best, the safest, the most sincere and reasonable way; namely, the Verdict of the whole Church orderly taken, and set down in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of some General Council. But to maintain, That all Christian Churches ought for Unities sake to be uniform in all Ceremonies, and then to teach, that the way of bringing this to pass, must be by mutual imitation, so that where we have better
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66185:103"/>
Ceremonies then others, they shall be bound to follow us, and we them, where theirs are better: How should we think it agreeable and consonant unto reason? For sith in things of this nature, there is such variety of particular inducements, whereby one Church may be led to think that better, which another Church led by other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments judgeth to be worse: (For example, the East Church did think it better to keep <hi>Easter</hi> day after the manner of the Jews; the West Church better to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; the Greek Church judgeth it worse to use Unleavened Bread in the Eucharist, the Latine Church leavened: One Church esteemeth it not so good, to receive the Eucharist sitting as standing, another Church not so good standing as sitting, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one side probable Motives, as well as on the other) unless they add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else, to define more certainly what Ceremonies shall stand for best, in such sort, That all Churches in the World shall know them to be the best, and so know them, that there may not remain any question about this point, we are not a whit the nearer for that they have hitherto said, They themselves although resolved in their own judgments what Ceremonies are best, foreseeing that such as they are addicted unto, be not all so clearly and so incomparably best; but others there are, or may be, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when all things are well considered, as good; knew not which way smoothly to rid their hands of this matter, without providing some more certain rule to be followed for establishment of Uniformity in Ceremonies, when there are divers kindes of equal goodness: And therefore in this case they say, That the latter Churches, and the fewer, should conform themselves unto the elder, and the moe. Hereupon they conclude,<note place="margin">

If the Ceremonies be alike commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Churches shou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the first, &amp;c. And again, The fewer ought to conform themselves unto the more.</note> that for as much as all the Reformed Churches (so far as they know) which are of our Confession in Doctrine, have agreed already in the Abrogation of divers things which we retain: Our Church ought either to shew, that they have done evil, or else she is found to be in fault for not conforming her self to those Churches, in that which she cannot deny to be in them well abrogated. For the authority of the first Churches, (and those they account to be the first in this cause which were first Reformed) they bring the comparison of younger Daughters conforming themselves in attire to the example of their elder Sisters; wherein there is just as much strength of Reason, as in the Livery Coats beforementioned. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they say, noteth it for a mark of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honor, that <hi>Epanetus</hi> was the first man in all <hi>Athaia,</hi> which did embrace the Christian Faith; after the same sort, he toucheth it also as a special preheminence of <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Andronicus,</hi> that in Christianity they were his Ancients. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> he pincheth with this demand,<note place="margin">Rom. 16 5. 1 Cor. 14 35.</note> 
                     <hi>Hath the Word of God gone out from you, or hath it lighted on you alone?</hi> But what of all this? If any man should think that alacrity and forwardness in good things, doth add nothing unto mens commendation; the two former speeches of St. <hi>Paul</hi> might lead him to reform his judgment. In like sort to take down the stomach of proud conceited men, that glory, as though they were able to set all others to School, there can be nothing more fit, then some such words as the Apostles third sentence doth contain; wherein he teacheth the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to know, that there was no such great odds between them, and the rest of their Brethren, that they should think themselves to be Gold, and the rest to be but Copper. He therefore useth speech unto them to this effect: <hi>Men instructed in the knowledge of Iesus Christ there both were before you, and are besides you in the world; ye neither are the Fountain from which first, nor yet the River into which alone, the Word hath flowed.</hi> But although as <hi>Epanetus</hi> was the first man in all <hi>Achaia,</hi> so <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> had been the first Church in the whole World that received Christ; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth not shew, that in any kinde of things indifferent whatsoever, this should have made their example a Law unto all others. Indeed, the example of sundry Churches for approbation of one thing doth sway much; but yet still as having the force of an example onely, and not of a Law. They are effectual to move any Church, unless some greater thing do hinder; but they binde none, no not, though they be many; saving onely when they are the major part of a General Assembly, and then their voices being more in number, must over-sway their judgments who are fewer, because in such cases the greater half is the whole. But as they stand out single, each of them by it self, their number can purchase them no such authority, that the rest of the Churches being fewer, should be therefore bound to follow them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguish as good Ceremonies as theirs for theirs.

The Church of <hi>England</hi> being to alter her received Laws, concerning such Orders, Rites, and Ceremonies, as had been in former times an hinderance unto Piety and Religious Service of God, was to enter into consideration first, That the change of Laws, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning matter of Religion, must be warily proceeded in. Laws, as all other things humane, are many times full of imperfection, and that which is supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful unto men, proveth oftentimes most pernicious. The wisdom which is learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tract of time, findeth the Laws that have been in former ages established, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in latter to be abrogated. Besides, that which sometime is expedient, doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways so continue; and the number of needless Laws unabolished, doth weaken the force of them that are necessary. But true withal it is, that Alteration, though it be from worse to better, hath in it inconveniences, and those weighty; unless it bein such Laws as have been made upon special occasions, which occasions ceasing, Laws of that kinde do abrogate themselves. But when we abrogate a Law, as being ill made, the whole cause for which it was made still remaining; Do we not herein revoke our very own deed, and upbraid our selves with folly, yea, all that were makers of it, with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and with error? Further, if it be a Law which the custom and continual practice of many ages or years, hath consumed in the mindes of men; to alter it, must needs be troublesome and scandalous. It amazeth them, it causeth them to stand in doubt, whether any thing be in it self by nature, either good or evil; and not all things rather such as men at this or that time agree to account of them, when they behold even those things disproved, disannulled, rejected, which use had made in a manner natural. What have we to induce men unto the willing obedience and observation of Laws, but the weight of so many mens judgments, as have with deliberate advice assented thereunto; the weight of that long Experience, which the World hath had thereof, with consent and good liking? So that to change any such Law, must needs with the common sort impair and weaken the force of those Grounds, whereby all Laws are made effectual. Notwithstanding, we do not deny alteration of Laws to be sometimes a thing necessary; as when they are unnatural, or impious, or otherwise hurtful unto the Publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Men, and against that good for which Humane Societies were instituted. When the Apostles of our Lord and Saviour were ordained to alter the Laws of Heatherish Religion, received throughout the whole World; chosen I grant, they were (<hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:66185:104"/>
excepted) the rest ignorant, poor, simple, unschooled altogether, and unlettered men; howbeit, extraordinarily endued with ghostly Wisdom from above, before they ever undertook this Enterprise, yea, their authority confirmed by Miracle, to the end; it might plainly appear, that they were the Lords Ambassadors, unto whose Soveraign power for all flesh to stoop, for all the Kingdoms of the Earth to yield themselves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conformable in whatsoever should be required, it was their duty. In this case therefore, their oppositions in maintenance of Publick Superstition against Apostolick endeavors, as that they might not condemn the ways of their ancient Predecessors, that they must keep <hi>Religiones Traditas,</hi> the Rites which from age to age had descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Ceremonies of Religion had been ever accounted by so much holier as elder; these, and the like Allegations in this case, were vain and frivolous. Not to stay longer therefore in speech concerning this point, we will conclude, That as the change of such Laws, as have been specified is necessary, so the evidence, that they are such, must be great. If we have neither voice from Heaven, that so pronounceth of them; neither sentence of men grounded upon such manifest and clear proof, that they in whose hands it is to alter them, may likewise infallibly even in heart and conscience judge them so, upon necessity to urge alteration, is to trouble and disturb without necessity. As for Arbitrary Alterations; when Laws in themselves not simply bad or unmeet, are changed for better and more expedient, if the benefit of that which is newly better devised, be but small, sith the custom of easiness to alter and change, is so evil, no doubt, but to bear a tolerable sore, is better then to venter on a dangerous remedy. Which being generally thought upon, as a matter that touched nearly their whole enterprize, whereas change was notwithstanding concluded necessary, in regard of the great hurt which the Church did receive by a number of things then in use, whereupon a great deal of that which had been, was now to be taken away and removed out of the Church; yet sith there are divers ways of abrogating things esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, they saw it best to cut off presently such things, as might in that sort be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished without danger, leaving the rest to be abolished by disusage through tract of time. And as this was done for the manner of Abrogation; so touching the stint or measure thereof, Rites and Ceremonies, and other external things of like nature being hurtful unto the Church, either in respect of their quality, or in regard of their number; in the former, there could be no doubt or difficulty, what should be done; their deliberation in the latter was more hard. And therefore in as much as they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to remove onely such things of that kinde as the Church might best spare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the residue, their whole Counsel is in this point utterly condemned, as having either proceeded from the blindness of those times, or from negligence, or from desire of honor and glory, or from an erroneous opinion, that such things might be tolerated for a while; or if it did proceed (as they which would seem most favorable, are content to think it possible) from a purpose, <hi>partly the easilier to draw Papists unto the Gospel,</hi>

But such is the lot of all that deal in Publick Affairs, whether of Church or Commonwealth, that which men list to surmise of their doings, being it good or ill, they must beforehand, patiently aim their mindes to endure. Wherefore to let go private surmises, whereby the thing in it self is not made, either better or worse; if just and allowable Reasons might lead them to do as they did, then are all these censures frustrate. Touching Ceremonies harmless therefore in themselves, and hurtful onely in respect of number: Was it amiss to decree, That those things which were least needful, and newliest come, should be the first that were taken away; as in the abrogating of a number of Saints days, and of other the like custom it appeareth they did, till afterwards the Form of Common Prayer being perfected, Articles of sound Religion and Discipline agreed upon, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisms framed for the needful instruction of Youth, Churches purged of things that indeed were but thensom to the people, or to the simple offensive and scandalous, all was brought at the length unto that wherein now we stand? Or was it amiss, that having this way eased the Church, as they thought of superfluity, they went not on till they had plucked up even those things also, which had taken a great deal stronger and deeper root, those things, which to abrogate without constraint of manifest harm

thereby arising, had been to alter unnecessarily (in their judgments) the antient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived custom of the whole Church, the universal practice of the people of God, and those very decrees of our Fathers, which were not onely set down by agreement of General Councils,<note place="margin">

True it is, That neither Councils nor Customs, be they never so ancient and so general, can let the Church from taking away that thing which is hurtful to be retained. Where things have been instituted, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and good at the first, do afterward in process of time wax otherwise; we make no doubt, but they may be altered, yea, though Councils or Customs General have received them. And therefore it is but a needless kinde of opposition which they make, who thus dispute,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>If in those things which are not expressed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is to be observed of the Church, which is the custom of the people of God, and decree of our Forefathers; then how can these things at any time be varied, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore have been once ordained in such sort?</hi> Whereto we say, that things so ordained are to be kept, howbeit not necessarily, any longer then till there grow some urgent cause to ordain the contrary. For there is not any Positive Law of Men, whether it be general or particular, received by formal express consent, as in Councils; or by secret approbation, as in Customs it cometh to pass; but the same may be taken away if occasion serve. Even as we all know, that many things generally kept heretofore, are now in like sort generally unkept and abolished every where. Nothwithstanding till such things be abolished, what exception can there be taken against the judgment of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who saith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That of things harmless, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever there is which the whole Church doth observe throughout the World, to argue for any mans immunity from observing the same, it were a point of most insolent madness?</hi> And surely, odious it must needs have been for one Christian Church, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish that which all had received and held for the space of many ages, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any detriment unto Religion, so manifest, and so great, as might in the eyes of unpartial men, appear sufficient to clear them from all blame of rash and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate proceeding, if in servor of zeal they had removed such things. Whereas contrariwise so reasonable Moderation herein used, hath freed us from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly subject unto that bitter kinde of obloquy, whereby as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth under the colour of love towards those things which be harmless, maintain extreamly most hurtful corruptions; so we peradventure might be upbraided, that under colour of hatred towards those things that are corrupt, we are on the other side as extream, even against most harmless Ordinances; and as they are obstinate to retain that, which no man of any conscience is able well to defend: So we might be reckoned fierce and violent, to tear away that which if our own mouths did condemn, our consciences would storm and repine thereat. The <hi>Romans</hi> having banished <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the Proud, and taken a Solemn Oath, that they never would permit any man more to reign, could not herewith content themselves, or think that Tyranny was throughly extinguished, till they had driven one of their Consuls to depart the City, against whom they found not in the world what to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject saving onely that his name was <hi>Tarquine,</hi> and that the Commonwealth could not seem to have recovered perfect freedom, as long as a man of so dangerous a name was left remaining.<note place="margin">

This kinde of proceeding might happily have pleased some few men, who having begun such a course themselves, must needs be glad to see their example followed by us. But the Almighty which giveth wisdom, and inspireth with right understanding whomsoever it pleaseth him, he foreseeing that which mans wit had never been able to reach unto; namely, what Tragedies the attempt of so extream alteration would raise in some parts of the Christian

World, did for the endless good of his Church (as we cannot chuse but interpret it) use the Bridle of his Provident restraining hand, to stay those eager affections in some, and to settle their resolution upon a course more calm and moderate; lest as in other most ample and heretofore most flourishing Dominions it hath since faln out, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if in ours it had come to pass, that the adverse part being enraged, and betaking it self to such practices, as men are commonly wont to embrace, when they behold things brought to desperate extremities, and no hope left to see any other end, them onely the utter oppression and clean extinguishment of one side: By this mean Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom flaming in all parts of greatest importance at once, they all had wanted that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of mutual relief, whereby they are now for the time sustained (and not the least by this our Church, which they so much impeach) till Mutual Combustions, Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheds and Wastes (because no other enducements will serve) may enforce them through very faintness, after the experience of so endless miseries, to enter on all sides at the length into some such consultation, as may tend to the best re-establishment of the whole Church of Jesus Christ, To the singular good whereof, it cannot but serve as a profitable direction, to teach men what is most likely to prove available, when they shall quietly consider the tryal that hath been thus long had of both kindes of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; as well this moderate kinde which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath taken, as that other more extream and rigorous, which certain Churches elswhere have better liked. In the mean while it may be, that suspence of judgment and exercise of Charity were safer and seemlier for Christian men, then the hot pursuit of these Controversies, wherein they that are more fervent to dispute, be not always the most able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But who are on his side, and who against him, our Lord in his good time shall reveal. And sith thus far we have proceeded in opening the things that have been done, let not the principal doers themselves be forgotten. When the ruines of the House of God (that House which consisting of Religious Souls, is most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the precious Temple of the Holy Ghost) were become not in his sight alone, but in the eyes of the whole World so exceeding great, that very Superstition began even to feel it self too far grown; the first that with us made way to repair the decays thereof, by beheading Superstition, was King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the Son and Successor of which famous King, as we know, was <hi>Edward</hi> the Saint: In whom (for so, by the event we may gather) it pleased God Righteous and Just to let <hi>England</hi> see, what a blessing sin and iniquity would not suffer it to enjoy. Howbeit, that which the Wiseman hath said concerning <hi>Enoch</hi> (whose days were, though many in respect of ours, yet scarce, as three to nine in comparison of theirs with whom he lived) the same to that admirable childe most worthily may be applied, <hi>Though he departed this world soon yet fulfilled be much time.</hi> But what ensued? That work, which the one in such sort had begun, and the other so far proceeded in, was in short space so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, as if almost it had never been: Till such time as that God, whose property is to shew his mercies then greatest when they are nearest to be utterly despaired of, caused in the depth of discomfort and darkness a most glorious Star to arise, and on her head setled the Crown, whom himself had kept as a Lamb from the slaughter of those bloody times, that the experience of his goodness in her own deliverance, might cause her merciful disposition, to take so much the more delight, in saving others, whom the like necessity should press. What in this behalf hath been done towards Nations abroad, the parts of Christendom most afflicted can best testifie. That which especially concerneth our selves in the present matter we treat of, is, the state of Reformed Religion, a thing at her coming to the Crown, even raised, as it were, by miracle from the dead; a thing which we so little hoped to see, that even they which beheld it done, searcely believed their own senses at the first beholding. Yet being then brought to pass, thus many years it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued standing by no other wordly mean, but that one onely hand which erected it, that hand, which as no kinde of imminent danger could cause at the first to withhold it self; so neither have the practises, so many, so bloody, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing since, been ever able to make weary. Nor can we say in this case so justly, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> the Ecclesiastical and Civil States, have sustained the hand which did lift it self to Heaven for them; as that Heaven it self hath by this hand sustained them, no aid or help having thereunto been ministred for performance of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66185:106"/>
the Work of Reformation, other then such kinde of help or aid, as the Angel in the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> speaketh of, saying, <hi>Neither by an army, nor strength, but by my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Which Grace and Favor of Divine Assistance, having not in one thing or two, shewed it self, nor for some few days or years appeared, but in such sort so long continued, our manifold sins and transgressions striving to the contrary; What can we less thereupon conclude, then that God would at leastwise by tract of time teach the World, that the thing which he blesseth, defendeth, keepeth so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot chuse but be of him? Wherefore, if any refuse to believe us disputing for the Verity of Religion established, let then believe God himself thus miraculously working for it, and with life, even for ever and ever, unto that Glorious and Sacred Instrument whereby he worketh.</p>

First, By the bitter strife which riseth oftentimes from small differences in this behalf, and is by so much always greater, as the matters is of more importance; we see a general agreement in the secret opinion of men, that every man ought to embrace the Religion which is true; and to shun, as hurtful, whatsoever dissenteth from it, but that most, which doth farthest dissent.

By their means it became a received opinion, that the Souls of Men departing this life, do slit out of one Body into some other. Which opinion, though false, yet entwined with a true, that the Souls of Men do never perish, abated the fear of death in them which were so resolved, and gave them courage unto all adventures. The <hi>Romans</hi> had a vain superstitious custom, in most of their enterprises, to conjecture before hand of the event, by certain tokens which they noted in Birds, or in the Intrails of Beasts, or by other the like frivolous Divinations. From whence notwithstanding as oft as they could receive any sign, which they took to be favorable, it gave them such hope, as if their gods had made them more then half a promise of prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Which many times was the greatest cause that they did prevail, especially being men of their own natural inclination, hopeful and strongly conceited, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they took in hand. But could their fond Superstition have furthered so great attempts, without the mixture of a true perswasion, concerning the unresistable force of Divine Power? Upon the wilful violation of Oaths, execrable Blasphemies, and like contempts, offered by Deriders of Religion, even unto false gods, fearful tokens of Divine Revenge have been know to follow. Which occurrents the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouter sort did take for manifest Arguments, that the gods whom they worshipped, were of power to reward such as sought unto them, and would plague those that feared them not. In this they erred. For (as the <hi>Wise man</hi> rightly noteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such) it was not the power of them by whom they sware,<note place="margin">2. Wisd. 14.13.</note> but the vengeance of them that sinned, which punished the offences of the ungodly. It was their hurt untruly to attribute so great power unto false gods. Yet the right conceit which they had, that to perjury vengeance is due, was not without good effect, as touching the course of their lives, who feared the wilful violation of Oaths in that respect. And whereas we read so many of them so much commended, some for their milde and merciful disposition, some for their vertuous severity, some for integrity of life, all these were the fruits of true and infallible principles delivered unto us in the World of God, as the Axioms of our Religion, which being imprinted by the God of Nature in their hearts also, and taking better root in some them in most others, grew, though not from, yet with and amidst the heaps of manifold repugnant Errors; which Errors of corrupt Religion, had also their suitable effects in the lives of the self-same parties. Without all controversie, the purer and perfecter our Religion is, the worthier effects it hath in them, who stedfastly and sincerely embraceit, in others not. They that love the Religion which they prosess, may have failed in choice, but yet they are sure to reap what benefit the same is able to afford, whereas the best and foundest professed by them that bear it not the like affection, yieldeth them, retaining it in that sort, no benefit. <hi>David</hi> was a Man after Gods own heart, so termed, because his affection was hearty towards God. Beholding the like dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in, them which lived under him, it was his Prayer to Almighty God,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 19. 17.</note>

Seeing therefore it doth thus appear, that the safety of all Estates dependeth upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that Religion unfeignedly loved, perfecteth mens abilities unto all kindes of vertuous Services in the Commonwealth; that mens desire in general is to hold no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the true; and that whatsoever good effects do grow out of their Religion, who embrace instead of the true, a false, the Roots thereof are certain sparks of the Light of Truth, intermingled with the darkness of Error; because no Religion can wholly and onely consist of untruths, we have Reason to think, That all true Vertues are to honor true Religion as their Parent, and all well ordered Commonweals to love her as their chiefest stay.</p>

Zeal, unless it be rightly guided, when it endeavoreth most busily to please God, forceth upon him those unseasonable offices which please him not. For which cause, if they who this way swerve, be compared with such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, found, and discreet, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was in Matter of Religion; the service of the one, is like unto slattery; the other, like the faithful sedulity of friendship. Zeal,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 7. <hi>Abraham</hi> thy friend.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be ordered aright, when it bendeth it self unto conflict with all things, either in deed, or but imagined to be opposite unto Religion, useth the Razor many times with such eagerness, that the very life of Religion it self is thereby hazarded, through hatred

of Tares, the Corn in the Field of God is plucked up. So that, Zeal needeth both ways a sober guide, Fear, on the other side, if it have not the light of true understanding concerning God, wherewith to be moderated, breedeth likewise Superstition. It is therefore dangerous, that in things Divine, we should work too much upon the spur, either of zeal or fear. Fear is a good Solicitor to Devotion. Howbeit, sith fear in this kinde doth grow from an apprehension, of Deity endued with irresistable power to hurt, and is of all affections (anger excepted) the unaptest to admit any conference with Reason, for which cause the Wise man doth say of Fear, that it is a betrayer of<note place="margin">Wisd. 19. 11.</note> the forces of reasonable understanding; therefore, except men know beforehand what manner of service pleaseth God, while they are fearful, they try all things which fancy offereth. Many there are who never think on God, but when they are in extremity of fear; and then because, what to think, or what to do, they are uncertain, perplexity not suffering them to be idle, they think and do, as it were in a phrensie, they know not what. Superstition neither knoweth the right kinde, nor observeth the due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of actions belonging to the Service of God, but is always joyned with a wrong opinion touching things Divine. Superstition is, when things are either abhorred or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, with a zealous or fearful, but erroneous relation to God. By means whereof, the superstitious do sometimes serve, though the true God, yet with needless offices, and defraud him of duties necessary; sometime load others then him with such honors as properly are his. The one, their over sight who miss in the choice of that wherewith they are affected; the other, theirs who fail in the election of him towards whom they shew their devotion: This, the crime of Idolatry; that, the fault of voluntary, either niceness or superfluity in Religion. The Christian World it self being divided into two grand parts, it appeareth by the general view of both, that with Master of Heresie the West hath been often and much troubled; but the East part never quiet, till the deluge of misery, wherein now they are, overwhelmed them. The chiefest cause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth seem to have lien in the restless wits of the Grecians, evermore proud of their own curious and subtile inventions; which when at any time they had contrived; the great facility of their Language served them readily to make all things fair and plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mens understanding. Those grand Heretical Impieties therefore, which most highly and immediately touched God, and the glorious Trinity, were all in a manner the Monsters of the East. The West bred fewer a great deal, and those commonly of a lower nature, such as more nearly and directly concerned rather men then God, the Latines being always to capital Heresies less inclined, yet unto gross Superstition more. Superstition,<note place="margin">Mark 7.5.</note> such as that of the Pharisees was, by whom Divine things indeed were less, because other things were more divinely esteemed of, then Reason would; the Superstition that riseth voluntarily, and by degrees, which are hardly discerned, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling it self with the Rites, even of very Divine Service, done to the onely true God, must be considered of, as a creeping and incroaching evil; an evil, the first beginnings whereof are commonly harmless, so that it proveth onely then to be an evil, when some farther accident doth grow unto it, or it self come unto farther growth. For in the Church of God, sometimes it cometh to pass, as in over-battle grounds, the Fertile disposition whereof is good; yet because it exceedeth due proportion, it bringeth forth abundantly, through too much rankness, things less profitable; whereby, that which principally it should yield, being either prevented in place, or defrauded of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, faileth. This (if so large a discourse were necessary) might be exemplified even by heaps of Rites and Customs, now superstitious in the greatest part of the Christian World; which in their first original beginnings, when the strength of vertuous, devout, or charitable affection bloomed them, no man could justly have condemned as evil.</p>

But howsoever Superstition doth grow; that wherein unsounder times have done amiss, the better ages ensuing must rectifie as they may. I now come therefore to those accusations brought against us by Pretenders of Reformation; the first in the rank whereof, is such, That if so be the Church of <hi>England</hi> did at this day, therewith as justly deserve to be touched as they in this cause have imagined it doth; rather would I exhort all sorts to seek pardon, even with tears, at the hands of God, then meditate words of defence for our doings, to the end, that men might think favorably of them. For as the case of this World, especially now, doth stand, what other stay or succor
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66185:110"/>
have we to lean unto, saving the testimony of our Conscience, and the comfort we take in this, that we serve the living God (as near as our Wits can reach unto the knowledge thereof) even according to his own will, and do therefore trust, that his mercy shall be our safeguard against those enraged Powers abroad, which principally in that respect are become our Enemies? But, sith no man can do ill with a good Conscience, the consolation which we herein seem to finde, is but a meer deceitful pleasing of our selves in errour, which at the length must needs turn to our greater grief, if that which we do to please God most, be for the manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof offensive unto him. For so it is judged, our Prayers, our Sacraments, our Fasts, our Times and Places of Publick meeting together for the worship and service of God; our Marriages, our Burials, our Functions, Elections, and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Ecclesiastical, almost whatsoever we do in the exercise of our Religion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Laws for that purpose established, all things are some way or other thought faulty, all things stained with Superstition. Now, although it may be the wiser sort of men are not greatly moved hereat, considering how subject the very best things have been always unto cavil, when Wits possessed either with disdain or dislike there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have set them up as their mark to shoot at: safe notwithstanding it were not, therefore to neglect the danger which from hence may grow, and that especially in regard of them, who desiring to serve God as they ought, but being not so skilful as in every point to unwinde themselves where the shares of glosing speech do lye to intangle them, are in minde not a little troubled, when they hear so bitter inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives against that which this Church hath taught them to reverence as holy, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as lawful, and to observe as behoveful, for the exercise of Christian duty. It seemeth therefore, at least for their sakes, very meet, that such as blame us in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, be directly answered, and they which follow us, informed plainly in the Reasons of that we do. On both sides, the end intended between us, is to have Laws and Ordinances, such as may rightly serve to abolish Superstition, and to establish the service of God with all things thereunto appertaining, in some perfect form. There is an inward (<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12. 1</note>)reasonable, and there is a (<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 1. 23.</note>)solemn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward serviceable Worship, belonging unto God. Of the former kinde are all manner of vertuous Duties, that each man in reason and conscience to God-ward oweth. Solemn and serviceable Worship we name for Distinction sake, whatsoever belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Church or Publick Society of God by way of External adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this later being ordered, partly, and as touching Principal matters, by none but Precepts Divine only; partly, and as concerning things of Inferiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, by Ordinances as well Human as Divine, about the substance of Religion, wherein Gods only Law must be kept, there is here no controversie: the Crime now intended against us is, that our Laws have not ordered those inferiour things as behoveth, and that our Customs are either Superstitious, or otherwise amiss, whether we respect the exercise of Publick duties in Religion, or the Functions of Persons autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised thereunto.</p>

For to this end they also propose, touching Customs and Rites indifferent, their general Axioms, some of them subject unto just Exceptions, and, as we think, more meet by them to be farther considered, than assented unto by us.

glorifie God, and edifie his Church, what not; when we should think them decent and fit, when otherwise: because these Rules being too general, come not near enough unto the matter which we have in hand; and the former Principles being nearer the purpose, are too far from Truth; we must propose unto all men certain Petitions inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and very material in Causes of this nature, such as no man of moderate judgment hath cause to think unjust or unreasonable.</p>

The first thing therefore which is of force to cause Approbation with good conscience towards such Customs or Rites, as publickly are established, is, when there ariseth from the due consideration of those Customs and Rites in themselves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent reason, although not alwayes to prove them better than any other that might possibly be devised, (for who did ever require this in man's Ordinances?) yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to shew their conveniency and fitness, in regard of the use for which they should serve. Now touching the nature of religious Services, and the manner of their due performance, thus much generally we know to be most clear, that whereas the greatness and dignity of all manner of Actions is measured by the worthiness of the Subject from which they proceed, and of the Object whereabout they are conversant, we must of necessity in both respects acknowledge, that this present World affordeth not any thing comparable unto the publick Duties of Religion. For if the best things have the perfectest and best operations; it will follow, that seeing Man is the worthiest Creature upon earth, and every Society of Men more worthy than any Man; and of Societies that most excellent which we call the Church; there can be in this World no work performed equal to the exercise of true Religion, the proper operation of the Church of God. Again, forasmuch as Religion worketh upon him, who in Majesty and Power is infinite, as we ought we account not of it, unless we esteem it even according to that very height of Excellency which our hearts conceive,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 24. Wisd. 6. 10. 1 Chron. 29. 19.</note> when Divine sublimity it self is rightly considered. In the powers and faculties of our Souls God requireth the uttermost which our unfeigned affection towards him is able to yield: So that if we affect him not farr above and before all things, our Religion hath not that inward perfection which it should have, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we indeed worship him as our God. That which inwardly each man should be, the Church outwardly ought to testifie. And therefore the Duties of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which are seen, must be such as that affection which is unseen ought to be Signs must resemble the Things they signifie.

These varieties are not known but by much experience, from whence to draw the true bounds of all Principles, to discern how farr forth they take effect, to see where and why they fail, to apprehend by what degrees and means they lead to the practise of things in show, though not indeed repugnant and contrary one to another, requireth more sharpness of Wit, more intricate circuitions of Discourse, more industry and depth of Judgment, than common Ability doth yield. So that general Rules, til their limits be fully known, (especially in matter of Publick and Ecclesiastical affairs) are, by reason of the manifold secret Exceptions which lye hidden in them, no other to the eye of man's understanding, than Cloudy mists cast before the eye of Common sense. They that walk in darkness know not whither they go. And even as little is their certainty, whose opinions Generalities only do guide. With gross and popular Capacities nothing doth more prevail, than unlimited Generalities, because of their plainness at the first fights nothing less with men of Exact Judgment, because such Rules are not safe to be trusted over-farr. General Laws are like general Rules of Physick, according whereunto, as no Wise man will desire himself to be cured, if there be joyned with his Disease some special Accident, in regard whereof that whereby others in the same Insirmity, but without the like Accident, recover health, would be to him either hurtful, or at the least unprofitable: So we must not, under a colourable commendation of holy Ordinances in the Church, and of reasonable causes whereupon they have been grounded for the Common good, imagine that all men's cases ought to have one measure. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out singular wisdom therefore it hath been provided, That as the ordinary course of Common affairs is disposed of by General Laws, so likewise mens rarer incident Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities and utilities should be with special equity considered. From hence it is, that so many Priviledges, Immunities, Exceptions, and Dispensations have been always with great equity and reason granted, not to turn the edge of Justice, not to make void at certain times, and in certain men, through meer voluntary grace or benevolence, that which continually and universally should be of force (as some men understand it) but in very truth to practise General Laws according to their right meaning. We see in Contracts, and other dealings which daily pass between man and man, that, to the utter undoing of some, many things by strictness of Law may be done, which equity and honest meaning forbiddeth. Not that the Law is unjust, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; nor Equity against, but above the Law; binding mens Consciences in things which Law cannot reach unto. Will any man say, That the vertue of private Equity is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66185:113"/>
opposite and repugnant to that Law, the silence whereof it supplieth in all such private Dealing? No more is publick Equity against the Law of publick Affaires; albeit the one permit unto some, in special Considerations, that which the other, agreeably with general Rules of Justice, doth in general sort forbid. For, sith all good Laws are the Voyces of right Reason, which is the Instrument wherewith God will have the World guided; and impossible it is, that Right should withstand Right; it must follow, that Principles and Rules of Justice, be they never so generally uttered, do no less effectually intend, then if they did plainly express an Exception of all Particulars, wherein their literal Practise might any way prejudice Equity. And because it is natural unto all men to wish their own extraordinary Benefit, when they think they have reasonable Inducements so to do; and no man can be presumed a competent Judge what Equity doth require in his own Case: the likeliest Mean whereby the wit of man can provide, that he which useth the benefit of any special benignity above the common course of others, may enjoy it with good Conscience, and not against the true purpose of Laws, which in outward shew are contrary, must needs be to arm with Authority some fit both for Quality and Place to administer that, which in every such particular shall appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with Equity: wherein, as it cannot be denyed, but that sometimes the practise of such Jurisdiction may swarve through errour even into the very best, and for other respects, where less Integrity is. So the watchfullest Observers of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that way growing, and the readiest to urge them in disgrace of authorized Proceedings, do very well know, that the disposition of these things resteth not now in the hands of Popes, who live in no Worldly awe or subjection, but is committed to them whom Law may at all times bridle, and Superiour power controll; yea to them also in such sort, that Law it self hath set down, to what Persons, in what Causes, with what Circumstances, almost every faculty or favour shall be granted, leaving in a manner nothing unto them, more than only to deliver what is already given by Law. Which maketh it by many degrees less reasonable, that under pretence of inconveniences so easily stopped, if any did grow, and so well prevented, that none may, men should be altogether barred of the liberty that Law with equity and reason grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. These things therefore considered, we lastly require, That it may not seem hard, if in Cases of Necessity, or for Common utilities sake, certain profitable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances sometimes be released, rather than all men, always, strictly bound to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rigor thereof.</p>

Which thing they did at the Emperors motion, each most willingly setting forth that Action to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, some with Orations, some with Sermons, some with the sacrifice of Prayers unto God for the peace of the World, for the Churches safety, for the Emperour's and his Childrens good.

So that whether Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours or Bishops in those days were Church-founders, the solemn Dedication of Churches they thought not to be a work in it self either vain, or superstitious. Can we judge it a thing seemly for any man to go about the building of an House to the God of Heaven with no other appearance, than if his end were to rear up a Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, or Parlour, for his own use? Or when a work of such nature is finished, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there nothing but presently to use it; and so an end? It behoveth that the place where God shall be served by the whole Church, be a publick place, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Privy Conventicles, which, covered with pretence of Religion, may serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangerous practises. Yea, though such Assemblies be had indeed for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake; hurtful nevertheless they may easily prove, as well in regard of their fitness to serve the turn of Hereticks, and such as privily will soonest adventure to instill their poyson into mens minds; as also for the occasion, which thereby is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to malicious persons, both of suspecting, and of traducing with more coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shew those Actions, which in themselves being holy, should be so ordered, that no man might probably otherwise think of them. Which considerations have by so much the greater waight, for that of these inconveniences the Church heretofore had so plain experience when Christian men were driven to use Secret Meetings, because the liberty of Publick places was not granted them. There are which hold, that the presence of a Christian multitude, and the Duties of Religion performed amongst them, do make the place of their Assembly publick; even as the presence of the King and his Retinue maketh any mans House a Court. But this I take to be an errour, in as much as the only thing which maketh any Place publick, is the publick assignment thereof unto such Duties. As for the Multitude there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, or the Duties which they perform, it doth not appear how either should be of force to insuse any such Prerogative. Not doth the solemn Dedication of Churches serve only to make them publick, but farther also to surrender up that right which otherwise their Founders might have in them, and to make God himself their Owner.

Again, <hi>The Nations to their Gods erected Temples, we not Temples unto our Martyrs as unto Gods, but Memorials as unto dead men, whose spirits with God are still living.</hi> Divers considerations there are, for which Christian Churches might first take their names of Saints: as either because by the Ministry of Saints it pleased God there to shew some rare effect of his power; or else in regard of death, which those Saints having suffered for the testimony of Jesus Christ, did thereby make the places where they dyed vénerable; or thirdly, for that it liked good and vertuous men to give such occasion of mentioning them often, to the end that the naming of their Persons might cause enquiry to be made, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation to be had of their vertues. Wherefore, seeing that we cannot justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it Superstition, to give unto Churches those sore-reheased names, as memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials either of holy Persons or Things; if it be plain that their Founders did with such meaning name thém, shall not we, in otherwise taking them, offer them inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Or if it be obscure or uncertain what they meant, yet this construction being more favourable, Charity (I hope) constraineth no man which standeth doubtful of their minds, to lean to the hardest and worst interpretation that their words can carry. Yea, although it were clear, that they all (for the error of some is manifest in this behalf) had therein a supertitious intent, Wherefore should their fault preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice us, who (as all men know) do use by way of mere Distinction the names which they of Superstition gave? In the use of those names whereby we distinguish both days and months, are we culpable of Superstition, because they were, who first invented them?

So far forth as our Churches and their Temple have one end, What should lett, but that they may lawfully have one from? The Temple was for Sacrifice, and therefore had Rooms to that purpose, such as ours have none. Our Churches are places provided, that the people might there assemble themselves in due and decent manner, according to their several degrees and orders. Which thing being common unto us with Jews, we have in this respect our Churches divided by certain partitions, although not so many in number as theirs. They had their several for Heathen Nations, their several for the people of their own Nation, their several for Men, their several for Women, their several for their Priests, and for the High Priest alone their several. There being in ours for local distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the Clergy and the rest (which yet we do not with any great strictness or curiosity observe neither) but one partition, the cause whereof at the first (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) was, that as many as were capable of the holy Mysteries, might there assemble themselves, and no other creep in amongst them; this is now made a matter so hainous, as if our Religion thereby were become even plain Judaism, and as though we retained a Most Holy Place, whereinto there might not any but the High Priest alone enter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couling to the custome of the Jews.</p>

There may be cause sometime to <hi>abolish</hi> or to <hi>extiguish</hi> them, But surely, never by way of punishment <hi>to the things themselves.</hi> Yea farther, howsoever the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did punish Idolaters, we find not that God hath appointed for us any definite or <hi>certain temporal judgment,</hi> which the Christian Magistrate <hi>is of necessity for ever</hi> bound to execute upon <hi>Offenders</hi> in that kind, much less upon <hi>things</hi> that way abused as mere <hi>instruments.</hi> For what God did command touching <hi>Canaan,</hi> the same concerneth not us any otherwise than only as a fearful pattern of his just displeasure and wrath against sinful Nations. It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, how <hi>God thought good</hi> to plague and afflict them; it doth not appoint in what form and manner <hi>we ought</hi> to punish the sin of <hi>Idolaty in all others.</hi> Unless they will say, that because the Israelites were commanded to make no Covenant with the people of that Land, therefore Leagues and Truces made between Superstitious Persons, and such as serve God aright, are unlawful altogether; or, because God commanded the Israelites to smite the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to root them out, that therefore reformed Churches are bound to put all others to the edge of the sword. Now whereas <hi>Commandment</hi> was also given to destroy all places where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites had served their gods,<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 2.</note> and not to convert any one of them to the honour of the true God: <hi>this Precept had reference unto a special intent and purpose,</hi> which was, that there should be <hi>but one only Place</hi> in the whole Land, whereunto the People might bring such Offerings, Gifts, and Sacrifices, as their <hi>Levitical Law</hi> did require. By which Law, severe charge was given them in that respect, not to convert <hi>those places</hi> to the worship of the living God, where Nations before them had served Idols,<note place="margin">Deut. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this case we are to retain as much, in the other as little of former things as we may. Sith therefore Examples have not <hi>generally</hi> the force of Laws which all men ought to keep, but of Counsels only and Perswasions not amiss to be followed by them whose Case is the like, surely where Cases are so unlike as theirs and ours, I see not how that which they did, should induce, much less any way enforce us to the same practise, especially considering that <hi>Groves</hi> and <hi>Hill-altars</hi> were, while they did remain, both dangerous in regard of the secret access, which People, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously given, might have always thereunto with ease; neither could they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

serve with any fitness unto better purpose: whereas our Temples (their former abuse being by order of Law removed) are not only free from such peril, but withall so conveniently framed for the people of God to serve and honour him therein; that no man beholding them, can chuse but think it exceeding great pity they should be ever any otherwise employed. Yea but the Cattel of <hi>Amalek</hi> (you will say) were <hi>fit</hi> for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and this was the very conceit which sometime deceived <hi>Soul.</hi> It was so. Nor do I any thing doubt, but that <hi>Saul</hi> upon this conceit might even lawfully have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God those reserved spoyls, had not the Lord <hi>in that particular case</hi> given <hi>special charge</hi> to the contrary. And therefore notwithstanding the commandement of <hi>Israel</hi> to destroy Canaanites, Idolaters may be converied and live: So the Temples which have served Idolatry as Instruments, may be sanctified again and continue, albeit, to <hi>Israel</hi> commandement have been given that <hi>they</hi> should destroy all Idolatrous places <hi>in their Lead</hi>; and to the good Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> commendation for fulfilling, to the evil for diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the same Commandement, sometimes punishment, always sharp and severe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof hath even from the Lord himself befallen. Thus much it may suffice to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in defence of those Christian Oratories, the overthrow and ruine whereof is desired, not now by Infidels, Pagans, or Turks, but by a special refined Sect of Christian Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; pretending themselves exceedingly grieved at our Solemnities in erecting Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, at the Names which we suffer them to hold, at their form and fashion, at the stateliness of them and costliness, at the opinion which we have of them, and at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold supertitious abuses whereunto they have been put.</p>

This they did partly as faithful <hi>Witnesses,</hi> making meer <hi>relation</hi> what God himself had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> unto them; and partly as careful <hi>Expounders,</hi> Teachers, Perswaders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Church in like case <hi>Preacheth</hi> still, first publishing by way of <hi>Testimony</hi> or relation, the truth which from them she hath received, even in such sort as it was received, <hi>written in the sacred volumes of Scripture</hi>; Secondly, by way of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> discovering the mysteries which lye hid therein. The Church as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, preacheth his meer revealed Truth, by reading <hi>publickly</hi> the Sacred Scripture. So that a second kind of preaching is the reading of holy Writ. For thus we may the boldlier speak, being strengthened(<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 15. 21.</note>) with the examples of so reverend a Prelate as saith, that <hi>Moses</hi> from the time of antient Generations and Ages long since past, had amongst the Cities of the very Gentiles them that preached him, <hi>in that</hi> he was read every Sabbath day. For so of necessity it must be meant, in as much as we know, that the Jews have alwayes had their weekly Readings of the <hi>Law of Moses</hi>; but that they always had in like manner their weekly <hi>Sermons upon some part of the Law of Moses,</hi> we no where find. Howbeit still we must here remember, that the Church; by her publick reading of the Book of God, preacheth only <hi>as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Now the principal thing required in a Witness, is Fidelity. Wherefore as we cannot excuse that Church, which either through corrupt translations of Scripture, delivereth, instead of divine Speeches, any thing repugnant unto that which God speaketh; or, through falsified additions, proposeth that to the people of God as Scripture, which is in truth no Scripture: So the blame, which in both these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects hath been laid upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is surely altogether without cause. Touching Translations of Holy Scripture, albeit we may not disallow of their painful travels herein, who strictly have tyed themselves to the very Original letter; yet the judgment of the Church, as we see by the practise of all Nations, <hi>Greeks, Latines, Persians, Syrians, AEthiopians, Arabians,</hi> hath been ever, That the fittest for publick Audience are such, as following a middle course between the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of literal Translators, and the liberty of Paraphrasts, do with greatest shortness and plainness deliver the meaning of the Holy Ghost. Which being a labour of so great difficulty, the exact performance thereof we may rather wish than look for.

Neither can it be reasonably thought, because upon certain solemn occasions, some Lessons are chosen out of those Books, and of Scripture it self some Chapters not appointed to be read at all, that we thereby do offer disgrace to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> or lift up the Writings of men above it.

We marvel the less that our reading of Books not Canonical, is so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, when so little is attributed unto the reading of Canonical Scripture it self; that now it hath grown to be a question, whether the Word of God be any ordinary mean to save the Souls of men, in that it is either privately studied, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly read, and so made known; or else only as the same is preached, that is to say, <hi>explained by a lively voyce,</hi> and applyed to the People's use, as the <hi>Speaker in his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thinketh meet.</hi> For this alone is it which they use to call <hi>Preaching.</hi> The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reading of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> they condemn altogether, as a thing effectual unto Evil; the bare reading in like sort of whatsoever, yea even of Scriptures themselves, they mislike, as a thing uneffectual to do that good, which we are perswaded may grow by it. Our desire is in this present Controversie, as in the rest, not to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down with the waves of uncertain Arguments, but rather positively to lead on the mindes of the simpler sort by plain and easie degrees, till the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it self do make manifest what is Truth. First therefore, because whatsoever is spoken concerning the efficacy or necessity of God's Word, the same they tye and restrain only unto Sermons, howbeit not Sermons read neither (for such they also abhor in the Church) but Sermons without Book, Sermons which spend their life in their birth, and may have publick audience but once: For this cause, to avoid ambiguities, wherewith they often intangle themselves, not mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what doth agree to the Word of God in it self, and what in regard of outward accidents which may befall it, we are to know that the Word of God is his Heavenly Truth, touching matters of eternal life revealed and uttered unto Men, unto Prophets and Apostles by immediate Divine Inspiration, from them to us by their Books and Writings. We therefore have no Word of God but the Scripture. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Sermons were, unto such as heard them, his Word, even as properly as to us their Writings are. Howbeit not so our own Sermons, the exposition which our discourse of Wit doth gather and minister out of the Word of God. For which cause, in this present question we are, when we name the Word of God, always to mean the Scripture only. The end of the Word of God is to save, and therefore we term it the Word of Life. The way for all men to be saved, is by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Truth which the Word hath taught. And sith Eternal life is a thing of it self communicable unto all, it behooved that the Word of God, the necessary mean thereunto, be so likewise. Wherefore the Word of Life hath been always a Treasure, though precious, yet easie, as well to attain, as to finde; lest any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66185:121"/>
of life should perish through the difficulty of the way. To this and the Word of God no otherwise serveth, than only in the nature of a Doctrinal Instrument. It saveth, because it maketh <hi>wise unto Salvation.</hi> Wherefore the ignorant it saveth not, they which live by the Word, must know it. And being it self the Instrument which God hath purposely framed, thereby to work the knowledge of Salvation in the hearts of men, what cause is there wherefore it should not of it self be acknowledged a most apt and a likely mean, to leave an <hi>apprehension</hi> of things Divine in our understanding, and in the minde an <hi>assent</hi> thereunto? For touching the one, sith God, who knoweth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closeth best the rich tresures of his own Wisdom, hath, by delivering his Word, made choice of the Scriptures, as the most effectual means, whereby those treasures might be imparted unto the World, it followeth, That no man's understanding the Scripture must needs be even of it self, intended as a full and perfect discovery, sufficient to imprint in us the lively Character of all things necessarily required for the attainment of Eternal Life. And concerning our assent to the Mysteries of Heavenly truth, seeing that the Word of God, for the Author's sake, hath credit with all that confess it (as we all do) to be his Word, every Proposition of holy Scripture, every Sentence being to us a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; if the Principles of all kindes of Knowledge else have that vertue in themselves, whereby they are able to procure our Assent unto such Conclusions, as the industry of right Discourse doth gather from them; we have no reason to think the Principles of that Truth, which tendeth unto man's everlasting happiness, less forcible than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when we know, that, of all other, they are for their certainty the most infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. But as every thing of price, so this doth require travel. We bring not the knowledge of God with us into the World. And the less our own opportunity or ability is that way, the more we need the help of other men's Judgments, to be our direction herein. Nor doth any man ever believe, into whom the doctrin of Belief is not instilled by instruction, some way received at the first from others. Wherein whatsoever fit means there are to notifie the Mysteries of the Word of God, whether Publickly (which we call <hi>Preaching</hi>) or in Private, howsoever, the Word by <hi>every such mean</hi> even <hi>ordinarily</hi> doth save, and not only by being delivered unto men in Sermons. <hi>Sermons</hi> are not <hi>the only Preaching</hi> which doth save Souls. For, concerning the use and sense of this word <hi>Preaching,</hi> which they shut up in so close a Prison, although more than enough have already been spoken, to redeem the liberty thereof; yet because they insist so much, and so proudly insult thereon, we must a little inure their Ears with hearing, how others whom they more regard, are in this Case accustomed to use the self-same language with us, whose manner of speech they deride.

So worthy a part of Divine Service we should greatly wrong, if we did not esteem Preaching as the blessed Ordinance of God, Sermons as Keyes to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as Wings to the Soul, as Spurrs to the good Affections of Man, unto the Sound and Healthy as Food, as Physick unto diseased Mindes. Wherefore how higly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may please them with words of Truth to extoll Sermons, they shall not herein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us. We seek not to derogate from any thing which they can justly esteem, but our desire is to uphold the just estimation of that, from which it seemeth unto us they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate more than becometh them. That which offendeth us, is, first, the great disgrace which they offer unto our Custom of bare reading the Word of God, and to his gracious Spirit, the Principal vertue whereof thereby manifesting it self, for the endless good of mens Souls, even the Vertue which it hath to <hi>convert,</hi> to <hi>edifie,</hi> to <hi>save</hi> Souls; this they mightily strive to obscure: and, Secondly, The shifts wherewith they maintain their opinion of Sermons, whereunto, while they labour to appropriate the Saving power of the Holy Ghost, they separate from all apparent hope of Life and Salvation, thousands whom the goodness of Almighty God doth not exclude. Touching therefore the use of Scripture even in that it is openly read, and the inestimable good which the Church of God, by that very mean, hath reaped; there was, we may very well think, some cause which moved the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to require,<note place="margin">2 Thes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the very having of the Books of God was a matter of no small charge and difficulty, in as much as they could not be had otherwise than only in written Copies, it was the necessity not of Preaching things agreeable with the Word, but of reading the Word it self at large to the People, which caused Churches throughout the World to have publick care, that the sacred Oracles of God being procured by Common charge, might with great sedulity be kept both intire and sincere. If then we admire the providence of God in the same continuance of Scripture, notwithstanding the violent endeavours of Infidels to abolish, and the fraudulence of Hereticks always to deprave the same, shall we set light by that Custom of Reading, from whence so precious a benefit hath grown? 2. The Voyce and Testimony of the Church acknowledging Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the Law of the Living God, is for the truth and certainty thereof no mean Evidence. For if with Reason we may presume upon things which a few mens depositions do testifie, suppose we that the mindes of men are not both at their first access to the School of Christ exceedingly moved, yea and for ever afterwards also confirmed much, when they consider the main consent of all the Churches in the whole World witnessing the Sacred Authority of Scriptures, ever sithence the first publication thereof, even till this present day and hour? And that they all have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways so testified, I see not how we should possibly wish a proof more palpable, than this manifest received, and every where continued Custom of Reading them publickly as the Scriptures. The Reading therefore of the Word of God, as the use hath ever been, in open Audience, is the plainest evidence we have of the Churches <hi>assent</hi> and <hi>acknowledgement</hi> that it is his Word. 3. A further commodity this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom hath, which is, to furnish the very <hi>simplest</hi> and <hi>rudest sort</hi> with such infallible <hi>Axioms</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of Sacred Truth, delivered even in the <hi>very letter</hi> of the Law of God, as may serve them for Rules whereby to judge the <hi>better all other Doctrins</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> which they <hi>hear.</hi>

For whereas in a manner the whole Book of God is by reading every year published, a small part thereof, in comparison of the whole, may hold very well the readiest Interpreter of Scripture occupied many years. 4. Besides, wherefore should any man think, but that Reading it self is one of the ordinary means, whereby it pleaseth God of his gracious goodness to instill that Celestial Verity, which being <hi>but so</hi> received is nevertheless effectual to <hi>save Souls</hi>? Thus much therefore we ascribe to the Reading

of the Word of God as the manner is in our Churches. And because it were odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if they on their part should altogether despise the same, they yield that Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may set forward, but not begin the work of Salvation; That<note n="a" place="margin">T.

So that their Repentance (although it be not their first entrance) is notwithstanding the first step of their re-entrance into Life, and may be in them wrought by the Word, only read unto them. Besides, it seemeth that God would have no man stand in doubt, but that the reading of Scripture is effectual, as well to lay even the first foundation, as to adde degrees of farther perfection in the fear of God; And therefore the Law saith,<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou shalt read this Law before all</hi> Israel, <hi>that Men, Women, and Children may hear, yea, even that their Children, which as yet have not known it, may hear it, and by hearing it so read, may learn to fear the Lord.</hi> Our Lord and Saviour was himself of opinion,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 29.</note> That they which would not be drawn to amendment of Life by the Testimony which <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets have given, concerning the miseries that follow Sinners after death, were not likely to be perswaded by other means, although God from the very Dead should have raised them up Preachers. Many hear the Books of God, and believe them not. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, their unbelief in that case we may not impute unto any weakness or insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the mean which is used towards them, but to the wilful bent of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate hearts against it. With mindes obdurate nothing prevaileth. As well they that preach, as they that read unto such, shall still have cause to complain with the Prophets which were of old, <hi>Who will give credit unto our Teaching?</hi> But with whom ordinary means will prevail, surely the power of the World of God, even without the help of Interpreters in God's Church, worketh mightily, not unto their confirmation alone which are converted, but also to their conversion which are not. It shall not boot them who derogate from reading, to excuse it, when they see no other remedy, as if their intent were only to deny, that Aliens and Strangers from the Family of God are won, or that Belief doth use to be wrought at the first in them, without Sermons. For they know it is our Custom of simple Reading, not for conversion of Infidels estranged from the House of God, but for instruction of Men baptised, bred and brought up in the bosom of the Church, which they despise as a thing uneffectual to save such Souls. In such they imagine that God hath no ordinary mean to work Faith without Sermons. The reason, why no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Belief by the bare contemplation of Heaven and Earth, is, for that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are sufficient to give us as much as the least spark of Light concerning the very principal Mysteries of our Faith; and whatsoever we may learn by them, the same we can only attain to know, according to the manner of natural Sciences, which meer discourse of Wit and Reason findeth out; whereas the things which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly believe, be only such, as are received upon the credit of Divine Testimony. Seeing therefore, that he which considereth the Creatures of God, findeth therein both these defects, and neither the one nor the other in Scriptures, because he that readeth unto us the Scriptures, delivereth all the Mysteries of Faith, and not any thing amongst them all more than the mouth of the Lord doth warrant: It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in those own respects, that our consideration of Creatures, and attention unto Scriptures are not in themselves, and without-Sermons, things of like disability to breed or beget Faith. Small cause also there is, why any man should great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66185:123"/>
wonder as at an extraordinary work, if, without Sermons, Reading be sound to effect thus much. For I would know by some special instance, what one Article of Christian Faith, or what duty required unto all mens Salvation there is, which the very reading of the Word of God is not apt to notifie. Effects are miraculous and strange, when they grow by unlikely means. But, did we ever hear it accounted for a Wonder, that he which doth read, should believe and live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of Almighty God?<note place="margin">Exod. 14.7.</note> Reading doth convey to the Minde that Truth, without addition or diminution, which Scripture hath derived from the Holy Ghost. And the end of all Scripture is the same which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> proposeth in the writing of that most Divine Gospel,<note place="margin">John 20. 31.</note> namely <hi>Faith,</hi> and through Faith Salvation. Yea, all Scripture is to this effect in it self available,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 2,3,4.

Otherwise, if he which wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, doth that which is forceable in it self, how should he which readeth, be thought to do that which in it self is of no force to work Belief, and to save Believers? Now, although we have very just cause to stand in some jealousie and fear, lest by thus overvaluing their Sermons, they make the price and estimation of Scripture, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise notified, to fall: nevertheless, so impatient they are, that being but request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let us know what causes they leave for mens incouragement to attend to the reading of the Scripture, if Sermons only be the power of God to save every one which believeth; that which we move for our better learning and instruction-sake, turneth unto anger and choler in them, they grow altogether out of quietness with it,<note place="margin">T. C. l. 2. p. 376.</note> they answer fumingly, that they are <hi>ashamed to defile their Pens with making answer to such idle questions:</hi> yet in this their mood they cast forth somewhat, wherewith under pain of greater displeasure we must rest contented. They tell us, the profit of Reading is singular, in that it serveth for a Preparative unto Sermons; it helpeth prettily towards the nourishment of Faith, which Sermons have once ingendred; it is some stay to his minde which readeth the Scripture, when he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same things there which are taught in Sermons, and thereby perceiveth how God doth concurr in opinion with the Preacher; besides, it keepeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in memory, and doth in that respect, although not feed the Soul of man, yet help the retentive force of that stomack of the minde, which receiveth ghostly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ood at the Preachers hands. But the principal cause of writing the Gospel was, that it might be preached upon or interpreted by publick Ministers, apt and authorized thereunto. Is it credible that a superstitious conceit (for it is no better) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, should in such sort both darken their Eyes, and yet sharpen their Wits withall, that the only true and weightly cause why Scripture was written, the cause which in Scripture is so often mentioned, the cause which all men have ever till this present day acknowledged, this they should clean exclude, as being no cause at all, and load us with so great store of strange concealed causes, which did never see light till now? In which number the rest must needs be of moment, when the very chiefest cause of committing the Sacred Word of God unto Books, is surmised to have been, lest the Preacher should want a Text whereupon to scholie. Men of Learning hold it for a slip in Judgement, when offer is made to demonstrate that as proper to one thing, which Reason findeth common unto moe. Whereas therefore they take from all kindes of teachings, that which they attribute to Sermons, it had been their part to yield directly some strong reason, why between <hi>Sermons alone</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> there should be ordinarily that coherence which causes have with their usual effects, why a Christian man's belief should so naturally grow from Sermons, and not possibly from any other kinde of teaching.

Finally, to explain even those things which need and admit explication, many other usual ways there are besides Sermons. Therefore Sermons are not the only ordinary means whereby we first come to apprehend the Mysterys of God.

Belief in all sorts doth come by hearkning, and attending to the Word of Life.

Furthermore, having received Apostolical Doctrine,<note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 1. 9.</note> the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us to esteem the same as the Supream Rule, whereby all other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines must for ever be examined. Yea, but in as much as the Apostle doth there speak of that he had Preached, he flatly maketh (as they strangely affirm) his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Sermons the Rule whereby to examine all. And then, I beseech you, what Rule have we whereby to judge or examine any? For, if Sermons must be our Rule, because the Apostles Sermons were so to their Hearers; then, sith we are not as they were, Hearers of the Apostles Sermons, it resteth that either the Sermons which we hear should be our Rule, or (that being absurd) therewill (which yet hath greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity) no Rule at all be remaining for Tryal, what Doctrines now are corrupt, what consonant with heavenly Truth.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3 16.</note> Again, let the same Apostle acknowledge all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, to instruct in Righteousness; Still notwithstanding we erre, if hereby we presume to gather, that Scripture read, will avail unto any one of all these uses; they teach us the meaning of the words to be, that so much the Scripture can do, if the Minister that way apply it in his Sermons, otherwise not. Finally, they never hear Sentence which mentioneth the Word or Scripture, but forthwith their Glosses upon it are, the Word preached, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture explained or delivered unto us in Sermons. Sermons they evermore understand to be that Word of God, which alone hath vital Operation; the dangerous sequel of which Construction I wish they did more attentively weigh. For, sith Speech is the very Image, whereby the minde and soul of the Speaker conveyeth it self into the bolom of him which heareth, we cannot chuse but see great reason, wherefore the Word that proceedeth from God, who is Himself very Truth and Life, should be (as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> noteth) lively and mighty in operation,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> sharper than any two-edged Sword. Now, if in this and the like Places we did conceive, that our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66185:124"/>
own Sermons are that strong and forcible Word, should we not hereby impart even the most peculiar glory of the Word of God, unto that which is not his word? For, touching our Sermons, that which giveth them their very being, is the wit of man, and therefore they oftentimes accordingly taste too much of that over-corrupt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from which they come. In our speech of most holy things, our most frail affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many times are bewrayed. Wherefore when we read or recite the Scripture, we then deliver to the People properly the Word of God. As for our Sermons, be they never so sound and perfect, his Word they are not, as the Sermons of the Prophets were; no, they are but ambiguously termed his Word, because his Word is commonly the Subject whereof they treat, and must be the Rule whereby they are framed. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by these, and the like shifts they derive unto Sermons alone, whatsoever is generally spoken concerning the Word. Again, what seemeth to have been uttered concerning Sermons, and their efficacy or necessity, in regard of Divine matter, and must consequently be verified in sundry other kindes of teaching, if the Matter be the same in all; their use is to fasten every such Speech unto that one only manner of teaching, which is by Sermons, that still Sermons may be all in all.<note n="a" place="margin">

First, therefore, as we know that God doth aide with his grace, and by his special providence evermore bless with happy success those things which himself appointeth; so his Church, we perswade our selves, he hath not in such sort given over to a reprobate sense, that whatsoever it deviseth for the good of the Souls of men, the same he doth still accurse and make frustrate. Or if he always did defeat the Ordinances of his Church,<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 13.</note> is not reading the Ordinance of God? Wherefore then should we think that the force of his secret grace is accustomed to bless the labour of dividing his Word, according unto each man's private discretion in publick Sermons, and to withdraw it self from concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the publick delivery thereof by such selected portions of Scriptures, as the

As for those things which at the first are obscure and dark, when memory hath laid them up for a time, Judgment afterwards growing explaineth them. Scripture therefore is not so hard, but that the only reading thereof may give life unto willing Hearers. The easie performance of which holy labour, is in like sort a very cold Objection, to prejudice the vertue thereof. For what though an Infidel; yes, though a Childe may be able to read; there is no doubt, but the meanest and worst amongst the People under the Law, had been as able as the Priests themselves were to offer Sacrifice. Did this make Sacrifice of no effect unto that purpose for which it was instituted? In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion some duties are not commended so much by the hardness of their execution, as by the worthiness and dignity of that acceptation wherein they are held with God. We admire the goodness of God in nature, when we consider how he hath provided that things most needful to preserve this life, should be most prompt and easie for all living Creatures to come by. Is it not as evident a sign of his wonderful providence over us, when that food of Eternal life, upon the utter want whereof our endless death and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction necessarily ensueth, is prepared and always set in such a readiness, that those very means, than which nothing is more easie, may suffice to procure the same?

As for the men, with whom we have thus fart taken pains to conferr, about the force of the Word of God, either read by it self or opened in Sermons; their speeches concerning both the one and the other are in truth such, as might give us very just cause to think, that the reckoning is not great which they make of either. For howsoever they have been driven to devise some odde kinde of blinde uses, whereunto they may answer that reading doth serve, yet the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God in publick more than their Preachers bare Text, who will not judge that they deem needless? when if we chance at any time to term it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as being a thing which God himself did institute amongst the Jews for purposes that touch as well us as them, a thing which the Apostles commend under the Old, and ordain under the New Testament; a thing whereof the Church of God hath ever sithence the first beginning reaped singular Commodity; a thing which without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great detriment no Church can omit, they only are the men that ever we heard of, by whom this hath been cross'd and gain-said; they only the men which have given their peremptory sentence to the contrary:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>It is untrue, that simple Reading is necessary in the Church.</hi> And why untrue? <hi>Because, although it be very convenient which is used in some Churches, where before Preaching-time the Church assembled hath the Scriptures read in such order, that the whole Canon thereof is oftentimes in one year run through: yet a number of Churches which have no such order of simple Reading, cannot be in this point charged with breach of Gods commandement, which they might be if simple Reading were necessary.</hi> A poor, a cold and an hungry cavil! Shall we therefore to please them change the Word <hi>Necessary,</hi> and say, that it hath been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Order, a Custom very expedient, or an Ordinance most profitable (whereby they know right well that we mean exceedingly behoovful) to read the Word of God at large in the Church, whether it be, as our manner is, or as theirs is whom they prefer before us?

Are they resolved then at the leastwise, if Preaching be the only ordinary mean whereby it pleaseth God to save our Souls, what kinde of Preaching it is which doth save? Understand they, how or in what respect there is that force or vertue in Preaching? We have reason wherefore to make these Demands; for that, although their Pens run all upon Preaching and Sermons, yet when themselves do practise that whereof they write, they change their Dialect, and those words they shun, as if there were in them some secret sting. It is not their phrase to say they Preach, or to give to their own instructions and exhortations the name of Sermons; the pain they take themselves in this kinde is either opening or Lecturing or Reading, or Exercising, but in no case Preaching.<note n="a" place="margin">

If substance of matter, evidence of things, strength and validity of arguments and proofs, or if any other vertue else which Words and Sentences may contain; of all this, what is there in the best Sermons being uttered, which they lose by being read? But they utterly deny that the reading either of Scriptures, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Sermons can ever by the ordinary grace of God save any Soul. So that although we had all the Sermons word for word which <hi>Iames, Paul, Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles made, some one of which Sermons was of power to convert thousands of the Hearers unto Christian Faith; yea, although we had all the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exhortations, consolations which came from the gracious lips of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ himself, and should read them ten thousand times over, to Faith and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation no man could hereby hope to attain. Whereupon it must of necessity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the vigour and vital efficacy of Sermons doth grow from certain accidents, which are not in them, but in their Maker; his vertue, his gesture, his countenance, his zeal, the motion of his body, and the inflexion of his voice, who first uttereth them as his own, is that which giveth them the form, the nature, the very essence of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments available to Eternal life. If they like neither that nor this, what remaineth but that their final conclusion be, <hi>Sermons we know are the only ordinary means to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but why or how we cannot tell?</hi> Wherefore to end this tedious Controversie, wherein the too great importunity of our over-eager Adversaries hath constrained us much longer to dwell, than the barrenness of so poor a Cause could have seemed at the first likely either to require or to admit, if they which without partialities and passions are accustomed to weigh all things, and accordingly to give their sentence, shall here sit down to receive our Audit, and to cast up the whole reckoning on both sides; the sum which Truth amounteth unto will appear to be but this, that as Medicines provided of Nature, and applyed by Art for the benefit of bodily health, take effect sometime under and sometime above the natural proportion of their vertue, according as the minde and fancy of the Patient doth more or less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr with them: So, whether we barely read unto men the Scriptures of God; or by Homilies concerning matter of Belief and Conversation seek to lay before them the duties which they owe unto God and Man; whether we deliver them Books to read and consider of in private at their own best leasure, or call them to the hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons publickly in the House of God; albeit every of these and the like unto these means

do truly and daily effect that in the hearts of men for which they are each and all meant; yet the operation which they have in common, being most sensible and most generally noted in one kinde above the rest, that one hath in some mens opinions drowned altogether the rest, and injuriously brought to pass that they have been thought not less effectual than the other, but without the other uneffectual to save souls. Whereas the cause why Sermons only are observed to prevail so much while all means else seem to sleep and do nothing, is in truth but that singular affection and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which the people sheweth every where towards the one, and their cold disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other; the reason hereof being partly the Art which our Adversaries use for the credit of their Sermons, to bring men out of conceit with all other Teaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; partly, a custom which men have to let those things carelesly pass by their ears which they have oftentimes heard before, or know they may hear again whenever it pleaseth themselves; partly, the especial advantages which Sermons naturally have to procure attention, both in that they come always new, and because by the Hearer it is still presumed, that if they be let slip for the present, what good soever they contain, is lost, and that without all hope of recovery. This is the true cause of odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sermons, and other kindes of wholesome Instruction. As for the difference which hath been hitherto so much defended on the contrary side, making Sermons the only ordinary means unto Faith and eternal Life, sith this hath neither evidence of Truth; nor proof sufficient to give it warrant, a cause of such quality may with fart better grace and conveniency aske that pardon which common humanity doth easily grant, than claim in challenging manner that assent which is as unwilling when reason guideth it to be yielded where it is not, as with-held where it is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due. All which notwithstanding, as we could greatly wish that the rigour of this their opinion were allayed and mittigated; so, because we hold it the part of religious ingenuity to honour vertue in whomsoever, therefore it is our most hearty desire, and shall be always our Prayer unto Almighty God, that in the self-same fervent zeal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they seem to effect the good of the Souls of men; and to thirst after nothing more than that all men might by all means be directed in the way of life, both they and we may constantly persist to the Worlds end. For in this we are not their Adversaries, though they in the other hitherto have been ours.</p>

Between the Throne of God in Heaven,<note place="margin">Of Prayer.</note> and his Church upon Earth here mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, if it be so that Angels have their continual intercourse, where should we finde the same more verified than in those two ghostly Exercises, the one Doctrine, the other Prayer? For what is the Assembling of the Church to learn, but the receiving of Angels descended from above? What to pray, but the sending of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels upwards? His Heavenly Inspirations, and our holy Desires are as so many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of intercourse and commerce between God and us. As Teaching bringeth us to know that God is our supream Truth; so Prayer, testifieth that we acknowledge him our soveraign Good. Besides, sith on God, as the most High, all inferiour Causes in the World are dependant; and the higher any Cause is, the more it coveteth to impart vertue unto things beneath it, how should any kinde of service we do or can do, finde greater acceptance than Prayer, which sheweth our concurrence with him, in desiring that wherewith his very Nature doth most delight? Is not the name of Prayer usual to signifie even all the service that ever we do unto God? And that for no other cause, as I suppose, but to shew that there is in Religion no acceptable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which devout Invocation of the name of God doth not either presuppose or inferr. Prayers are those<note n="a" place="margin">Ose. 14. 3.</note> Calves of Mens lips; those most gracious and sweet<note n="b" place="margin">Revel. 5. 8.</note> odours; those rich Presents and Gifts, which being<note n="c" place="margin">Acts. 10. 4.</note> carried up into Heaven, do best restifie our dutiful affection, and are, for the purchasing of all favour at the hands of God, the most undoubted means we can use. On others what more easily, and yet what more fruitfully bestowed than our Prayers? If we give Counsel, they are the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler onely that need it; if Almes, the poorer only are relieved; but by Prayer we do good to all. And whereas every other Duty besides, is but to shew it self as time and opportunity require, for this all times are convenient:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9. 1 Thes. 5. 17. Luke 18. 1.</note> when we are not able to do any other things for mens behoof, when through maliciousness or unkindness they vouchsafe not to accept any other good at our hands, Prayer is that which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have in our power to bestow, and they never in theirs to refuse.

The knowledge is small which we have on Earth concerning things that are done in Heaven. Notwithstanding, thus much we know even of Saints in Heaven, that they pray. And therefore Prayer being a work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Church as well Triumphant as Militant, a work common unto Men with Angels, what should we think, but that so much of our Lives is celestial and divine as we spend in the exercise of Prayer?

As men, we are at our own choice, both for time, and place, and form, according to the exigence of our own occasions in private: But the service, which we do as Members of a Publick Body, is publick, and for that cause must needs be accompted by so much worthier than the other, as a whole society of such condition exceedeth the worth of any one.

The authority of his Place, the fervour of his Zeal, the piety and gravity of his whole Behaviour, must needs exceedingly both grace and set forward the service he doth. The authority of his Calling is a furtherance, because if God have so farr received him into favour, as to impose upon him by the hands of men that Office of blessing the People in his Name, and making interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to him in theirs; which Office he hath sanctified with his own most gracious Promise,<note place="margin">Num. 6. 23. 2 Chron. 30, 27.</note> and ratified that promise by manifest actual performance thereof, when others before in like place have done the same, is not his very Ordination a seal, as it were to us, that the self-same Divine love which hath chosen the instrument to work with, will by that instrument effect the thing whereto he ordained it, in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his People, and accepting the Prayers which his Servant offereth up unto God for them?

So that if the Liturgies of all antient Churches throughout the World be compared amongst themselves, it may be easily perceived they had all one original mold, and that the publick Prayer of the People of God in Churches throughly settled, did never use to be voluntary Dictates, proceeding from any man's extemporal wit. To him which considereth the grievous and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Inconveniencies, whereunto they make themselves daily subject, with whom any blinde and secret Corner is judged a fit House of Common Prayer; the manifold confusions which they fall into, where every man's private Spirit and Gift (as they term it) is the only Bishop that ordaineth him to this Ministry; the irksome defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities whereby through endless and senseless effusions of indigested Prayers, they oftentimes disgrace in most unsufferable manner, the worthiest part of Christian duty towards God, who herein are subject to no certain Order, but pray both what and how they list; to him, I say, which weigheth duly all these things, the reasons cannot be obscure,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 6. 20. Joel. 2. 17. 2 Chron. 29. 30.</note> why God doth in Publick Prayer so much respect the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Places where, the Authority and calling of Persons by whom, and the precise Appointment even with what Words or Sentences his Name should be called on amongst his People.</p>

The best stratagem that Satan hath, who knoweth his Kingdom to be no one way more shaken, than by the Publick devout Prayers of God's Church, is by traducing the form and manner of them, to bring them into contempt, and so to shake the force of all men's devotion towards them. From this, and from no other forge, hath proceeded a strange conceit, that to serve God with any set form of Common Prayer, is superstitious. As though God himself did not frame to his Priests the very speech,<note place="margin">Num. 6. 23.</note> wherewith they were charged to bless the People; or as if our Lord, even of purpose to prevent this fancy of extemporal and voluntary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had not left us of his own framing one, which might both remain as a part of the Church-Liturgy, and serve as a Pattern whereby to frame all other Prayers with efficacy, yet without superfluity of words. If Prayers were no otherwise accepted of God, then being conceived always new, according to the exigence of present occasions; if it be right to judge him by our own Bellies, and to imagine that he doth loath to have the self-same supplications often iterated, even as we do to be every day fed without alteration or change of diet; if Prayers he Actions which ought to waste away themselves in the making; if being made to remain that they may be resumed and used again as Prayers, they be but instruments of Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; surely, we cannot excuse <hi>Moses,</hi> who gave such occasion of scandal to the World, by not being contented to praise the Name of Almighty God, according to the usual naked simplicity of God's Spirit, for that admirable victory given them against <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> unless so dangerous a President were lest for the casting of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into certain Poetical moulds, and for the framing of Prayers which might be repeated often, although they never had again the same occasions which brought them forth at the first.

It hath in their eye too great affinity with the form of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; it differeth too much from that which Churches elsewhere reformed allow and observe; our Attire disgraceth it; it is not orderly read nor gestured as beseemeth; it requireth nothing to be done, which a Childe may not lawfully do; it hath a number of short cutts or shreddings, which may be better called Wishes than Prayers; it intermingleth Prayings and Readings in such manner, as, if Supplicants should use in proposing their Sutes unto mortal Princes, all the World would judge them madd; it is too long, and by that mean abridgeth Preaching; it appointeth the People to say after the Minister; it spendeth time in singing and in reading the Psalms by course, from side to side; it useth the Lord's Prayer too oft, the Songs of <hi>Magnificat, Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Nune Dimittis,</hi> it might very well spare; it hath the Letany, the Creed of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> which are superfluous; it craveth Earthly things too much; for deliverance from those Evils against which we pray, it giveth no Thanks; some things it asketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably, when they need not to be prayed for, as deliverance from Thunder and Tempest, when no Danger is nigh; some in too abject and diffident manner, as that God would give us that which we for our unworthiness dare not ask; some which ought not to be desired, as the deliverance from sudden Death, riddance from all Adversity, and the extent of saving Mercy towards all men. These and such like are the Imperfections, whereby our form of Common Prayer is thought to swerve from the Word of God. A great favourer of that part, but yet (his Errour that way excepted) a learned, painful, a right vertuous and good man, did not fear sometime to undertake, against Popish Detractors, the general maintenance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our whole Church-Service, as having in it nothing repugnant to the Word of God. And even they which would file away most the largeness of that Offer, do notwithstanding in more sparing terms acknowledge little less. For when those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite judgements which never are wont to construe things doubtful to the better, those very tongues which are always prone to aggravate whatsoever hath but the least shew whereby it may be suspected to savour of, or to sound towards any evil, do by their own voluntary sentence clearly free us from gross Errours, and from manifest Impiety herein; who would not judge us to be discharged of all blame, which are confest to have no great fault, even by their very word and testimony, in whose eyes no fault of ours hath ever hitherto been accustomed to seem small? Nevertheless, what they seem to offer us with the one hand, the same with the other they pull back again. They grant we erre not in palpable manner, weare not openly and notoriously impious; yet Errors we have, which the sharp insight of their wisest men do espy; there is hidden impiety, which the profounder sort are able enough to disclose. Their skilful ears perceive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain harsh and unpleasant discords in the sound of our Common Prayer, such as the Rules of Divine Harmony, such as the Laws of God cannot bear.</p>

To solemn Actions of Royalty and Justice, their suitable Ornaments are a Beauty. Are they only in Religion a stain? <hi>Divine Religion,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> (he speaketh of the Priestly Attire of the Law) <hi>hath one kinde of Habite wherein to minister before the Lord, another for ordinary uses belonging unto common life.

Which Answer wringeth out of <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> that which their words will not gladly yield. They both speak of the same Persons, namely, the Clergy; and of their Weed at the same time when they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the blessed Sacrament; and of the self-same kinde of Weed, a white Garment, so far as we have wit to conceive; and for any thing we are able to see, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech is not such as doth argue either the thing it self to be different where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they speak, or their Judgment concerning it different; although the one do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain it against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as a thing not therefore unlawful, because it was fair or handsom, and the other make it a matter of small commendation in it self, if they which wear it, do nothing else but weare the Robes which their Place requireth. The honesty, dignity, and estimation of White Apparel in the Eastern part of the World, is a token of greater fitness for this sacred use, wherein it were not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that any thing basely thought of should be suffered. Notwithstanding, I am not bent to stand stiffely upon these Probabilities, that in <hi>Ierom</hi>'s and <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s time any such Attire was made several to this purpose. Yet surely the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> are very impertinent to prove it an Ornament, therefore not several for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to execute their Ministry in, because men of credit and estimation wore their ordinary Apparel white. For we know that when <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote those words, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Apparel for the Ministers of the Law, to execute their Ministry in, was such. The Wise man which seared God from his heart,<note place="margin">Eccles. 45. 7.</note> and honoured the Service that was done unto him, could not mention so much as the Garment of Holiness, but with effectual signification of most singular reverence and love. Were it not better that the love which men bear to God, should make the least things which are imployed in his Service amiable, than that their over-scrupulous dislike of so mean a thing as a Vestment, should from the very Service of God with-draw their hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

notwithstanding we are not certain we shall gain one; the Examples of <hi>Ezechias</hi> and of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Charge which was given to the Jews by <hi>Esay,</hi> the strict Apostolical prohibition of things indifferent, whensoever they may be scandalous, were before so forcible Laws against our Ecclesiastical Attire, as neither Church nor Common-wealth could possibly make void, which now one of far less authority than either, hath found how to frustrate by dispensing with the breach of inferiour Commandments, to the end that the greater may be kept. But it booteth them not, thus to soder up a broken Cause, whereof their first and last discourses will fall asunder, do what they can. Let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously confess that their Invectives were too bitter, their Arguments too weak, the matter not so dangerous as they did imagin. If those alleged testimonies of Scripture did indeed concern the matter, to such effect as was pretended, that which they should inferr were unlawfulness, because they were cited as Prohibitions of that thing which indeed they concern. If they prove not our attire unlawful, because in truth they concern it not, it followeth that they prove not any thing against it, and consequently, not so much as uncomeliness or incoveniency. Unless therefore they be able throughly to resolve themselves, that there is no one Sentence in all the Scriptures of God, which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the wearing of it in such manner, and to such purpose, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> alloweth; unless they can fully rest and settle their mindes in this most sound perswasion, that they are not to make themselves the only competent Judges of decency in these cases, and to despise the solemn judgement of the whole Church, preferring before it their own conceit, grounded only upon uncertain suspicions and fears, whereof if there were at the first some probable cause, when things were but raw and tender, yet now very tract of time hath it self worn that out also; unless, I say, thus resolved in minde they hold their Pastoral Charge with the comfort of a good Conscience, no way grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that which they do, or doing that which they think themselves bound of duty to reprove, how should it possibly help or further them in their course, to take such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as they say are requisite to be taken, and in pensive manner to tell their Audience; <q>
                        <hi>Brethren, our hearts desire is, that we might enjoy the full liberty of the Gospel, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformed Churches they do elsewhere, upon whom the heavy hand of Authority hath imposed no grievous burthen. But such is the misery of these our days, that so great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we cannot look to attain unto. Were it so, that the equity of the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>could prevail, or the zeal of</hi> Ezechias <hi>be found in the hearts of those Guides and Governours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom we live; or the voyce of God's own Prophets be duly heard; or the Examples of the Apostles of Christ be followed; yea, or their Precepts be answered with full and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: these abominable Raggs, polluted Garments, marks and Sacraments of Idolatry, which Power, as you see, constraineth us to wear, and Conscience to abhor, had long ere this day been removed both out of sight and out of memory. But, as now things stand, behold to what narrow streights we are driven; On the one side, we fear the words of our Saviour Christ,</hi> Woe be to them by whom scandal and offence cometh: <hi>on the other side, at the Apostles speech we cannot but quake and tremble,</hi> If I preach not the Gospel, woe be unto me. <hi>Being thus hardly beset, we see not any other remedy, but to hazzard your Souls the one way, that we may the other way endeavour to save them. Touching the the offence of the Weak therefore, we must adventure it. If they perish, they perish. Our Pastoral charge is God's most absolute Commandment. Rather than that shall be taken from us, we are resolved to take this filth, and to put it on, although we judge it to be so unfit and inconvenient, that as oft as ever we pray or preach so arrayed before you, we do as much as in us lyeth, to cast away your Souls that are weak-minded, and to bring you unto endless perdition. But we beseech you, Brethren, have a care of your own safety, take heed to your steps, that ye be not taken in those snares which we lay before you. And our Prayer in your behalf to Almighty God is, that the poyson which we offer you, may never have the power to do you harm.</hi>

if themselves had gone under those sails which they require to be hoised up, if they had been themselves to execute their own Theory in this Church, I doubt not but cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would have seen, being nearer at hand, that the way was not good which they took of advising men, first, to wear the apparel, that thereby they might be free to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their preaching, and then, of requiring them so to preach as they might be sure they could not continue, except they imagine that Laws which permit them not to do as they would, will endure them to speak as they list, even against that which themselves do by constraint of Laws; they would have easily seen that our People being accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think evermore that thing evil which is publickly under any pretence reproved, and the men themselves worse which reprove it, and use it too; it should be to little purpose for them to salve the wound, by making protestations in disgrace of their own actions, with plain acknowledgement that they are scandalous, or by using fair intreaty with the weak Brethren, they would easily have seen how with us it cannot be endured, to hear a man openly profess that he putteth fire to his Neighbors house, but yet so hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same with Prayer, that he hopeth it shall not burn.

Having thus disputed, whether the Surplice be a fit Garment to be used in the service of God, the next Question whereinto we are drawn, is, Whether it be a thing allowable or no, that the Minister should say Service in the Chancel, or ruin his face at any time from the People, or before Service ended remove from the place where it was begun? By them which trouble us with these doubts, we would more willingly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved of a greater doubt; Whether it be not a kinde of taking God's Name in vain, to debase Religion with such frivolous disputes, a sin to bestow time and labour about them? Things of so mean regard and quality, although necessary to be ordered, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding very unsavory when they come to be disputed of; because Disputation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth some difficulty in the matter which is argued, whereas in things of this nature they must be either very simple or very froward, who need to be taught by disputation what is meet. When we make profession of our Faith, we stand; when we acknowledge our sins, or seek unto God for favour, we fall down; because the gesture of constancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh us best in the one, in the other the behavior of humility. Some part of our Liturgy consist in the reading of the word of God, and the proclaiming of his Law, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may thereby learn what their duties are towards him; some consist in words of praise and thanksgiving, whereby we acknowledge unto God what his blessings are towards us; some are such as albeit they serve to singular good purpose, even when there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion administred; nevertheless, being devised at the first for that purpose, are at the Table of the Lord for that cause also commonly read; some are uttered as from the people, some as with them unto God, some as from God unto them, all as before his sight, whom we fear, and whose presence to offend with any the least unseemliness, we would be surely as loath as they, who most reprehend or deride that we do.

In setting down the form of Common-Prayer, there was no need that the Book should mention either the learning of a fit, or the unfitness of an ignorant Minister, more than that he which describeth the manner how to pitch a field, should speak of moderation and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in diet. And concerning the duty it self, although the hardness thereof be not such as needeth much Art, yet surely they seem to be very farr carried besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to whom the dignity of Publick Prayer doth not discover somewhat more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in men of gravity and ripe discretion, than in <hi>children of ten years of age,</hi> for the decent discharge and performance of that Office. It cannot be that they who speak thus, should thus judge. At the board and in private it very well becommeth Children's innocency to pray, and their Elders to say, <hi>Amen.</hi> Which being a part of their vertuous education, serveth greatly both to nourish in them the fear of God, and to put us in continual remembrance of that powerful grace which openeth the mouths of Infants to sound his praise. But Publick Prayer, the service of God in the solemn Assembly of Saints, is a work, though easie, yet withal so weighty and of such respect, that the great facility thereof is but a slender argument to prove, it may be as well and as lawfully committed to Children as to men of years, howsoever their ability of learning be but only to do that in decent order wherewith the Book contenteth it self. The Book requireth but orderly reading. As in truth, what should any Prescript form of Prayer framed to the Minister's hand require, but only so to be read as beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth? We know that there are in the world certain voluntary Over-seers of all Books, whose censure in this respect would fall as sharp on us as it hath done on many others, if delivering but a form of Prayer, we should either express or include an thing, more than doth properly concern Prayer. The Ministers greatness or meanness of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to do other things, his aptness or insufficiency otherwise than by reading to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the flock, standeth in this place as a Stranger, with whom our form of Common-Prayer hath nothing to do.

heard it inquired of by many, how it might be brought to pass that the Church should every where have able Preachers to instruct the People; what impediments there are to hinder it, and which were the speediest way to remove them. In which consultation, the multitude of Parishes, the paucity of Schools, the manifold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements which are offered unto mens inclinations that way, the penury of the Ecclesiastical estate, the irrecoverable loss of so many Livings of principal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, clean taken away from the Church long sithence by being appropriated, the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruises that Spiritual promotions use to take by often falling, the want of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in certain Statutes which concern the state of the Church, the too great facility of many Bishops, the stony hardness of too many Patrons hearts not touched with any feeling in this case: such things oftentimes are debated, and much thought upon by them that enter into any discourse concerning any defect of knowledge in the Clergy. But whosoever be found guilty, the Communion Book hath surely deserved least to be called in question for this fault. If all the Clergie were as learned as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are that most complain of ignorance in others, yet our Book of Prayer might remain the same; and remaining the same it is, I see not how it can be a lett unto any man's skill in Preaching.

Two faults there are, which our Lord and Saviour himself especially reproved in Prayer, the one, when ostentation did cause it to be open; the other, when supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made it long. As therefore Prayers the one way are faulty, not whensoever they be openly made, but when Hypocrisie is the cause of open Praying: so the length of Prayer is likewise a fault, howbeit not simply, but where errour and superstition cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth more than convenient repetition or continuation of speech to be used. It is not, as some do imagine,<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 121.</note> (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) that long Praying is that fault of much speaking in Prayer which our Saviour did reprove; for then would not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Prayer have continued whole nights.<note place="margin">Luke 6. 12.</note> Use in Prayer no vain superfluity of words, as the Heathens doe, for they imagine that their much speaking will cause them to be heard: whereas in truth the thing which God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is, how vertuous their mindes are, and not how copious their tongues in Prayer; how well they think, and not how long they talk, who come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Supplications before him. Notwithstanding for as much as in Publick Prayer we are not only to consider what is needful in respect of God, but there is also in men that which we must regard; we somewhat the rather incline to length, lest over-quick dispatch of a Duty so important should give the World occasion to deem, that the thing it self is but little accounted of, wherein but little time is bestowed. Length thereof is a thing which the gravity and weight of such actions doth require. Beside, this benefit also it hath, that they whom earnest letts and impediments do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hinder from being Partakers of the whole, have yet through the length of Divine Service, opportunity 
sleft them, at the least, for access unto some reasonable part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Again, it should be considered, how it doth come to pass that we are so long. For if that very Service of God in the Jewish Synagogues, which our Lord did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and sanctifie with the presence of his own Person, had so large portions of the Law and the Prophets, together with so many Prayers and Psalms read day by day, as do equal in a manner the length of ours, and yet in that respect was never thought to deserve blame, is it now an offence, that the like measure of time is bestowed in the like manner? Peradventure the Church had not now the leisure which it had then, or else those things whereupon so much time was then well spent, have sithence that lost their dignity and worth. If the reading of the Law, the Prophets and Psalms, be a part of the Service of God, as needful under Christ as before, and the adding of the New Testament, as profitable as the ordaining of the Old to be read; if therewith instead of Jewish Prayers it be also for the good of the Church to annex that variety which the Apostle doth commend;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1.</note> seeing that the time which we spend is no more than the orderly performance of these things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required, why are we thought to exceed in length? Words, be they never so few, are too many when they benefit not the Hearer. But he which

They reprove long Prayer, and yet acknowledge it to be in it self a thing commendable; For so it must needs be, if the Devil have used it as a colour to hide his malicious practises. When Malice would work that which is evil, and in working avoid the suspition of any evil intent, the colour wherewith it overcasteth it self, is always a fair and plausible pretence of seeking to further that which is good. So that if we both retain that good which Saran hath pretended to seek, and avoid the evil which his purpose was to effect, have we not better prevented his malice, than if, as he hath, under colour of long Prayer, driven Preaching out of the Church, so we should take the quarrel of Sermons in hand, and revenge their Cause, by requital, thrusting Prayer in a manner out of doors under colour of long Preaching? In case our Prayers being made at their full length, did necessarily inforce Sermons to be the shorter, yet neither were this to uphold and maintain an unpreaching Ministery, unless we will say that those antient Fathers, <hi>Chrysostom, Augustine, Leo,</hi> and the rest, whose Homilies in that consideration were shorter for the most part than our Sermons are, did then not preach when their Speeches were not long. The necessity of shortness causeth men to cut off impertinent Discourses, and to comprize much matter in few words. But neither did it maintain inabilitie, not at all prevent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of Preaching, as long as a competent time is granted for that purpose. <hi>An hour and an half</hi> is, they say, in reformed Churches ordinarily thought reasonable, for <hi>their whole Liturgy or Service.</hi>

Our speech to worldly Superiours we frame in such sort as serveth best to inform and perswade the mindes of them, who otherwise neither could nor would greatly regard our necessities: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, because we know that God is indeed a King, but a <hi>great</hi>; King who understandeth all things before-hand, which no other King besides doth, a King which needeth not to be informed what we lack, a King readier to grant than we to make our requests; therefore in Prayer we do not so much respect what Precepts Art delivereth touching the method of perswasive utterance in the presence of great men, as what doth most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to our own edification in piety and godly zeal. If they on the contrary side do think that the same rules of decency which serve for things done unto terrene Powers, should universally decide what is fit in the service of God, if it be their meaning to hold it for a Maxim, That the Church must deliver her publick Supplications unto God in no other form of speech than such as were decent; if suit should be made to the Great Turk, or some other Monarch, let them apply their own rule unto their own form of Common-Prayer. Suppose that the people of a whole Town, with some chosen man before them, did continually twice or thrice in a week resort to their King, and every time they come, first acknowledge themselves guilty of Rebellions and Treasons, then sing a Song, and after that explain some Statute of the Land to the Standers by, and therein spend at the least an hour; this done, turn themselves again to the King, and for every sort of his Subjects crave somewhat of him; at the length sing him another Song, and so take their leave: Might not the King well think, that either they knew not what they would have, or else that they were distracted in minde, or some other such like cause of the disorder of their Supplication? This form of suing unto Kings were absurd: This form of Praying unto God they allow. When God was served with legal Sacrifices, such was the miserable and wretched disposition of some mens mindes, that the best of every thing they had being culled out for themselves, if there were in their flocks any poor starved or diseased thing not worth the keeping, they thought it good enough for the Altar of God, pretending (as wise Hyprocrites do when they rob God to enrich themselves) that the fatness of Calves doth benefit him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; to us the best things are most profitable, to him all as one, if the minde of the Offerer be good, which is the only thing he respecteth.

Touching Prayers for things earthly, we ought not to think that the Church hath set down so many of them without cause. They, peradventure, which finde this fault, are of the same affection with <hi>Solomon</hi>; so that if God should offer to grant the whatsoever they ask, they would neither crave Riches, not length of dayes, not yet victory over their Enemies, but only an understanding heart; for which cause themselves having Eagles wings, are offended to see others flye so near the ground. But the tender kindness of the Church of God it very well beseemeth, to help the weaker sort, which are by so great oddes moe in number, although some few of the perfecter and stronger may be therewith for a time displeased. Ignorant we are not, that of such as resorted to our Saviour Christ being present on Earth, there came not any unto him with better success for the benefit of their Souls ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happiness, than they whose bodily necessities gave them the first occasion to seek relief, when they saw willingness and ability of doing every way good unto all. The graces of the Spirit are much more precious than worldly benefits; our ghostly evils of greater importance than any harm which the body feeleth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our desires to heaven-ward should both in measure and number no less exceed, than their glorious Object doth every way excel in value. These things are true and plain in the eye of a perfect Judgement. But yet it must be withal considered, that the greatest part of the World are they which be farthest from perfection. Such being better able by sense to discern the wants of this present life, than by spiritual capacity to apprehend things above sense, which tend to their happiness in the world to come, are in that respect the more apt to apply their mindes even with hearty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and zeal at the least unto those Branches of Publick prayer, wherein their own particular is moved. And by this mean there stealeth upon them a double be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; first because that good affection, which things of smaller account have once set on work, is by so much the more easily raised higher; and secondly, in that the very custom of seeking so particular aide and relief at the hands of God, doth by a secret contradiction withdraw them from endeavouring to help themselves by those wicked shifts, which they know can never have his allowance, whose assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance their Prayer seeketh. These multiplyed Petitions of worldly things in Prayer have therefore, besides their direct use, a Service, whereby the Church under-hand, through a kinde of heavenly fraud, taketh therewith the Souls of men as with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain baits. If then their calculation be true (for so they reckon) that a full third of our Prayers be allotted unto earthly benefits, for which our Saviour in his plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form hath appointed but one Petition amongst seven, the difference is without any great disagreement; we respecting what men are, and doing that which is meer in regard of the common imperfection, our Lord contrariwise proposing the most

I mean not only because Prayer, but because this very Prayer is of such efficacy and necessity: for that our Saviour did but set men a bare example how to contrive or devise Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their own, and no way binde them to use this, is no doubt as Errour. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>'s Disciples,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 1.</note> which had been always brought up in the bosom of God's Church from the time of their first Infancy, till they came to the School of <hi>Iohn,</hi> were not so brutish, that they could be ignorant how to call upon the Name of God: but of their Master they had received a form of Prayer amongst themselves, which form none did use saving his Disciples, so that by it as by a mark of special difference they were known from others. And of this the Apostles having taken notice, they request that as <hi>Iohn</hi> had taught his, so Christ would likewise teach them to pray, <hi>Tertullian</hi> and Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> do for that cause term it, <hi>Orationem le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimam,</hi> the Prayer which Christ's own Law hath tyed his Church to use in the same Prescript form of words wherewith he himself did deliver it: and therefore what part of the World soever we fall into, if Christian Religion have been there recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the ordinary use of this very Prayer hath with equal continuance accompanied the same, as one of the principal and most material duties of honour done to Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">Cypr. in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

He therefore which made us to live, hath also taught us to pray, to the end that speaking unto the Father in the Sonn's own prescript without scholy or gloss of ours, we may be sure that we utter nothing which God will either disallow or deny. Other Prayers we use may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, and this oftner than any other, although not tyed so to do by any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Scripture, yet moved with such considerations as have been before set down: the causeless dislike where of which others have conceived, is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason for us, as much as once to forbear, in any place, a thing which uttered with true devotion and zeal of heart, affordeth to God himself that glory, that aide to the weakest sort of men, to the most perfect that solid comfort which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</p>

But surely, with so good reason, it standeth in those two places, that otherwise to order it were not, in all respects so well.

                     <note place="margin">Of Musick with Psalms.</note>38. Touching Musical Harmony, whether by Instrument or by Voice, it being but of high and low in sounds a due proportionable disposition, such notwithstanding is the force thereof, and so pleasing effects it hath in that very part of man which is most Divine, that some have been thereby induced to think that the Soul it self by Nature is, or hath in it Harmony. A thing which delighteth all Ages, and beseemeth all States; a thing as seasonable in grief as in joy; as decent being added unto acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of greatest weight and solemnity, as being used when men most sequester themselves from action. The reason hereof is an admirable faculty which Musick hath to express and represents to the minde, more inwardly then any other sensible mean, the very standing, rising, and falling, the very steps and inflections every way, the turns and varieties of all Passions, whereunto the minde is subject; yea, so to imitate them, that whether it resemble unto us the same state wherein our mindes already are, or a clean contrary, we are not more contentedly by the one confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then changed and led away by the other. In Harmony, the very Image and Character, even of Vertue and Vice is perceived, the minde delighted with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances, and brought, by having them often iterated, into a love of the things themselves. For which cause there is nothing more contagious and pestilent then some kindes of Harmony; then some, nothing more strong and potent unto good. And that there is such a difference of one kinde from another, we need no proof but our own experience, in as much as we are at the hearing of some more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto sorrow and heaviness, of some more mollified and softned in minde; one kinde apter to stay and settle us, another to move and stir our affections: There is that draweth to a marvelous grave and sober mediocrity, there is also that carrieth as it were into extasies, filling the minde with an heavenly joy, and for the time, in a manner, severing it from the body: So that although we lay altogether aside the consideration of Ditty or Matter, the very Harmony of sounds being framed in due sort, and carried from the Ear to the Spiritual faculties of our Souls, is by a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Puissance and Efficacy greatly available to bring to a perfect temper whatsoever is there troubled, apt as well to quicken the spirits as to allay that which is too eager, sovereign against melancholly and despair, forcible to draw forth tears of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, if the minde be such as can yield them able, both to move and to moderate all affections. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> having therefore singular knowledge, not in Poetry alone, but in Musick also, judged them both to be things most necessary for the House of God, left behinde him to that purpose, a number of divinely indited Poems, and was farther the Author of adding unto Poetry, melody a publick Prayer, melody both Vocal and Instrumental for the raising up of Mens hearts, and the sweetning of their affections towards God. In which consideration, the Church of Christ doth likewise at this present day, retain it as an ornament to Gods service, and an help to our own devotion. They which, under pretence of the Law Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial abrogated require the abrogation of Instrumental Musick, approving never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless the use of Vocal melody to remain, must shew some reason wherefore the one should be thought a Legal Ceremony, and not the other. In Church Musick curiosity and oftentation of Art, wanton, or light, or unsuitable harmony, such as onely pleaseth the ear, and doth not naturally serve to the very kinde and degree of those impressions which the matter that goeth with it, leaveth, or is apt to leave in mens mindes, doth rather blemish and disgrace that we do, then adde either beauty or furtherance unto it. On the other side, these faults prevented, the force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the thing it self, when it drowneth not utterly, but fitly suiteth with matter

altogether sounding to the praise of God, is in truth most admirable, and doth much edifie, if not the Understanding, because it teacheth not; yet surely the Affection, because therein it worketh much. They must have hearts very dry and tough, from whom the melody of <hi>Psalms</hi> doth not sometime draw that wherein a minde religiously affected delighteth. Be it as <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi> observeth, that at the first the Church in this exercise was more simple and plain then we are; that their singing was little more then onely a melodious kinde of pronounciation; that the custom which we now use, was not instituted so much for their cause which are Spiritual, as to the end that into grosser and heavier mindes, whom bare words do not easily move, the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of melody might make some entrance for good things. St. <hi>Basil</hi> himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging as much, did not think that from such inventions, the least jot of esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and credit thereby should be derogated:<note n="*" place="margin">

To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose were those harmonious tunes of Psalms divised for us; that they which are either in years but young, or touching perfection of Vertue, as yet not grown to ripeness, might, when they think they sing, learn.

Which for any thing we know to the contrary, might be the self-same form which <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> expresseth, declaring how the <hi>Essens</hi> were accustomed with Hymns and Psalms to honor God, sometime all exalting their voices together in one, and sometime one part answering another, wherein, as he thought, they swerved not much from the pattern of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriam.</hi> Whether <hi>Ignatius</hi> did at any time hear the Angels praising God after that sort, or no, what matter is it: If <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not,<note place="margin">Isai. 6. 3.</note> yet one which must be with us of greater Authority did. <hi>I saw the Lord</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>) <hi>on an high Throne, the Seraphims stood upon it,</hi> one cryed to another, <hi>saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, the whole world is full of his glory.</hi> But whosoever were the Author, whatsoever the Time, whencesoever the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of beginning this Custom in the Church of Christ; sith we are wont to suspect things onely before tryal, and afterwards either to approve them as good, or if we finde them evil, accordingly to judge of them; their counsel must needs seem very unseasonable, who advise men now to suspect that wherewith the World hath had, by their own account, Twelve hundred years acquaintance, and upwards, enough to take away suspition and jealousie. Men know by this time, if ever they will know, whether it be good or evil which hath been so long retained. As for the Devil, which way it should greatly benefit him to have this manner of singing Psalms accounted an invention of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or an imitation of the Angels of Heaven, we do not well understand, But we very well see in them who thus plead, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful celerity of discourse. For perceiving at the first, but onely some cause of suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fear, left it should be evil, they are presently in one and the self-same breath resolved,<note n="*" place="margin">From whence so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it came, it cannot he good, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when it is granted, that all the people may praise God (as it is in singing of Psalms) then this ought no: to be restrained unto a few; and where it is lawful, both with heart and voice, tosing the whole Psalm; there it is not meet, that they should sing but the one half with their heart and voice, and the other with their heart onely.

Therefore besides the incommodity which cometh this way, in that being tossed after this sort, men cannot understand what is sung, those other two inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences come of this form of singing, and therefore it is vanished in all Reformed Churches <hi>T. C.</hi> lib. 1. p. 103.</note> That <hi>what beginning soever it had, there is no possibility it should be good.</hi> The Potent Arguments which did thus suddenly break in upon them, and overcome them, are; First, That it is not unlawful for the People, all joyntly to praise God in singing of Psalms. Secondly, That they are not any where forbidden by the Law of God, to sing every Verse of the whole Psalm, both with heart and voice, quite and clean throughout. Thirdly, That it cannot be understood what is sung after our manner. Of which three, for as much as lawfulness to sing one way, proveth not another way inconvenient; the former two, are true Allegations, but they lack strength
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66185:136"/>
to accomplish their desire; the third so strong; that it might perswade, if the truth thereof were not doubtful. And shall this inforce us to banish a thing which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches in the World have received; a thing which so many ages have held; a thing which the most approved Councils and Laws have so oftentimes ratified; a thing which was never sound to have any inconvenience in it; a thing which always here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the best Men, and wisest Governors of Gods people, did think they could never commend enough; a thing which as <hi>Basil</hi> was perswaded, did both strengthen the Meditation of those holy Words which were uttered in that sort, and serve also to make attentive, and to raise up the hearts of men; a thing whereunto Gods people of old, did resort with hope and thirst, that thereby, especially their Souls, might be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; a thing which filleth the minde with comfort and heavenly delight, stirreth up flagrant desires and affections correspondent unto that which the words contain, allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all kinde of base and earthly Cogitations, banisheth and driveth away those evil secret suggestions which our invisible Enemy is always apt to minister, watereth the heart to the end it may fructifie, maketh the vertuous, in trouble, full of magnanimity and courage, serveth as a most approved remedy against all doleful and heavy accidents which befal men in this present life.

It is not our meaning, that what we attribute unto the Psalms, should be thought to depend altogether on that onely form of singing or reading them by course, as with us the manner is; but the end of our speech is to shew, That because the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, with whom the self-same custom was so many ages ago in use, have uttered all these things concerning the fruit which the Church of God did then reap, observing that and no other form, it may be justly avouched, that we our selves retaining it; an besides it also the other more newly and not unfruitfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, do neither want that good which the latter invention can afford, not lose any thing of that, for which the Ancients so oft and so highly commend the former.

And if the Psalms for the excellency of their use, deserve to be oftner repeated then they are, but that the multitude of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not any ofther repetition, What disorder is it if these few Evangelical Hymns which are in no respect less worthy, and may be by reason of their paucity imprinted with much more ease in all mens memories, be for that cause every day rehearsed?

Either let them not allow the one, or else cease to reprove the other. For the Ancient received use of intermingling Hymns and Psalms with Divine Readings, enough hath been written.

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they tell us, These Songs were fit for that purpose, when <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the Blessed Virgin uttered them, but cannot so be to us which have not received like benefit; Should they not remember how expresly <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> amongst many other good things,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29.30.</note> is commended for this also, That the praises of God were through his appointment daily set forth, by using in publick Divine Service, the Songs of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> unto that very end? Either there wanted wise men to give <hi>Hezekiah</hi> advice, and to inform him of that, which in his case was as true, as it is in ours, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that without some inconvenience and disorder, he could not appoint those <hi>Psalms</hi> to be used as ordinary Prayers, seeing what although they were Songs of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, such as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> had special occasion to use, yet not so the whole Church and People afterwards, whom like occasions did not befal; or else <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was perswaded as we are, that the praises of God in the mouths of his Saints, are not so restrained to their own particular, but that others may both conveniently and fruitfully use them; first, because the Mystical Communion of all faithful men is such as maketh every one to be interested in those precious Blessings, which any one of them receiveth at Gods hands: Secondly, because when any thing is spoken to extol the goodness of God, whose mercy endureth for ever, albeit the very particular occasion whereupon it riseth, do come no more; yet, the Fountain continuing the same, and yielding other new effects which are but onely in some sort proportionable, a small resemblance between the benefits, which we and others have received, may serve to make the same words of praise and thanksgiving fit, though not equally in all circumstances fit for both; a clear demonstration whereof, we have in all the Ancient Fathers Commentaries and Meditations upon the <hi>Psalms.</hi> Last of all, because even when there is not as much as the shew of any resemblance, nevertheless by often using their words in such manner, our mindes are daily more and more ensured with their affections.</p>

For till the empty name of the Empire came to be setled in <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the fall of the <hi>Romans</hi> huge Dominion concurring with other universal evils, caused those times to be days of much affliction and trouble throughout the World. So that <hi>Rogations</hi> or <hi>Litanies</hi> were then the very strength, stay, and comfort of Gods Church. Whereupon in the year Five hundred and six, it was by the Council of <hi>Aurelia</hi> decreed, That the whole Church should bestow yearly at the Feast of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost,<note place="margin">Concii. tom. 2. pag. 513.</note> three days in that kinde of Processionary service. About half an hundred years alter, to the end, that the Latine Churches, which all observed this Custom, might not vary in the order and form of those great <hi>Litanies</hi> which were so solemnly every where exercised, it was thought convenient by <hi>Gregory</hi> the First, and the best of that name, to draw the flower of them all into one. But this iron began at length to gather rust; which thing the Synod of <hi>Colen</hi> saw, and in part redrest within that Province, neither denying the necessary use for which such Litanies serve,<note place="margin">Concil. rom. 5.

For remedy whereof it was then thought better, that these and all other Supplications or Processions should be no where used, but onely within the Walls of the House of God, the place sanctified unto Prayer. And by us not onely such inconveniences being remedied, but also whatsoever was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise amiss in form or matter, it now remaineth a work, the absolute perfection whereof upbraideth with Error, or somewhat worse, them whom in all parts it doth not satisfie. As therefore Litanies have been of longer continuance then that we should make either <hi>Gregory</hi> or <hi>Mamercus</hi> the Author of them; so they are of more permanent use, then that now the Church should think it needeth them not. What dangers at any time are imminent, what evils hang over our heads, God doth know, and not we. We finde by daily experience, that those calamities may be nearest at hand, readiest to break in suddenly upon us, which we in regard of times or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, may imagine to be farthest off. Or if they do not indeed approach, yet such miseries as being present, all men are apt to bewail with tears, the wise by their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should rather prevent. Finally, if we for our selves had a priviledge of immunity, doth not true Christian Charity require, that whatsoever any part of the World, yea, any one of all our Brethren elswhere, doth either suffer or fear, the same we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as our own burthen? What one Petition is there found in the whole Litany, whereof we shall ever be able at any time to say, That no man living needeth the grace or benefit therein craved at Gods hands? I am not able to express how much it doth grieve me, that things of Principal Excellency, should be thus bitten at, by men whom God hath endued with graces, both of Wit and Learning for better purposes.</p>

Being for this impiety deprived of his place by the Bishop of the same Church, the punishment which should have reformed him, did but increase his obstinacy, and give him occasion of laboring with greater earnestness elswhere, to intangle unwary mindes with the snares of his damnable opinion. <hi>Arius</hi> in short time had won to himself, a number both of Followers and of great Defenders, whereupon much disquietness on all sides en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. The Emperor, to reduce the Church of Christ unto the Unity of sound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when other means, whereof tryal was first made, took no effect, gathered that famous Assembly of Three hundred and eighteen Bishops in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where besides, order taken for many things which seemed to need redress, there was with common consent, for the setling of all mens mindes, that other Confession of Faith set down, which we call the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> whereunto the Arians themselves which were present subscribed also; not that they meant sincerely, and indeed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their error, but onely to escape deprivation and exile, which they saw they could not avoid, openly persisting in their former opinions, when the greater part had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded against them, and that with the Emperors Royal Assent. Reserving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themselves unto future opportunities, and knowing, that it would not boot them to stir again in a matter so composed, unless they could draw the Emperor first, and by his means the chiefest Bishops unto their part; till <hi>Constantines</hi> death, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after, they always professed love and zeal to the Nicene Faith, yet ceased not in the mean while to strengthen that part which in heart they favored, and to infest by all means, under colour of other quarrels, their greatest Adversaries in this cause: Amongst them <hi>Athanasius</hi> especially, whom by the space of Forty six years, from the time of his Consecration, to succeed <hi>Alexander,</hi> Archbishop in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> till the last hour of his life in this World, they never suffered to enjoy the comfort of a peaceable day.

Crimes there were laid to his charge many, the least whereof, being just, had bereaved him of estimation and credit with men, while the World standeth. His Judges evermore the self-same men by whom his accusers were suborned. Yet the issue always on their part shame; on his, triumph. Those Bishops and Prelates, who should have accounted his cause theirs, and could not many of them, but with bleeding hearts, and with watred checks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a person of so great place and worth constrained to endure so soul indignities, were sure by bewraying their affection towards him, to bring upon themselves those molestations, whereby if they would not be drawn to seem his Adversaries, yet others should be taught how unsafe it was to continue his friends. Whereupon it came to pass in the end, that (very few excepted) all became subject to the sway of time; other odds there was none amongst them, saving onely that some fell sooner away, some latter from the soundness of Belief; some were Leaders in the Host of

For though I were now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the torments of men, yet could I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive nor dead.</hi> But such was the stream of those times, that all men gave place unto it, which we cannot but impute, partly, to their own over-sight. For at the first the Emperor was theirs, the determination of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was for them, they had the Arians hands to that Council: So great advantages are never changed so far to the contrary, but by great error. It plainly appeareth, that the first thing which weakned them, was their security. Such as they knew were in heart still affected towards Arianism, they suffered by continual nearness to possess the mindes of the greatest about the Emperor, which themselves might have done with very good acceptation, and neglected it. In <hi>Constantines</hi> life time to have setled <hi>Constantius</hi> the same way, had been a duty of good service towards God, a mean of peace and great quietness to the Church of Christ, a labor easie, and how likely we may conjecture, when after that so much pains was taken to instruct, and strengthen him in the contrary course, after that so much was done by himself to the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Heresie, yet being touched in the end voluntarily with remorse, nothing more grieved him then the memory of former proceedings in the cause of Religion, and that which he now foresaw in <hi>Iulian,</hi> the next Physician into whose hands the body that was thus distempered must fall. Howbeit this we may somewhat excuse, in as much as every mans particular care to his own charge was such, as gave them no leisure to heed what others practised in Princes Courts. But of the two Synods of <hi>Arimine</hi> and <hi>Selencia,</hi> what should we think? <hi>Constantius</hi> by the Arians suggestion, had devised to assemble all the Bishops of the whole World about this controversie; but in two several places, the Bishops of the West at <hi>Arimine</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Eastern at <hi>Selencia</hi> the same time. Amongst them of the East there was no stop, they agreed without any great ado, gave their sentence against Heresie, excommunicated some chief maintainers thereof, and sent the Emperor word what was done. They had at <hi>Arimine</hi> about Four hundred which held the truth, scarce of the adverse part Fourscore; but these obstinate, and the other weary of contending with them: Whereupon, by both it was resolved to send to the Emperor, such as might inform him of the cause, and declare what hindred their peaceable agreement.

Now although these Contentions were cause of much evil, yet some good the Church hath reaped by them, in that they occasioned the learned and sound in Faith, to explain such things as Heresie went about to deprave. And in this respect, the Creed of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> first exhibited unto <hi>Iulius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards (as we may probably gather) sent to the Emperor <hi>Iovinian,</hi> for his more full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning that truth which Arianism so mightily did impugn, was both in the East and the West Churches accepted as a treasure of inestimable price,<note place="margin">

It hath been the Custom of the Church of Christ, to end sometimes Prayers, and Sermons always, with words of glory, wherein, as long as the Blessed Trinity had due honor, and till Arianism had made it a matter of great sharpness and subtilty of Wit, to be a sound believing Christian; men were not curious what Syllables or Particles of speech they used. Upon which confidence and trust notwithstanding, when St. <hi>Basil</hi> began to practise the like indifferency, and to conclude Publick Prayers, glorifying sometime the Father, with the Son, and the Holy Ghost; sometime the Father, by the Son, in the Spirit; whereas long custom had enured them unto the former kindealone, by means whereof, the latter was new and strange in their ears: This needless experiment brought afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him a necessary labor of excusing himself to his Friends, and maintaining his own act against them, who because the Light of his Candle too much drowned theirs, were glad to lay hold on so colorourable matter, and exceeding forward to traduce him as an Author of suspicious Innovation. How hath the World forsaken that course which it sometime held? How are the judgments, hearts, and affections of men altered? May we not wonder, that a man of St. <hi>Basils</hi> authority and quality,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66185:140"/>
an Arch-Prelate in the House of God, should have his Name far and wide called in question, and be driven to his painful Apologies, to write in his own defence whole Volumes, and yet hardly to obtain with all his endeavor a pardon; the crime laid against him, being but onely a change of some one or two syllables in their usual Church Liturgy? It was thought in him an unpardonable offence to alter any thing; in us as intolerable, that we suffer any thing to remain unaltered. The very Creed of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and that sacred Hymn of Glory, then which, nothing doth sound more heavenly in the ears of faithful men, are now reckoned as superfluities, which we must in any case pare away, left we cloy God with too much service. Is there in that Confession of Faith, any thing which doth not at all times edefie and instruct the attentive hearer? Or is our Faith in the Blessed Trinity, a matter need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, to be so oftentimes mentioned and opened in the principal part of that duty which we ow to God, our Publick Prayer? Hath the Church of Christ from the first beginning, by a secret Universal Instinct of Gods good Spirit, always tied it self to end neither Sermon, nor almost any speech of moment which hath concerned Matters of God, without some special words of honor and glory to that Trinity which we all adore; and is the like conclusion of Psalms, become now at length an eye-sore, or a galling to their ears that hear it? Those flames of Arianism, they say, are quenched, which were the cause why the Church devised in such sort to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and praise the glorious Deity of the Son of God. Seeing therefore the sore is whole, why retain we as yet the Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ster? When the cause, why any thing was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained doth once cease, the thing it self should cease with it, that the Church being eased of unprofitable labors, needful offices may the better be attended. For the doing of things unnecessary, is many times the cause why the most necessary are not done. But in this case so to reason, will not serve their turns. For first, the ground whereupon they build, is not certainly their own, but with special limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Few things are so restrained to any one end or purpose, that the same being extinct, they should forthwith utterly become frustrate. Wisdom may have framed one and the same thing to serve commodiously for divers ends, and of those ends, any one be sufficient cause for continuance, though the rest have ceased, even as the Tongue, which Nature hath given us, for an Instrument of speech is not idle in dumb persons, because it also serveth for taste. Again, if time have worn out, or any other mean altogether taken away, what was first intended; uses, not thought upon before, may afterwards spring up, and be reasonable causes of retaining that which other considerations did formerly procure to be instituted. And it cometh sometime to pass, that a thing unnecessary in it self, as touching the whole direct purpose, whereto it was meant, or can be applied, doth notwithstanding appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be still held, even without use, lest by reason of that coherence which it hath with somewhat most necessary, the removal of the one, should indamage the other: And therefore men which have clean lost the possibility of sight, keep still their eyes nevertheless in the place where Nature set them. As for these two Branches whereof our Question groweth, Arianism was indeed some occasion of the one, but a cause of neither, much less the onely intire cause of both. For albeit, conflict with Arians brought forth the occasion of writing that Creed, which long after was made a part of the Church Liturgy, as Hymns and Sentences of Glory were a part thereof before; yet cause sufficient there is, why both should remain in use, the one as a most Divine Explication of the chiefest Articles of our Christian Belief, the other as an Heavenly acclamation of joyful applause to his praises in whom we believe; neither the one, nor the other unworthy to he heard souncing as they are in the Church of Christ, whether Arianism live or die. Against which poyson likewise, if we think, that the Church at this day needeth not those ancient preservatives, which ages before us were so glad to use, we deceive our selves greatly. The Weeds of Heresie being grown unto such ripeness as that was, do even in the very cutting down, scatter oftentimes those seeds which for a while lie unseen and buried in the Earth, but afterward freshly spring up again no less pernicious them at the first. Which thing they very well know, and I doubt not will easily confess, who live to their great, both toil and grief, where the blasphemies of <hi>Arians, Samosatenians, Tritheits, Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Maccdonians,</hi> are renewed by them,

As oft therefore, as any Publick or Universal scourge is removed, as oft as we are delivered from those, either imminent or present Calamities, against the storm and tempest whereof we all instantly craved favor from above, let it be a Question what we should render unto God for his Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings universally, sensibly, and extraordinarily bestowed. A Prayer of three or four lines inserted into some part of our Church Liturgy? No, we are not perswaded that when God doth in trouble injoyn us the duty of Invocation, and promise us the benefit of Deliverance, and profess, That the thing he expecteth after at our hands, is to glorifie him as our mighty and onely Saviour, the Church can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in manner convenient, a work of so great importance, by fore-ordaining some short Collect wherein briefly to mention thanks. Our custom therefore, whensoever so great occasions are incident, is by Publick Authority to appoint throughout all Churches, set and solemn Forms, as well of Supplication, as of Thanksgiving, the preparations and intended Complements whereof may stir up the mindes of men in much more effectual sort, then if onely there should be added to the Book of Prayer, that which they require. But we err in thinking, that they require any such matter. For albeit their words to our understanding be very plain, that in our Book <hi>there are Prayers set forth</hi> to be said when <hi>common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> are felt, as <hi>Plague, Famine,</hi> and such like; Again, that <hi>indeed so it ought to be by the Word of God:</hi> That likewise <hi>there ought to be as necessary Prayers of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving when we have received those things.</hi> Finally, that the want of such Forms of Thanksgiving for the release from those common calamities from which we have Petitions to be delivered, is the <hi>default of the Book of Common Prayer:</hi> Yet all this they mean, but only by way of <hi>supposition if express Prayers</hi> against so many Earthly miseries were convenient, that then indeed as many express and particular Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings should be likewise necessary. Seeing therefore we know that they hold the one superfluous, they would not have it so understood, as though their mindes were that any such addition to the Book is needful, whatsoever they say for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sake concerning this pretented defect. The truth is, they wave in and out, no way sufficiently grounded, no way resolved what to think, speak, or write, more then onely that, because they have taken it upon them, they must (no remedy now) be opposite.</p>

Our good or evil estate after death,<note place="margin">Touching Prayer for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from sudden death.</note> dependeth most upon the quality of our lives. Yet somewhat there is, why a vertuous minde should rather wish to depart this world with a kinde of treatable dissolution, then to be suddenly cut off in a moment; rather to be taken then snatched away from the face of the Earth. Death is that which all men suffer. but not all men with one minde, neither all men in one manner. For being of necessity a thing common, it is through the manifold perswasions, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and occasions of men, with equal desert both of praise and dispraise, shunned by some, by others desired. So that absolutely we cannot discommend, we cannot absolutely approve, either willingness to live, or forwardness to die. And concerning the ways of death, albeit the choice thereof be onely in his hands, who alone hath power over all flesh, and unto whose appointment we ought with patience meekly to submit our selves (for to be agents voluntarily in our own destruction, is against both God and Nature) yet there is no doubt, but in so great variety, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires will and may lawfully prefer one kinde before another. Is there any man of worth and vertue, although not instructed in the School of Christ, or ever taught what the soundness of Religion meaneth, that had not rather end the days of this transitory life, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or in <hi>Plato, Socrates,</hi> are described, then to sink down with them,<note place="margin">Job 34. 20.</note> of whom <hi>Elihu</hi> hath said, <hi>Momento Moriuntur,</hi> there is scarce an instant between their flourishing, and their not being? But let us which know what it is to die, as <hi>Absalon,</hi> or <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> died; let us beg of God, that when the

To such as judge things according to the sense of natural men, and ascend no higher, suddenness, because it shortneth their grief, should in reason be most acceptable.

And our Prayer against it, importeth a twofold desire; first, That death when it cometh, may give us some convenient respight; or secondly, If that be denied us of God, yet we may have wisdom to provide always beforehand; that those evils overtake us not, which death unexpected doth use to bring upon careless men; and that although it be sudden in it self, nevertheless in regard of our prepared mindes, it may not be sudden.</p>

Mindes religiously affected, are wont in every thing of weight and moment, which they do or see, to examine according unto rules of Piety, what dependency it hath on God, what reference to themselves, what coherence with any of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereunto all things in the World should lead, and accordingly they frame the inward disposition of their mindes, sometime to admire God, sometimes to bless him, and give him thanks, sometime to exult in his love, sometime to implore his mercy. All which different elevations of spirit unto God, are contained in the name of Prayer. Every good and holy desire, though it lack the form, hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in it seft the substance, and with him the force of a Prayer, who regardeth the very moanings, groans, and sighs of the heart of man. Petitionary Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to such as are in themselves impotent, and stand in need of relief from others. We thereby declare unto God, what our own desire is, that he by his power should effect.

The Prayers of the Just are accepted always, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways those things granted for which they pray: For in Prayer, if Faith and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to obtain, were both one and the same thing, seeing that the effect of not obtaining, is a plain testimony, that they which prayed, were not sure they should obtain; it would follow, that their Prayer being without certainty of the event, was also made unto God without Faith, and consequently, that God abhorred it. Which to think of so many Prayers of Saints, as we finde have failed in particular requests, how absurd were it? His faithful people have this comfort, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they rightly ask, the same (no doubt, but) they shall receive, so far as may stand with the glory of God, and their own everlasting good; unto either of which two, it is no vertuous mans purpose to seek, or desire to obtain any thing prejudicial; and therefore that clause which our Lord and Saviour in the Prayer of his Agony did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, we in Petitions of like nature, do always imply, <hi>Pater, si possibile est,</hi> If it may stand with thy will and pleasure.

For of Prayer there are two uses. It serveth as a mean to procure those things which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, to grant when we ask; and it serveth as a mean to express our lawful desires also towards that, which whether we shall have or no, we know not, till we see the event. Things in themselves unholy or unseemly, we may not ask; we may what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, being not forbidden, either Nature or Grace shall reasonably move us to wish as importing the good of men; albeit, God himself have no where by promise assured us of that particular which our Prayer craveth. To pray for that, which is in it self, and of its own nature, apparently a thing impossible, were not convenient. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though men do without offence wish daily, that the affairs which with evil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess are past, might have faln out much better, yet to pray that they may have been any other then they are, this being a manifest impossibilty in it self, the Rules of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion do not permit. Whereas contrariwise, when things of their own nature contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and mutable, are by the secret determination of God, appointed one way, though we the other way make our Prayers, and consequently ask those things of God, which are by this supposition impossible, we notwithstanding do not hereby in Prayer, transgress our lawful bounds. That Christ, as the onely begotten Son of God, having no Superior, and therefore owing honor unto none, neither standing in any need, should either give thanks, or make petition unto God, were most absurd. As Man, what could beseem him better, whether we respect his affection to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or his own necessity, or his charity and love towards men? Some things he knew should come to pass, and notwithstanding prayed for them, because he also knew that the necessary means to effect them, were his Prayers.

At the first to pray against all adversity was unlawful, because we cannot assure our selves that this will be granted. Now we have licence to pray against any particular adversity, and the reason given, because we know not but upon the event what God will do. If we know not what God will do, it followeth, that for any assurance we have, he may do otherwise then we pray, and we faithfully pray for that which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assuredly presume that God will grant. Seeing therefore neither of these two Answers will serve the turn, they have a third, which is, That to pray in such sort, is but idly mispent labor, because God hath already revealed his Will touching this request; and we know, that the sute we make, is denied before we make it.

                     <hi>He knew all things that should come upon him</hi>; the other less credible, if any thing may be of less credit then what the Scripture it self gain-sayeth. Doth any of them which wrote his sufferings, make report that memory failed him? Is there in his words and speeches any sign of defect that way? Did not himself declare before, whatsoever was to happen in the course of that whole tragedy? Can we gather by any thing, after taken from his own mouth, either in the place of publick judgment, or upon the Altar of the Cross, that through the bruising of his Body, some part of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his Soul were scattered and slipt from him? If that which was perfect both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, did fail at this onely middle instant, there must appear some manifest cause how it came to pass. True it is, that the pangs of his heaviness and grief were unspeakable; and as true, That because the mindes of the afflicted, do never think they have fully conceived the weight or measure of their own wo, they use their affection as a whetstone, both to wit and memory; these as Nurses do feed grief, so that the weaker his conceit had been touching that which he was to suffer, the more it must needs in that hour have helped to the mitigation of his anguish. But his anguish we see was then at the very highest whereunto it could possibly rise; which argueth his deep apprehension, even to the last drop of the Gall which that Cup contained, and of every circumstance wherein there was any force to augment heaviness; but above all things, the resolute determination of God, and his own unchangeable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which he at that time could not forget.

The Nature therefore of God being one, there are not in God divers Wills, although the God-head be in divers persons, because the power of willing, is a natural, not a personal propriety. Contrariwise, the Person of our Saviour Christ being but one, there are in him two Wills; because two Natures, the Nature of God, and the Nature of Man, which both do imply this Faculty and Power. So that in Christ there is a Divine, and there is an Humane will, otherwise he were not both God and Man. Hereupon the Church hath of old condemned Monothelites as Hereticks, for holding, That Christ had but one Will. The Works and Operations of our Saviours Humane will, were all subject to the Will of God, and framed according to his Law,<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 1.</note>

And in this sort special Reason often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times causeth the Will by choice to prefer one good thing before another, to leave one for anothers sake, to forgo meaner for the attainment of higher desires, which our Saviour likewise did. These different inclinations of the Will considered, the reason is easie, how in Christ there might grow desires seeming, but being not indeed opposite, either the one of them unto the other, or either of them to the Will of God.

Whereas therefore we finde in God a will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that Christ shall suffer; and in the Humane will of Christ two actual desires, the one avoiding, and the other accepting death; Is that desire which first declareth it self by Prayer, against that wherewith he concludeth Prayer, or either of them
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66185:145"/>
against his minde, to whom Prayer in this case seeketh? We may judge of these diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities in the Will, by the like in the Understanding. For as the intellectual part doth not cross it self, by conceiving man to be just and unjust, when it meaneth not the same man, nor by imagining the same man learned and unlearned, if learned in one skill, and in another kinde of learning unskilful, because the parts of every true opposition do always both concern the same subject, and have reference to the same thing, sith otherwise they are but in shew opposite, and not in truth: So the Will about one and the same thing may in contrary respects have contrary inclinations, and that without contrariety. The Minister of Justice may, for publike example to others, virtuously will the execution of that party, whose pardon another for cousanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake as virtuously may desire. Consider death in it self, and nature teacheth Christ to shun it. Consider death as a mean to procure the salvation of the World, and mercy worketh in Christ all willingness of minde towards it.<note place="margin">Isa. 53.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, compare them with the Will of God, and if any opposition be, it must be onely between his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs death, and the former desire which wisheth deliverance from death. But neither is this desire opposite to the Will of God. The Will of God was, that Christ should suffer the pains of death. Not so his will, as if the torment of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency did in it self please and delight God; but such was his Will, in regard of the end whereunto it was necessary, that Christ should suffer. The death of Christ in it self therefore, God willeth not, which to the end we might thereby obtain life, he both alloweth and appointeth. In like manner, the Son of Man endureth willingly to that purpose those grievous pains<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which simply not to have shunned had been against Nature, and by consequent against God. I take it therefore to be an error, that Christ either knew not what himself was to suffer, or else had forgotten the things he knew. The root of which error, was an over-restrained consideration of Prayer, as though it had no other lawful use, but onely to serve for a chosen mean, whereby the Will resolveth to seek that which the Understanding certainly knoweth it shall obtain: Whereas Prayers, in truth, both unto are, and his were, as well some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a presentation of meer desires, as a mean of procuring desired effects at the hands of God. We are therefore taught by his example, that the presence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous and dreadful objects, even in mindes most perfect, may as clouds over-cast all sensible joy; that no assurance touching future victories can make present conflicts so sweet and easie, but nature will shun and shrink from them; nature will desire case and deliverance from oppressive burthens; that the contrary determination of God is oftentimes against the effect of this desire, yet not against the affection it self, because it is naturally in us; that in such case our Prayers cannot serve us as means to obtain the thing we desire; that notwithstanding they are unto God most accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sacrifices, because they testifie we desire nothing but at his hands, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires we submit with contentment to be over-ruled by his Will; and in general they are not repugnant unto the Natural Will of God, which wisheth to the works of his own hands, in that they are his own handy-work, all happiness, although perhaps for some special cause in our own particular, a contrary determination have seemed more convenient; finally, that thus to propose our desires which cannot take such effects as we specifie, shall notwithstanding otherwise procure us his Heavenly grace, even as this very Prayer of Christ obtained Angels to be sent him,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 14.</note> as comforters in his Agony. And, according to this example, we are not afraid to present unto God our Prayers for those things, which that he will perform unto us, we have no sure nor certain knowledge. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Prayer for the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13 7.</note> that they might not do any evil, although he knew that no man liveth which sinneth not, although he knew that in this life we always must pray, <hi>Forgive us our sins.</hi> It is our frailty,<note place="margin">We may not pray in this life, to be free from all sin, because we must always prays. <hi>Forgive in our sins.

They pray in vain to have sin pardoned, which seek not also to prevent sin by Prayer, even every particular sin, by Prayer against all sin, except men can name some transgression wherewith we ought to have truce. For in very deed, although we cannot be free from all sin col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, in such sort that no part thereof, shall be found inherent in us, yet distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively,

at the least, all great and grievous actual offences, as they offer themselves one by one, both may and ought to be by all means avoided. So that in this sense, to be preserved from all sin, is not impossible. Finally, concerning deliverance it self from all adversity, we use not to say, men are in adversity whensoever they feel any small hinderance of their welfare in this World, but when some notable affliction or cross, some great calamity or trouble befalleth them. Tribulation hath in it divers circumstances, the Minde sundry faculties to apprehend them: It offereth sometime it self to the lower powers of the Soul, as a most unpleasant spectacle; to the higher sometimes, as drawing after it a train of dangerous inconveniences; sometime as bringing with it remedies for the curing of sundry evils, as Gods instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of revenge and fury sometime; sometime as a rod of his just, yet moderate, ire and displeasure; sometime, as matter for them that spightfully hate us to exercise their poysoned malice; sometime as a furnace of tryal for vertue to shew it self, and through conflict to obtain glory. Which different contemplations of adversity, do work for the most part their answerable effects. Adversity either apprehended by Sense as a thing offensive and grievous to Nature, or by Reason conceived as a snare, an occasion of many mens falling from God, a sequel of Gods indignation and wrath, a thing which Satan desireth, and would be glad to behold; Tribulation thus considered being present causeth sorrow, and being imminent breedeth fear. For moderation of which two affections, growing from the very natural bitterness and gall of adversity,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> the Scripture much alledgeth contrary fruits, which Affliction likewise hath whensoever it falleth on them that are tractable, the grace of Gods holy Spirit concurring therewith.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12.

Such Prayers of the Church to be delivered from all adversity, are no more repugnant to any reasonable disposition of mens mindes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards death, much less to that blessed Patience and meek Contentment which Saints by Heavenly inspiration have to endure, (what cross or calamity soever it pleaseth God to lay upon them) then our Lord and Saviours own Prayer before his Passion, was repugnant unto his most gracious resolution to die for the sins of the whole World.</p>

The other is a duty which belongeth unto all, and prevaileth with God daily. For as it is in it self good, so God accepteth and taketh it in very good part, at the hands of faithful men. Our Prayers for all men do include, both them that shall finde mercy, and them also that shall finde none. For them that shall, no man will doubt but our Prayers are both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and granted. Touching them for whom we crave that mercy which is not to be obtained, let us not think that our Saviour did mis-instruct his Disciples,<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 11, 12.</note> willing them to pray for the peace, even of such as should be uncapable of so great a bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or that the Prayers of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> offended God,<note place="margin">Jere. 15. 1.</note> because the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of God was a resolute denial of favor to them, for whom Supplication was made. And if any man doubt, how God should accept such Prayers in case they be opposite to his Will, or not grant them, if they be according unto that which himself will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, our answer is, That such suits God accepteth, in that they are conformable unto his <hi>general inclination,</hi> which is, that all men might be saved; yet always he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not, for as much as there is in God sometimes a more private <hi>occasioned

will,</hi> which determineth the contrary. So that the other being the rule of our actions, and not this; our requests for things opposite to this Will of God, are not therefore the less gracious in his sight. There is no doubt but we ought in all things to frame our wills to the Will of God, and that otherwise in whatsoever we do, we sin. For of our selves, being so apt to err, the onely way which we have to streighten our paths, is by following the rule of his Will, whose footsteps natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are right. If the eye, the hand, or the foot, do that which the will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, though they serve as instruments to sin, yet is sin the commanders fault, and not theirs, because Nature hath absolutely, and without exception, made them subjects to the will of man, which is Lord over them. As the body is subject to the will of man, so mans will to the Will of God; for so it behoveth, that the better should guide and command the worse. But because the subjection of the body to the will, is by natural necessity, the subjection of the Will unto God volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; we therefore stand in need of direction, after what sort our wills and desires may be rightly conformed to his. Which is not done, by willing always the self-same thing that God intendeth. For it may chance, that his purpose is sometime the speedy death of them, whose long continuance in life if we should not wish we were unnatural. When the object or matter therefore of our desires is (as in this case) a thing both good of it self, and not forbidden of God; when the end for which we desire it, is vertuous and apparently most holy; when the root from which our affection towards it proceedeth, is Charity, Piety that which we do in declaring our desire by Prayer; yea, over and besides all this, sith we know, that to pray for all men living, is but to shew the same affection which towards every of them our Lord Jesus Christ hath born, who knowing onely as God who are his, did as Man taste death for the good of all men; surely,<note place="margin">Propterea ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis erat, si Christus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo secundum affectum pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis quam in humanitate sui assumpse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat aliquid vo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lebat, quod tamen secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem divinam, in qua cum Fatre ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Church every where maketh Prayers unto God, not onely for Saints, and such as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Christ are regenerate; but for all Infidels and Enemies of the Cross of Iesus Christ, for all Idolaters, for all that persecute Christ in his followers, for Iews to whose blindness the Light of the Gospel doth not yet shine, for Hereticks and Schismaticks, who from the Unity of Faith and Charity are estranged. And for such, what doth the Church ask of God but this, That leaving their Errors, they may be converted unto him, that Faith and Charity may be given them, and that out of the darkness of ignorance, they may come to the knowledge of his truth? Which because they cannot themselves do in their own behalf, as long as the sway of evil custom ever-beareth them, and the chains of Satan detain them bound, neither are they able to break through those Errors wherein they are so determinately setled, that they pay unto falsity, the whole sum of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever love is owing unto Gods Truth. Our Lord merciful and just, requireth to have all men prayed for; that when we behold innumerable multitudes drawn up from the depth of so bottomless evils; we may not doubt, but (in part) God hath done the thing we requested; nor despair, but that being thankful for them, towards whom already he hath shewed mercy; the rest which are not as yet enlightned, shall before they pass out of life, be made partakers of the like grace. Or if the Grace of him which saveth [for so we set is falleth out] over-pass some, so that the Prayer of the Church for them be not received, this we may leave to the hidden Iudgments of Gods Righteousness, and acknowledge that in this Secret there is a Gulf, which, whole we live, we shall never sound.</hi>

As many therefore as are apparently to our judgment born of God, they have the Seed of their Regeneration by the Ministery of the Church, which useth to that end and purpose, not onely the Word, but the Sacrament, both having Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative force and vertue. As oft as we mention a Sacrament properly understood (for in the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, all Articles which are peculiar to Christian Faith, all Duties of Religion containing that which Sense or Natural Reason cannot of it self discern, are most commonly named Sacraments) our restraint of the Word to some few principal Divine Ceremonies, importeth in every such Ceremony two things, the Substance of the Ceremony it self which is visible; and, besides that, somewhat else more secret, in reference whereunto we conceive that Ceremony to be a Sacrament. For we all admire and honor the holy Sacraments, not respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much the Service which we do unto God in receiving them, as the dignity of that Sacred and Secret Gift which we thereby receive from God. Seeing that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therefore consist altogether in relation to some such Gift or Grace Supernatural, as onely God can bestow, how should any but the Church administer those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as Sacraments, which are not thought to be Sacraments by any, but by the Church? There is in Sacraments to be observed their Force and their Form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration. Upon their Force, their necessity dependeth. So that how they are necessary we cannot discern, till we see how effectual they are. When Sacraments are said to be Visible Signs of Invisible Grace, we thereby conceive how Grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very end for which these Heavenly Mysteries were instituted; and besides sundry other Properties observed in them, the matter whereof they consist, is such as signifieth, Figureth, and representeth their End. But still their efficacy resteth obscure to our understanding, except we search somewhat more distinctly what Grace in particular that is, whereunto they are referred, and what manner of operation they have towards it. The use of Sacraments is, but onely in this life, yet so, that here they concern a far better life then this, and are for that cause accompanied with Grace, which worketh Salvation. Sacraments are the Powerful Instruments of God to Eternal Life. For as our Natural Life consisteth in the Union of the Body with the Soul; so our Life Supernatural in the Union of the Soul with God.

For as much therefore as Christ hath no personal subsistence but one, whereby we acknowledge him to have been eternally the Son of God, we must of necessity apply to the Person of the Son of God, even that which is spoken of Christ, according to his Humane nature. For example, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the flesh, he was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> in the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> by <hi>Pilate</hi> adjudged to die, and executed by the Jews.

If we should say, that the Person of a Man in our Saviour Christ was the subject of these things, this were plainly to intrap our selves in the very snare of the Nestorians Heresie, between whom, and the Church of God, there was no difference, saving onely, that <hi>Nestorius</hi> imagined in Christ, as well a Personal Humane subsistence, as a Divine; the Church acknowledging a substance, both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane, but no other Personal subsistence then Divine, because the Son of God took not to himself a mans person, but the nature onely of a man. Christ is a Person both Divine and Humane, howbeit not therefore two persons in one; neither both these in one sense, but a Person Divine, because he is personally the Son of God; Humane, because he hath really the nature of the Children of Men.

On Christ therefore, is bestowed the Gift of Eternal Generation, the Gift of Union, and the Gift of Unction.

Touching Union of Deity with Manhood, it is by Grace, because there can be no greater Grace shewed towards Man, then that God should vouchsafe to unite to Mans nature, the Person of his onely begotten Son.

Neither is it a thing impossible, That the Word being made Flesh, should be that which it was not before, as touching the manner of subsistence, and yet continue in all Qualities or Properties of Nature the same it was, because the Incarnation of the Son of God consisteth <hi>meerly in the Union</hi> of Natures, which Union doth adde Perfection to the Weaker, to the Nobler no alteration at all. If therefore it be demanded what the Person of the Son of God hath attained by assuming Manhood; surely, the whole sum of all, is this, to be as we are, truly, really, and naturally Man, by means whereof he is made capable of meaner offices, then otherwise his Person could have admitted, the onely gain he thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for himself, was to be capable of loss and detriment for the good of others. But may it rightly be said concerning the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, That as our Nature hath in no respect changed his, so from his to ours, as little alteration hath ensued? The very cause of his taking upon him our Nature, was to change it, to better the Quality, and to advance the condition thereof, although in no sort to abolish the Substance which he took; nor to infuse into it the Natural forces and Properties of his Deity. As therefore we have shewed, how the Son of God by his Incarnation hath changed the manner of that Personal subsistence, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was solitary, and is now in the Association of Flesh, no alteration thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to the Nature of God; so neither are the <hi>Properties of Mans nature,</hi> in the Person of Christ, by force and vertue of the same Conjunction so much altered, as not to stay within those limits which our Substance is bordered withal; nor the <hi>state and quality</hi> of our Substance so unaltered, but that there are in it many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects proceeding from so near Copulation with Deity. God from us can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing, we by him have obtained much. For albeit, the Natural Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Deity be not communicable to Mans nature, the Supernatural Gifts, Graces, and Effects thereof, are. The honor which our Flesh hath by being the Flesh of the Son of God, is in many respects great. If we respect but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto us with him, the Glory provided for him and his in the Kingdom of Heaven, his Right and Title thereunto, even in that he is Man, differeth from other mens, because he is that Man of whom God is himself a part. We have right to the same Inheritance with Christ, but not the same right which he hath; his being such as we cannot reach, and ours such as he cannot stoop unto. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, to be the Way, the Truth, and the Life; to be the Wisdom, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Sanctification, Resurrection; to be the Peace of the whole World, the Hope of the Righteous, the Heir of all things; to be that Supream Head whereunto all Power, both in Heaven and in Earth is given: These are not Honors common unto Christ, with other Men; they are Titles above the dignity and worth of any which were but a meer Man, yet true of Christ, even in that he is Man, but Man with whom Deity is personally joyned, and unto whom it hath added those excellencies which makes him more then worthy thereof.

But shall we say, that in Heaven his glorious Body, by vertue of the same cause, hath now power to present it self in all places, and to be every where at once present? We nothing doubt, but God hath many ways above the reach of our capacities, exalted that Body which it hath pleased him to make his own, that Body wherewith he hath saved the World, that Body which hath been, and is the Root of Eternal Life; the Instrument wherewith Deity worketh, the Sacrifice which taketh away sin, the Price which hath ransomed Souls from Death, the Leader of the whole Army of Bodies that shall rise again.

All things are in such sort divided, into Finite and Infinite, that no one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Nature, or Quality, can be possibly capable of both. The World and all things in the World, are stinted; all effects that proceed from them; all the powers and abilities whereby they work; whatsoever they do, whatsoever they may, and whatsoever they are, is limited. Which limitation of each Creature, is both the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and also the perservation thereof. Measure, is that which perfecteth all things, because every thing is for some end; neither can that thing be available to any end, which is not proportionable thereunto; and to proportion as well excesses, as defects, are opposite. Again, for as much as nothing doth perish, but onely through excess or defect of that, the due proportioned measure whereof doth give perfection, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That measure is likewise the preservation of all things.

Seeing therefore that Presence every where is the sequel of an infinite and incomprehensible Substance, (for what can be every where, but that which can no where be comprehended?) To enquire, whether Christ be every where, is to enquire of a Natural Property, a Property that cleaveth to the Deity of Christ. Which Deity being common unto him with none, but onely the Father, and the Holy Ghost, it followeth, That nothing of Christ which is limited, that nothing created, that neither the Soul nor the Body of Christ, and consequently, not Christ as Man, or Christ according to his Humane Nature, can possibly be every where present, because those phrases of Limitation and Restraint, do either point out the principal subject whereunto every such attribute adhereth, or else they intimate the radical cause out of which it groweth. For example, when we say, that Christ as Man, or according to his Humane Nature, suffered death; we show what Nature was the proper subject of Mortality: When we say, that as God, or according to his Deity, he conquered Death, we declare his Deity to have been the cause, by force and vertue whereof, lie raised himself from the Grave. But neither is the Manhood of Christ, that subject whereunto Universal Presence agreeth, neither is it the cause original, by force whereof his Person is enabled to be everywhere present. Wherefore Christ is essentially present with all things, in that he is very God, but not present with all things as Man, because Manhood and the parts thereof, can neither be the cause, nor the true subject of such Presence. Notwithstanding, somewhat more plainly to shew a true immediate reason, wherefore the Manhood of Christ, can neither be every where present, nor cause the Person of Christ so to be, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> concerning Christ most true,<note n="c" place="margin">Quod id cero bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and it doth not appear, that any one Creature hath Power to be present withall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Whereupon nevertheless it will not follow, that Christ cannot therefore be thus present, because he is himself a Creature; for as much as onely Infinite Presence, is that which cannot possibly stand with the Essence or Being of any Creature; as for Presence with all things that are, sith the whole Race, Mass, and Body of them is Finite, Christ by being a <hi>Creature,</hi> is not <hi>in that respect</hi> excluded from possibility of Presence with them. That which excludeth him therefore, as Man, from so great largeness of Presence, is onely his being <hi>Man,</hi> a Creature <hi>of this particular kinde,</hi> whereunto the God of Nature hath set those bounds of restraint and limitation, beyond which, to attribute unto it any thing more then a Creature <hi>of that sort</hi> can admit, were to give it another Nature, to make it a Creature of some other kinde then in truth it is. Furthermore, if Christ, in that he is Man, be every where present, seeing this cometh not by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Manhood it self, there is no other way how it should grow, but either by the Grace of Union with Deity, or by the Grace of Unction received from Deity. It hath been already sufficiently proved, that by Force of Union, the Properties of both Natures are imparted <hi>to the Person onely,</hi> in whom they are, and not what belongeth to the one Nature, really conveyed or translated into the other; it hath been likewise proved, That Natures united in Christ, continue the very same which they are, where they are not united. And concerning the Grace of Unction, wherein are contained the Gifts and Vertues which Christ as Man hath above men, they make him Really and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually a Man more excellent then we are, they take not from him the Nature and Substance that we have, they cause not his Soul nor Body to be of another kinde, then ours is. Supernatural endowments, are an advancement, they are no extinguishment of that Nature whereto they are given. The Substance of the Body of Christ hath no Presence, neither can have, but onely Local. It was not therefore every where seen, nor did it every where suffer death, every where it could not be intombed, it is not every where now being exalted into Heaven. There is no proof in the World strong to inforce, that Christ had a true Body, but by the true and natural Properties of his Body.

                     <hi>Make thou no doubt or question of it</hi> (saith St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>but that the Man Christ Iesus, is now in that very place from whence he shall come in the same Form and Substance of Flesh, which he carried thither, and from which he hath not taken Nature, but given thereunto Immortality. According to this Form, he spreadeth not out himself into all places: For it behoveth us to take great heed, lest while we go about to maintain the glorious Deity of him, which is Man, we leave him not the true Bodily Substance of a Man.</hi> According to St. <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion therefore, that Majestical Body which we make to be every where present, doth thereby cease to have the Substance of a true Body. To conclude, We hold it in regard of the fore-alleaged proofs, a most infallible truth, That Christ as Man, is not every where present. There are which think it as infallibly true, That Christ is every where present as Man, which peradventure in some sense may be well enough granted. His Humane Substance in it self, is naturally absent from the Earth; his Soul and Body not on Earth, but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely: Yet because this Substance is inseparably joyned to that Personal Word, which by his very Divine Essence, is present with all things; the Nature which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have in it self Universal Presence, hath it <hi>after a sort,</hi> by being <hi>no where severed</hi> from that which every where is present. For in as much as that Infinite Word is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible into parts, it could not in part, but must needs be wholly incarnate, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wheresoever the Word is, it hath with it Manhood, else should the Word be in part, or somewhere God onely, and not Man, which is impossible. For the <hi>Person of Christ is whole,</hi> perfect God, and perfect Man, wheresoever; although the parts of his Manhood, being Finite, and his Deity Infinite, we cannot say, that the <hi>whole of Christ</hi> is simply every where, as we may say, that his Deity is, and that his Person is by Force of Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For, <hi>somewhat of the Person of Christ</hi> is not every where in that sort, namely, His Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66185:152"/>
the <hi>onely Conjunction</hi> whereof with Deity is extended as far as Deity, the <hi>actual position</hi> restrained and tied to a certain place; yet presence <hi>by way of Conjunction,</hi> is in some sort presence. Again, As the Manhood of Christ may after a sort be every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where said to be present, because that Person is every where present, from whose Divine Substance, Manhood is no where severed: So the same Universality of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, may likewise seem in another respect appliable thereunto, namely, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation with Deity, and that <hi>in all things.</hi> The Light created of God in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, did first by it self illuminate the World; but after that the Sun and Moon were created, the World sithence hath by them always enjoyed the same. And that Deity of Christ, which before our Lords Incarnation, wrought all things without man, doth now work nothing wherein the Nature which it hath assumed, is either absent from it, or idle. Christ as Man, hath all Power both in Heaven and Earth given him.<note place="margin">Matth. 28. Rom. 14. 8.</note> He hath as Man, not as God onely, Supream Dominion over quick and dead; for so much his Ascension into Heaven, and his Session at the right Hand of God, do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The Son of God which did first humble himself, by taking our flesh upon him, descended afterwards much lower, and became according to the Flesh obedient, so far as to suffer Death, even the Death of the Cross for all men, because such was his Fathers Will. The former was an Humiliation of Deity, the later an Humiliation of Manhood;<note place="margin">Psal. 2 9. Heb. 2. 9. Revel. 5 12.</note> for which cause there followed upon the latter an Exaltation of that which was humbled: For with Power he created the World, but restored it by obedience. In which obedience, as according to his Manhood, he had glorified God on Earth; so God hath glorified in Heaven, that Nature which yielded him obedience; and hath given unto Christ, even in that he is Man, such Fulness of Power over the whole World, that he which before fulfilled in the state of Humility and Patience, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God did require, doth now reign in Glory till the time that all things be restored.<note place="margin">Luk. 21.27. Acts 3. 21. Ephes. 4. 9.</note> He which came down from Heaven, and descended into the lowest parts of the Earth, is ascended far above all Heavens; that fitting at the right Hand of God, he might from thence fill all things with the gracious and happy fruits of his saving Presence. Ascension into Heaven, is a plain local translation of Christ, according to his Manhood, from the lower to the higher parts of the World. Session at the right Hand of God, is the actual exercise of that Regency and Dominion, wherein the Manhood of Christ is joyned, and matched with the Deity of the Son of God. Not that his Manhood was before without the Possession of the same Power, but because the full use thereof was suspended, till that Humility which had been before as a vail to hide and conceal Majesty, were laid aside. After his rising again from the dead,<note place="margin">Ephes 1.20.</note> then did God set him at his right Hand in Heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and might, and domination, and every name that is named, not in this World onely, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet,<note place="margin">Psal. 3. 4. Heb. 2. 6.</note> and hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him over all the Head to the Church, which is his Body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 25.</note> The Scepter of which Spiritual Regiment over us in this present World is at the length to be yielded up into the hands of the Father which gave it; that is to say, The use and exercise thereof shall cease, there being no longer on Earth any Militant Church to govern. This Government therefore he exerciseth both as God and as Man; as God, by Essential Presence with all things; as Man, by Co-operation with that which essentially is present. Touching the manner how he worketh as Man in all things; the Principal Powers of the Soul of Man, are the Will and Understanding, the one of which two in Christ assenteth unto all things, and from the other nothing which Deity doth work, is hid; so that by knowledge and assent, the Soul of Christ is present with all things which the Deity of Christ work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And even the Body of Christ it self, although the definite limitation thereof be most sensible, doth notwithstanding admit in some sort a kinde of infinite and unlimited Presence likewise. For his Body being a part of that Nature, which whole Nature is presently joyned unto Deity; wheresoever Deity is, it followeth, That his Bodily Substance hath every where a Presence of true Conjunction with Deity. And for as much as it is, by vertue of that Conjunction, made the Body of the Son of God, by whom also it was made a Sacrifice for the sins of the whole World, this giveth it a <hi>presence of force and efficacy,</hi> throughout all Generations of Men.

Which things indifferently every way considered, that gracious promise of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ concerning presence with his to the very end of the World, I see no cause but that we may well and safely interpret he doth perform, both as God, by essential presence of Deity, and as Man, in that order, sense, and meaning, which hath been shewed.</p>

                        </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin in Symbol.</note> The Persons of the Godhead, by reason of the Unity of their substance, do as necessarily remain one within another, as they are of necessity to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one from another, because two are the issue of one, and one the Off-spring of the other two; onely of three, one not growing out of any other. And sith they all are but one God in number, one indivisible Essence or Substance, their distinction cannot possibly admit Separation. For how should that subsist solitarily by it self, which hath no substance, but individually the very same, whereby others subsist with it; seeing that the Multiplication of Substances in particular, is necessarily required to make those things subsist apart, which have the self-same General Nature, and the Persons of that Trinity, are not three particular Substances, to whom one General Nature is common, but three that subsist by one substance, which it self is Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; yet they all three have it, and their several ways of having it, are that which maketh their Personal distinction? The Father therefore is in the Son, and the Son in him; they both in the Spirit, and the Spirit in both them. So that the Fathers first Off-spring which is the Son, remaineth eternally in the Father; the Father eternally also in the Son, no way severed or divided, by reason of the sole and single Unity of their Substance. The Son in the Father, as Light in that Light out of which it floweth without separation; the Father in the Son, as Light in that Light which it causeth, and leaveth not. And because in this respect his eternal Being is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which eternal Being is his Life, therefore he by the Father liveth. Again, sith all things do accordingly love their Off-spring, as themselves are more or less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, he which is thus the onely begotten, must needs be in this degree the onely Beloved of the Father. He therefore which is in the Father, by eternal Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Being and Life from him, must needs be in him through an eternal Affection of love. His Incarnation causeth him also as man to be now in the Father, and the Father to be in him. For in that he is Man, he receiveth Life from the Father, as from the Fountain of that Ever-living Deity, which in the Person of the Word hath combined it self with Manhood, and doth thereunto impart such life, as to no other Creature besides him is communicated. In which consideration likewise,<note place="margin">Luke 3 22. Joh 3. 14.35. &amp; 5 20. &amp; 10. 17 &amp; 14. 31. &amp; 15. 10.</note> the love of the Father towards him, is more then it can be towards any other; neither can any attain unto that perfection of love, which he beareth towards his Heavenly Father. Wherefore God is not so in any, nor any so in God as Christ; whether we consider him as the Personal Word of God, or as the Natural Son of Man. All other things that are of God, have God in them, and he them in himself likewise. Yet because their Substance and his wholly differeth, their coherence and communion either with him or amongst themselves, is in no sort like unto that before mentioned. God hath his influence into the very Essence of all things, without which influence of Deity supporting them, their utter annihilation could not chuse but follow. Of him all things have both received their first Being, and their continuance to be that which they are. All things are therefore partakers of God, they are his Off-spring, his influence is in them, and the Personal Wisdom of God is, for that very cause, said

to excel in nimbleness or agility, to pierce into all intellectual, pure, and subtile spirits,<note place="margin">Wisd. 7. 29.</note> to go through all, and to reach unto every thing which is. Otherwise, how should the same Wisdom be that which supporteth, beareth up, and sustaineth all?<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God doth work, the hands of all three Persons are joyntly and equally in it, according to <hi>the order of that connexion,</hi> whereby they each depend upon other. And therefore albeit in that respect the Father be first, the Son next, the Spirit last, and consequently nearest unto every effect which groweth from all three; nevertheless, they all being of one Essence, are likewise all of one Efficacy. Dare any man, unless he be ignorant altogether how inseparable the Persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are, perswade himself that every of them may have their sole and several Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, or that we being not partakers of all, can have fellowship with any one?<note place="margin">John 14. 13.</note> The Father as Goodness, the Son as Wisdom, the Holy Ghost as Power, do all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in every particular, outwardly issuing from that one onely glorious Deity which they all are. For that which moveth God to work, is Goodness; and that which ordereth his Work, is Wisdom; and that which perfecteth his Work, is Power. All things which God in their times and seasons hath brought forth, were eternally and before all times in God, as a work unbegun is in the Artificer, which afterward bringeth it unto effect. Therefore whatsoever we do behold now in this present World, it was inwrapped within the Bowels of Divine Mercy, written in the Book of Eternal Wisdom, and held in the hands of Omnipotent Power, the first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the World being as yet unlaid. So that all things which God hath made, are in that respect the Off-spring of God,<note place="margin">Acts 19.28, 29. Joh. 1.4. &amp; 1.10. Isai. 40.26.</note> they are in him as effects in their highest cause; he likewise actually is in them, the assistance and influence of his Deity is their life. Let hereunto saving efficacy be added, and it bringeth forth a special Off-spring amongst men, containing them to whom God hath himself given the gracious and amiable name of Sons. We are by Nature the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> When God created <hi>Adam,</hi> he created us; and as many as are descended from <hi>Adam,</hi> have in themselves the Root, out of which they spring. The Sons of God we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all, nor any one of us, otherwise then onely by grace and favor. The Sons of God have Gods own Natural Son, as a second <hi>Adam</hi> from Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note> whose Race and Progeny they are by Spiritual and Heavenly Birth. God therefore loving eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally his Son, he must needs eternally in him, have loved and preferred before all others, them which are spiritually sithence descended and sprung out of him.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 3,4.</note> These were in God as in their Saviour, and not as in their Creator onely. It was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his <hi>saving</hi> Goodness, his <hi>saving</hi> Wisdom, and his <hi>saving</hi> Power, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it self towards them. They which thus were in God eternally by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended admission to life, have, by vocation or adoption, God actually now in them, as the Artificer is in the Work, which his hand doth presently frame. Life as all other gifts and benefits, groweth originally from the Father, and cometh not to us but by the Son; nor by the Son to any of us in particular, but through the Spirit.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 11. Rom. 8. 10. 3 Cor. 13. 13.</note> For this cause the Apostle wisheth to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God, and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost.

                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> We are therefore in God, through Christ eternally, according to that intent and purpose, whereby we are chosen to be made his in this present World, before the World it self was made: We are in God, through the knowledge which is had of us, and the love which is born towards us from everlasting. But in God we actually are no longer then onely from the time of our actual Adoption into the Body of his true Church, into the Fellowship of his Children. For his Church he knoweth and loveth; so that they which are in the Church, are thereby known to be in him. Our being in Christ by Eternal fore-knowledge saveth us not, without our Actual and Real A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption into the Fellowship of his Saints in this present World. For in him we actually are by our actual incorporation into that Society which hath him for their Head;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.10.</note> and doth make together with him one Body, (he and they in that respect having one name) for which cause by vertue of this Mystical Conjunction, we are of him, and in him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 11.

Ephes. 5. 23.</note> It is too cold an interpretation, whereby some men expound our Being in Christ to import nothing else, but onely, That the self-same Nature which maketh us to be Men, is in him, and maketh him Man as we are. For what man in the World is there, which hath not so far forth communion with Jesus Christ? It is not this that can sustain the weight of such sentences as speak of the Mystery of our Coherence with Jesus Christ. The Church is in Christ,<note place="margin">John 14. 30. &amp; 15. 4.</note> as <hi>Eve</hi> was in <hi>Adam.</hi> Yea, by Grace we are every of us in Christ, and in his Church, and in his Church, as by Nature we were in those our first Parents. God made <hi>Eve</hi> of the Rib of <hi>Adam:</hi> And his Church he frameth out of the very Flesh, the very wounded and bleeding side of the Son of Man. His Body crucified and his Blood shed for the Life of the World,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 48.</note> are the true Elements of that Heavenly Being, which maketh us such as himself is of whom we come. For which cause the words of <hi>Adam</hi> may be fitly the words of Christ concerning his Church, <hi>Flesh of my Flesh, and Bone of my Bones</hi>; a true Nature extract out of my own Body. So that in him, even according to his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, we, according to our Heavenly Being, are as Branches in that Root out of which they grow.

That which in him made our Nature uncorrupt, was the Union of his Deity with our Nature. And in that respect the sentence of Death and Condemnation, which onely taketh hold upon sinful flesh, could no way possibly extend unto him. This caused his voluntary death for others to prevail with God, and to have the force of an Expiatory Sacrifice. The Blood of Christ, as the Apostle witnesseth, doth therefore take away sin,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> because <hi>through the Eternal Spirit, he offered himself unto God without spot.</hi> That which sanctified our Nature in Christ, that which made it a Sacrifice available to take away sin, is the same which quickneth it, raised it out of the Grave after Death, and exalted it unto Glory.

Our corruptible bodies could never live the life they shall live, were it not that here they are joyned with his Body, which is incorruptible, and that his is in ours as a cause immortality, a cause by removing through the Death and Merit of his own Flesh that which hindered the life of ours.

Thus much no Christian Man will deny, That when Christ sanctified his own Flesh, giving as God, and taking as Man the Holy Ghost, he did not this for himself onely, but for our sakes, that the Grace of Sanctification and Life, which was first received in him, might pass from him to his whole Race, as Malediction came from <hi>Adam</hi> unto all mankinde, Howbeit, because the Work of his Spirit to those effects is in us prevented by Sin and Death, possessing us before; it is necessity, that as well our present Sanctification unto newness of life; as the future of Restauration of our Bodies, should presuppose a participation of the Grace, Efficacy, Merit, or Vertue of his Body and Blood; without which Foundation first laid, there is no place for those other operations of the Spirit of Christ to ensue.

But most assured we are, that we all receive of his Fulness, because he is in us as a moving and working Cause; from which, many blessed effects are really found to ensue, and that in sundry, both kindes and degrees, all tending to eternal happiness. It must be confest, that of Christ, working as a Creator, and a Governor of the World by providence, all are partakers; not all partakers of that Grace, whereby he inhabiteth whom he saveth. Again, as he dwelleth not by Grace in all, so neither doth he equally work in all them in whom he dwelleth. <note n="b" place="margin">

Christ is whole with the whole Church, and whole with every part of the Church, as touching his Person which can no way divide it self, or be possest by degrees and portions. But the Participation of Christ importeth, besides the Presence of Christs Person, and besides the Mystical Copulation thereof, with the Parts and Members of his whole Church, a true actual influence of Grace whereby the life which we live according to godliness, is his;<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Eph. 1.7.</note> as when Grace is inwardly bestowed while we are on Earth, and afterwards more fully, both our Souls and Bodies make like unto his in Glory.

Rom. 9.23.</note> sometime the Pledge of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance, sometime the Hansel or Earnest of that which is to come. From hence it is, that they which belong to the Mystical Body of our Saviour Christ, and be in number as the Stars of Heaven, divided successively, by reason of their mortal condition, into many Generations,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.29. Eph. 4. 15. Rom. 12. 5. Eph. 4. 29.</note> are notwithstanding coupled every one to Christ their Head, and all unto every particular person amongst themselves, in as much as the same Spirit, which anointed the Blessed Soul of our Saviour Christ, doth so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malize, unite, and actuate his whole Race, as if both he and they, were so many Limbs compacted into one Body, by being quickned all with one and the same Soul. That wherein we are Partakers of Jesus Christ by Imputation, agreeth equally unto all that have it. For it consisteth in such Acts and Deeds of his, as could not have longer continuance, then while they were in doing, nor at that very time belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other, but to him from whom they come; and therefore how men, either then, or before, or fithence, should be made Partakers of them, there can be no way imagined, but onely by Imputation. Again, a Deed must either not be imputed to any, but rest altogether in him, whose it is; or if at all it be imputed, they which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66185:155"/>
have it by Imputation, must have it such as it is, whole. So that degrees being neither in the Personal Presence of Christ, nor in the Participation of those effects which are ours by Imputation onely, it resteth, that we wholly apply them to the Participation of Christs infused Grace; although, even in this kinde also, the first beginning of Life, the Seed of God, the First-fruits of Christs Spirit, be without latitude. For we have hereby onely the being of the Sons of God, in which number how far soever one may seem to excel another, yet touching this that all are Sons, they are all equals, some happily better Sons then the rest are, but none any more a Son then another. Thus therefore we see, how the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; how they both are in all things, and all things in them; what Communion Christ hath with his Church, how his Church and every Member thereof, is in him by original deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and he personally in them, by way of Mystical Association, wrought through the Gift of the Holy Ghost, which they that are his, receive from him, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the same, what benefit soever the vital force of his Body and Blood may yield; yea, by steps and degrees they receive the compleat measure of all such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace as doth sanctifie and save throughout, till the day of their Final Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a state of Fellowship in glory with him, whose partakers they are now in those things that tend to glory. As for any mixture of the Substance of his Flesh with ours, the Participation which we have of Christ includeth no such kinde of gross surmise.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The necessity of Sacraments unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatien of Christ.</note>57. It greatly offendeth, that some, when they labor to shew the use of the holy Sacraments, assign unto them no end but onely to teach the minde, by other seases, that which the Word doth teach by Hearing. Whereupon how easily neglect and careless regard of so Heavenly Mysteries may follow, we see in part by some experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had of those Men, with whom that opinion is most strong. For where the Word of God may be heard, which teacheth with much more Expedition, and more full Explications, any thing we have to learn; if all the benefit we reap by Sacraments be instruction, they which at all times have opportunity of using the better mean to that purpose, will surely hold the worse in less estimation. And unto Infants which are not capable of instruction, who would not think it a meer superfluity, that any Sacrament is administred, if to administer the Sacraments, be but to teach receivers what God doth for them? There is of Sacraments therefore, undoubtedly, some other more excellent and Heavenly use. Sacraments, by reason of their mixt Nature, are more diversly interpreted and disputed of, then any other part of Religion besides; for that in so great store of Properties belonging to the self-same thing, as every Mans wit hath taken hold of some especial consideration above the rest, so they have accordingly seemed one to cross another, as touching their several opinions about the necessity of Sacraments; whereas in truth their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement is not great. For, let respect be had to the duty which every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant doth undertake, and we may well determine concerning the use of Sacraments, that they serve as Bonds of Obedience to God, strict Obligations to the mutual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Christian Charity, Provocations to Godliness, Preservations from Sin, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of the Principal benefits of Christ; respect the time of their institution, and it thereby appeareth, that God hath annexed them for ever unto the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as other Rites were before with the Old; regard the weakness which is in us, and they are warrants for the more security of our belief: Compare the receivers of then with such as receive them not, and Sacraments are marks of distinction to separate Gods own from strangers; so that in all these respects, they are sound to be most necessary. But their chiefest force and vertue, consisteth not herein so much as in that they are Heavenly Ceremonies, which God hath sanctified and ordained to be administred in his Church: First, As marks whereby to know when God doth impart the vital or saving Grace of Christ unto all that are capable thereof; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as Means conditional, which God requireth in them, unto whom he impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Grace. For, sith God in himself is invisible, and cannot by us be discerned work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore when it seemeth good in the eyes of his Heavenly Wisdom, that men for some special intent and purpose, should take notice of his glorious Presence, he giveth them some plain and sensible token whereby to know what they cannot see.

Christ and his Spirit with all their blessed Effects, though entring into the Soul of Man, we are not able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or express how, do notwithstanding give notice of the times, when they use to make their access, because it pleaseth Almighty God to communicate by sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means those Blessings which are incomprehensible. Seeing therefore, that Grace is a consequent of Sacraments, a thing which accompanieth them as their end, a benefit which they have received from God himself, the Author of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and not from any other Natural or Supernatural Quality in them, it may be hereby both understood, That Sacraments are necessary, and that the manner of their necessity to Life Supernatural, is not in all respects as food unto Natural Life, because they contain in themselves no vital force of efficacy; they are not Physical, but Moral Instruments of Salvation, duties of Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; which unless we perform as the Author of Grace requireth, they are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. For, all receive not the Grace of God, which receive the Sacraments of his Grace. Neither is it ordinarily his Will to bestow the Grace of Sacraments on any, but by the Sacraments; which Grace also, they that receive by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or with Sacraments, receive it from him, and not from them.

                     <hi>He that turned towards it, was not healed by the thing he saw, but by thee, O Saviour of all,</hi> This is therefore the necessity of Sacraments. That saving Grace which Christ originally is, or hath for the general good of his whole Church, by Sacraments he severally deriveth into every member thereof, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments serve as the Instruments of God, to that end and purpose: Moral Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the use whereof is in our own hands, the effect in his; for the use, we have his express Commandment; for the effect, his Conditional Promise: So that without our obedience to the one, there is of the other no apparent assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; as contrariwise, where the Signs and Sacraments of his Grace, are not either through contempt unreceived, or received with contempt, we are not to doubt, but that they really give what they promise, and are what they signifie. For we take not Baptism, nor the Eucharist, for bare resemblances or memorials of things absent, neither for naked signs and testimonies assuring us of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived before, but (as they are indeed and in verity) for means effectual, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God, when we take the Sacraments, delivereth into our hands that Grace avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto Eternal Life, which Grace the Sacraments<note n="b" place="margin">Dum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini bonum inv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

There have grown in the Doctrine concerning Sacraments many difficulties for want of distinct Explication, what kinde or degree of Grace doth belong unto each Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For by this it hath come to pass, that the true immediate cause why Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and why the Supper of our Lord is necessary, few do rightly and distinctly consider. It cannot be denied, but sundry the same effects and benefits which grow unto men by the one Sacrament, may rightly be attributed unto the other. Yet then doth Baptism challenge to it self but the inchoation of those Graces, the consummation whereof dependeth on Mysteries ensuing. We receive Christ Jesus in Baptism once, as the first beginner; in the Eucharist often, as being by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual degrees, the finisher of our Life. By Baptism therefore, we receive Christ Jesus; and from him that saving Grace which is proper unto Baptism. By the other Sacrament we receive him also, imparting therein himself, and that Grace which the Eucharist properly bestoweth. So that each Sacrament having both that which is general or common, and that also which is peculiar unto it self, we may hereby gather, that the Participation of Christ, which properly belongeth to any one Sacrament, is not otherwise to be obtained, but by the Sacrament whereunto it is proper.</p>

Now even as the Soul doth Organize the Body, and give unto every Member thereof, that substance, quantity, and shape which Nature seeth most expedient; so, the inward Grace of Sacraments may teach what serveth best for their outward form; a thing in no part of Christian Religion, much less here, to be neglected. Grace intended by Sacraments, was a cause of the choice, and is a reason of the fitness of the Elements themselves. Furthermore, seeing that the Grace which here we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, doth no way depend upon the Natural force of that which we presently behold, it was of necessity, That words of express Declaration taken from the very mouth of our Lord himself, should be added unto visible Elements, that the one might infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly teach what the other do most assuredly bring to pass.

Which they think is plain, because elswhere it is not improbable, that <hi>the Holy Ghost and Fire,</hi> do but signifie the Holy Ghost in operation resembling Fire. Whereupon they conclude, That seeing Fire in one place may be, therefore Water in another place is, but a Metaphor: Spirit, the interpretation thereof; and so the words do onely mean, <hi>That unless a man be born again of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> I hold it for a most infallible rule in Expositions of Sacred Scripture, that were a literal construction will stand, the farthest from the Letter is commonly the worst. There is nothing more dangerous then this licentious and deluding Art, which changeth the meaning of words, as Alchymy doth or would the substance of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, maketh of any thing what it listeth, and bringeth in the end all Truth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Or howsoever such voluntary exercise of wit might be born with, otherwise; yet in places which usually serve, as this doth, concerning Regeneration by Water and the Holy Ghost, to be alledged for Grounds and Principles, less is permitted. To hide the general consent of Antiquity, agreeing in the literal interpretation, they cunningly affirm, That certain have taken those words as meant of Material Water, when they know, that of all the Ancients there is no one to be named, that ever did otherwise, either expound or alledge the place, then as implying External Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.

When the Letter of the Law hath two things plainly and expresly specified, Water and the Spirit; Water as a duty required on our parts, the Spirit as a Gift which God bestoweth: There is danger in presuming so to interpret it, at if the clause which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth our selves, were more then needeth.

For, although the Scripture should say, That none can be saved, but those which have the Spirit of God, and are Baptized with Material and Elemental Water; yet ought it to be understood of those which can conveniently and orderly be brought to Baptism; as the Scripture, saying, That who so doth not believe the Gospel, is condemned already, <hi>Iob.</hi> 3. 18. meaneth this sentence of those which can hear the Gospel, and have discretion to understand it when the hear it; and cannot here shut under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, either those that he born deaf and so remain, or little infants, or natural Fools that have no wit to couceive what is Preached.</note> That as we err by following a wrong construction of the place before alledged; so our second over-sight is, that we thereupon infer a necessity over-rigorous and extream.

For, saith he, if a Man desirous of Baptism, be suddenly cut off by Death, in whom there wanted neither sound Faith, devout Hope, not sincere Charity (God be merciful unto me, and pardon me if I err) but verily of such a ones Salvation, in whom there is no other defect besides his faultless lack of Baptism; despair I cannot, nor induce my minde to think his Faith void, his Hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,

If the Blood of Martyrs in that case be their Baptism, surely his religious desire of Baptism standeth him in the same stead.</hi> It hath been therefore constantly held as well touching other Believers, as Martyrs, That Baptism, taken away by necessity, is supplied by desire of Baptism, because with Equity this opinion doth best stand.<note place="margin">Quid ad role<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randam om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem pro Dei gloria injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am semel dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie animum in Martyrium mihi videter implesse.

Nevertheless, seeing Christs Institution containeth, besides that which maketh compleat the Essence or Nature, other things that onely are parts, as it were, of the Furniture of Sacraments; the difference between these two must unfold that which the general terms of indefinite speech would confound. If the place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Baptism, be a part of Christ Institution, it is but his Institution as Sacrifice, Baptism his Institution as Mercy: In this case, He which requireth both Mercy and Sacrifice, rejecteth his own Institution of Sacrifice, where the Offering of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice would hinde: Mercy from being shewed: External Circumstances even in the holiest and highest actions, are but the <hi>lesser things of the Law,</hi>

For if want of Calling do frustrate Baptism, they that Baptize without Calling do nothing, be they Women or Men.

Secondly, That by an evidence, rejecting the Heathens, and condemning them of Impiety, they would prove such affection towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as ordereth the Affairs of the Church by the pattern of their example: And Thirdly, That out of an evidence which nameth the Heathens, as being in some part a reason why the Church had no Women-Priests, they gather, the Heathens to have been one of the first occasions why it had. So that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out every branch of this testimony, their issue is, Yea; and their evidence directly No. But to Womens Baptism in private, by occasion of urgent necessity, the reasons that onely concern Ordinary Baptism in publick, are no just prejudice; neither can we by force thereof, disprove the practice of those Churches which (necessity requiring) allow Baptism in private to be Administred by Women. We may not from Laws that prohibite any thing with restraint, conclude abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and unlimited prohibitions: Although we deny not, but they which utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid such Baptism, may have perhaps wherewith to justifie their orders against it.

The Bishop was greatly moved thereat, yet durst not adventure to Rebaptize, but did the best he could to put him in good comfort, using much perswasion with him not to trouble himself with things that were past and gone, nor after so long continuance in the Fellowship of Gods people, to call now in question his first entrance. The poor man that law himself in this sort answered, but not satisfied, spent afterwards his life in continual perplexity, whereof the Bishop remained fearful to give release; perhaps too fearful, if the Baptism were such as his own Declaration importeth. For that, the substance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was rotten at the very first, is never by tract of time able to recover soundness. And where true Baptism was not before given, the case of Rebaptization is clear. But by this it appeareth, that Baptism is not void in regard of Heresie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much less through any other Moral defect in the Minister thereof.

Which men growing thereby odious to the rest, whose constancy was greater; it fortuned that after, when one <hi>Caecilian</hi> was ordained Bishop in the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whom others endeavored in vain to defeat by excepting against him as a Traditor, they whose accusations could not prevail, desperately joyned themselves in one, and made a Bishop of their own crue, accounting from that day forward, their Faction, the onely true and sincere Church. The first Bishop on that part, was <hi>Majorinus,</hi> whose Successor <hi>Donatus,</hi> being the first that wrote in defence of their Schism, the Birds that were hatched before by others, have their names from him. Arians and Donatists began both about one time. Which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies according to the different strength of their own sinews, wrought as hope of success led them; the one with the choicest wits, the other with the multitude, so far, that after long and troublesome experience, the perfectest view men could take or both, was hardly able to induce any certain determinate resolution, whether Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror may do more by the curious subtilty of sharp Discourse, or else by the meer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of zeal and devout affection; the latter of which two aids, gave Donatists, beyond all mens expectation, as great a sway as ever any Schism or Heresie had within that reach of the Christian World, where it bred and grew; the rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, because the Church which neither greatly feared them, and besides had neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary cause to bend it self against others that aimed directly at a far higher mark, the Deity of Christ, was contented to let Donatists have their course, by the space of Threescore years and above, even from Ten years before <hi>Constantine,</hi> till the time that <hi>Optatus,</hi>

First, the very occasion of their breach with the Church of God, a just hatred and dislike of Traditors, seemed plausible; they easily perswaded their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that such men could not be holy as held communion and fellowship with them that betrayed Religion. Again, when to dazle the eyes of the simple, and to prove, that it can be no Church which is not holy, they had in shew and sound of words the glorious pretence of the Creed Apostolick, <hi>I believe the holy Catholick Church:</hi> We need not think it any strange thing that with the multitude they gain credit. And avouching that such as are not of the true Church, can administer no true Baptism, they had for this point whole Volums of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> own writing, together with the judgment of divers <hi>Affrican</hi> Synods, whose sentence was the same with his. Whereupon, the Fathers were likewise in defence of their just cause very greatly prejudiced, both for that they could not inforce the duty of mens communion with a Church, confest to be in many things blame-worthy, unless they should often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seem to speak as half-defenders of the faults themselves, or at the least not so vehement accusers thereof, as their adversaries; And to withstand it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So true we finde it by experience of all Ages in the Church of God, that the teachers error is the peoples tryal, harder and heavier by so much to bear, as he is in worth and regard greater, that mis-perswadeth them.

Donatists were therefore, in process of time, though with much ado, wearied, and at the length worn out by the constancy of that Truth which reacheth, that evil Ministers of good things are as Torches, a Light to others, a Waste to none but themselves onely; and that the soulness of their hands, can neither any whit impair the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor stain the Glory of the Mysteries of Christ. Now that which was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss by vertuous and good men, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> carried aside with hatred against Heresie; and was secondly followed by Donatists, whom Envy and Rancor, covered with shew of Godliness, made obstinate to cancel whatsoever the Church did in the Sacrament of Baptism; hath of latter days, in another respect, far different from both the former, been brought freshly again into practice.

Of these three Errors, there is not any but hath been able, at the least, to alledge in defence of it self, many fair probabilities. Notwithstanding, sith the Church of God hath hitherto always constantly maintained, that to Rebaptize them which are known to have received true Baptism is unlawful; that if Baptism seriously be administred in the same Element, and with the same form of words which Christs Institution teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there is no other defect in the World that can make it frustrate, or deprive it of the Nature of a true Sacrament: And lastly, That Baptism is onely then to be re-adminstred, when the first delivery thereof is void, in regard of the fore-alledged imperfections, and no other: Shall we now in the case of Baptism, which having both for matter and form, the substance of Christs Institution, is by a fourth sort of men voided, for the onely defect of Ecclesiastical Authority in the Minister, think it enough, that they blow away the force thereof, with the bare strength of their very breath, by saying, <hi>We take such Baptism to be no more the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptism, then any other ordinary Bathing to be a Sacrament?</hi>

For whereas in case of necessity, the greatest amongst them professeth the change of the Element of Water lawful, and others which like not so well this opinion, could be better content, that voluntarily the words of Christs Institution were altered, and Men baptized in the Name of Christ, without either mention made of the Father, or of the Holy Ghost; nevertheless, in denying that Baptism administred by private persons ought to be reckoned of as a Sacrament, they both agree. It may therefore please them both to consider, That Baptism is an Action in part Moral, in part Ecclesiastical, and in part Mystical: Moral, as being a duty which men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form towards God; Ecclesiastical, in that it belongeth unto Gods Church as a publick duty: Finally, Mystical, if we respect what God doth thereby intend to work. The greatest Moral perfection of Baptism consisteth in mens devout obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God, which Law requireth both the outward act or thing done, and also that Religious affection which God doth so much regard, that without it, whatsoever we do, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66185:162"/>
our own Perfection; which Perfection consisteth chiefly in the vertuous disposition of the Minde, and approveth it self to him, not by doing, but by doing well. Wherein appeareth also, the difference between Humane and Divine Laws; the one of which two are content with <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> the other require <hi>Opus operantis</hi>; the one do but claim the Deed, the other, especially the Minde. So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Laws, which principally respect the heart of Men, Works of Religion being not religiously performed, cannot Morally be perfect. Baptism as an Ecclesiastical work, is for the manner of performance, ordered by divers Ecclesiastical Laws, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, That as the Sacrament it self, is a gift of no mean worth; so the Ministery thereof, might in all circumstances, appear to be a Function of no small regard. All that belongeth to the Mystical Perfection of Baptism outwardly, is the Element, the Word, and the serious Application of both, unto him which receiveth both; whereunto, if we add that secret reference which this action hath to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and remission of sins, by vertue of Christs own compact solemnly made with his Church, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish fully the Sacrament of Baptism, there is not any thing more required. Now put the Question, Whether Baptism, Administred to Infants, without my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Calling, be unto them both a true Sacrament, and an effectual instrument of Grace; or else an act of no more account, then the ordinary Washings are. The sum of all that can be said to defeat such Baptism, is, That those things which have no Being, can work nothing; and that Baptism, without the power of Ordination, is, as a Judgment without sufficient Jurisdiction, void, frustrate, and of no effect. But to this we answer, That the Fruit of Baptism dependeth onely upon the Covenant which God hath made: That God by Covenant requireth in the elder sort, Faith and Baptism; in Children, the Sacrament of Baptism alone, whereunto he hath also given them right by special priviledge of Birth, within the bosom of the holy Church: That infants therefore, which have received Baptism compleat, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mystical Perfection thereof, are by vertue of his own Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise cleansed from all sin; for as much as all other Laws, concerning that which in Baptism is either Moral or Ecclesiastical, do binde the Church which giveth Baptism, and not the Infant which receiveth it of the Church. So that if any thing be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in amiss, the harm which groweth by violation of holy Ordinances, must altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rest, where the Bonds of such Ordinances hold. For, that in actions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it fareth not as in Jurisdictions, may somewhat appear by the very opinion which men have of them. The nullity of that which a Judge doth by way of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without Authority, is known to all men, and agreed upon with full consent of the whole World, every man receiveth it as a general Edict of Nature; whereas the nullity of Baptism, in regard of the like defect, is onely a few mens new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, and as yet unapproved imagination. Which difference of generality in mens perswasions on the one side, and their paucity whose conceit leadeth them the other way, hath risen from a difference easie to observe in the things themselves. The exercise of unauthorised Jurisdiction is a grievance unto them that are under it, whereas they that without Authority presume to Baptize, offer nothing but that which to all men is good and acceptable. Sacraments are food, and the Ministers thereof, as Parents, or as Nurses; at whose hands when there is necessity, but no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of receiving it, if that which they are not present to do in right of their Office, be of pity and compassion done by others; shall this be thought turn Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Bread into Gravel, or the Medicine of Souls into Poyson? Jurisdiction is a yoke, which Law hath imposed on the necks of men in such sort, that they must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it for the good of others, how contrary soever it be to their own particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and inclinations: Jurisdiction bridleth men against their wills; that which a Judge doth, prevails by vertue of his very Power; and therefore, not without great reason, except the Law hath given him Authority, whatsoever he doth, vanisheth. Baptism on the other side, being a favor which it pleaseth God to bestow, a benefit of Soul to us that receive it, and a Grace, which they that deliver, are but as meer Vessels, either appointed by others, or offered of their own accord to this Service; of which two, if they be the one, it is but their own honor, their own offence to be the other: Can it possibly stand with<note n="*" place="margin">Factu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For then, what should we think of Baptism by Laymen, to whom Authority was never given?

Treasures of his Heavenly Grace, should, without his consent, be past by forged conveyances; nor lest he should deny at any time his own acts, and seek to revoke what hath been consented unto before: As there is no such fear of danger through deceit and falshood in this case, so neither hath the circumstance of mens persons that waight in Baptism; which for good and just considerations in the custody of Seals of office, it ought to have. The Grace of Baptism cometh by Donation from God alone: That God hath committed the Ministery of Baptism unto special men, it is for orders sake in his Church, and not to the end, that their Authority might give being, or add force to the Sacrament it self. That Infants have right to the Sacrament in Baptism, we all acknowledge. Charge them we cannot, as guilful and wrongful possessors of that, whereunto they have right by the manifest will of the Donor, and are not parties unto any defect or disorder in the manner of receiving the same. And if any such disorder be, we have sufficiently before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That <hi>delictum cum capite semper ambulat,</hi> mens own faults are their own harms. Wherefore, to countervail this and the like mischosen resemblances, with that which more truly and plainly agreeth; the Ordinance of God, concerning their Vocation that minister Baptism, wherein the Mystery of our Regeneration is wrought, hath thereunto the same Analogy, which Laws of Wedlock have to our first Nativity and Birth: So that if Nature do effect procreation, notwithstanding the wicked viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and breach even of Natures Law, made that the entrance of all mankinde into this present World might be without blemish; may we not justly presume, that Grace doth accomplish the other, although there be faultiness in them that transgress the Order which our Lord Jesus Christ hath established in his Church?

The Anabaptist hath many pretences to scorn at the baptism of Children: First, Because the Scriptures, he saith, do no where give Commandment to Baptize Infants: Secondly, For that, as there is no Commandment, so neither any manifest example, shewing it to have been done either by Christ, or his Apostles: Thirdly, In as much as the Word Preached, and the Sacraments, must go together; they which are not capable of the one, are no fit receivers of the other: Last of all, sith the Order of Baptism continued from the first beginning, hath in it those things which are unfit to be applied unto Sucking Children; it followeth in their conceit, That the Baptism of such is no Baptism, but plain mockery. They with whom we contend, are no enemies to the Baptism of Infants; it is not their desire, that the Church should hazard so many Souls, by letting them run on till they come to ripeness of understanding, that so they may be converted, and then baptized, as Infidels heretofore have been; they bear not towards God so unthankful mindes, as not to acknowledge it even amongst the greatest of his endless mercies, That by making us his own possession so soon, many advantages which Satan otherwise might take are prevented, and (which should be esteemed a part of no small happiness) the first thing whereof we have occasion to take notice, is, How much hath been done already to our great good, though altogether without our knowledge: The Baptism of Infants, they esteem as an Ordinance which Christ hath instituted, even in special love and favor to his own people: They deny not the practice thereof accordingly to have been kept, as derived from the hands, and continued from the days of the Apostles themselves unto this present; onely it pleaseth them not, That to Infants there should be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories proposed in Baptism. This they condemn as foolish, toyish, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane mockery: But are they able to shew, that ever the Church of Christ had any Publick Form of Baptism without Interrogatories; or, that the Church did ever use at the Solemn Baptism of Infants, to omit those Questions as needless in this case? <note n="*" place="margin">

If I should ask, What good or evil such an infant thinketh? Thine answer hereunto must needs be again with the like uncertainty. If them neither canst promise for the time to come, nor for the present pronounce any thing in this case; How is it, that when such are brought unto Baptism, their Parents there undertake what the Childe shall afterwards do? Yea, they are not doubtful to say, It doth that which is impossible to be done by Infants. At the least there is no man precisely able to affirm it done. Vonchsafe me hereunto some short answer, such as not onely may press me with the bare authority of Custom, but also instruct me in the cause thereof.</hi> Touching which difficulty, whether it may truly be said for Infants, at the time of their Baptism, That they do believe; the effect of St. Angustines answer is, Yea, but with this distinction,<note place="margin">

They that can take to themselves, in ordinary talk, a charitable kinde of liberty to name men of their own sort, Gods dear children (notwithstanding the large reign of of Hyprocrisie) should not methinks be so strict and rigorous against the Church for presuming as it doth, of a Christian Innocent. For when we know how Christ is general hath said, That of such is the Kingdom of Heaven, which Kingdom is the Inheritance of Gods Elect; and do withal behold, how his providence hath called them unto the first beginnings of Eternal Life, and presented them at the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of New-birth, wherein original sin is purged; besides which sin, there is no Hinderance of their Salvation known to us, as themselves will grant; hard it were, that loving so many fair inducements whereupon to ground, we should not be thought to utter, at the least, a truth as probable and allowable in terming any such particular Infant an elect Babe, as in presuming<note n="c" place="margin">2 John 1.</note> the like of others, whose safety nevertheless we are not absolutely able to warrant. If any troubled with these seru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, be onely for Instructions sake, desirous to know yet some farther reason, why Interrogatories should be ministred to Infants in Baptism, and be answered unto by others, as in their names; they may consider, that Baptism implieth a Covenant or League between God and Man, wherein as God doth bestow presently remission of sins and the Holy Ghost, hinding also himself to add in process of time, what Grace soever shall be farther necessary for the attainment of Everlasting Life; so every Baptized Soul receiving the same Grace at the hands of God, tieth likewise it self for ever to the observation of his Law, no less then the Jews<note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision bound themselves to the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> The Law of Christ requiring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith and newness of life in all men, by vertue of the Covenant which they make in Baptism, Is it toyish, that the Church in Baptism exacteth at every mans hands an express Profession of Faith, and an inevocable promise of obedience by way of<note n="e" place="margin">Stipu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit therefore, neither deaf, nor dumb men, neither surious persons, nor children, can receive any civil stipulation; yet this kinde of ghostly stipulation they may through his indulgence, who respecting the singular benefit thereof; accepteth Children brought unto him for that end, entrech into Articles of Covenant with them, and in tender commiseration, granteth that other Mens Professions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in Baptism made for them, shall avail no less, then if they had been them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, able to have made their own.

Thus whereas God hath appointed them Ministers of holy things, they make themselves Inquisitors of mens persons, a great deal farther then need is.

It is not the vertue of our Fathers, nor the Faith of any other that can give us the true holiness which we have by vertue of our New Birth.

In the phrase of some kinde of men, they use to be termed Witnesses, as if they came but to see and testifie what is done. It savoreth more of Piety to give them their old accustomed name of Fathers and Mothers in God, whereby they are well put in minde what affection they ought to bear towards those Innocents, for whose

This therefore is their own duty: But because the answer which they make to the usual demands of stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proposed in Baptism, is not their own; the Church doth best to receive it of them, in that form which best sheweth whose the act is.

By which good reason the Authors of those grave admonitions to the Parliament are well-holpen up, which held, <hi>That sitting at Communions, betokeneth rest and full accomplishment of Legal Ceremonies in our Saviour Christ.</hi> For although it be the Word of God, That such Ceremonies are expired; yet seeing it is not the Word of God, that men to signifie so much should sit at the Table of our Lord; these have their doom as well as others, <hi>Guilty of a new devised Gospel in the Church of Christ.</hi> Which strange imagination is begotten of a special dislike they have to hear, that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies now in use, should be thought significant; whereas, in truth, such as are not significant must needs be vain. Ceremonies destitute of signification, are no better then the idle gestures of men, whose broken wits are not Masters of what they do. For if we look but into Secular and Civil Complements, what other cause can there possibly be given why to omit them, where of course they are looked for; for where they are not so due, to use them, bringeth mens secret intents often-times into great jealousie: I would know, I say, What reason we are able to yield, why things so light in their own nature should weigh in the opinions of men so much, saving onely in regard of that which they use to signifie or betoken? Doth not our Lord Jesus Christ<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 7. 44</note> himself impute the omission of some courteous Ceremonies, even in domestical entertainment, to a colder degree of loving affection, and take the contrary in better part, not so much respecting what was less done, as what was signified less by the one, then by the other? For, to that very end, he referreth in part those gracious Expostulations, <hi>Simon, seest thou this Woman? since I entred unto thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my seet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head: Thou gavest me no kiss, but this Woman since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet: Mine head with oyl, thou didst not anoint, but this Woman hath anointed my feet with oynment.</hi> Wherefore as the usual dumb Ceremonies of common life are in request or dislike, according to that they import; even so Religion, having likewise her silent Rites, the chiefest rule whereby to judge of their quality, is that which they mean or betoken. For if they signifie good things (as somewhat they must of necessity signifie, because it is of their very nature to be signs of intimation, presenting both themselves unto outward sense, and besides themselves some other thing, to the understanding of beholders) unless they be either greatly mischosen to signifie the same, or else applied where that which they signifie, agreeth not, there is no cause of exception against them, as against evil and unlawful Ceremonies, much less of excepting against them onely, in that they are not without sense. And if every Religious Ceremony which hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of men, to signifie any thing that God himself alloweth, were the publication

of another Gospel in the Church of Christ; seeing that no Christian Church in the World, is, or can be, without continual use of some Ceremonies which men have instituted, and that to signifie good things (unless they be vain and frivolous Ceremonies;) it would follow, That the World hath no Christian Church which doth not daily proclaim new Gospels; a sequel, the manifest absurdity whereof argueth the rawness of that Supposal, cut of which it groweth.

Howbeit, unless we be strangers to the age wherein we live, or else in some partial respect, dissemblers of that we hourly both hear and see; there is not the simplest of us, but knoweth with what disdain and scorn Christ is dishonored far and wide. Is there any burden in the World, more heavy to bear then contempt? Is there any contempt that grieveth as theirs doth, whose quality no way making them less worthy then others are, of reputation; onely the service which they do to Christ in the daily exercise of Religion, treadeth them down? Doth any contumely, which we sustain for Religion sake, pierce so deeply as that which would seem of meer Conscience religiously spightful? When they that honor God, are despised; when the chiefest service of Honor that man can do unto him, is the cause why they are despised; when they which pretend to honor him, and that with greatest sincerity, do with more then Heathenish petulancy trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot almost whatsoever, either we, or the whole Church of God, by the space of so many ages, have been accustomed unto, for the comlier and better exercise of our Religion, according to the soundest Rules that Wisdom directed by the Word of God, and by long experience confirmed, hath been able with common advice, with much deliberation and exceeding great diligence, to comprehend; when no man fighting under Christs Banner, can be always exempted from seeing,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66185:168"/>
or sustaining those indignities; the sting whereof not to feel, or feeling, not to be moved thereat, is a thing impossible to flesh and blood: If this be any object for Patience to work on, the strictest bond that thereunto tieth us, is our vowed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Christ; the solemnest vow that we ever made to obey Christ, and to suffer willingly all reproaches for his sake, was made in Baptism: And amongst other memorials to keep us mindful of that vow, we cannot think, that the Sign which our new Baptized Fore-heads cïd there receive, is either unfit or unforcible; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hitherto alledged, being weighed with indifferent ballance. It is not (you will say) the Cross in our Fore-heads, but in our Hearts the Faith of Christ, that ameth us with Patience, Constancy, and Courage. Which as we grant to be most true, so neither dare we despise, no not the meanest helps that serve, though it be but in the very lowest degree of furtherance, towards the highest services that God doth require at our hands. And if any man deny, that such Ceremonies are available, at the least, as memorials of duty; or do think that himself hath no need to be so put in minde, what our duties are; it is but reasonable, that in the one, the publick experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the World over-weigh some few mens perswasion; and in the other, the rare perfection of a few condescend unto common imbecillity. Seeing therefore, that in fear shame, which doth worthily follow sin, and to bear undeserved reproach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, is the general duty of all men professing Christianity; seeing also, that our weakness, while we are in this present World, doth need towards Spiritual duties, the help even of corporal furtherance; and that by reason of natural intercourse between the highest and the lowest powers of mans minde in all actions, his fancy or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, carrying in it that special note of Remembrance, then which, there is nothing more forcible, where either too weak, or too strong a conceit of infamy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace might do great harm, standeth always ready to put forth a kinde of necessary helping hand; we are in that respect to acknowledge the<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>The Ceremony which was but a thing indifferent even of old, we judge not at this day, a matter necessary for all Christian men to observe.</hi> As for their last upshot of all towards this Mark, they are of opinion, that if the ancient Christians, to deliver the Cross of Christ from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, did well, and with good consideration, use often the Sign of the Cross, in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Faith and Profession, before Infidels which upbraided them with Christs sufferings; now that we live with such as contrariwise adore the Sign of the Cross (because contrary diseases should always have contrary remedies) we ought to take away all use thereof. In which conceipt, they both ways greatly seduce themselves; first, for that they imagine the Fathers to have had no use of the Cross, but with reference unto Infidels, which mis-perswasion we have before discovered at large; and secondly, by reason that they think there is not any other way besides Universal Extirpation to reform superstitious abuses of the Cross. Wherein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are that stand very much upon the example of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> as if his <hi>breaking to pieces that Serpent</hi> of Brass, whereunto the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had <hi>burnt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66185:169"/>
Incense,</hi> did enforce the utter abolition of this Ceremony; the fact of that vertuous Prince, is by so much the more attentively to be considered. Our lives in this World, are partly guided by Rules, and partly directed by Examples. To conclude, out of general Rules and Axioms, by discourse of Wit, our duties in every particular action, is both troublesome, and many times so full of difficulty, that it maketh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations hard and tedious to the wisest men. Whereupon we naturally all incline to observe examples, to mark what others have done before us, and in favor of our own ease, rather to follow them, then to enter into new consultation; if in regard of their Vertue and Wisdom, we may but probably think they have waded without Error. So that the willingness of men to be led by example of others, both discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and helpeth the imbecillity of our judgment. Because it doth the one, therefore insolent and proud Wits would always seem to be their own Guides; and, because it doth the other, we see how hardly the vulgar sort is drawn unto any thing, for which there are not as well Examples as Reasons alledged. Reasons proving that which is more particular by things more general and farther from Sense, are with the simpler sort of men less trusted, for that they doubt of their own judgment in those things; but of Examples which prove unto them, one doubtful particular by another, more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly and sensibly known, they easily perceive in themselves some better ability to judge. The force of Examples therefore is great, when in matter of action, being doubtful what to do, we are informed what others have commendably done, whose deliberations were like. But whosoever doth perswade by example, must as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the fitness, as the goodness of that he alledgeth. To <hi>Ezechias,</hi> God himself in this fact, giveth testimony of well-doing. So that nothing is here questionable, but onely whether the example alledged, be pertinent, pregnant, and strong. The Serpent spoken of, was first erected for the extraordinary and miraculous cure of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Desart. This use having presently an end, when the cause, for which God ordained it, was once removed; the thing it self they notwithstanding kept for a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Mercy, as in like consideration they did the Pot of Manna, the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Sword which <hi>David</hi> took from <hi>Goliah.</hi> In process of time, they made of a Monument of Divine Power a plain Idol, they burnt Incense before it contrary to the Law of God, and did it the services of honor due unto God onely.

But unto this he addeth, That no such error can grow, by adoring in that sort a dead Image, which every man knoweth to be void of excellency in it self, and therefore will easily conceive, that the honor done unto it, hath an higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Howbeit, seeing that we have by over-true experience, been taught how often, especially in these cases, the light even of common understanding faileth; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their usual adoration of the Cross is not hereby freed. For in actions of this kinde, we are more to respect, what the greatest part of men is commonly prone to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, then what some few mens wits may devise in construction of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meanings. Plain it is, that a false opinion of some personal divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to be in those things, which either Nature or Art hath framed, causeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways religious adoration. And as plain, that the like adoration applied unto things sensible, argueth to vulgar capacities, yea, leaveth imprinted in them the very same opinion of Deity, from whence all idolatrous worship groweth. Yea, the meaner and baser a thing worshipped, is in it self, the more they incline to think, that every man which doth adore it, knoweth there is in it, or with it, a presence of divine power. Be it therefore true, That Crosses purposely framed or used for receipt of divine honor, be even as scandalous as the Brazen Serpent it self, where they are in such sort adored; Should we hereupon think our selves in the sight of God, and in Conscience charged to abolish utterly the very Ceremony of the Cross, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meant at the first, nor now converted unto any such offensive purpose?

If we think the example of <hi>Ezechias</hi> a proof, that things which Error and Superstition hath abused, may in no consideration be tolerated, although we presently finde them not subject to so vile abuse, the plain example of <hi>Ezechias</hi> proveth the contrary.<note place="margin">1 King. 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">2 King. 18 3,6. &amp; 12. 2.</note> and did no way displease God. Perhaps it seemeth, that by force and vertue of this example, although it bare detestation and hatred of Idolatry, all things which have been at any time worshipped, are not necessarily to be taken out of the World; nevertheless, for remedy and prevention of so great offences, Wisdom should judge it the safest course to remove altogether from the eyes of men, that which may put them in minde of evil. Some kindes of evil, no doubt, there are very quick in working on those affections that most easily take fire, which evils should in that respect, no oftner then need requireth, be brought in presence of weak mindes. But neither is the Cross any such evil, nor yet the Brazen Serpent it self so strongly poysoned, that our eyes, ears, and thoughts, ought to shun them both, for fear of some deadly harm to ensue, the onely representation thereof, by gesture, shape, sound, or such like significant means. And for mine own part, I most assuredly perswade my self, that had <hi>Ezechias</hi> (till the days of whose most vertuous Reign, they ceased not continually to burn Incense to the Brazen Serpent) had he found the Serpent, though sometime adored, yet at that time recovered from the evil of so gross abuse, and reduced to the same that was before in the time of <hi>David,</hi> at which time they esteemed it onely as a Memorial, Sign, or Monument of Gods miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous goodness towards them, even as we in no other sort esteem the Ceremony of the Cross; the due consideration of an use so harmless, common to both, might no less have wrought their equal preservation, then different occasions have procured, notwithstanding the ones extinguishment, the others lawful continuance. In all perswasions, which ground themselves upon example, we are not so much to respect what is done, as the causes and secret inducements leading thereunto. The questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being therefore, whether this Ceremony supposed to have been sometimes scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and offensive, ought for that cause to be now removed; there is no reason we should forthwith yield our selves to be carried away with example, no not of them, whose acts, the highest judgment approveth for having reformed in that manner, any publick evil: But before we either attempt any thing, or resolve, the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as well of our own affairs as theirs, whose example presseth us, is advisedly to be examined; because some things are of their own nature scandalous, and cannot chuse but breed offence,<note place="margin">2 King. 23. 7.</note> as those Sinks of execrable filth which <hi>Iosias</hi> did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm; some things, albeit not by Nature, and of themselves, are notwithstanding so generally turned to evil, by reason of an evil corrupt habit grown, and through long continuance incurably setled in the mindes of the greatest part, that no red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess can be well hoped for, without removal of that wherein they have ruined themselves, which plainly was the state of the Jewish people, and the cause why <hi>Ezechias</hi> did with such sudden indignation destroy what he saw worshipped; finally, some things are as the Sign of the Cross, though subject either almost or altogether to as great abuse, yet curable with more facility and ease. And to speak as the truth is, our very nature doth hardly yield to destroy that which may be fruitfully kept, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difficulty, clean scouted from the rust of evil, which by some accident hath grown into it. Wherefore to that which they build in this question upon the example of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> let this suffice. When Heathens despised Christian Religion, because of the sufferings of Jesus Christ, the Fathers, to testifie how little such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies and contempts prevailed with them, chose rather the Sign of the Cross, then any other outward mark, whereby the World might most easily discern always what they were. On the contrary side now, whereas they which do all profess the Christian Religion, are divided amongst themselves; and the fault of the one part is, That the zeal to the sufferings of Christ, they admire too much, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66185:170"/>
over-superstitiously adore the Visible Sign of his Cross; if you ask, what w that mislike them should do, we are here advised to cure one contrary by another. Which Art or Method, is not yet so current as they imagine. For if, as their practice for the most part sheweth, it be their meaning, that the scope and drift of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when things are faulty, should be to settle the Church in the contrary; it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them upon, to beware of this rule, because seeing Vices have not onely Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but other Vices also in Nature opposite unto them, it may be dangerous in these cases to seek, but that which we finde contrary to present evils. For in sores and sicknesses of the minde, we are not simply to measure good by distance from evil, because one Vice may in some respect be more opposite to another, then either of them to that Vertue which holdeth the mean between them both. Liberality and Covetousness, the one a Vertue, and the other a Vice, are not so contrary as the Vices of Covetousness and Prodigality: Religion and Superstition have more affiance, though the one be Light, and the other Darkness; then Superstition and Prophaneness, which both are vicious extremities. By means whereof it cometh also to pass, that the Mean, which is Vertue, seemeth in the eyes of each extream an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; the liberal hearted man is by the opinion of the Prodigal miserable, and by the judgment of the miserable lavish: Impiety for the most part upbraideth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as Superstitious, which Superstition often accuseth as impious; both so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thereof, because it doth seem more to participate each extream, then one extream doth another, and is by consequent less contrary to either of them, then they mutually between themselves. Now, if he that seeketh to reform Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness or Superstition, should but labor to induce the contrary, it were but to draw men out of Lime into Cole-dust: So that their course, which will remedy the Superstitious abuse of things profitable in the Church, is not still to abolish utterly the use thereof, because not using at all, is most opposite to ill using; but rather, if it may be, to bring them back to a right perfect and religious usage, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit less contrary to the present sore, is notwithstanding the better, and by many degrees the sounder way of recovery: And unto this effect, that very Precedent it self, which they propose, may be best followed. For as the Fathers, when the Cross of Christ was in utter contempt, did not superstitiously adore the same, but rather declare, that they so esteemed it as was meet? In like manner where we finde the Cross, to have that honor which is due to Christ, is it not as lawful for us to retain it, in that estimation which it ought to have, and in that use which it had of old with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, as by taking it clean away, so seem Followers of their example; which cure wilfully by abscission that which they might both preserve and heal? Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the Sign and Ceremony of the Cross, we no way finde our selves bound to relinquish it; neither because the first Inventors thereof were but mortal men; nor lest the sense and signification we give unto it, should burthen us as Authors of a new Gospel in the House of God; not in respect of some cause which the Fathers had more then we have to use the same; nor finally, for any such offence or scandal, as heretofore it hath been subject unto by Error, now reformed in the mindes of Men.</p>

Which also is done amongst our selves, when they which be already Baptized, are brought to the Prelates of the Church, to obtain by their Prayer and Imposition of Hands the Holy Ghost.</hi> By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that when the Ministers of Baptism were persons of inferior degree, the Bishops did after Confirm whom such had before Baptized. Sometimes they which by force of their Ecclesiastical Calling, might do as well the one as the other, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Men whom Heresie had dis-joyned from the Fellowship of true Believers. Whereupon, when any Man, by them Baptized and Confirmed, came afterwards to see and renounce their Error, there grew in some Churches very hot contention about the manner of admitting such into the Bosome of the true Church, as hath been declared already in the question of Rebaptization. But the generally received Custom was onely to admit them with Imposition of Hands and Prayer. Of which Custom, while some imagined the reason to be, for that Hereticks might give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins by Baptism, but not the Spirit by Imposition of Hands, because themselves had not Gods Spirit, and that therefore their Baptism might stand, but Confirmation must be given again. The imbecillity of this ground, gave <hi>Cyprian</hi> occasion to oppose himself against the practice of the Church herein, laboring many ways to prove, That Hereticks could do neither; and consequently, that their Baptism in all respects, was as frustrate as their Chrism; for the manner of those times was in Confirming to use Anointing. On the other side, against Luciferians which ratified onely the Baptism of Hereticks, but disannulled their Confirmations and Consecrations, under pretence of the reason which hath been before specified, <hi>Hereticks cannot give the Holy Ghost.</hi> St. <hi>Ierome</hi> proveth at large, That if Baptism by Hereticks be granted available to Remission of Sins, which no man receiveth without the Spirit, it must needs follow, that the reason taken from disability of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing the Holy Ghost, was no reason wherefore the Church should admit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts with any new Imposition of Hands. Notwithstanding, because it might be objected, That if the gift of the Holy Ghost do always joyn it self with true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the Church, which thinketh the Bishops Confirmation after others Mens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism needful for the obtaining of the Holy Ghost, should hold an error: Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> hereunto maketh answer, That the cause of this observation is not any abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66185:172"/>
impossibility of receiving the Holy Ghost by the Sacrament of Baptism, unless a Bishop add after it the Imposition of Hands, but rather a certain congruity and fitness to honor Prelacy with such pre-eminences, because the safety of the Church dependeth upon the dignity of her chief Superiors, to whom, if some eminent Offices of Power above others should not be given, there would be in the Church as many Schisms as Priests. By which answer, it appeareth his opinion was, That the Holy Ghost is received in Baptism; that Confirmation is onely a Sacramental Complement; that the reason why Bishops alone did ordinarily confirm, was not because the benefit, grace, and dignity thereof, is greater then of Baptism; but rather, for that, by the Sacrament of Baptism, Men being admitted into Gods Church, it was both reasonable and convenient, that if he Baptize them not unto whom the chiefest authority and charge of their Souls belongeth; yet for honors sake, and in token of his Spiritual Superiority over them,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 3.</note> because to bless, is an act of Authority, the performance of this annexed Ceremony should be sought for at his hands. Now what effect their Imposition of Hands hath, either after Baptism ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by Hereticks or otherwise, St. <hi>Ierome</hi> in that place hath made no mention, because all men understood that in Converts it tendeth to the fruits of Repentance, and craveth in behalf of the Penitent,<note place="margin">Psal. 31. 10, 11, 12.</note> such grace as <hi>David,</hi> after his fall, desired at the hands of God; in others, the fruit and benefit thereof is, that which hath been before shewed. Finally, Sometime the cause of severing Confirmation from Baptism, was in the parties that received Baptism being Infants, at which age they might be very well admitted to live in the Family; but because to fight in the Army of God, to discharge the duties of a Christian man, to bring forth the fruits, and to do the Works of the Holy Ghost, their time of ability was not yet come,(so that Baptism were not deferred) there could, by stay of their Confirmation, no harm ensue, but rather good. For by this means it came to pass, that Children in expectation thereof, were seasoned with the principles of true Religion, before malice and corrupt examples depraved their mindes, a good foundation was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for direction of the course of their whole lives, the Seed of the Church of God was preserved sincere and sound, the Prelates and Fathers of Gods Family, to whom the cure of their Souls belonged, saw by tryal and examination of them, a part of their own heavy burthen discharged, reaped comfort by beholding the first beginnings of true godliness in tender years, glorified him whose praise they found in the mouths of Infants, and neglected not so fit opportunity of giving every one Fatherly encouragement and exhortation. Whereunto Imposition of Hands, and Prayer being added, our Warrant for the great good effect thereof, is the same which Patriarks, Prophets, Priests, Apostles, Fathers, and Men of God, have had for such their particular Invocations and Benedictions, as no Man, I suppose, professing truth of Religion, will easily think to have been without Fruit. No, there is no cause we should doubt of the benefit; but surely great cause to make complaint of the deep neglect of this Christian duty, almost with all them, to whom by tight of their place and calling, the same belongeth. Let them not take it in evil part, the thing is true, their small regard hereunto hath done harm in the Church of God. That which<note n="*" place="margin">T C. lib. 1. pag. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to be utterly abolished? And thirdly, this Confirmation hath many dangerous points in it. The first step of Popery in this Confirmation, is the Laying on of Hands upon the Head of the Childe, whereby the opinion of it that it is a Sacrament, is confirmed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when as the Prayer doth say, That it is done according to the example of the Apostles, which is a manifest unw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and taken indeed from the Popish Confirmation. The second is, for that the Bishop, as he is called, must be the onely minister of it, whereby the Popish opinion, which esteemeth it above Baptism, is confirmed. For whilest Baptism may be ministred of the Minister, and not Confirmation, but onely of the Bishop; there is great cause of suspition given to think that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is not so precious a thing as Confirmation, seeing this was one of the principal reasons whereby that wicked opinion was established in Popery. I do not here speak of the inconvenience, that men are constrained with charges to bring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren oftentimes half a score miles for that, which, if it were needful, might be as well done at home in their own Parishes. The third is, for that the Book saith, a cause of using Confirmation is, Therby imposition of Hands and Prayer, the Children may receive strength and defence against all temptations, whereas there is no promise, that by the Laying on of Hands upon Children any such gift shall be given; and it maintaineth the Popish distinction, That the Spirit of God is given at Baptism, unto Remission of Sins; and in Confirmation, unto Strength.</note> Error rashly uttereth in disgrace of good things, may peradventure be sponged out, when the print of those evils, which are grown through neglect,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66185:172"/>
will remain behinde. Thus much therefore generally spoken, may serve for answer unto their demands, that require us to tell them, <hi>Why there should be any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the Church,</hi> seeing we are not ignorant how earnestly they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested against it; and how directly (although untruly, for so they are content to acknowledge) it hath by some of them been said, <hi>To be first brought in by the seigned Decretal Epistles of the Popes</hi>; or, why it should not be <hi>utterly abolished, seeing that no one title thereof, can be once found in the whole Scripture,</hi> except the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> be Scripture:<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 3.</note> And again, seeing that how free soever it be now from abuse, if we look back to the times past, which wise men do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more respect then the present, it hath been abused, and is found at the length no such profitable Ceremony, as the whole silly Church of Christ, for the space of these Sixteen hundred years, hath through want of experience imagined: Last of all, Seeing also, besides the cruelty which is shewed towards poor Country people, who are fain sometimes to let their Ploughs stand still, and with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wearisome toyl of their feeble bodies, to wander over Mountains and through Woods; it may be, now and then little less then a whole half score of miles for a Bishops blessing, <hi>which if it were needful, might as well be done at home in their own Parishes, rather then they is purchase it with so great loss and so intolerable pain.</hi> There are, they say, in Confirmation, besides this, Three terrible points. The first is, <hi>Laying on of hands, with pretence, that the same is done to the example of the Apostles,</hi> which is not onely, as they suppose, <hi>a manifest untruth</hi>; (for all the World doth know, that the Apostles did never after Baptism lay hands on any, and therefore Saint <hi>Luke</hi> which saith they did, was much deceived:) But farther also, we thereby teach men to think <hi>Imposition of Hands a Sacrament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8.13, 17.</note> belike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a principle ingrafted by common Light of Nature in the Mindes of Men, that all things done by Apostolick example, must needs be Sacrament. The second high point of danger is, <hi>That by tying Confirmation to the Bishop alone, there is great cause of suspition given, to think that Baptism is not so precious a thing as Confirmation:</hi> For will any man think, that a Velvet Coat is of more price, then a Linnen Coyf, knowing the one to be an ordinary Garment, the other an Ornament which onely Sergeants at Law do wear? Finally, To draw to an end of perils, the last and the weightiest hazard is, where the Book it self doth say, That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Imposition of Hands and Prayer, may receive strength against all temptation: Which speech, as a two-edged sword, doth both ways dangerously wound; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it ascribeth Grace to Imposition of Hands, whereby we are able no more to assure our selves in the warrant of any promise from God, that his Heavenly Grace shall be given, then the Apostle was, that himself should obtain Grace by the bowing of his knees to God; and partly, because by using the very word <hi>strength</hi> in this matter,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 24.</note> a word so apt to spred infection, we <hi>maintain</hi> with Popish Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, an old forlorn <hi>distinction</hi> of the Holy Ghost, bestowed upon Christs Apostles before his Ascension into Heaven,<note place="margin">John 20. 22.</note> and augmented upon them afterwards; a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Grace infused into Christian men by degrees;<note place="margin">Acts 1. 8.</note> planted in them at the first by Baptism, after cherished, watred, and (be it spoken without offence) strengthned as by other vertuous Offices, which Piety and true Religion teacheth, even so by this very special Benediction whereof we speak, the Rite or Ceremony of Confirmation.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. The Grace which we have by the holy Eucharist,<note place="margin">Of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body and Blood of Christ.</note> doth not begin, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue life. No man therefore receiveth this Sacrament before Baptism, because no dead thing is capable of nourishment. That which groweth, must of necessity first live. If our Bodies did not daily waste, Food to restore them, were a thing super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. And it may be, that the Grace of Baptism would serve to Eternal Life, were it not that the state of our Spiritual Being, is daily so much hindered and impaired after Baptism. In that life therefore, where neither Body nor Soul can decay, our Souls shall as little require this Sacrament, as our Bodies corporal nourishment. But as long as the days of our warfare last, during the time that we are both subject to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution and capable of augmentation in Grace, the Words of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ will remain forceable,<note place="margin">John 6. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <hi>Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> Life being therefore proposed unto all men
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66185:173"/>
as their end, they which by Baptism have laid the Foundation and attained the first beginning of a new life, have here their nourishment and food prescribed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of life in them. Such as will live the Life of God, must eat the Flesh and drink the Blood of the Son of Man; because this is a part of that diet, which if we want, we cannot live. Whereas therefore in our Infancy we are incorporated into Christ, and by Baptism receive the Grace of his Spirit, without any sense or feeling of the gift which God bestoweth; in the Eucharist, we so receive the gift of God, that we know by Grace, what the Grace is which God giveth us; the degrees of our own Increase, in holiness and vertue, we see and can judge of them; we understand that the strength of our life begun in Christ, is Christ; that his Flesh is Meat, and his Blood drink, not by surmised imagination, but truly, even so truly, that through Faith, we perceive in the Body and Blood sacramentally presented, the very taste of Eternal Life; the Grace of the Sacrament, is here as the food which we eat and drink. This was it that some did exceedingly fear, lest <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Occolampadius</hi> would bring to pass, that men should account of this Sacrament, but onely as of a shadow, destitute, empty, and void of Christ. But seeing, that by opening the several opinions which have been held, they are grown, for ought I can see, on all sides at the length to a general agreement, concerning that which alone is material, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Real Participation of Christ, and of Life in his Body and Blood, by means of this Sacrament; Wherefore should the World continue still distracted, and rent with so manifold Contentions, when there remaineth now no Controversie, saving onely about the subject where Christ is? Yea, even in this point no side denieth, but that the Soul of Man is the receptacle of Christs presence. Whereby the question is yet driven to a narrower issue, nor doth any thing rest doubtful but this, Whether when the Sacrament is administred, Christ be whole within Man onely, or else his Body and Blood be also externally seated in the very Consecrated Elements themselves. Which opinion they that defend, are driven either to Consubstantiate and Incorporate Christ with Elements Sacramental, or to Transubstantiate and change their substance into his; and so the one to hold him really, but invisibly, moulded up with substance of those Elements; the other to hide him under the onely visible shew of Bread and Wine, the substance whereof, as they imagine, is abolished, and his succeeded in the same room. All things considered, and compared with that success, which Truth hath hitherto had by so bitter Conflicts with Errors in this point, Shall I wish that men would more give themselves to meditate with silence, what we have by the Sacrament, and less to dispute of the manner how? If any man suppose that this were too great stupidity and dulness, let us see whether the Apostles of our Lord themselves have not done the like. It appeareth by many examples, that they of their own disposition were very scrupulous and inquisitive, yea, in other cases of less importance, and less difficulty, always apt to move questions. How cometh it to pass, that so few words of so high a Mystery being uttered, they receive with gladness the gift of Christ, and make no shew of doubt or scruple? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof, is not dark to them which have any thing at all observed how the powers of the minde are wont to stir, when that which we infinitely long for, presenteth it self above and besides expectation. Curious and intricate speculations do hinder, they abate, they quench such inflamed motions of delight and joy, as Divine Graces use to raise when extraordinarily they are present. The minde therefore feeling present joy, is always marvellous unwilling to admit any other cogitation, and in that case, casteth off those disputes whereunto the intellectual part at other times easily draweth. A manifest effect whereof may be noted, if we compare with our Lords Disciples in the Twentieth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the people that are said in the Sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> to have gone after him to <hi>Capernaum.</hi> These leaving him on the one side the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and finding him again as soon as themselves by ship were arrived on the contrary side, whither they knew that by ship he came not, and by Land the journey was longer then according to the time he could have to travel, as they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; so they asked also,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John 6.25.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</hi> The Disciples, when Christ appeared to them in far more strange and miraculous manner, moved no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rejoyced greatly in that they saw. For why? The one sort beheld onely, that in Christ, which they knew was more then natural, but yet their affection was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66185:173"/>
not rapt therewith through any great extraordinary gladness; the other, when they looked on Christ, were not ignorant that they saw the Well-spring of their own Everlasting felicity; the one, because they enjoyed not, disputed; the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted not, because they enjoyed. If then the presence of Christ with them, did so much move, Judge what their thoughts and affections were at the time of this new presentation of Christ; not before their Eyes, but within their Souls. They had learned before, That his Flesh and Blood are the true cause of Eternal Life, that this they are not by the bate force of their own substance, but through the dignity and worth of His Person, which offered them up by way of Sacrifice, for the Life of the whole World, and doth make them still effectual thereunto: Finally, that to us they are Life in particular, by being particularly received. Thus much they knew, although as yet they understood not perfectly, to what effect or issue the same would come, till at the length, being assembled for no other cause which they could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but to have eaten the Passover onely that <hi>Moses</hi> appointed; when they saw their Lord and Master, with hands and eyes lifted up to Heaven, first bless and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, for the endless good of all Generations till the Worlds end, the chosen Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine, which Elements, made for ever the Instruments of Life by vertue of his Divine Benediction, they being the first that were commanded to receive from him, the first which were warranted by his promise, that not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at the present time, but to whomsoever, they and their Successors after them, did duly administer the same, those Mysteries should serve as Conducts of Life, and Conveyances of his Body and Blood unto them: Was it possible they should hear that voice, <hi>Take, eat, This is my Body; Drink ye all of this, This is my Blood?</hi> Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that doing what was required, and believing what was promised, the same should have present effect in them, and not fill them with a kinde of fearful admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Heaven which they saw in themselves? They had at that time a Sea of Comfort and Joy to wade in, and we, by that which they did, are taught, that this Heavenly Food is given for the satisfying of our empty Souls, and not for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of our curious and subtile wits. If we doubt what those admirable words may import, let him be our Teacher for the meaning of Christ, to whom Christ was himself a School-master, let our Lords Apostle be his Interpreter, content we our selves with his Explication; My Body, <hi>The Communion of my Body:</hi> My Blood, <hi>The Communion of my Blood.</hi> Is there any thing more expedite, clear, and easie, then that as Christ is termed our Life, because through him we obtain life; so the parts of this Sacrament are his Body and Blood, for that they are so to us; who receiving them, receive that by them which they are termed? The Bread and Cup are his Body and Blood, because they are causes instrumental, upon the receit whereof, the Participation of his Body and Blood ensueth. For that which produceth any certain effect, is not vainly nor improperly said to be, that very effect whereunto it tendeth. Every cause is in the effect which groweth from it. Our Souls and Bodies quickned to Eternal Life, are effects; the cause whereof, is the Person of Christ: His Body and Blood are the true Well-spring, out of which, this Life floweth. So that his Body and Blood are in that very subject whereunto they minister life: Not onely by effect or operation, even as the influence of the Heavens is in Plants, Beasts, Men, and in every thing which they quicken; but also by a far more Divine and Mystical kinde of Union, which maketh us one with him, even as He and the Father are one. The Real Presence of Christs most Blessed Body and Blood, is not therefore to be sought for in the Sacrament, but in the worthy Receiver of the Sacrament. And with this the very order of our Saviours words agreeth, first,<note place="margin">Mark 14. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Take and eat</hi>; then, <hi>This is my Body which was broken for you:</hi> First, <hi>Drink ye all of this</hi>; then followeth, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</hi> I see not which way it should be gathered by the Words of Christ, when and where the Bread, is his Body, or the Cup, his Blood; but onely in the very Heart and Soul of him which receiveth them. As for the Sacraments, they really exhibite; but, for ought we can gather out of that which is written of them, they are not really, nor do really contain in themselves, that Grace, which with them, or by them, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to bestow. If on all sides it be confest, That the Grace of Baptism is poured into the Soul of Man; that by Water we receive it, although it be neither seated
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66185:174"/>
in the Water, nor the Water changed into it; what should induce men to think, that the Grace of the Eucharist must needs be in the Eucharist, before it can be in us that receive it? The fruit of the Eucharist is the Participation of the Body and Blood of Christ. There is no sentence of holy Scripture which saith, That we cannot by this Sacrament be made partakers of his Body and Blood, except they be first contained in the Sacrament, or the Sacrament converted into them. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> being words of promise, sith we all agree, That by the Sacrament, Christ doth really and truly in us, perform his promise; why do we vainly trouble our selves with so fierce Contentions, whether by Consubstantiation, or else by Transubstantiation the Sacrament it self be first possessed with Christ, or no? A thing which no way can either further or hinder us, howsoever it stand, because our Participation of Christ in this Sacrament, dependeth on the co-operation of his Omnipotent Power, which maketh it his Body and Blood to us; whether with change or without alteration of the Element, such as they imagine, we need not greatly to care or inquire. Take therefore that wherein all agree, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider by it self, what cause, why the rest in question should not rather be left as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, then urged as necessary. It is on all sides plainly confest, first, That this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a true and a real Participation of Christ, who thereby imparteth himself, even his whole intire Person, <hi>as a Mystical Head,</hi> unto every Soul that receiveth him, and that every such Receiver doth thereby incorporate or unite himself unto Christ <hi>as a Mystical Member</hi> of him, yea, of them also whom he acknowledgeth to be his own. Secondly, That to whom <hi>the Person of Christ</hi> is thus communicated, to them he giveth by the same Sacrament his holy Spirit to sanctifie them, as it sanctifieth him which is their Head. Thirdly, That what <hi>merit, force, or vertue soever there is in his Sacrificed Body and Blood,</hi> we freely, fully, and wholly have it by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, That <hi>the effect thereof in us, is a real transmutation of our Souls and Bodies,</hi> from sin to righteousness, from death and corruption to immortality and life. Fifthly, That because the Sacrament being of it self, but a corruptible and earthly Creature, must needs be thought an unlikely Instrument to work so admirable effects in Man; we are therefore, to rest our selves altogether upon <hi>the strength of his glorious power,</hi> who is able, and will bring to pass, That the Bread and Cup which he giveth us, shall be truly the thing he promiseth. It seemeth therefore much amiss, that against them whom they term Sacramentaries, so many invective Discourses are made, all ranning upon two points, That the Eucharist is not bare a Sign or Figure onely, and that the efficacy of his Body and Blood is not all we receive in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For no man, having read their Books and Writings which are thus traduced, can be ignorant that both these Assertions they plainly confess to be most true. They do not so interpret the words of Christ, as if the name of his Body did import but the figure of his Body; and to be, were onely to signifie his Blood. They grant, that these holy Mysteries received in due manner, do instrumentally both make us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Grace of that Body and Blood which were given for the Life of the World; and besides, also impart unto us, even in true and real, though mystical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the very Person of our Lord himself, whole, perfect, and intire, as hath been shewed. Now whereas all three opinions do thus far accord in one, that strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which two of the three have imbraced, as touching a Literal, Corporal, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Manducation of the very Substance of his Flesh and Blood, is surely an opinion no where delivered in holy Scripture, whereby they should think themselves bound to believe it, and (to speak with the softest terms we can use) greatly prejudiced in that, when some others did so conceive of eating his Flesh, our Saviour to abate that error in them, gave them directly to understand, how his Flesh so eaten could profit them nothing, because the words which he spake were Spirit; that is to say, they had a reference to a Mystical Participation; which Mystical Participation giveth life. Wherein there is small appearance of likelihood, that his meaning should be onely to make them Marcionites by inversion, and to teach them that, as <hi>Marcion</hi> did think, Christ seemed to be Man, but was not; so they contrariwise should believe. That Christ in Truth would so give them, as they thought, his Flesh to eat; but yet left the horror thereof should offend them, he would not seem to do that he did. When they which have this opinion of Christ, in that Blessed Sacrament, go about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

themselves, and to open after what manner things are brought to pass, the one sort lay the Union of Christs Deity with his Manhood, as their first foundation and ground: From thence they infer a power which the Body of Christ hath, thereby to present it self in all places; out of which Ubiquity of his Body, they gather the presence thereof with that sanctified Bread and Wine of our Lords Table: The Conjunction of his Body and Blood with those Elements they use as an Argument, to shew how the Bread may as well in that respect be termed his Body, because his Body is therewith joyned, as the Son of God may be named Man, by reason, that God and Man in the Person of Christ are united: To this they add, how the Words of Christ commanding us to eat, must needs import, That as he hath coupled the Substance of his Flesh, and the Substance of Bread together, so we together should receive both: Which Labyrinth, as the other sort doth justly shun, so the way which they take to the same In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is somewhat more short, but no whit more certain. For through Gods Omnipotent Power, they imagine that Transubstantiation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the words of Consecration; and, upon Transubstantiation, the Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs both Body and Blood, in the onely shape of Sacramental Elements. So that they all three do plead Gods Omnipotency: Sacramentaries, to that Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the rest confess he accomplisheth; the Patrons of Transubstantiation, over and besides that, to the change of one substance into another; the Followers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, to the kneading of both Substances, as it were, into one lump: Touching the sentence of Antiquity in this cause; first, For as much as they knew, that the force of this Sacrament doth necessarily presuppose the Verity of Christs both Body and Blood, they used oftentimes the same as an Argument to prove, That Christ hath as truly the substance of Man as of God, because here we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ, and those Graces which flow from him, in that he is Man. So that if he have no such Being, neither can the Sacrament have any such meaning, as we all confess it hath.

and Body, an alteration from death to life. In a word, it appeareth not, that of all the ancient Fathers of the Chruch, any one did ever conceive or imagine other then onely a Mystical Participation of Christs both Body and Blood in the Sacrament, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are their speeches concerning the change of the Elements themselves, into the Body and Blood of Christ such, that a man can thereby, in Conscience, assure himself it was their meaning, to perswade the World, either of a Corporal Consubstantiation of Christ, with those Sanctified and Blessed Elements, before we receive them; or of the like Transubstantiation of them into the Body and Blood of Christ. Which both to our Mystical Communion with Christ, are so unnecessary, that the Fathers, who plainly hold but this Mystical Communion, cannot easily be thought to have meant any other change of Sacramental Elements, then that which the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Communion did require them to hold. These things considered, how should that Minde, which, loving Truth, and seeking Comfort out of Holy Mysteries, hath not perhaps the leisure, perhaps nor the wit nor capacity to tread out so endless Mazes, as the intricate Disputes of this cause have led men into, how should a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously disposed minde better resolve with it self then thus? <hi>Variety of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Opinions argueth obscurity in those things whereabout they differ. But that which all parts receive for Truth, that which every one having sifted, is by no one denied or doubted of, must needs be matter of infallible certainly. Whereas therefore there are but three Expositions made of,</hi> This is my Body; <hi>The first, This is in it self before participation</hi> really and truly the Natural Substance of my Body, by reason of the coexistence which my Omnipotent Body hath with the sanctified Element of Bread, which is the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Interpretation. <hi>The second, This is in itself and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore participation</hi> the very true and Natural Substance of my Body, by force of that Deity, which with the words of Consecration, abolisheth the Substance of Bread, and substituteth in the place thereof my Body, which is the Popish construction. <hi>The last,</hi> This Hallowed Food, through concurrence of Divine Power, is in verity and truth, unto faithful Receivers, instrumentally a cause of that Mystical Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, whereby as I make my self wholly theirs; so I give them in hand an actual possession of all such saving Grace, as my Sacrificed Body can yield, and as their Souls do presently need: This is to them, and in them, my Body. <hi>Of these three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed Interpretations, the last hath in it nothing but what the rest do all approve and acknowledge to be most true; nothing but that which the words of Christ are on all sides confest to inforce; nothing but that which the Church of God hath always thought necessary; nothing but that which alone is sufficient for every Christian man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, concerning the use and force of this Sacrament: Finally, Nothing but that wherewith the Writings of all Antiquity are consonant, and all Christian Confessions agreeable. And as Truth, in what kinde soever, is by no kinde of Truth gain-said; so the minde which resteth it self on this, it never troubled with those perplexities which the other do both finde, by means of so great contradiction between their opinions, and true principles of Reason grounded upon Experience, Nature, and Sense. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, with boysterous courage and breath, they seem oftentimes to blow away; yet who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so observeth, how again they labor and sweat by subtilty of wit, to make some shew of agreement between their peculiar conceits, and the general Edicts of Nature, must needs perceive they struggle with that which they cannot fully master. Besides, sith of that which is proper to themselves, their Discourses are hungry and unpleasant, full of tedious and irksome labor, heartless, and hitherto without Fruit; on the other side, read we them, or hear we others, be they of our own or of ancienter times, to what part soever they be thought to incline, touching that whereof there is controversie; yet in this, where they all speak but one thing, their Discourses are Heavenly, their Words sweet as the Honey-Comb, their Tongues melodiously tuned Instruments, their Sentences meer Consolation and Ioy: Are we not hereby almost, even with voice from Heaven admonished, which we may safeliest cleave unto? He which hath said of the one Sacrament,</hi> Wash and be clean, <hi>hath said concerning the other likewise,</hi> Eat and live. <hi>If therefore without any such particular and solemn warrant as this is, that poor distressed Woman coming unto Christ for health, could so constantly resolve her self,</hi> May I but touch the skirt of his Garment, I shall be whole, <hi>what moveth us to argue of the manner how Life should come by Bread? our duty being here, but
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66185:175"/>
to take what is offered, and most assuredly to rest perswaded of this, that, can we but eat, we are safe? When I behold with mine eyes, some small and scarce discernable Grain or Seed, whereof Nature maketh a promise, that a Tree shall come; and when afterwards of that Tree, any skilful Artificer undertaketh to frame some exquisite and curious work, I look for the event, I move no question about performance, either of the one, or of the other. Shall I simply credit Nature in things natural? Shall I in things arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, relie my self on Art, never offering to make doubt? And in that which is above, both Art and Nature refuse to believe the Author of both, except he acquaint me with his ways, and lay the secret of his skill before me? Where God himself doth speak those things, which, either for height and sublimity of Matter, or else for secresie of Performance, we are not able to reach unto, as we may be ignorant without danger, so it can be no disgrace to confess we are ignorant. Such as love Piety will, as much as in them lieth, know all things that God commandeth, but especially the duties of Service which they ow to God. As for his dark and hidden works, they prefer, as becometh them in such cases, simplicity of Faith before that Knowledge, which curiously sisting what it should adore, and disputing too boldly of that which the wit of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not search, chilleth for the most part all warmth of zeal, and bringeth soundness of belief many times into great hazard. Let it therefore be sufficient for me, presenting my self at the Lords Table, to know what there I receive from him; without searching or enquiring of the manner, how Christ performeth his promise? Let Disputes and Questions, Enemies to Piety, abatements of true Devotion, and hitherto, in this cause, but over-patiently heard, let them take their rest: Let curious and sharp-witted Men, beat their Heads about what Questions themselves will; the very Letter of the Word of Christ, giveth plain security, that these Mysteries do, as Nails, fasten us to his very Cross, that by them we draw out, as touching Efficacy, Force, and Vertue, even the Blood of his goared side: In the Wounds of our Redeemer, we there dip our Tongues, we are died red, both within and without; our hunger is satisfied, and our thirst for ever quenched; they are things wonderful which he feeleth, great which he seeth, and unheard of which he uttereth, whose Soul it possest of this Paschal Lamb, and made joyful in the strength of this new Wine: This Bread hath in it more then the substance which our eyes behold; this Cup hallowed with solemn Benediction, availeth to the endless life and welfare both of Soul and Body, in that it serveth as well for a Medicine to heal our infirmities and purge our sins; as for a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving: With touching it sanctifieth, it enlightneth with belief, it truly conformeth us unto the image of Iesus Christ. What these Elements are in themselves, it skilleth not, it is enough, that to me which take them, they are the Body and Blood of Christ; his Promise, in witness hereof sufficeth; his Word, he knoweth which way to accomplish; why should any cogitation possess the minde of a Faithful Communicant, but this. O my God, thou art true; O my Soul, thou art happy!</hi> Thus therefore we see, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mens opinions do otherwise vary; nevertheless, touching Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, we may with consent of the whole Christian World conclude they are necessary; the one to initiate or begin, the other to consummate or make perfect our life in Christ.</p>

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ at his last Supper did speak generally once to all, or to every one in particular, is a thing uncertain. His words are recorded in that Form which serveth best for the setting down with Historical brevity, what was spoken; they are no manifest proof, that he spake but once unto all, which did then Communicate, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that we in speaking unto every Communicant severally do amiss; although it were clear, that we herein do otherwise then Christ did. Our imitation of him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in tying scrupulously our selves unto his syllables, but rather in speaking by the Heavenly Direction of that inspired Divine Wisdom, which teacheth divers ways to one end; and doth therein controul their boldness, by whom any profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way is censured, as reprovable, onely under colour of some small difference from great examples going before; to do throughout every the like circumstance, the same which Christ did in this action, were by following his footsteps in that sort, to err more from the purpose he aimed at, then we now do by not following them with so nice and severe strictness. They little weigh with themselves, how dull, how heavy, and almost, how without sense, the greatest part of the common mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude every where is, who think it either unmeet or unnecessary to put them, even man by man, especially at that time, in minde whereabout they are.

The softness of Wax may induce a wise man to set his stamp or image therein; it perswadeth no man, that because Wooll hath the like quality, it may therefore receive the like impression.

The name of a Papist is not given unto any man for being a notorious Malefactor. And the crime wherewith we are charged, is suffering of Papists to communicate; so that, be their life and conversation whatsoever in the fight of man, their Popish opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in this case laid as Bars and Exceptions against them, yea, those opinions which they have held in former times,<note n="c" place="margin">Although they would receive the Communion, yet they ought to be kept back, until such time, as by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Gospel-like behavior, they have purged themselves of that suspition of Popery, which their former life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. <hi>T.

But of the Visible Church of Christ in this present World, from which they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate all Papists, we are thus perswaded. <hi>Church</hi> is a word which Art hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, thereby to sever and distinguish that Society of Men, which professeth the true Religion from the rest which profess it not. There have been in the World, from the very first foundation thereof, but three Religions, <hi>Paganism,</hi> which lived in the blindness of corrupt and depraved Nature; <hi>Iudaism,</hi> embracing the Law which Reformed Heathenish Impiety, and taught Salvation to be looked for through One, whom God in the last days would send and exalt to be Lord of all. Finally, <hi>Christian Belief,</hi> which yieldeth obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth him the Saviour whom God did promise. Seeing then that the <hi>Church</hi> is a name, which Art hath given to <hi>Professors of true Religion.</hi> As they which will define a Man, are to pass by those qualities wherein one man doth excel another, and to take onely those Essential Properties, whereby a Man doth differ from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of other kindes: So he that will teach what the Church is, shall never rightly perform the work whereabout he goeth, till in Matter of Religion he touch that difference which severeth the Churches Religion from theirs who are not the Church. Religion being therefore a matter partly of contemplation, partly of action; we must define the Church, which is a Religious Society, by such differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as do properly explain the Essence of such things, that is to say, by the Object or Matter whereabout the Contemplations and Actions of the Church are properly conversant. For so all Knowledges and all Vertues are defined. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, because the onely Object which separateth ours from other Religions, is Jesus Christ, in whom, none but the Church doth believe; and whom, none but the Church doth worship; we finde that accordingly the Apostles do every where distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish hereby the Church from Infidels and from Jews, accounting <hi>them which call upon the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ to be his Church.</hi> If we go lower, we shall but add unto this certain casual and variable accidents, which are not properly of the Being, but make onely for the happier and better Being of the Church of God, either indeed, or in mens opinions and conceits. This is the Error of all Popish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions that hitherto have been brought. They define not the Church by that which the Church essentially is, but by that wherein they imagine their own more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then the rest are. Touching parts of eminency and perfection, parts likewise
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66185:177"/>
of imperfection and defect in the Church of God, they are infinite, their degrees and differences no way possible to be drawn unto any certain account. There is not the least contention and variance,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 5. 1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> but it blemisheth somewhat the Unity that ought to be in the Church of Christ, which notwithstanding may have not onely without offence or breach of concord, her manifold varieties in Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Religion, but also her Strifes and Contentions many times, and that about matters of no small importance; yea, her Schisms, Factions, and such other evils whereunto the Body of the Church is subject, sound and sick, remaining both of the same Body; as long as both parts retain by outward profession, that vital substance of truth, which maketh Christian Religion to differ from theirs, which acknowledge not our Lord Jesus Christ, the Blessed Saviour of Mankinde, give no crecit to his glorious Gospel, and have his Sacraments, the Seals of Eternal Life, in derision. Now the priviledge of the visible Church of God (for of that we speak) is to be herein like the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> that, for any thing we know to the contrary, all without it are lost sheep; yet in this, was the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> priviledged above the Church, that whereas none of them which were in the one could perish, numbers in the other are cast away, because to Eternal Life our Profession is not enough. Many things exclude from the Kingdom of God, although from the Church they separate not. In the Church there arise sundry grievous storms, by means whereof, whole Kingdoms and Nations professing Christ, both have been heretofore, and are at this present day, divided about Christ. During which Divisions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions amongst men, albeit each part do justifie it self, yet the one of necessity must needs err, if there be any contradiction between them, be it great or little; and what side soever it be that hath the truth, the same we must also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alone,<note place="margin">1 John <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In like sense and meaning throughout all ages, Hereticks have justly been hated, as Branches cut off from the Body of the true Vine; yet onely so far forth cut off, as they Heresies have extended. Both Heresie, and many other crimes, which wholly sever from God, do sever from God the Church of God in part onely.

That which separateth therefore utterly, that which cutteth off clean from the visible Church of Christ, is plain Apostasie, direct denial, utter rejection of the whole Christian Faith, as far as the same is professedly different from Infidelity.

Foundations whereof they continue built, notwithstanding these breaches whereby they are rent at the top asunder. Now because for redress of professed Errors, and open Schisms, it is, and must be the Churches care, that all may in outward Conformity be one, as the laudable Polity of former Ages; even so our own, to that end and purpose, hath established divers Laws, the moderate severity whereof is a mean both to stay the rest, and to reclaim such as heretofore have been led awry. But seeing that the <hi>Offices</hi> which Laws require, are always definite, and when that they require is done, they go no farther, whereupon sundry ill-affected persons to save themselves from danger of Laws, pretend obedience, albeit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they carry still the same hearts which they did before; by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it falleth out, that receiving unworthily the Blessed Sacrament at our hands, they eat and drink their own damnation: It is for remedy of this mischief<note n="*" place="margin">

The Ministring of the holy Sacraments unto them, is a Declaration and Seal of Gods favor and reconciliation with them, and a plain Preaching, partly, that they be wash<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I conclude, That the compelling of Papists unto the Communion, and the dismissing and letting of them go, when as they be to be punished for their stubbornness in Popery (with this condition, if they will receive the Communion) is very unlawful; when as, although they would receive it, yet they ought to be kept back, till such time as by their Religious and Gospel-like behavior, &amp;c.</note> here determined, that whom the Law of the Realm doth punish unless they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, such if they offer to obey Law, the Church notwithstanding should not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit without probation before had of their Gospel-like behavior. Wherein they first set no time, how long this supposed probation must continue; again, they nominate no certain judgment, the verdict whereof shall approve mens behavior to be Gospel-like; and, that which is most material, whereas they seek to make it more hard for dissemblers to be received into the Church, then Law and Polity as yet hath done; they make it in truth more easie for such kinde of persons, to winde themselves out of the Law, and to continue the same they were. The Law requireth at their hands, that duty which in conscience doth touch them nearest, because the greatest difference between us and them, is the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, whose Name in the Service of our Communion, we celebrate with due honor, which they in the Error of their Mass prophane. As therefore on our part to hear Mass, were an open departure from that sincere Profession wherein we stand; so if they on the other side, receive our Communion, they give us the strongest pledge of fidelity that man can demand. What their hearts are, God doth know. But if they which minde treachery to God and Man, shall once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this advantage given them, whereby they may satisfie Law, in pretending themselves conformable, (for what can Law with Reason or Justice require more?) and yet be sure the Church will accept no such offer, till their Gospel-like behavior be allowed, after that our own simplicity hath once thus fairly eased them from the sting of Law; it is to be thought they will learn the Mystery of Gospel-like behavior, when leisure serveth them. And so while without any cause, we fear to profane Sacraments, we shall not onely defeat the purpose of most wholesome Laws, but lose or wilfully hazard those Souls; from whom, the likeliest means of full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recovery, are by our indiscretion with-held. For neither doth God thus binde us to dive into mens consciences, nor can their fraud and deceit hurt any man but themselves.

First, In the one it is not denied, but that they may have reasonable causes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and that then even they are delivered from just blame.

And may not a third cause, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitness at the present time, detain us as lawfully back, as either of these two? True it is, that we cannot hereby altogether excuse our selves, for that we ought to prevent this, and do not: But if we have committed a fault in not preparing our mindes before, shall we therefore aggravate the same with a worse; the crime of unworthy participation? He that abstaineth, doth want for the time that Grace and Comfort which Religious Communicants have, but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, receiveth death; that which is life to others, turneth in him to poyson.

The falsly surmised necessity, is that, whereby some have thought all such excluded from possibility of salvation, as did depart this life, and never were made partakers of the holy Eucharist. The other case of necessity was, When men which had faln in time of persecution, and had afterwards repented them, but were not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again unto the Fellowship of this Communion, did at the hour of their death request it, that so they might rest with greater quietness and comfort of minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby assuted of departure, in unity of Christs Church; which vertuous desire, the Fathers did think it great impiety, not to satisfie. This was <hi>Serapions</hi> case of necessity. <hi>Serapion</hi> a faithful aged person, and always of very upright life, till fear of persecution in the end, caused him to shrink back; after long sorrow for his scandalous offence, and sute oftentimes made to be pardoned of the Church, fell at length into grievous sickness, and being ready to yield up the ghost, was then more instant then ever before to receive the Sacrament. Which Sacrament was necessary in this case, not that <hi>Serapion</hi> had been deprived of Everlasting Life without it, but that his end was thereby to him made the more comfortable. And do we think, that all cases of such necessity are clean vanished? Suppose that some have by mis-perswasion lived in Schism, withdrawn themselves from holy and publick Assemblies, hated the Prayers, and loathed the Sacraments of the Church, falsly presuming them to be fraught with impious and Antichristian corruptions: Which Error, the God of Mercy and Truth, opening at the length their eyes to see, they do not onely repent them of the evil which they have done, but also in token thereof, desire to receive comfort by that whereunto they have offered disgrace (which may be the case of many poor seduced souls, even at this day.) God forbid, we should think that the Church doth sin, in permitting the wounds of such to be suppled with that Oyl, which this gracious Sacrament doth yield, and their bruised mindes not onely need but beg. There is nothing which the Soul of Man doth desire in that last hour so much, as comfort against the natural terrors of Death, and other scruples of Conscience, which commonly do then most trouble and perplex the weak; towards whom, the very Law of God doth exact at our hands, all the helps that Christian lenity and indulgence can afford.

As the Substance of God alone is infinite, and hath no kinde of limitation; so likewise his Continuance is from everlasting to everlasting, and knoweth neither Beginning nor End. Which demonstrable conclusion being presupposed, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth necessarily, that, besides him, all things are finite, both in substance and in continuance. If in Substance all things be finite, it cannot be, but that there are bounds without the compass whereof, their substance doth not extend; if in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance also limited, they all have, it cannot be denied, their set and their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain terms, before which they had no Being at all. This is the reason, why first we do most admire those things which are Greatest; and secondly, those things which are Ancientest, because the one are least distant from the infinite Substance; the other from the infinite Continuance of God. Out of this we gather, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath true Immortality or Eternity, that is to say, Continuance wherein there groweth no difference by addition of Hereafter unto Now, whereas the noblest and perfectest of all things besides, have continually through continuance, the time of former continuance lengthned; so that they could not heretofore be said to have continued so long as now, neither now so long as hereafter, Gods own Eternity, is the Hand which leadeth Angels in the course of their Perpetuity; their Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity the Hand that draweth out Celestial Motion; the Line of which Motion, and the Thred of Time, are spun together. Now as Nature bringeth forth Time with Motion, so we by Motion have learned how to divide Time, and by the smaller parts of Time, both to measure the greater, and to know how long all things else endure. For, Time, considered in it self, is but the Flux of that very instant, wherein the Motion of the Heaven began; being coupled with other things, it is the quantity of their continuance measured by the distance of two instants: As the time of a man, is a mans continuance from the instant of his first breath, till the instant of his last gasp. Hereupon, some have defined Time to be the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Motion of Heaven; because the first thing which Time doth measure, is that Motion wherewith it began, and by the help whereof it measureth other things; as when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, That a mans continuance doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly exceed Threescore and ten years, he useth the help, both of Motion and Number, to measure Time. They which make Time an effect of Motion, and Motion to be in Nature before Time, ought to have considered with themselves, that albeit we should deny, as <hi>Melissus</hi> did, all Motion, we might notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acknowledge Time, because Time doth but signifie the quantity of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which Continuance may be in things that rest, and are never moved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we may also consider in Rest, both that which is past, and that which is present, and that which is future; yea, farther, even length and shortness in every of these, although we never had conceit of Motion. But to define, without Motion, how long, or how short such Continuance is, were impossible. So that herein we must of necessity use the benefit of Years, Days, Hours, Minutes, which all grow from Celestial Motion. Again, for as much as that Motion is Circular, whereby we make our Divisions of Time, and the Compass of that Circuit such, that the Heavens which are therein continually moved, and keep in their Motions uniform Celerity, must needs touch often the same points, they cannot chuse but bring unto us by equal distances, frequent returns of the same times. Furthermore, whereas Time is nothing but the meer quantity of that Continuance which all things have, that are not as God is, without beginning, that which is proper unto all quantities agreeth also to this kinde; so that Time doth but measure other things, and neither worketh in them any real effect, nor is it self ever capable of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:66185:180"/>
any. And therefore when commonly we use to say, That Time doth eat or fret out all things; that Time is the wisest thing in the World, because it bringeth forth all Knowledge; and that nothing is more foolish then Time, which never holdeth any thing long, but whatsoever one day learneth, the same another day forgetteth again; that some men see prosperous and happy days, and that some mens days are miserable: In all these, and the like speeches, that which is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Time, is not verified of Time it self; but agreeth unto those things which are in Time, and do by means of so near conjunction, either lay their burden upon the back, or set their Crown upon the Head of Time.

Festival solemnity therefore, is nothing but the due mixture, as it were, of these three Elements, Praise, Bounty, and Rest. Touching Praise, for as much as the Jews, who alone knew the way how to magnifie God aright, did commonly (as appeared by their wicked lives) more of custom, and for fashion sake execute the services of their Religion, then with hearty and true devotion (which God especially requireth) he therefore protesteth against their Sabbaths and Solemn Days, as being therewith much offended. Plentiful and liberal expence is required in them that abound, party as a sign of their own joy, in the goodness of God towards them, and partly as a mean, whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh those poor and needy, who being, especially at these times, made partakers of relaxation and joy with others,<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 14. Nehe 8. 9.</note> do the more religiously bless God, whose great Mercies were a cause thereof, and the more contentedly endure the burthen of that hard estate wherein they continue. Rest is the end of all Motion, and the last perfection of all things that labor. Labors in us are journeys, and even in them which feel no weariness by any work; yet they are but ways whereby to come unto that which bringeth not happiness, till it do bring Rest. For as long as any thing which we desire is unattained, we rest not. Let us not here take Rest for Idleness. They are Idle, whom the painfulness of action causeth to avoid those Labors, whereunto both God and Nature bindeth them; they Rest, which either cease from their work, when they have brought it unto perfection, of else give over a meaner labor, because a worthier and better is to be undertaken. God hath created nothing to be idle or ill employed. As therefore, Man doth consist of different and distinct parts, every part endued with manifold abilities, which all have their several ends and actions thereunto referred; so there is in this great variety of duties which belong to men, that dependency and other; by means whereof, the lower sustaining always the more excellent, and the higher perfecting the more base; they are in their times and seasons continued with most exquisite correspondence: Labors of bodily and daily toyl, purchase freedom for actions of Religious Joy, which benefit these actions requite with the gift of desired Rest: A thing most natural and fit to accompany the solemn Festival duties of honor, which are done to God. For if those principal works of God, the memory whereof we use to celebrate at such times, be but certain tastes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Besides, whereas ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary labors are both in themselves painful, and base in comparison of Festival Services done to God, doth not the natural difference between them, shew that the one, as it were, by way of submission and homage, should surrender themselves to the other, wherewith they can neither easily concur, because painfulness and joy are opposite, nor decently, because while the minde hath just occasion to make her abode in the House of Gladness, the Weed of ordinary toyl and travel, becometh her not? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even Nature hath taught the Heathens, and God the Jews, and Christ us, first, that Festival Solemnities are a part of the publick exercise of Religion: secondly, that Praise, Liberality, and Rest, are as Natural Elements whereof Solemnities consist. But these things the Heathens converted to the honor of their false gods: And,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66185:181"/>
as they failed in the end it self; so neither could they discern rightly what form and measure Religion therein should observe. Whereupon, when the <hi>Israelites</hi> impiously followed so corrupt example, they are in every degree noted to have done amiss; their Hymns of Songs of Praise, were Idolatry, their Bounty, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; and their Rest, wantonness. Therefore the Law of God which appointed them days of Solemnity, taught them likewise in what manner the same should be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated: According to the pattern of which Institution, <hi>David</hi> establishing the state of Religion, ordained Praise to be given unto God in the Sabbaths,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 23.30.</note> Moneths, and appointed Times, as their custom had been always before the Lord. Now, besides the times which God himself in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> particularly specified, there were, through the Wisdom of the Church, certain other devised by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of like occurents to those whereupon the former had risen; as namely, that which <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi> did first celebrate,<note place="margin">Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which cause they honored the last day, we the first, in every seven, throughout the year, The rest of the days and times which we celebrate, have relation all unto one head. We begin therefore our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical year,<note place="margin">Luk 1. 25.</note> with the glorious Annuntiation of his Birth, by Angelical Embassage. There being hereunto added, his Blessed Nativity it self; the Mystery of his Legal Circumcision,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 21.</note> the Testification of his true Incarnation, by the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her, which brought him in the World, his Resurrection, his Ascension into Heaven, the admirable sending down of his Spirit upon his chosen, and (which consequently ensued) the notice of that incomprehensible Trinity thereby given to the Church of God. Again, for as much as we know, that Christ hath not onely been manifested great in himself, but great in other his Saints also, the days of whose departure out of the World, are to the Church of Christ, as the Birth and Coronation days of Kings or Emperors; therefore especial choice being made of the very flower of all occasions in this kinde, there are annual selected times to meditate of Christ glorified in them, which had the honor to suffer for his sake, before they had age and ability to know him; glorified in them, which knowing him as <hi>Stephen,</hi> had the sight of that before death, whereinto so acceptable death did lead, glorified in those Sages of the East, that came from far to adore him,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66185:182"/>
and were conducted by strange light; glorified in the second <hi>Elias</hi> of the World, sent before him to prepare his way, glorified in every of those Apostles, whom it pleased him to use as Founders of his Kingdom here; glorified in the Angels, as in <hi>Michael,</hi> glorified in all those happy Souls, that are already possessed of Heaven. Over and besides which number not great, the rest be but four other days heretofore annexed to the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> by reason of general Baptism, usual at those two Feasts; which also is the cause why they had not, as other days, any proper name given them. Their first Institution was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through necessity, and their present continuance is now for the greater honor of the Principals, whereupon they still attend. If it be then demanded, Whether we observe these times as being thereunto bound by force of Divine Law, or else by the onely Positive Ordinances of the Church; I answer to this, That the very Law of Nature it self, which all men confess to be Gods Law, requireth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral no less the Sanctification of Times, then of Places, Persons and Things, unto Gods honor. For which cause it hath pleased him heretofore, as of the rest; so of times likewise, to exact some parts by way of perpetual homage, never to be dispensed withal, nor remitted: Again To require some other parts of time with as strict exaction, but for less continuance; and of the rest which were left arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, to accept what the Church shall in due consideration consecrate volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, unto like Religious uses. Of the first kinde, amongst the Jews, was the Sabbath-day; of the second, Those Feasts which are appointed by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; the Feast of Dedication, invented by the Church, standeth in the number of the last kinde. The Moral Law requiring therefore a seventh part throughout the age of the whole World, to be that way employed, although with us the day be changed, in regard of a new Revolution begun by our Saviour Christ; yet the same proportion of time continueth which was before, because in reference to the benefit of Creation, and now much more of Renovation thereunto added by him which was Prince of the World to come; we are bound to accompt the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of one day in seven, a duty which Gods Immutable Law doth exact for ever. The rest, they say, we ought to abolish, because the continuance of them doth nourish wicked Superstition in the mindes of men; besides, they are all abused by Papists, the enemies of God; yea, certain of them, as <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> even by the Jews.</p>

As for imitation of Papists, and the breeding of Superstition, they are now become such common guests, that no man can think it discourteous to let them go as they came. The next is a rare Observation and Strange; you shall finde, if you mark it (as it doth deserve to be noted well) that many thousands there are, who if they have vertuously during those times behaved themselves,<note place="margin">T. C. lib. 6. pag. 151. If they had been never abused, neither by the Papists, nor by the Jews, as they have been, and are daily; yet such making of Holidays, is never without some great danger of bringing in some evil and currupt opinions into the mindes of men. I will use an example in one, and that the chief of Holidays, and most generally, and of longest time observed in the Church, which is the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> which was kept of some more days, of some sewer. How many thousands are there, I will not say of the ignorant Papists, but of those also which profess the Gospel, which when they have celebrated those days with diligent heed taken unto their life; and with some earnest devotion in praying, and hearing the Word of God, do not by and by, think that they have well celebrated the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi>; and yet have they thus notably deceived themselves. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reacheth, 1 Cor. 5. 8. That the celebrating of the Feast of the Christians <hi>Easter,</hi> is not, as the Jews was for certain days, but sheweth, That we must keep this Feast all the days of our life in the Unleavened Bread of Sincerity and of Truth. By which we see, that the observing of the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> for certain days in the year, doth pull out of our mindes, ere ever we he aware, the Doctrine of the Gospel, and causeth us to rest in that near consideration of our duties, for the space of a few days, which should be extended in all our life.</note> if their devotion and zeal in Prayer have been fervent, their attention to the Word of God, such as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men should yield, imagine, that herein they have performed a good duty; which notwithstanding to think, is a very dangerous: Error, in as much as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught, That we ought not to keep our <hi>Easter</hi> as the Jews did for certain days; but, in the Unleavened Bread of Sincerity and of Truth, to feast continually: Whereas the restraint of <hi>Easter</hi> to a certain number of days, causeth us to rest for a short space in that near consideration of our duties, which should be extended throughout the course of our whole lives, and so pulleth out
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66185:182"/>
of our mindes, the Doctrine of Christs Gospel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re we be aware. The Doctrine of the Gospel, which here they mean, or should mean, is, That Christ having finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law, there is no Jewish Paschal Solemnity, nor abstinence from sour Bread, now required at our hands; there is no Leaven which we are bound to cast out, but malice, sin, and wickedness; no Bread but the food of sincere Truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are tied to celebrate our Passover. And seeing no time of sin is granted us, neither any intermission of sound belief, it followeth, That this kinde of feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to endure always. But how are standing Festival Solemnities against this? That which the Gospel of Christ requireth, is the perpetuity of vertuous duties; not perpetuity of exercise or action; but disposition perpetual, and practice as oft as times and opportunities require. Just, valiant, liberal, temperate, and holy men are they, which can whensoever they will, and will whensoever they ought, execute what their several perfections import. If Vertues did always cease to be, when they cease to work, there should be nothing more pernicious to Vertue then Sleep: Neither were it possible that men, as <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> should in all the Commandments of God, walk unreprovable; or that the Chain of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation should contain so many Links of Divine Vertues, as the Apostles in divers places have reckoned up; if in the exercise of each vertue, perpetual continuance were exacted at our hands. Seeing therefore all things are done in time, and many offices are not possible at one and the same time to be discharged; duties of all forms must have necessarily their several successions and seasons: In which respect the School-men have well and soundly determined, That Gods Affirmative Laws and Precepts, the Laws that enjoyn any actual duty, as Prayer, Alms, and the like, do binde us <hi>ad semper velle,</hi> but not <hi>ad semper agere</hi>; we are tyed to iterate and resume them when need is, howbeit not to continue them without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Feasts, whether God himself hath ordained them, or the Church by that Authority which God hath given, they are of Religion such publick services, as neither can, nor ought to be continued otherwise then onely by iteration. Which iteration is a most effectual mean to bring unto full maturity and growth those Seeds of Godliness, that these very men themselves do grant to be sown in the hearts of many Thousands, during the while that such Feasts are present. The constant habit of well-doing, is not gotten, without the custom of doing well, neither can Vertue be made perfect, but by the manifold works of Vertue often practised. Before the powers of our mindes be brought unto some perfection, our first assays and offers towards Vertue, must needs be raw; yet commendable, because they tend unto ripeness. For which cause, and Wisdom of God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, especially this circumstance amongst others in solemn Feasts, That to Children and Novices in Religion, they minister the first occasion to ask and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of God. Whereupon, if there follow but so much Piety as hath been mentioned, let the Church learn to further imbecillity with Prayer. <hi>Preserve, Lord, these good and gracious beginnings, that they suddenly dry not up like the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dew, but may prosper and grow as the Trees, which Rivers of Waters keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways flourishing.</hi> Let all mens acclamations be, <hi>Grace, Grace unto it,</hi> as to that first laid Corner Stone in <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Buildings. For who hath despised the day of those things which are small? Or, how dare we take upon us to condemn that very thing which voluntarily we grant, maketh as of nothing, somewhat; seeing all we pretend against it, is onely, that as yet this somewhat, is not much? The days of solemnity which are but few, cannot chuse but soon finish that outward exercise of Godliness, which properly appertaineth to such times; howbeit, mens inward disposition to Vertue, they both augment for the present, and by their often returns, bring also the same at the length unto that perfection which we most desire. So that although by their necessary short continuance, they abridge the present exercise of Piety in some kinde; yet because by repetition they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, strengthen, and confirm the habits of all Vertue; it remaineth, that we honor, observe and keep them as Ordinances, many ways singularly profitable in Gods Church. This Exception being taken against Holidays, for that they restrain the Praises of God unto certain times, another followeth condemning restraint of men, from their ordinary Trades and Labors at those times.</p>

But it followeth not, because the Lord did it, that therefore the Church may do it, unless it hath Commandment and Authority from God so to do.

The reason of which Commandment of the Lord was, that they abstained that day as much as might be conveniently from Meats; so they might abstain from their daily works, to the end they might bestow the whole day in hearing the Word of God, and humbling themselves in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, confessing their faults, and desiring the Lord to turn away from his fierce wrath. In this case the Church having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to make a Holiday, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They deny not, but in times of publick calamity, that men may the better assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to fast and pray, the Church, because it hath received Commandment from God, to proclaim a Prohibition from ordinary works, standeth bound to do it, as the Jews afflicted did in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But without some express Commandment from God, there is no power, they say, under Heaven, which may presume by any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to restrain the liberty that God hath given. Which opinion, albeit applied here no farther then to this present cause, shaketh universally the Fabrick of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tendeth to Anarchy, and meer confusion, dissolveth Families, dissipateth Colledges, Corporations, Armies; overthroweth Kingdoms, Churches, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is now, through the providence of God, by Authority and Power upheld. For whereas God hath foreptized things of the greatest weight, and hath therein precisely defined, as well that which every man must perform, as that which no man may attempt, leaving all sorts of men in the Rest, either to be guided by their own good discretion, if they be free from subjection to others, or else to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such Commandments and Laws, as proceed from those Superiors under whom they live; the Patrons of Liberty have here made Solemn Proclamation, that all such Laws and Commandments are void, in as much as every man is left to the freedom of his own minde, in such things as are not either exacted or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Law of God. And because, onely in these things, the Positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men have place; which Precepts cannot possibly be given without some Abridgment of their Liberty, to whom they are given: Therefore if the Father command the Son, or the Husband the Wife; or the Lord the Servant, or the Leader the Soldier, or the Prince the Subject; to go or stand, sleep or wake, at such times, as God himself in particular commandeth neither; they are to stand in defence of the Freedom which God hath granted, and to do as themselves list, knowing, that men may as lawfully command them things utterly forbidden by the Law of God, as tye them to any thing which the Law of God leaveth free. The plain contradictory whereunto is unfallibly certain. Those things which the Law of God leaveth Arbitrary and at Liberty, are all subject to the Positive Laws of Men; which Laws for the common benefit, abridge particular Mens Liberty in such things, as far as the Rules of Equity will suffer. This we must either maintain, or else over-turn the World, and make every man his own Commander. Seeing then that Labor and Rest upon any one day of the Six, throughout the year, are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed free by the Law of God, how exempt we them from the force and power of Ecclesiastical Law, except we deprive the World of Power, to make any Ordinance or Law at all? Besides, Is it probable that God should not onely allow, but command concurrency of Rest, with extraordinary occasions of doleful events, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling (peradventure) some one certain Church, or not extending unto many, and not as much as permit or licence the like; when Piety, triumphant with Joy and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66185:183"/>
Gladness, maketh solemn commemoration of Gods most rare and unwonted Mercies, <hi>such especially as the whole race of mankinde</hi> doth or might participate? Of vacation from labor in times of sorrow, the onely cause is, for that the general publick Prayers of the whole Church, and our own private business, cannot both he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at once; whereas of Rest in the famous solemnities of publick Joy, there is both this consideration the same; and also farther a kinde of natural repugnancy, which maketh labors (as hath been proved) much more unfit to accompany Festival Praises of God, then Offices of Humiliation and Grief. Again, If we sift what they bring for proof and approbation of Rest with Fasting, doth it not in all respects as fully warrant, and as strictly command Rest, whensoever the Church hath equal reason by Feasts, and gladsome solemnities to testifie publick thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness towards God?

So that what abuses soever were of that Feast, yet as a perpetual Decree of God, it ought to have remained; whereas our Churches can make no such Decree, which may not upon change of times, and at her circumstances, be altered. For the other proof hereof. I take the last Verse: For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet contenteth not himself with that, that he had rehearsed the Decree, as he doth sometimes the Decree of propane Kings, but oditeth precisely, that as soon as ever the Decree was made, it was Registred in this Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> which is one of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it had been of no further Authority, then on Decree, or then a Canon of one of the Councils, it had been presumption to have brought it into the Library of the Holy Ghost. The sum of my Answer is, That this Decree was Divine, and not Ecclesiastical onely.</note> But this Decree, they say, was Divine, not Ecclesiastical, as may appear in that there is another Decree in another Book of Scripture; which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is plain, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As though the purposes of men might never intend constancy in that, the nature whereof is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to alteration. Doth the Scripture it self make mention of any Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? Is the Scripture witness of more, then onely that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was the Author of this Custom, that by Letters written to his brethren the Jews, throughout all Provinces under <hi>Darius,</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi>; he gave them charge to celebrate yearly those two days, for perpetual remembrance of Gods miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and mercy; that the Jews hereupon undertook to do it, and made it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66185:184"/>
with general consent, an order for perpetnity; that <hi>Esther,</hi> secondly, by her Letters confirmed the same which <hi>Mordecai</hi> had before decreed; and that finally, the Ordinance was written to remain for ever upon Record? Did not the Jews, in Provinces abroad, observe at the first the Fourteenth day, the Jews in <hi>Susis</hi> the Fifteenth? Were they not all reduced to an uniform order, by means of those two Decrees, and so every where three days kept; the first with fasting, in memory of danger; the rest, in token of deliverance, as festival and joyful days? Was not the first of these three afterwards, the day of sorrow and heaviness, abrogated, when the same Church saw it meet that a better day, a day in memory of like deliverance,<note place="margin">2 Mac. 15 34.</note> out of the bloody hancs of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> should succeed in the room thereof? But for as much as there is no end of answering fruitless oppositions, let it suffice men of sober mindes, to know, that the Law both of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alloweth generally, days of rest and festival solemnity, to be observed by way of thankful and joyful remembrance, if such miraculous favors be shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankinde, as require the same; that such Graces, God hath bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Church,<note place="margin">

Considerations to be kept by all sorts of men, took not their beginning, either from <hi>Montanus,</hi> or any other, whose Heresies may prejudice the credit and due estimation thereof, but have their ground in the Law of Nature, are allowable in Gods sight, were in all ages heretofore, and may till the Worlds end be observed, not without singular use and benefit. Much hurt hath grown to the Church of God, through a false imagination, that Fasting standeth men in no stead for any spiritual respect, but onely to take down the frankness of Nature, and to tame the wildeness of flesh. Whereupon the World being bold to surfeit, doth now blush to fast, supposing, that men when they fast, do rather bewray a Disease, then exercise a Vertue. I much wonder what they, who are thus perswaded, do think, what conceit they have concerning the Fasts of the Patriarks, the Prophets, the Apostles, our Lord Jesus Christ himself. The affections of Joy and Grief are so knit unto all the actions of mans life, that whatsoever we can do, or may be done unto us, the sequel thereof is continually, the one or the other affection. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore considering, that they which grieve and joy as they ought, cannot possibly otherwise live then as they should, the Church of Christ, the most absolute and perfect School of all Vertue, hath by the speciall direction of Gods good Spirit, hitherto always inured men from their infancy; and partly with days of Festival Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, for the framing of the one affection; partly with times of a contrary sort, for the perfecting of the other. Howbeit, over and besides this, we must note, that as Resting, so Fasting likewise attendeth sometimes no less upon the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the higher, then upon the Affections of the lower part of the minde. Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is a work of reverence towards God. The end thereof, sometimes elevation of minde; sometime the purpose thereof clean contrary. The cause why <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount did so long fast, was meer divine Speculation; the cause why <hi>David,</hi>

If that befal us which maketh glad, our Festival Solemnities declare our rejoycing to be in him, whose meer undeserved Mercy is the Author of all happiness; if any thing be either imminent or present, which we shun, our Watchings, Fastings, Cryes, and Tears, are unfeigned Testimonies, that our selves we condemn as the onely causes of our own misery, and do all acknowledge him no less inclinable, then able to save. And because as the memory of the one, though past, reneweth gladness; so the other, called again to minde, doth make the wound of our just remorse to bleed anew; which wound needeth often touching the more, for that we are generally more apt to Kalendar Saints, then sinners days, therefore there is in the Church a care, not to iterate the one alone, but to have frequent repetition of the other. Never to seek after God, saving onely when either the Crib or the Whip doth constrain, were brutish servility, and a great derogation to the worth of that which is most predominant in men, if sometime it had not a kinde of voluntary access to God, and of conference, as it were, with God; all these inferior considerations laid aside. In which sequestration, for as much as<note n="c" place="margin">John 4.31.</note> higher cogitations do naturally drown and bury all inferior cares, the minde may as well forget natural, both food and sleep, by being carried above it self with serious and heavenly Meditation, as by being cast down with heaviness, drowned and swallowed up of sorrow. Albeit therefore, concerning Jewish Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from certain kindes of meats, as being unclean, the Apostle doth reach, That the<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 14. 19.</note> Kingdom of Heaven is not meat nor drink, that food commendeth us not unto God, whether we take it, or abstain from it, that if we eat, we are not thereby the more acceptable in his sight, nor the less, if we eat not: His purpose notwithstanding was far from any intent to derogate from that Fasting, which is no such scrupulous Abstinence, as onely refuseth some kindes of meats and drinks, lest they make them unclean that taste them, but an Abstinence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we either interrupt, or otherwise abridge the careof our bodily sustenance, to shew by this kinde of outward exercise, the serious intention of our mindes, fixed on Heavenlier and better desires, the earnest hunger and thirst whereof, depriveth the body of those usual contentments, which otherwise are not denied unto it. These being in Nature the first causes that induce fasting, the next thing which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66185:186"/>
followeth to be considered, is the ancient practice thereof amongst the Jews. Touching whose private voluntary Fasts, the Precept which our Saviour gave them, was, <hi>When ye fast, look not sour, as Hypocrites: For they dis-figure their faces, that they might seem to men to fast.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. When thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face, that thou seem not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.</hi> Our Lord and Saviour would not teach the manner of doing, much less propose a reward for doing that, which were not both holy and acceptable in Gods sight. The Pharisees weekly bound themselves unto double Fasts, neither are they for this reproval. Often Fasting, which was a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples, could not in them of it self be a vice; and therefore not the oftenness of their Fasting, but their hypocrisie therein was blamed.

Besides, they which found so great fault with our Lords Disciples, for rubbing a few Ears of Corn in their hands on the Sabbath day, are not unlikely to have aimed also at the same mark. For neither was the bodily pain so great, that it should offend them in that respect, and the very manner of defence which our Saviour there useth, is more direct and literal to justifie the breach of the Jewish custom in Fasting, then in working at that time. Finally, the Apostles afterwards themselves, when God first gave them the gift of Tongues, whereas some in disdain and spight, termed Grace, Drunkenness, it being then the day of Pentecost, and but onely a fourth part of the day spent, they use this as an argument against the other cavil,<note n="c" place="margin">Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithstanding, for as much as Christ hath fore-signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that wher. himself should be taken from them, his absence would soon make them apt to fast, it seemeth, that even as the first Festival day appointed to be kept of the Church, was the day of our Lords return from the dead; so the first sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful and mourning day, was, That which we now observe in memory of his departure o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And because there could be no abatement of grief, till they saw him raised, whose death was the occasion of their heaviness; therefore the day he lay in the Sepulchre hath been also kept and observed as a weeping day. The Custom of Fasting these two days before Easter, is undoubtedly most ancient; in so much,<note place="margin">

It came afterward to be an order, that even as the day of Christs Resurrection, so the other two, in memory of his death and burial, were weekly. But this, when Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> lived, had not as yet taken place throughout all Churches, no not in <hi>Millan,</hi> where himself was Bishop. And for that can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Churches which did not observe that day, had another instead thereof, which was the Wednesday, for that when they judged it meet to have weekly a day of Humiliation, besides that whereon our Saviour suffered death, it seemed best to make their choice of that day especially, whereon the Jews are thought to have first contrived their treason together with <hi>Iudas</hi> against Christ. So that the instituting and ordaining both of these, and of all other times of like exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, is as the Church shall judge expedient for mens good. And concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Christians mans duty herein, surely that which <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged to have done, is such, as all men favoring Equity, must needs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and follow, if they affect peace. As for their specified Errors, I will not in this place dispute, whether voluntarily Fasting with a vertuous purpose of minde, be any medicinable remedy of evil, or a duty acceptable unto God, and in the World to come even rewardable, as other offices are which proceed from Christian Piety; whether wilfully to break and despise the wholesome laws of the Church herein, be a thing which offendeth God; whether truly it may not be said, that penitent both weaping and fasting, are means to blot out sin, means whereby through Gods unspeakable and undeserved mercy, we obtain or procure to our selves par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; which attainment unto any gracious benefit by him bestowed, the phrase

of Antiquity useth to express by the name of Merit; but if either Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> or Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> have taught any wrong opinion, seeing they which reprove them are not altogether free from Error; I hope they will think it no error in us so to censure mens smaller faults, that their vertues be not thereby generally prejudiced. And if in Churches abroad, where we are not subject to Power or Jurisdiction, discretion should teach us for Peace and Quietness sake, to frame our selves to other mens example, Is it meet that at home where our freedom is less, our bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should be more? Is it our duty to oppugn, in the Churches whereof we are Ministers, the Rites and Customs which in Foreign Churches Piety and Modesty did teach us, as strangers not to oppugn, but to keep without shew of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or dislike? Why oppose they the name of a Minister in this case, unto the state of a private man? Doth their order exempt them from obedience to Laws? That which their Office and place requireth, is to shew themselves patterns of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend subjection, not Authors and Masters of contempt towards Ordinances, the strength whereof, when they seek to weaken, they do but in truth discover to the World their own imbecillities, which a great deal wiselier they might conceal. But the practice of the Church of Christ, we shall by so much the better, both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and love, if to that which hitherto hath been spoken, there be somewhat added for more particular declaration, how Hereticks have partly abused Fasts, and partly bent themselves against the lawful use thereof in the Church of God.

And therefore as the Jews did by the Festival Solemnity of their Sabbath, rejoyce in the God that created the World, as in the Author of all Goodness; so those Hereticks in hatred of the Maker of the World, sorrowed, wept, and fasted on that day, as being the birth-day of all evil. And as Christian men of sound belief, did solemnize the Sunday, in joyful memory of Christs Resurrection, so likewise at the self-same time such Hereticks as denied his Resurrection, did the contrary to them which held it: When the one sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,<note place="margin">Vide Canon.

Against those Hereticks which have urged perpetual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from certain Meats, as being in their very nature unclean, the Church hath still bent herself as an enemy; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giving charge to take heed of them, which under any such opinion, should utterly forbid the use of Meats or Drinks. The Apostles themselves forbad some, as the order taken at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> declareth. But the cause of their so doing, we all know. Again, when <hi>Tertullian,</hi> together with such as were his followers, began to Montanize, and pretending to perfect the severity of Christian Discipline, brought in sundry unaccustomed days of Fasting, continued their Fasts a great deal longer, and made them more rigorous then the use of the Church had been; the mindes of men being somewhat moved at so great, and so sudden novelty, the cause was presently inquired into. After notice taken how the Montanists held these Additions to be Supplements of the Gospel, whereunto the Spirit of Prophesie did now mean to put, as it were, the last hand, and was therefore newly descended upon <hi>Montanus,</hi> whose orders all Christian men were no less to obey, then the Laws of the Apostles themselves; this Abstinence the Church abhorred likewise, and that justly. Whereupon <hi>Tertullian</hi> proclaiming even open War of the Church, maintained Montanism, wrote a Book in defence of the new Fast, and intituled the same; <hi>A Treatise of Fasting against the opinion of the Carnal sort.</hi> In which Treatise nevertheless, because so much is sound and good, as doth either generally concern the use, or in particular, declare the Custom of the Churches Fasting in those times, men are not to reject whatsoever is alledged out of that Book, for confirmation of the Truth. His error discloseth it self in those places, where he defendeth Fasts to be duties necessary for the whole Church of Christ to observe as commanded by the Holy Ghost, and that with the same authority from whence all other Apostolical Ordinances came, both being the Laws of God himself, without any other distinction or difference, saving onely, that he which before had declared his will by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> did now
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:66185:187"/>
farther reveal the same by <hi>Montanus</hi> also. <hi>Against us ye pretend,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian, that the Publick Orders which Christianity is bound to keep, were delivered at the first, and that no new thing is to be added thereunto. Stand if you can upon this point; for behold, I challenge you for Fasting more then at</hi> Easter <hi>your selves. But in fine ye answer, That these things are to be done as established by the voluntary appointment of men, and not by vertue or force of any Divine Commandment. Well then</hi> (he addeth) <hi>Ye have removed your first footing, and gone beyond that which was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by doing more then was at the first imposed upon you. You say, you must do that which your own judgments have allowed: We require your obedience to that which God himself doth institute. Is it not strange, that men to their own will, should yield that, which to Gods Commandment they will not grant? Shall the pleasure of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more with you, then the power of God himself?</hi> These places of <hi>Tertullian</hi> for Fasting, have worthily been put to silence. And as worthily <hi>Aerius</hi> condemned for opposition against Fasting. The one endeavored to bring in such Fasts as the Church ought not to receive; the other, to overthrow such as already it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and did observe: The one was plausible unto many, by seeming to hate carnal loosness, and riotous excess, much more then the rest of the World did; the other drew hearers, by pretending the maintenance of Christian Liberty: The one thought his cause very strongly upheld by making invective declamations with a pale and a withered countenance against the Church, by filling the ears of his starved hearers with speech suitable to such mens humors, and by telling them, no doubt, to their marvellous contentment and liking, <hi>Our new Prophesies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, they are despised. It is because</hi> Montanus <hi>doth Preach some other God, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Gospel of Iesus Christ, or overthrow any Canon of Faith and Hope? No, our crime is, We teach that men ought to Fast more often then Marry; the best Feast-maker is with them the perfectest Saint, they are assuredly meer Spirit; and therefore these our corporal devotions please them not:</hi> Thus the one for <hi>Montanus</hi> and his Superstition.

Two kindes there were of Publick Penitency; the one belonging to notorious offenders, whose open wickedness had been scandalous; the other appertaining to the whole Church, and unto every several person whom the same containeth. It will be answered. That touching this latter kinde, it may be exercised well enough by men in private. No doubt, but Penitency is as Prayer, a thing acceptable unto God, be it in publick or in secret. Howbeit, as in the one, if men were wholly left to their own voluntary Meditations in their Closets, and not drawn by Laws and Orders unto the open Assemblies of the Church, that there they may joyn with others in Prayer; it may be soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, what Christian devotion that way would come unto in a short time: Even so in the other, We are by sufficient experience taught, how little it booreth, to tell men of washing away their sins with tears of Repentance, and so to leave them altogether unto themselves. O Lord, what heaps of grievous transgressions have we committed, the best, the perfectest, the most righteous amongst us all; and yet clean pass them over unsorrowed fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66185:188"/>
mean to put them often in minde, and even in a manner to draw them to that which now we all quite and clean forget, as if Penitency were no part of a Christian mans duty. Again, besides our private offences which ought not thus loosly to be overslipt; suppose we the Body and Corporation of the Church so just, that at no time it needeth to shew it self openly cast down, in regard of those Faults and Transgressions; which though they do not properly belong unto any one, had notwithstanding a special Sacrifice appointed for them in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and being common to the whole Society which containeth all, must needs so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern every man in particular, as at some time in solemn manner to require ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, with more then daily and ordinary testifications of grief. There could not hereunto a fitter preamble be devised, then that memorable Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set down in the Book of Common Prayer, if our practice in the rest were suitable. The Head already so well drawn, doth but wish a proportionable Body, And by the Preface to that very part of the English Liturgy, it may appear, how at the first setting down thereof, no less was intended. For so we are to interpret the meaning of those words, wherein restitution of the Primitive Church Discipline is greatly wished for, touching the manner of publick penance in time of <hi>Lent.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with some being not much acquainted, but having framed in their mindes, the conceit of a new Discipline, far unlike to that of old, they make themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it is undoubtedly this their Discipline, which at the first was so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. They have long pretended, that the whole Scripture is plain for them. If now the Communion Book make for them too (I well think the one doth as much as the other) it may be hoped, that being found such a well-willer unto their cause, they will more favor it then they have done. Having therefore hitherto spoken, both of Festival days, and so much of solemn Fasts, as may reasonably serve to shew the ground thereof in the Law of Nature; the practice partly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and partly allowed of God in the Jewish Church, the like continued in the Church of Christ; together with the sinister oppositions, either of Hereticks erroneously abusing the same, or of others thereat quarrelling without cause, we will onely collect the chiefest points as well of resemblance, as of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and so end. First, In this they agree, that because Nature is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Root of both; therefore both have been always common to the Church with Infidels and Heathen men.

A fourth thing common unto them, is, that the greatest part of the World hath always grosly and palpably offended in both; Infidels, because they did all in relation to false gods; godless, sensual, and careless mindes, for that there is in them no constant, true, and sincere affection towards those things which are pretended by such exercise; yea, certain flattering over-sights there are, wherewith sundry, and they not of the worst sort, may be easily in these cases led awry, even through abundance of love and liking to that which must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all means, but with caution, in as much as the very admiration of Saints, Whether we celebrate their glory, or follow them in humility; whether we laugh or weep, mourn or rejoyce with them, is, (as in all things, the affection of Love) apt to deceive; and doth therefore need the more to be directed by a watchful guide, seeing there is manifestly both ways, even in them whom we honor, that which we are to observe and shun.

On the other side, the Sores and Diseases of mind which inordinante pleasure breedeth, are by Dolour and Grief cured.

Many singular Effects there are which should make Fasting even in publick Considerations the rather to be accepted. For I presume we are not altogether without experience how great their advantage is in martial Enterprizes, that lead Armies of men trained in a School of Abstinence. It is therefore noted at this day in some, that patience of hunger and thirst hath given them many Victories; in others, that because if they want, there is no man able to rule them, not they in plenty to moderate themselves; he which can either bring them to hunger or overcharge them, is sure to make them their own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. What Nation soever doth feel these dangerous inconveniences, may know that sloth and fulness in peaceable times at home is the cause thereof, and the remedy a strict Observation of that part of Christian Discipline, which teacheth men in practice of Ghostly warfare against themselves, those things that afterwards may help them, justly assaulting or standing in lawful defence of themselves against others. The very purpose of the Church of God, both in the number and in the order of her Fasts, hath been not only to preserve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by throughout all Ages, the remembrance of miseries heretofore sustained, and of the causes in our selves out of which they have risen, that men consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one, might fear the other the more, but farther also to temper the mind, lest contrary affections coming in place should make it too profuse and dissolute, in which respect it seemeth that Fasts have been set as Ushers of Festival days, for prevention of those disorders, as much as might be; wherein, notwithstanding, the

In this world there can be no Society durable, otherwise then only by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation. Albeit therefore single Life be a thing more Angelical and Divine, yet sith the replenishing first of Earth with blessed Inhabitants, and then of Heaven with Saints everlastingly praising God, did depend upon conjunction of Man and Woman, he which made all things compleat and perfect, saw it could not be good to leave men without any Helper, unto the sore-alledged end: In things which some farther and doth cause to be desired, choice seeketh rather proportion, then absolute perfection of goodness. So that Woman being created for mans sake to be his Helper, in regard of the end before mentioned; namely, the having and bringing up of Children, whereunto it was not possible they could concur, unless there were subalternation between them, which subalternation is naturally ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon inequality, because things equall in every respect are never willingly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one by another. Woman therefore was even in her first estate framed by Nature, not only after in time, but inferiour in excellency also unto Man, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in so due and sweet proportion, as being presented before our eyes, might be sooner perceived then defined. And even herein doth lie the Reason why that kind of love which is the perfectest ground of Wedlock is seldome able to yield any reason of it self. Now, that which is born of Man must be nourished with far more travel, as being of greater price in Nature, and of slower pace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, then the Off-spring of any other Creature besides. Man and Woman being therefore to joyn themselves for such a purpose, they were of necessity to be linked with some straight and insoluble knot.

Wherefore, to begin with the times wherein the liberty of Marriage is restrained; <hi>There is,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, a time for all things; a time to laugh, and a time to mourn.</hi> That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging unto Marriage, and Offices appertaining to Pennance, are things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable and unfit to be matched together, the Prophets and Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do witness. Upon which ground, as we might right well think it marvellous absurd to see in a Church a Wedding on the day of a publick Fast, so likewise in the self-same consideration, our Predecessors thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss to take away the common liberty of Marriages, during the time which was

The custome of laying down Money seemeth to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Saxons, whose manner was to buy their Wives. But, seeing there is not any great cause wherefore the memory of that custome should remain, it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not much, although we suffer it to lie dead, even as we see it in a manner already worn out. The Ring hath been always used as an especial pledge of Faith and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: Nothing more fit to serve as a token of our purposed endless continuance in that which we never ought to revoke. This is the cause wherefore the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themselves did in such cases use the Ring, whereunto <hi>Tertullian</hi> alluding, saith; That in ancient times,<note n="c" place="margin">Aurum nulla norat praeter unico digiro quem sponsus oppignorasset pro nubo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulo Tertul. Apol. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>No Woman was permitted to wear gold, saving only upon one finger, which her Husband had fastened unto himself, with that Ring which was usually given for assurance of future Marriage.</hi> The cause why the Christians use it, as some of the Fathers think, is<note n="d" place="margin">Isidor. de. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Offic, l. 2. c. 19.</note> either to testifie mutual love, or rather to serve for a pledge of conjunction in heart and mind agreed upon between them. But what right and custome is there so harmless, wherein the wit of man bending it self to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision may not easily find out somewhat to scorn and jest at? He that should have beheld the Jews when they stood with<note n="e" place="margin">Elias Thesb. in dict. Hupha.</note> a four-cornered Garment, spread over the heads of Espoused Couples, while their Espousals were in making: He that should have beheld their<note n="f" place="margin">In Ritual. de benedict. nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum.</note> praying over a Cup, and their delivering the same at the Marriage-feast, with set Forms of Benediction, as the Order amongst them was, might being lewdly affected, take thereat as just occasion of scornful cavil, as at the use of the Ring in Wedlock amongst Christians. But of all things the most hardly taken, is the uttering of these words, <hi>With my body I thee worship</hi>; In which words when once they are understood, there will appear as little cause as in the rest, for any wise man to be offended. First, therefore, inasmuch as unlawful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation doth pollute and<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 1 Cor. 7. 4.</note> dishonour both parties, this Protestation that we do worship and honour another with our bodies, may import a denial of all such Lets and Impediments to our knowledge, as might cause any stain, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, or disgrace that way; which kind of construction being probable, would easily approve that speech to a peaceable and quiet mind. Secondly, in that the Apostle doth so expresly affirm, that parties unmarried have not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger entire power over themselves, but each hath interest in others person, it cannot be thought an absurd construction to say, that worshipping with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the imparting of that interest in the body unto another,<note n="h" place="margin">L. penul<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, de concub.</note> which none before had, save only our selves. But if this were the natural meaning, the words should perhaps be as requisite to be used on the one side as on the other; and therefore a third sense there is, which I rather rely upon. Apparent it is, that the ancient difference between a lawful Wife and a Concubine was only in the different purpose of man betaking himself to the one or the other. If his purpose were only fellowship, there grew to the Woman by this means no worship at all, but the contrary. In professing that his intent was to add by his person honour and worship unto hers, he took her plainly and cleerly to Wife. This is it which the Civil Law doth mean, when it maketh a Wife to differ from a Concubine in<note n="i" place="margin">L. item lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sect. penult.

Donatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes D. donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus.</note> Conjugal honour and affection do go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The worship that grew unto her being taken with declaration of this intent, was, that her children became by this mean legitimate and free; her self was made a Mother over his Family: Last of all, she received such advancement of state, as things annexed unto his person might augment her with; yea, a right of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation was thereby given her both in him, and even in all things which were his. This doth somewhat the more-plainly appear, by adding also that other Clause, <hi>With

The Laws of <hi>Romulus</hi> concerning Marriage, are therefore extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led above the rest amongst the Heathens which were before, in that they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the use of certain special Solemnities, whereby the mindes of men were drawn to make the greater conscience of Wedlock, and to esteem the Bond thereof, a thing which could not be without impiety dissolved. If there be any thing in Christian Religion, strong and effectual to like purpose, it is the Sacrament of the holy Eucharist; in regard of the force whereof, <hi>Tertullian</hi> breaketh out into these words, concerning Matrimony therewith sealed, <hi>Unde sufficiam ad enarrandam faeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatem ejus Matrimonii quod Ecclesia conciliat &amp; confirmat Oblatio?

But if there be such store of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, even inestimable, poured every day upon thousands (as indeed the Earth is full of the Blessings of the Lord, which are day by day renewed without number, and above measure) shall it not be lawful to cause solemn Thanks to be given unto God for any benefit, then which greater, or whereunto equal are received, no Law binding men in regard thereof to perform the like duty? Suppose that some Bond there be, that tieth us at certain times to mention publickly the names of sundry our Benefactors. Some of them, it may be, are such, That a day would scarcely serve to reckon up together with them the Catalogue of so many men besides, as we are either more, or equally beholden unto. Because no Law requireth this impossible labor at our hands, shall we therefore condemn that Law, whereby the other being possible, and also dutiful, is enjoyned us? So much we ow to the Lord of Heaven, that we can never sufficiently praise him, nor give him thanks for half those benefits, for which this Sacrifice were most due. Howbeit, God forbid, we should cease performing this duty, when publick Order doth draw us unto it, when it may be so easily done, when it hath been so long executed by devout and vertuous people. God forbid, that being so many ways provoked in this case unto so good a duty, we should omit it, onely because there are other cases of like nature, wherein we cannot so conveniently, or at leastwise do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the same most vertuous Office of Piety.

The end of Funeral duties is, first, to shew that love towards the party deceased, which Nature requireth; then to do him that honor which is fit both generally for man, and particularly for the quality of his person: Last of all, to testifie the care which the Church hath to comfort the living, and the hope which we all have concerning the Resurrection of the dead. For signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of love towards them that are departed, Mourning is not denied to be a thing convenient; as in truth, the Scripture every where doth approve lamentation made unto this end. The Jews by our Saviours tears therefore, gathered in this case, that his love towards <hi>Lazatus</hi> was great. And that as Mourning at such times is fit,<note place="margin">John 11.36.</note> so likewise, that there may be a kinde of Attire suitable to a sorrowful affection, and convenient for Mourners to wear;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s it sufficeth, that the known benefit hereof doth countervail Millions of such inconveniences as are therein surmised, although they were not surmised onely, but found therein. The life and the death of Saints is precious in Gods sight. Let it not seem odious in our eyes, if both the one and the other he spoken of, then especially, when the present occasion doth make mens mindes the more capable of such speech. The care, no doubt, of the living, both to live and to die well must needs be somewhat increased, when they know that their departure shall not be folded up in silence, but the ears of many be made acquainted with it. Moreover, when they hear how mercifully God hath dealt with their Brethren in their last need, besides the praise which they give to God, and the joy which they have of should have by reason of their Fellowship and Communion with Saints; Is not their hope also much confirmed against the day of their own dissolution? Again, the sound of these things doth not so pass the ears of them that are most loose and dissolute in life, but it causeth them one time or other to wish, <hi>O that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my end might be like this!</hi> Thus much peculiar good there doth grow at those times by speech concerning the dead, besides the benefit of publick instruction common unto Funeral with other Sermons. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them whose mindes are through natural affection pensive in such cases, no man can justly mislike the custom which the Jews had to end their Burials with Funeral Banquets, in reference whereunto the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> spake, concerning the people whom God had appointed unto a grievous manner of destruction, saying,<note place="margin">Jere. 16. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That men should not give them the Cup of Consolation to drink for their Father, or for their Mother,</hi> because it should not be now with them, as in peaceable times with others, who bringing their Ancestors unto the Grave with weeping eyes, have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing means wherewith to be re-comforted.<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 6. 1 Chron. 19. 2. Job 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Give Wine,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, unto them that have grief of heart.</hi> Surely, he that ministreth unto them comfortable speech, doth much more then give them Wine. But the greatest thing of all other about this duty of Christian Burial, is an outward testification of the hope which we have touching the Resurrection of the Dead. For which purpose, let any man of reasonable judgment examine, whether it be more convenient for a company of men, as it were, in a dumb show, to bring a Corse to the place of Burial, there to leave it covered with Earth, and so end, or else to have the Exequies devoutly performed with solemn recital of such Lectures, Psalms, and Prayers, as are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely framed for the stirring up of mens mindes unto a careful consideration of their estate, both here and hereafter. Whereas therefore it is objected, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people of God under the Law, nor the Church in the Apostles times, did use any form of Service in Burial of their dead; and therefore, that this order is taken up without any good example or precedent followed therein: First, while the World doth stand, they shall never be able to prove, that all things which either the one or the other did use at Burials, are set down in holy Scripture, which doth not any where of purpose deliver the whole manner and form thereof, but toucheth onely sometime one thing, and sometime another which was in use, as special occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions require any of them to be either mentioned or insinuated. Again, if it might be proved, that no such thing was usual amongst them, hath Christ so deprived his Church of Judgment, that what Rites and Orders soever the latter Ages thereof, have devised, the same must needs be inconvenient? Furthermore, that the Jews before our Saviours coming had any such form of service, although in Scripture it be not affirmed; yet neither is it there denied (for, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orbidding of Priests to be present at Burials, letteth not but that others might discharge that duty, seeing all were not Priests which had rooms of Publick Function in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues) and if any man be of opinion, that they had no such form of Service; thus much there is to make the contrary more probable. The Jews at this day have, as appeareth is their form of Funeral Prayers, and in certain of their Funeral Sermons published; neither are they so affected towards Christians, as to borrow that order from us; besides that, the form thereof is such as both in it sundry
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66185:191"/>
things, which the very words of the Scripture it self doth seem to allude unto, us namely, after departure from the Sepulchre unto the House whence the dead was brought, it sheweth the manner of their Burial-feast, and a consolatory form of Prayer, appointed for the Master of the Synagogue thereat to utter; albeit I may not deny, but it hath also some things which are not perhaps so antsient as the Law and the Prophets. But whatsoever the Jewes custom was before the dayes of our Saviour Christ, hath it once at any time been heard of, the either Church or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man of sound belief did ever judge this a thing unmeet, undecent, unfit for Christianity, till these miserable daies, wherein, under the colour of removing superstitious abuses, the most effectual means, both to testifie and to strengthen true Religion, are plucked at, and in some places even pulled up by the very roots<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And because the nature of things consisting, as this doth, in action, is known by the object whereabout they are conversant, and by the end or scope whereunto they are referred, we must know that the object of this Function in both God and Men; God, in that he is publickly worshipped of his Church; and Men, in that they are capable of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by means which Christian Discipline appointeth. So that the summe of our whole labour in this kinde, is to honour God, and to save men. For whether we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally take, and consider men one by one, or else gather them into one Society and Body, as it hath been before declared, that every man's Religion is in him the Well-spring of all other sound and sincere vertues, from whence both here in some sort, and hereafter more abundantly, their full joy and felicity ariseth; because while they live, they are blessed of God, and when they dye, their works follow them: So at this present we must again call to minde how the very worldly peace and prosperity, the secular happinesse, the temporal and natural good estate both of all Men, and of all Dominions, hangeth chiefly upon Religion, and doth evermore give plain testimony, that as well in this as in other considerations the Priest is a pillar of that Common-wealth, wherein he faithfully serveth God. For if these Assertions be true, first, that nothing can be enjoyed in this present world against his will which hath made all things: secondly, that albeit God doth sometime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the impious to <hi>have,</hi> yet impiety permitteth them not to <hi>enjoy,</hi> no not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral blessings on earth: thirdly, that God hath appointed those blessings to attend as Hand-maids upon Religion: and fourthly, that without the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, Religion by no means can possibly continue, the use and benefit of that sacred Function, even towards all mens worldly happiness, must needs be granted.

The second perhaps may be called in question, except it be perfectly understood. By good things temporal therefore we mean length of daies, health of body, store of friends and well-willers, quietness; prosperous success of those things we take in hand; riches with fit opportunities to use them during life, reputation following us both alive and dead, children, or such as instead of children, we wish to leave Successors and Partakers of our happinesse. These things are naturally every man's desire, because they are good. And on whom God bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same, them we confesse he graciously blesseth; Of earthly blessings the meanest is wealth, reputation the chiefest. For which cause we esteem the gain of honour an ample recompence for the losse of all other worldly benefits. But for as much as in all this there is no certain perpetuity of goodnesse, nature hath taught to affect these things, not for their own sake, but with reference and relation to somewhat independently good, as is the exercise of vertue and speculation of truth.

Between trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and quiet dayes we should make no difference, if the one did not hinder and interrupt, the other uphold our liberty of action.

For greatness delighteth to shew it self by effects of power, and baseness to help it self with shifts of malice. For which cause, a moderate, indifferent temper, between fulness of bread, and emptiness hath been evermore thought and found (all circumstances duly considered) the safest and happiest for all Estates, even for Kings and Princes themselves. Again, we are not to look, that these things should always concur, no not in them which are accounted happy, neither that the course of men's lives, or of publick affairs should continually be drawn out as an even thred (for that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things will not suffer) but a just survey being made, as those particular men are worthily reputed good, whose vertues be great, and their faults tolerable; so him we may register for a man fortunate, and that for a prosperous and happy State, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving flourished, doth not afterwards feel any tragical alteration, such as might cause them to be a spectacle of misery to others. Besides, whereas true felicity consisteth in the highest operations of that nobler part or man, which sheweth sometime greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not in using the benefits which delight nature, but in suffering what nature can hardless indure, there is no cause why either the loss of good, if it tend to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of better, or why any misery, the issue whereof is their greater praise and honor that have sustained it, should be thought to impeach that temporal happiness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Religion, we say, is accompanied, but yet in such measure, as the several degrees of men may require by a competent estimation, and unless the contrary do more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as it hath done those most Heroical Saints, whom afflictions have made glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In a word, not to whom no calamity falleth, but whom neither misery nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity is able to move from a right minde, them we may truly pronounce fortunate, and whatsoever doth outwardly happen without that precedent improbity, for which it appeareth in the eyes of sound and unpartial Judges to have proceeded from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revenge, it passeth in the number of humane casualties whereunto we are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like subject. No misery is reckoned more than common or humane, if God so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we pass thorow it, and come safe so shore, even as contrariwise, men do not use to think those flourishing days happy, which do end with tears. It standeth therefore with these cautions firm and true, yea, ratified by all mens unfeigned confessions drawn from the very heart of experience, that whether we compare men of note in the world with others of like degree and state, or else the same men with themselves, whether we conferr one Dominion with another, or else the different times of one and the same Dominion, the manifest odds between their very outward condition,

But it may be, the case is now altogether changed, and that in Christian Religion there is not the like force towards Temporal felicity. Search the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of time, look what hath happened by the space of these sixteen hundred years, see if all things to this effect be not Inculent and clear; yea, all things so manifest, that for evidence and proof herein; we need not by uncertain dark conjectures sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise any to have been plagued of God for contempt, or blest in the course of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience towards true Religion, more than onely them, whom we finde in that respect on the one side, guilty by their own confessions, and happy on the other side by all mens acknowledgement, who beholding that prosperous estate of such as are good and vertuous, impute boldly the same to God's most especial favour, but cannot in like manner pronounce, that whom he afflicteth above others, with them he hath cause to be more offended. For Vertue is always plain to be seen, rareness causeth it to be observed, and goodness to be honoured with admiration. As for iniquity and sin, it lyeth, many times hid, and because we be all offenders, it becometh us not to incline towards hard and severe sentences touching others, unless their notorious wickedness did sensibly before proclaim that which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to pass. Wherefore the sum of every Christian man's duty is, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by all means towards that which other men seeing in us may justifie; and what we our selves must accuse, if we fall into it, that by all means we can to avoid, considering especially, that as hitherto upon the Church there never yet fell tempestuous storm, the vapours whereof were not first noted to rise from coldness in affection, and from backwardness is duties of service towards God, so if that which the tears of antiquity have untered concerning this point should be here set down, it were assuredly enough to soften and to mollifie an Heart of steel. On the contrary part, although we confesse with Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> most willingly, that the chiefest happiness for which we have some Christian Kings in so great admiration above the rest, is not because of their long Reign; their calm and quiet departure out of this present life; the settled establishment of their own flesh and blood, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them in Royalty and Power; the glorious overthrow of foreign enemies, or the wise prevention of inward danger, and so secret attempts at home; all which solaces and comforts of this our unquiet life, it pleaseth God oftentimes to bestow on them which have no society or part in the joys of Heaven, giving thereby to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that these in comparison are toys and trifles, farr under the value and price of that which is to be looked for at his hands: but in truth the reason wherefore we most extol their felicity, is, if so be they have virtuously reigned, if honour have

And therefore the Church being the most absolute of all his works, was in reason to be also ordered with like harmony, that what he worketh, might no less in grace than in nature be effected by hands and instruments duly subordinated unto the power of his own Spirit.

They which have once received this power, may not think to put it off and on, like a Cloak, as the weather serveth, to take it, reject and resume it as oft as themselves list; of which prophane and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contempt these latter times have yielded, as of all other kindes of Iniquity and Apostasie, strange examples: but let them know which put their hands unto this Plough, that once consecrated unto God, they are made his peculiar Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ever. Suspensions may stop, and degradations utterly cut off the use or exercise of Power before given, but voluntarily it is not in the power of man to separate and pull asunder what God by his authority coupleth. So that although there may be through mis-desert degradation,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> as there may be cause of just separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after Matrimony; yet if (as sometime it doth) restitution to former dignity, or reconciliation after breach doth happen, neither doth the one nor the other ever iterate the first knot. Much less is it necessary, which some have urged, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the re-ordination of such, as others in times more corrupt did consecrate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. Which Errour already quell'd by Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> doth not now require any other refutation. Examples I grant there are which make for restraint of those men from admittance again into rooms of Spiritual function, whose fall by Heresie, or want of constancy in professing the Christian Faith, hath been once a disgrace to their calling. Nevertheless, as there is no Law which bindeth, so there is no cause that should alwaies lead to shew one and the same severity towards Persons culpable. Goodnesse of nature it self more inclineth to clemency than rigour. And we in other mens offences do behold the plain image of our own imbecillity.

                     <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> may be used to signifie not the Person alone, but the Gift of the Holy Ghost; and we know that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts are not onely abilities to do things miraculous, as to speak with Tongues which were never taught us, to cure Diseases without art, and such like; but also that the very authority and power which is given men in the Church to be Ministers of holy things, this is contained within the number of those Gifts whereof the Holy Ghost is Author; and therefore he which giveth this Power, may say without absurdity or folly, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> such power as the Spirit of Christ hath endued his Church withal, such Power as neither Prince not Potentate, King nor <hi>Caesar</hi> on Earth can give. So that if men alone had devised this form of speech, thereby to expresse the heavenly well-spring of that Power which Ecclesiastical Ordinations do bestow, it is not so foolish but that Wise-men might bear with it. If then our Lord and Saviour himself have used the self-samen form of words, and that in the self-same kinde of action, although there be but the least shew of probability, yea, or any possibility, that his meaning might be the same which ours is, It should teach sober and grave men not to be too venturous in condemning that of folly, which is not impossible to have in it more profoundness of wisdom than flesh and blood should presume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol. Our Saviour after his resurrection from the dead, gave his Apostles their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, saying,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>All power is given me in Heaven and in Earth: Go therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghosts, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. <hi>In sum,</hi> As my Father sent me,<note place="margin">John 20. 21.</note> so send I you.</hi> Whereunto Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth adde farther, that <hi>having thus spoken he breathed on them and said, Receive the Holy Ghost.</hi> By which words he must of likelyhood understand some gift of the Spirit which was presently at that time bestowed upon them, as both the speech of actual delivery in saying <hi>Receive,</hi> and the visible sign thereof, his Breathing did shew. Absurd it were to imagine our Saviour did both to the ear, and also to the very eye, expresse a real donation, and they at that time receive nothing. It resteth then that we search what special grace they did at that time receive. Touching miraculous power of the Spirit, most apparent it is, that as then they received it not, but the promise thereof was to be shortly after performed. The words of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> concerning that Power, are therefore set down with signification of the time to come, <hi>Behold I will send</hi> the promise of my Father upon you, but carry you in the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> untill ye be endued with power from on high. Wherefore, undoubtedly, it was some other effect of the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, in some other kinde which
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:66185:195"/>
our Saviour did then bestow. What other likelier than that which himself doth mention, as it should seem of purpose to take away all ambiguous constructions, and to declare that the Holy Ghost, which he then gave, was an holy and a ghostly authority, authority over the souls of men, authority, a part whereof consisteth in power to remit and retain sinnes? Receive the Holy Ghost? <hi>Whose sinnes server ye remit, they are remitted;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 10. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>whose sinnes ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Whereas therefore the other Evangelists had set down, that Christ did before his suffering promise to give his Apostles the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and being risen from the dead, promised moreover at that time a miracolous power of the Holy Ghost: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth, that he also invested them even then with the power of the Holy Ghost for castigation and relaxation of sinne, wherein was fully accomplished that which the promise of the Keys did import. Seeing therefore that the same power is now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why should the same form of words expressing it be thought foolish? The cause why we breathe not as Christ did on them unto whom he imparted power, is, for that neither Spirit nor Spiritual authority may be thought to proceed from us, who are but Delegates of Assigns to give men possession of his Graces.

Knowing therefore that when we take Ordination, we also receive the presence of the Holy Ghost, partly to guide, direct, and strengthen us in all our wayes, and partly to assume unto it self for the more authority, those actions that appertain to our Place and Calling, can our ears admit such a speech uttered in the reverend performance of that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; or can we at any time renew the memory, and enter into serious cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, but with much admiration and joy? Remove what these foolish words do imply, and what hath the Ministry of God besides wherein to glory? Whereas now, forasmuch as the Holy Ghost, which our Saviour in his first Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations gave, doth no lesse concurr with Spiritual vocations throughout all ages, than the Spirit which God derived from <hi>Moses</hi> to them that assisted him in his Government, did descend from them to their Successors in like Authority and Place, we have for the least and meanest Duties, performed by vertue of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial power, that, to dignifie, grace, and authorize them, which no other Offices on Earth can challenge. Whether we Preach, Pray, Baptize, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, Condemn, give Absolution, or whatsoever, as Disposers of God's Mysteries; ourwords, judgemnts, acts, and deeds are not ours, but the Holy Ghost's. Enough If unfeigaedly and in heart we did believe it, enough to banish whatsoever may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought corrupt, either in bestowing, or in using, or in esteeming the same otherwise than is meet. For prophanely to bestow, or loosely to use, or vilely to esteem of the Holy Ghost, we all in shew and profession abhor. Now because the Ministerie is an Office of dignitie and honour, some are doubtful whether any man may seek for it without offence; or, to speak more properly, doubtful they are not, but rather bold to accuse our Discipline in this respect, as not only permitting, but requiring also ambitious suits, or other oblique waies or means whereby to obtain it. Against this they plead, that our Saviour did stay till his Father sent him, and the Apostles till he them, that the antient Bishops in the Church of Christ were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and patterns of the same modesty. Whereupon in the end they insert, 
<hi>Let see therefore at the length amend that custom of repairing from all parts unto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop at the day of Ordination, and of seeking to obtain Orders; Let the custom of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commendatory Letters be removed; let men keep themselves at home, expecting there the voyce of God, and the authority of such as may call them to undertake charge.</hi> Thus severely they censure and control ambition, if it be ambition which they take upon them to reprehend. For of that there is cause to doubt. Ambition, as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, hath been accounted a Vice which seeketh after Honours inordinately, Ambitious mindes esteeming it their greatest happiness to be admired, reverenced,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66185:195"/>
and adored above others, use all means lawful and unlawful which may bring them to high rooms. But as for the power of Order considered by it self, and as in this case it must be considered, such reputation it hath in the eye of this present World, that they which affect it, rather need encouragement to bear contempt, than deserve blame as men that carry aspiring mindes. The work whereunto this power serveth is commended,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 1.</note> and the desire thereof allowed by the Apostle for good. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less because the burthen thereof is heavy, and the charge great, it commeth many times to pass, that the mindes even of virtuous men are drawn into clean contrary affections; some in humility declining that by reason of hardness, which others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of goodness onely do with servent alacrity cover. So that there is not the least degree in this service, but it may be both in<note n="a" place="margin">

If then the desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be holy, religious, and good, may not the profession of that desire be so likewise? We are not to think it so long good as it is dissembled, and evil if once we begin to open it. And allowing that it may be opened without ambition, what offence, I beseeth you, is there in opening it, there where it may be furthered and satisfied, in case they to whom it appertaineth think meet? In vain are those desires allowed, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment whereof it is not lawful for men to seek. Power therefore of Ecclesiastical order may be desired, the desire thereof may be professed, they which profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that way inclined, may endeavour to bring their desires to effect, and in all this no necessity of evil. Is it the bringing of testimonial Letters wherein so great obliquity consisteth? What more simple, more plain, more harmless, more agreeable with the law of common humanity, than that men where they are not known, use for their easier access the credit of such as can best give testimony of them? Letters of any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction our Church-discipline alloweth not; and these to allow, is neither to require ambitious saings; not to approve any indirect or unlawful act. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> receiving his message at the hands of God, and his charge by heavenly vision, heard the voice of the Lord,<note place="margin">Esay 6. 8.</note> saying, <hi>Whom shall I send, Who shall go for us?</hi> Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he recordeth his own answer, <hi>Then I said, Here Lord I am, send me.</hi> Which in effect is the Rule and Canon whereby touching this point the very order of the Church is framed.</p>
                  <p>The appointment of times for solemn Ordination, is but the publick demand of the Church in the name of the Lord himself,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Whom shall I send, who shall go for us?</hi> The confluence of men, whose inclinations are bent that way, is but the answer thereunto, whereby the labours of sundry being offered, the Church hath freedom to take whom her Agents in such case think meet and requisite. As for the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Saviour Christ who took not to himself this honour to be made our High Priest, but received the same from him which said: <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 5.</note> his waiting, and not attempting to execute the Office till God saw convenient time, may serve in reproof of usurped honours, for as much as we ought not of our own accord to assume dignities, whereunto we are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as Christ was. But yet it should be withal considered, that a proud usurpation without any orderly calling is one thing, and another the bare declaration of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to obtain admittance; which Willingness of minde, I suppose, did not want in him whose answer was to the voice of his heavenly calling, <hi>Behold I am come to do thy will.</hi> And had it been for him, as it is for us, expedient to receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission signed with the hands of men, to seek it, might better have beseemed his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, than it doth our boldness, to reprehend them of Pride and Ambition, that make no worse kinde of suits than by Letters of information. Himself in calling his Apostles prevented all cogitations of theirs that way, to the end it might truly be said of them, <hi>Ye chose not me, but I of mine own voluntary motion made choice of you.</hi> Which kinde of undesired nomination to Ecclesiastical Places hefell divers of the most famous amongst the antient Fathers of the Church in a clean contrary considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For our Saviour's election respected not any merit or worth, but took them which were farthest off from likelihood of fitness; that afterwards their supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ability and performance, beyond hope, might cause the greater admiration;
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:66185:196"/>
whereas in the other, mere admiration of their singular and rare vertues was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why honours were inforced upon them, which they of meekness and modesty did what they could to avoid. But did they ever judge it a thing unlawful to wish or desire the Office, the onely charge and bare Function of the Ministery? Towards which labour, what doth the blessed Apostle else but encourage, saying, <hi>He which desireth it, is desirius of a good work?</hi> What doth he else by such sentences but stir, kindle and inflame ambition; if I may term that desire ambition, which coveteth more to testifie love by painfulness in God's service, than to reap any other benefit? Although of the very honour it self, and of other emoluments annexed to such la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for more encouragement of man's industry, we are not so to conceive nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as if no affection could be cast towards them without offence.

Wherefore, to pass by the name, let them use what dialect they will, whether we call it a Priesthood, a Presbytership, or a Ministery, it skilleth not: Although in truth the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> doth seem more fit, and in propriety of speech more agreeable than <hi>Priest</hi> with the drift of the whole Gospel of Jesus Christ. For what are they that embrace the Gospel but Sons of God? What are Churches but his Families? Seeing therefore we receive the Adoption and state of Sons by their Ministery whom God hath chosen out for that purpose: seeing also that when we are the Sons of God, our continuance is still under their care which were our Progenitors, what better Title could there be given them than the reverend name of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or fatherly Guides? The Holy Ghost throughout the body of the New Testament, making so much mention of them, doth not any where call them Priests. The Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay 66. 21.</note> I grant, doth, but in such sort as the antient Fathers, by way of analogy. <hi>A Presbyter,</hi> according to the proper meaning of the New Testament, <hi>is he unto whom our Saviour Christ hath communicated the power of Spiritual procreation.</hi> Out of twelve Patriarks issued the whole multitude of <hi>Israel</hi> according to the flesh.

For of Presbyters, some were greater, some lesse in power, and that by our Saviour's own appointment; the greater they which received fulness of Spiritual power, the less they to whom less was granted. The Apostle's peculiar charge was to publish the Gospel of Christ unto all Nations, and to deliver them his Ordinances received by <hi>immediate revelation from himself.</hi>

Whereas therefore we finde, that the very first Sermon which the Apostles did publickly make, was, the conversion of above three thousand Souls, unto whom there were every day more and more added, they having no open place permitted them for the exercise of Christian Religion, think we that Twelve were sufficient to teach and administer Sacraments in so many private places, as so great a multitude of People did require? This harvest, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (no doubt) foreseeing, provided accordingly Labourers for it before hand. By which means it came to: pass, that the growth of that Church being so great and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66185:197"/>
so sudden, they had notwithstanding in a readiness Presbyters enough to furnish it. And therefore the History doth make no mention by what occasion Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were instituted in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> onely we read of things which they did, and how the like were made afterwards elsewhere. To these two Degrees appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Lord and Saviour Christ, his Apostles soon after annexed Deacons: Deacons therefore must know, saith <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

A part also of their Office, was attendance upon their Presbyters at the time of Divine Service.<note place="margin">

These onely being the uses for which Deacons were first made, if the Church have sithence extended their Ministery further than the circuit of their labour at the first was drawn, we are not herein to think the Ordinance of Scripture violated, except there appear some prohibition, which hath abridged the Church of that liberty. Which I note chiefly, in regard of them to whom it seemeth a thing so monstrous, that Deacons should sometime be licensed to preach, whose institution was at the first to another end. To charge them for this as men not contented with their own Vocations, and as breakers into that which appertaineth unto others, is very hard. For when they are thereunto once admitted, it is part of their own Vocation, it appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now unto them as well as others; neither is it intrusion for them to do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such sort called, but rather in us it were temerity to blame them for doing it. Suppose we the Office of Teaching to be so repugnant unto the Office of Deaconship, that they cannot concurr in one and the same Person? What was there done in the Church by Deacons, which the Apostles did not first discharge being Teachers? Yea, but the Apostles found the burthen of Teaching so heavy, that they judged it meet to cutt off that other charge, and to have Deacons which might undertake it. Be it so. The multitude of Christians increasing in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and waxing great, it was too much for the Apostles to teach, and to minister unto Tables also. The former was not to be slacked, that this latter might be followed. Therefore unto this they appointed others. Whereupon we may rightly ground this Axiom, that when the subject wherein one man's labours of sundry kindes are imployed, doth wax so great, that the same men are no longer able to manage it sufficiently as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the most natural way to help this, is, by dividing their Charge into slipes, and ordaining of Under-Officers; as our Saviour under twelve Apostle, seventy Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Apostles by his example seven Deacons to be under both. Neither ought it to seem less reasonable, that when the same men are sufficient both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that which they do, and also to undertake somewhat more, a combination be admitted in this case, as well as division in the former. We may not therefore disallow it in the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> were made both Pastors and Readers in Divinity, being men so able to discharge both. To say they did not content themselves with their Pastoral vocations, but brake into that which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to others;<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The antient custome of the Church, was to yield the poor much relief, especially Widows. But as poor people are always querulous and apt to think themselves less respected then they should be, we see that when the Apostles did what they could without hindrance to their weightier business, yet there were which grudged that others had too much, and they too little, the Grecian Widows shorter Commons than the Hebrews. By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostles saw it meet to ordain Deacons. Now tract of time having clean worn out those first occasions, for which the Deaconship was then most necessary, it might the better be afterwards extended to other Services, and so remain, as at this present day, a Degree in the Clergy of God which the Apostles of Christ did institute. That the first seven Deacons were chosen out of the seventy Disciples, is

The Apostles, to the end they might follow teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with more freedom, committed the ministery of Tables unto Deacons. And shall we think they judged it expedient to chuse so many out of those seventy to be ministers unto Tables, when Christ himself had before made them Teachers? It appeareth therefore, how long these three degrees of Ecclesiastical Order have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church of Christ; the highest and largest, that which the Apostles, the next that which Presbyters, and the lowest that which Deacons had.

                     <hi>Timothy,</hi> and others were thus employed. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Evangelists, afterwards in <hi>Trajans</hi> dayes, the History Ecclesiastical noteth that many of the Apostle's Disciples and Scholars which were then alive, and did with singular love of Wisdom affect the Heavenly Word of God, to shew their willing mindes in executing that which Christ first of all requireth at the hands of men, they sold their Possessions, gave them to the Poor, and, betaking themselves to travel, undertook the labour of Evangelists, that is, they pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preached Christ, and delivered the Gospel to them, who as yet had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the Doctrine of Faith. Finally, whom the Apostle nameth Pastors and Teachers, what other were they than Presbyters also, howbeit settled in some certain charge, and thereby differing from Evangelists? I beseech them therefore which have hitherto troubled the Church with questions, about Degrees and Offices of Ecclesiastical Calling, because they principally ground themselves upon two places, that, all partiality laid aside, they would sincerely weigh and examine, whether they have not mis-interpreted both places, and all by surmising incompatible Offices, where nothing is meant but sundry graces, gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which Christ bestowed. To them of <hi>Corinth,</hi> his words are these, <hi>God placed in the Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 28.</note> first of all, some Apostles; Secondly, Prophets; Thirdly, Teachers; after them Powers, then gifts of Cures, Aides Governments, kindes of Languages. Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers? Is there power in all? Have all grace to cure? Do all speak with Tongues? Can all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret? But be you desirous of the better graces.</hi> They which plainly discern first, that some <hi>one general</hi> thing there is which the Apostle doth here divide into all these branches, and do secondly conceive that general to be Church-Offices, besides a number of other difficulties, can by no means possibly deny but that many of these might concurr in one man, and peradventure, in some one all; which mixture not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, their form of discipline doth most shun. On the other side, admit that <hi>Communicants of special infused grace,</hi> for the benefit of Members knit into one body, the Church of Christ, are here spoken of, which was in truth the plain drift of that whole Discourse; and see if every thing do not answer in due place with the fitness, which sheweth easily what is likeliest to have been meane. For why are Apostles the first, but because unto them was granted the Revelation of all Truth from Christ immediately? Why Prophets the second, but because they had of some things knowledge in the same manner? Teachers the next, because whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was known to them it came by hearing, yet God withal made them able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, which every one could not do that was taught. After Gifts of Edification there follow general abilities to work things above Nature, Grace to cure men of bodily Diseases, Supplies against occurrent defects and impediments, Dexterities to govern and direct by counsel; Finally, aptness to speak or interpret foreign tongues. Which Graces, not poured out equally, but diversly sorted and given, were a
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66185:198"/>
cause why not onely they all did furnish up the whole Body, but each benefit and help other. Again, the same Apostle, other-where in like sort,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 7. Psal. 68. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>To every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the gathering together of Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edification of the Body of Christ.</hi> In this place none but gifts of Instruction are exprest. And because of Teachers some were Evangelists which neither had any part of their knowledge by Revelation as the Prophets, and yet in ability to teach were farr beyond other Pastors, they are, as having received one way less than Prophets, and another way more than Teachers, set accordingly between both. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth in neither place respect what any of them were by Office or Power given them through Ordination, but what by grace they all had obtained through miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous infusion of the Holy Ghost. For in Christian Religion, this being the ground of our whole Belief, that the promises which God of old had made by his Prophets concerning the wonderful Gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, wherewith the Reign of the true <hi>Messias</hi> should be made glorious, were immediately after our Lord's Ascension performed, there is no one thing whereof the Apostles did take more often occasion to speak. Out of men thus endued with gifts of the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Conversion to Christian Faith, the Church had her Ministers chosen, unto whom was given Ecclesiastical power by Ordination. Now, because the Apostle in reckoning degrees and varieties of Grace, doth mention Pastors and Teachers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he mention them not in respect of their Ordination to exercise the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, but as examples of men especially enriched with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, divers learned and skilfull men have so taken it, as if those places did intend to teach what Orders of Ecclesiastical Persons there ought to be in the Church of Christ, which thing we are not to learn from thence but out of other parts of holy Scripture, whereby it clearly appeareth, that Churches Apostolick did know but three degrees in the power of Ecclesiastical Order; at the first Apostles, Presbyters, and Deacons; afterwards in stead of Apostles, Bishops, concerning whose Order we are to speak in the seventh Book. There is an errour which beguileth many who doe much intangle both themselves and others by not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Services, Offices,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> Ecclesiastical: the first of which three, and in part the second may be executed by the Laity; whereas none have, or can have the third but the Clergy. Catechists, Exorcists, Readers, Singers, and the rest of like sort, if the nature onely of their labours and pains be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may in that respect seem Clergy-men, even as the Fathers for that cause term them usually Clerks; as also in regard of the end whereunto they were train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, which was to be ordered when years and experience should make them able. Notwithstanding, in as much as they no way differed from others of the Laity longer than during that work of Service, which at any time they might give over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto but admitted, not tyed by irrevocable Ordination, we finde them alwayes exactly severed from that body whereof those three before rehearsed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alone are natural parts. Touching Widows, of whom some men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that if such as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> describeth may be gotten, we ought to retain them in the Church for ever.<note place="margin">T.C.l. 1. p. 191 1 Tim. 5. 9.</note> Certain mean Services there were of Attendance; as about Women, at the time of their Baptism, about the Bodies of the sick and dead, about the necessities of Travellers, Way-faring men, and such like, wherein the Church did commonly life them when need required, because they lived of the Alms of the Church, and were fittest for such purposes; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth therefore, to avoid scandal, require that none but Women well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced and vertuously given, neither any under threescore years of age should be admitted of that number. Widows were never in the Church so highly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Virgins. But seeing neither of them did or could receive Ordination, to make them Ecclesiastical Persons were absurd. The antientest therefore of the Fathers mention those three degrees of Ecclesiastical Order specified, and no moe. <hi>When your Captain</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>that is to say,</hi>

Lay-men</hi> (saith <hi>Optatus</hi>) <hi>yea, or divers of the Ministery it self? To what purpose Deacons, which are in the third, or Presbyters in the second degree of Priesthood, when the very Heads and Princes of all, even certain of the Bishops themselves</hi> were content to redeem life with the loss of Heaven? Heaps of Allegations in a case so evident and plain are needless. I may securely therefore conclude, that there are at this day in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no other than the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Ecclesiastical Order, namely, Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, which had their beginning from Christ, and his blessed Apostles themselves. As for Deans, Prebendaries, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, Arch-deacons, Chancellours, Officials, Commissaries, and such other the like names, which being not found in holy Scripture, we have been thereby through some mens errour thought to allow of Ecclesiastical Degress not known, nor ever heard of in the better ages of former times; all these are in truth but Titles of Office, whereunto partly Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and partly others are in sundry forms and conditions admitted, as the state of the Church doth need degrees of Order, still continuing the same they were from the first beginning. Now what habit or attire doth beseem each Order to use in the course of common life, both for the gravity of his Place, and for Example-sake to other men, is a matter frivolous to be disputed of. A small measure of wisedom may serve to teach them how they should cutt their coats. But seeing all well-ordered Polities have ever judged it meet and fit by certain special distinct Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to sever each sort of men from other when they are in publick, to the end that all may receive such Complements of Civil Honour, as are due to their Roomes and Callings, even where their Persons are not known, it argueth a disproportioned minde in them whom so decent Orders dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please.</p>

We might somewhat marvel, what the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> should mean to say that Covetousness is Idolatry, if the daily practise of men did not shew, that whereas Nature requireth God to be honoured with wealth, we honour for the most part Wealth as God. Fain we would teach our selves to believe, that for worldly goods it sufficeth frugally and honestly to use them to our own benefit, without detriment and hurt of others; or if we go a degree farther, and perhaps convert some small contemptible portion thereof to Charitable uses, the whole duty which we owe unto God herein is fully satisfied. But for as much as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly honour God, unless both our Souls and Bodies be sometime imployed meerly in his Service; Again, sith we know that Religion requireth at our hands the taking away of so great a part of the time of our lives quite and clean from our own business; and the bestowing of the same in his; Suppose we that nothing of our wealth and substance is immediately due to God, but all our own to bestow and spend as our selves think meet? Are not our riches as well his, as the days of our life are his? Wherefore, unless with part we acknowledge his Supream Dominion, by whose benevolence we have the whole, how give we Honour to whom Honour belongeth, or how hath God the things that are God's? I would know what Nation in the World did ever honour God, and not think it a point of their duty to do him honour with their very goods. So that this we may boldly set down as a Principle clear in Nature, an Axiom which ought not to be called in question, a Truth manifest and infallible, that men are eternally bound to honour God with their substance, in token of thankful acknowledgement that all they have is from him. To honour him with our worldly goods, not only by spending them in lawful manner, and by using them without offence, but also by alienating from our selves some reasonable part or portion thereof, and by offering up the same to him as a sign that we gladly confess his sole and Soveraign Dominion over all, is a duty which all men are bound unto, and a part of that very Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; which, as the Law of God and Nature it self requireth, so we are the rather to think all men no less strictly bound thereunto than to any other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty, in as much as the hearts of men do so cleave to these earthly things, so much admire them for the sway they have in the World, impute them so generally either to Nature, or to Chance, and Fortune, so little think upon the Grace and Providence from which they come, that unless by a kinde of continual tribute we
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66185:199"/>
did acknowledge God's Dominion, it may be doubted that short in time men would learn to forget whose Tenants they are, and imagine that the World is their own absolute, free, and independent inheritance. Now, concerning the kinde or quality of gifts which God receiveth in that sort, we are to consider them, partly as first they proceed from us, and partly as afterwards they are to serve for divine uses. In that they are testimonies of our affection towards God, there is no doubt, but such they should be as beseemeth most his Glory to whom we offer them. In this respect the fatness of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice is commended; the flower of all mens increase assigned to God by <hi>Solomon</hi>; the Gifts and Donations of the People rejected as oft as their cold affection to God-ward made their Presents to be little worth. Somewhat the Heathens saw touching that which was herein fit, and therefore they unto their gods did not think they might consecrate any thing which was <hi>impure</hi> or <hi>unsound,</hi>

Whether we give unto God therefore that which himself by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment requireth; or that which the publick consent of the Church thinketh good to allot, or that which every man's private devotion doth best like, in as much as the gift which we offer, proceedeth not only as a testimony of our affection towards God, but also as a mean to uphold Religion, the exercise whereof cannot stand without the help of temporal commodities: if all men be taught of Nature to wish, and, as much as in them lyeth, to procure the perpetuity of good things; if for that very cause we honour and admire their wisdom, who having been Founders of Common-weals, could devise how to make the benefit they lest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them durable; if, especially in this respect, we prefer <hi>Lycurgus</hi> before <hi>Solon,</hi> and the <hi>Spartan</hi> before the <hi>Athenian</hi> Polity, it must needs follow, that as we do unto God very acceptable service in honouring him with our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so our service that way is then most acceptable, when it tendeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity. The first permanent donations of honour in this kinde are Temples. Which works do so much set forward the exercise of Religion, that while the World was in love with Religion, it gave to no sort greater reverence than to whom it could point and say, <hi>These are the men that have built us Synagogues.</hi> But of Churches we have spoken sufficiently heretofore. The next things to Churches are the Ornaments of Churches, memorials which mens devotion hath added to remain in the treasure of God's House, not onely for uses wherein the exercise of Religion presently needeth them, but also partly for supply of future casual necessities, whereunto the Church is on earth subject, and partly to the end, that while they are kept they may continually serve as testimonies, giving all men to understand, that God hath in every Age and Nation, such as think it no burthen to honour him with their substance. The riches first of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God, and then of the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> arising out of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts and Donations, were, as we commonly speak, a <hi>Nemo scit,</hi> the value of them above that which any man would imagine.

There are in <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, many Arguments to shew the great congruity and fitness of this number in things consecrated unto God. But because over-nice and curious speculations become not the earnestnesse of holy things, I omit what might be farther observed, as well out of others, as out of him, touching the quantity of this general sacred Tribute; whereby it commeth to passe, that

Albeit a hedge do onely fence and preserve that which is contained, whereas their Tithes and Offerings did more, because they procured increase of the heap out of which they were taken. God demandeth no such debt for his own need, but for their onely benefit that owe it. Wherefore detaining the same, they hurt not him whom they wrong; and themselves whom they think they relieve, they wound; except men will haply affirm, that God did by fair speeches, and large promises, delude the world in saying, <hi>Bring ye all the Tithes into the Store-house, that there may be meat in mine House,</hi> (deal truly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud not God of his due, but bring all)<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note>

In like manner we give, and we are not the more accepted, because he beholdeth how unwisely we spill our Gifts in the bringing. It is to him which needeth nothing,<note place="margin">Nemo liben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dedit quod non accepit sed expressit. <hi>Sen. de Benef,</hi> l. 1. c. 1.</note> all one whether any thing or nothing be given him. But for our own good, it always behoveth that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we offer up into his hands, we bring it seasoned with this cogitation, <hi>Thou Lord art worthy of all honour.</hi> With the Church of Christ touching these matters, it standeth as it did with the whole World before <hi>Moses.</hi> Whereupon for many years men being desirous to honour God in the same manner, as other vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy Personages before had done, both during the time of their life, and, if farther ability did serve, by such devise as might cause their works of piety to remain always, it came by these means to pass that the Church from time to time, had. Treasure, proportionable unto the poorer or wealthier estate of Christian men. And, assoon as the state of the Church could admit thereof, they easily condescended to think it most natural and most fit, that God should receive, as before, of all men his antient accustomed Revenues of Tithes. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both God and Nature have taught to convert things temporal to eternal u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to provide for the perpetuity of Religion, even by that which is most transitory. For, to the end that, in worth and value, there might be no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing once assigned to such purposes, the Law requireth precisely the best of what we possesse; and, to prevent all dammages by way of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where in stead of natural Commodities, or other rights, the price of them might be taken, the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> determined their rates, and the payments to be alwayes made by the Sickle of the Sanctuary,<note place="margin">Levit. 27. 29.</note> wherein there was great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of weight above the ordinary currant Sickle. The truest and surest way for God to have alwayes his own, is by making him payment in kinde out of the very self-same riches, which through his gracious benediction the earth doth continually yield. This, where it may be without inconvenience, is for every man's Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake. That which commeth from God to us, by the natural course of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which we know to be innocent and pure, is perhaps best accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause least spotted with the stain of unlawful, or indirect procurement. Besides, whereas prices daily change, Nature, which commonly is one, must needs be the most indifferent, and permanent Standard between God and Man. But the main foundation of all, whereupon the security of these things dependeth, as farr as any thing may be ascertained amongst men, is, that the Title and Right which man had in every of them before Donation, doth by the Act, and from the time of any such Donation, Dedication, or Grant, remain the proper pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of God till the World's end, unless himself renounce or relinquish it.

There are in a Minister of God these four things to be considered, his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination which giveth him power to meddle with things sacred, the charge or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church allotted unto him for exercise of his Office; the performance of his Duty, according to the exigence of his Charge; and lastly, the maintenance which in that respect he receiveth. All Ecclesiastical Lawes and Canons which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concern the bestowing or the using of the power of Ministerial Order, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to these four. Of the first we have spoken before at large. Concerning the next, for more convenient discharge of Eclcesiastical Duties, as the body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must needs be severed by divers Precincts, so the Clergy likewise accordingly distributed. Whereas therefore Religion did first take place in Cities, and in that respect was a cause why the name of Pagans, which properly signifieth a Countrey people, came to be used in common speech for the same that Infidels and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were; it followed thereupon that all such Cities had their Ecclesiastical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, consisting of Deacons and of Presbyters, whom first the Apostles or their Delegates the Evangelists, did both ordain and govern. Such were the Colledges of <hi>Ierusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Rome, Corinth,</hi> and the rest, where the Apostles are known to have planted our Faith and Religion. Now because Religion and the cure of Souls was their general charge in common over all that were near about
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:66185:202"/>
them, neither had any one Presbyter his several Cure apart, till <hi>Evaristus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the year 112. began to assign Precincts unto every Church, or Title, which the Christians held, and to appoint unto each Presbyter a certain compasse, whereof himself should take charge alone; the commodiousnesse of this invention caused all parts of Christendom to follow it, and at the length, amongst the rest our own Churches, about the year 636. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came divided in like manner. But other distinction of Churches there doth not appear any in the Apostles Writings, save onely, according to those<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 15 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And from hence hath grown their errour, who, as oft as they read of the duty which Ecclesiastical Persons are now to perform towards the Church, their manner is alwayes to understand by that Church, some particular Congregation, of Parish Church. They suppose that there should now be no man of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Order, which is not tyed to some certain Parish. Because the names of all Church-Officers are words of relation, because a Shepheard must have his Flock, a Teacher his Scholars, a Minister his Company which he ministreth unto, therefore it seemeth a thing in their eyes absurd and unreasonable, that any man should be ordained a Minister, otherwise, than onely for some particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Perceive they not, how by this meane they make it unlawful for the Church to imploy men at all, in converting Nations? For if so be the Church may not lawfully admit to an Ecclesiastical Function, unlesse it tye the party ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto some particular Parish, then surely a thanklesse labour it is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men seek the Conversion of Infidels, which know not Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be as yet divided into their special Congregations and Flocks: But, to the end it may appear how much this one thing amongst many more hath been mistaken, there is first no Precept, requiring that Presbyters and Deacons be made in such sort, and not otherwise. Albeit therefore the Apostles did make them in that order, yet is not their Example such a Law, as, without all exception, bindeth to make them in no other order but that. Again, if we will consider that which the Apostles themselves did, surely, no man can justly say, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we practise any thing repugnant to their example. For by them there was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained onely in each Christian City a Colledge of Presbyters and Deacons to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister holy things. <hi>Evaristus</hi> did a hundred years after the birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ begin the distinction of the Church into Parishes. Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons having been ordained before to exercise Ecclesiastical Functions in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> promiscuously, he was the first that tyed them each one to his own sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that of the two, indefinite Ordination of Presbyters and Deacons doth come more near the Apostles Example, and the tying of them to be made onely for particular Congregations, may more justly ground it self upon the Example of <hi>Evaristus</hi> than of any Apostle of Christ. It hath been the opinion of wise and good men heretofore, that nothing was ever devised more singularly beneficial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's Church, than this which our honourable Predecessors have to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less praise found out by the erecting of such Houses of Study, as those two most famous Universities do contain, and by providing that choise Wits, after reasonable time spent in contemplation, may at the length either enter into that holy Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for which they have been so long nourished and brought up, or else give place, and suffer others to succeed in their rooms, that so the Church may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes furnished with a number of men, whose ability being first known by publick tryal in Church-labours there where men can best judge of them, their calling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards unto particular charge abroad may be accordingly. All this is frustrate, those worthy Foundations we must dissolve, their whole device and religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose which did erect them is made void, their Orders and Statutes are to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66185:203"/>
and disannulled, in case the Church be forbidden to grant any power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, unless it be with restraint to the Party ordained unto some particular Parish or Congregation. Nay, might we not rather affirm of Presbyters and of Deacons, that the very nature of their Ordination is unto necessary local restraint a thing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and repugnant? The Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> doth say of Tutors,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iust.</hi> lib. 1 tir. 14. sect. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Certa rei vel causae tutor dari non potest, quia personae non causae vel rei tutor datur.</hi> He that should grant a Tutorship, restraining his grant to some one certain thing or cause; should do but idlely, because Tutors are given for personal defence generally, and not for managing of a few particular things or causes. So he that ordaining a Presbyter, or a Deacon, should, in the form of Ordination, restrain the one or the other to a certain place, might, with much more reason, be thought to use a vain and a frivolous addition, than they reasonably to require such local restraint, as a thing which must of necessity concurr evermore with all lawfull Ordinations. Presbyters and Deacons are not by Ordination consecrated unto Places, but unto Functions. In which respect, and in no other it is, that sith they are by vertue thereof bequeathed unto God, severed and sanctified to be imployed in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which is the highest advancement that mortal Creatures on Earth can be raised unto, the Church of Christ hath not been acquainted in former Ages with any such propane and unnatural Custom, as doth hallow men with Ecclesiastical Functions of Order onely for a time, and then dismiss them again to the common Affairs of the World. Whereas, contrariwise, from the Place or Charge where that Power hath been exercised, we may be by sundry good and lawful occasions translated, retaining nevertheless the self-same Power which was first given. It is some grief to spend thus much labour in refuting a thing that hath so little ground to uphold it, especially sith they themselves that teach it doe not seem to give thereunto any great credit, if we may judge their mindes by their actions. There are amongst them that have done the work of Ecclesiastical Persons, sometime in the Families of Noblemen, sometime in much more publick and frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; there are that have successively gone through perhaps seven or eight particular Churches after this sort; yea, some that at one and the same time have been, some which at this present hour are, in real obligation of Ecclesiastical duty, and possession of Commodity thereto belonging, even in sundry particular Churches within the Land; some there are amongst them which will not so much abridge their liberty, as to be fastened or tyed unto any place; some which have bound themselves to one place, onely for a time, and that time being once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, have afterwards voluntarily given unto other places the like experience and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of them. All this I presume they would not doe, if their perswasion were as strict as their words pretend. But for the avoiding of these and such other the like confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as are incident unto the cause and question whereof we presently treat, there is not any thing more material, than first to separate exactly the nature of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery from the use and exercise thereof; Secondly, to know that the onely true and proper Act of Ordination is, to invest men with that power which doth make them Ministers by consecrating their Persons to God, and his Service in holy things during term of life, whether they exercise that power or no; Thirdly, that to give them a Title or Charge where to use their Ministery, concerneth not the making, but the placing of God's Ministers; and therefore the Lawes which concern onely their Election or Admission unto place of Charge, are not applyable to infringe any way their Ordination; Fourthly, that as oft as any antient Constitution, Law, or Cannon is alledged, concerning either Ordinations or Elections, we forget not to examine whether the present case be the same which the antient was, or else do contain some just reason for which it cannot admit altogether the same Rules which former Affairs of the Church, now altered, did then require. In the question of making Ministers without a Title, which to doe, they say, is a thing unlawful, they should at the very first have considered what the name of <hi>Title</hi> doth imply, and what affinity or coherence Ordinations have with Titles, which thing observed would plainly have shewed them their own errour. They are not ignorant, that when they speak of a Title, they handle that which belongeth to the placing of a Minister in some charge, that the Place of Charge wherein a Minister doth execute
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66185:203"/>
his Office, requireth some House of God for the People to resote unto, some defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Souls unto whom he there administreth holy things, and some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain allowance whereby to sustain life, that the Fathers at the first named <hi>oratories,</hi> and Houses of Prayer; Titles, thereby signifying how God was interessed in them, and held them as his own Possessions? But because they know that the Church had Ministers before Christian Temples and Oratories were, therefore some of them understand by a Title, a <hi>definite Congregation</hi> of People onely, and so deny that any Ordination is lawful which maketh Ministers, that have no certain Flock to attend: forgetting how the Seventy whom Christ himself did ordain Ministers, had their Calling in that manner, whereas yet no certain Charge could be given them. Others referring the name of a Title, especially to the maintenance of the Minister,<note place="margin">Unlawful to ordain a Minister with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Title. <hi>Abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that every man lawfully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained must bring a Bow which hath two strings, a Title of present Right, and another to provide for future possibility or chance. Into these absurdities and follies they slide by mis-conceiving the true purpose of certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which indeed have forbidden to ordain a Minister without a Title, not that simply it is unlawful so to ordain, but because it might grow to an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, if the Church did not somewhat restrain that liberty. For, seeing they which have once received Ordination; cannot again return into the World, it behoveth them which Ordain, to fore-see how such shall be afterwards able to live, lest their poverty and destitution should redound to the disgrace and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their Calling. Which evil prevented, those very Lawes which in that respect forbid, doe expresly admit Ordinations to be made at large, and without Title, namely, if the Party so ordained have of his own for the sustenance of this life; or if the Bishop which giveth him Orders will finde him competent allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, till some place of Ministration, from whence his maintenance may arise, be provided for him; or if any other fit and sufficient means be had against the danger before mentioned. Absolutely therefore it is not true, that any antient Canon of the Church which is, or ought to be with us in force, doth make Ordinations at large unlawful, and, as the state of the Church doth stand, they are most necessary. If there be any conscience in men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouching that which they write or speak, let them consider, as well what the present condition of all things doth now suffer, as what the Ordinances of former Ages did appoint, as well the weight of those Causes, for which our Affairs have altered, as the reasons in regard whereof our Fathers and Predecessours did sometime strictly and severely keep that, which for us to observe now, is neither meet nor alwayes possible. In this our present Cause and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, whether any not having Title of Right to a Benefice, may be lawfully ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Minister, is it not manifest in the eyes of all men, that whereas the name of a Benefice doth signifie some standing Ecclesiastical Revenue, taken out of the Treasure of God, and allotted to a Spiritual Person, to the end he may use the same, and enjoy it as his own for term of life, unless his default cause Deprivation? The Clergy for many years after Christ had no other Benefices, but onely their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Portions, or monethly Dividends allowed them according to their several degrees and qualities, out of the Common Stock of such Gifts, Oblations, and Tythes, as the servour of Christian Piety did then yield. Yea, that even when Ministers had their Churches and Flocks assigned unto them in several; yet for maintenance of life, their former kinde of allowance continued, till such time as Bishops and Churches Cathedral being sufficiently endowed with Lands, other Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters enjoyed in stead of their first Benefices, the Tythes and Profits of their own Congregations whole to themselves? Is it not manifest, that in this Realm, and so in other the like Dominions, where the tenure of Lands is altogether
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66185:204"/>
grounded on Military Laws, and held as in Fee under Princes which are not made Heads of the People by force of voluntary Election, but born the Soveraign Lords of those whole and intire Territories, which Territories their famous Progenitours obtaining by way of Conquest, retained what they would in their own hands, and divided the rest to others with reservation of Soveraignty and Capital Interest; the building of Churches, and consequently the assigning of either Parishes or Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was a thing impossible without consent of such as were principal Owners of Land; in which consideration, for their more encouragement hereunto, they which did so farr benefit the Church, had by common consent granted (as great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and reason was) a right for them and their Heirs till the Worlds end, to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in those Benefices men whose quality the Bishop allowing might admit them thereunto? Is it not manifest, that from hence inevitably such inequality of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes hath grown, as causeth some through the multitude of people which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto one Church, to be more than any one man can welld, and some to be of that nature by reason of Chappels annex'd, that they which are Incumbents should wrong the Church, if so be they had not certain Stipendaries under them, because where the Crops of the Profit or Benefice is but one, the Title can be but one man's, and yet the charge may require more? Not to mention therefore any other reason whereby it may clearly appear how expedient it is, and profitable for this Church to admit Ordinations without Title, this little may suffice to declare, how impertinent their allegations against it are out of antient Canons, how untrue their confident asseverations, that onely through negligence of Popish Prelates the custom of making such kinde of Ministers hath prevailed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Canons, and that with us it is expresly against the Laws of our own Government, when a Minister doth serve as a Stipendary Curate, which kinde of Service neverthelesse the greatest Rabbins of that part doe altogether fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For howsoever they are loath peradventure to be named Curates, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaries they are, and the labour they bestow is in other mens Cures; a thing not unlawfull for them to doe, yet unseemly for them to condemn which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it. I might here discover the like over-sight throughout all their Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, made in behalf of the Peoples pretended right to elect their Ministers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishop may lawfully ordain. But because we have otherwhere at large disputed of popular Elections, and of the right of Patronage, wherein is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatsoever the people under any pretence of colour may seem to challenge about Admission and Choyce of the Pastours that shall feed their Souls, I cannot see what one Duty there is which alwayes ought to goe before Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely care of the Partie's worthinesse, as well for integrity and vertue, as knowledge, yea; for vertue more: in as much as defect of knowledge may sundry wayes be supplyed, but the scandal of vicious and wicked life is a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil.</p>

The truth is, that of all things hitherto mentioned, the greatest is that three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold blott or blemish of notable ignorance, unconscionable absence from the Cures whereof men have taken charge, and unsatiable hunting after Spiritual preferments without either care or conscience of the publick good.

the Word rightly, because also the Lord himself hath protested, they shall be no Priests to him which have rejected knowledge, and because if the blince lead the Blinde, they must both needs fall into the Pit; the second, because Teachers are Shepherds, whose Flocks can be at no time secure from danger; they are Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom the Enemy doth alwayes besiege, their labours in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments admit no intermission; their duty requireth instruction and conference with men in private; they are the living Oracles of God, to whom the People must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort for counsel; they are commanded to be Patterns of Holiness, Leaders, Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Supervisors amongst their own; it should be their grief, as it was the Apostles, to be absent, though necessarily, from them over whom they have taken charge; finally, the last, because Plurality and Residence are opposite, because the placing of one Clark in two Churches is a point of Merchandize and filthy gain, because no man can serve two Masters, because every one should remain in that Vocation whereto he is called; What conclude they of all this? Against Ignorance, against Non-residence, and against Plurality of Livings, is there any man so raw and dull, but that the Volumes which have been written, both of old and of late, may make him in so plentiful a cause eloquent? For if by that which is generally just and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, we measure what knowledge there should be in a Minister of the Gospel of Christ; the Arguments which Light of Nature offereth; the Laws and Statutes which Scripture hath; the Canons that are taken out of antient Synods; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and Constitutions of sincerest Times; the Sentences of all Antiquity; and in a word, even every man's full consent and conscience is against Ignorance in them that have Charge and Cure of Souls. Again, what availeth it if we be Learned and not Faithful? or what benefit hath the Church of Christ, if there be in us suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency without endeavour or care to do that good which our place exacteth? Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pains and industry therefore, wherewith men are in conscience bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the work of their Heavenly Calling, even as much as in them lyeth, bending thereunto their whole endeavour, without either fraud, sophistication, or guile; I see not what more effectual Obligation or Bond of Duty there should be urged, than their own onely Vow and Promise made unto God himself, at the time of their Ordination. The work which they have undertaken requireth both care and fear. Their sloth that negligently perform it maketh them subject to malediction. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we also know that the fruit of our pains in this Function is life both to our selves and others. And doe we yet need incitements to labour? Shall we stop our ears both against those conjuring exhortations which Apostles, and against the fearful comminations which Prophets, have uttered out of the mouth of God; the one for prevention, the other for reformation of our sluggishness in this behalf?

The residence of Ministers upon their own peculiar Charge, is by so much the rather necessary; for that absenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the place where they ought to labour, they neither can do the good which is looked for at their hands, nor reap the comfort which sweetneth life to them that spend it in these cravels upon their own.

wholly, or us but in part, and according to the rate of a general regard. As for plurality, it hath not onely the same inconveniencies which are observed to grow by absence; but over and besides, at the least in common construction, a shew of that worldly humour which men do think should not raign so high. Now from hence their Collections are, as followeth, first, a repugnancy or contradiction between the Principles of common right, and that which our Laws in special considerations have allowed: secondly, a nullitie or frustration of all such acts, as are by them sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed opposite to those Principles, and invalidity in all Ordinations of men unable to preach, and in all dispensations which mitigate the Law of Common right for the other two:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Abstract. p</hi> 117</note> And why so? Forsooth, because whatsoever we do in these three cases, and not by vertue of Common-right, we must yield it of necessity done by warrant of peculiar right or priviledge. Now a Priviledge is said to be that, that for favour of certain persons commeth forth against Common-right; things prohibited are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with, because things permitted are dispatched by Common-right, but things forbidden require Dispensations. By which descriptions of a Priviledge and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation it is (they say) apparent, that a Priviledge must licence and authorize the same, which the Law against ignorance, non-residence, and plurality doth infringe; and so be a Law contrariant or repugnant to the Law of Nature, and the Law of God, because all the reasons whereupon the Positive Law of man against these three was first established, are taken and drawn from the Law of Nature, and the Law of God. For answer whereunto, we will but lead them to answer themselves. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they will grant (as they must) that all direct oppositions of speech require one and the self-same subject, to be meant on both parts where opposition is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it will follow that either the Maxims of Common right do inforce <hi>the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same things</hi> not to be good which we say are good, grounding our selves on the reasons, by vertue whereof our priviledges are established; or if the one doe not reach unto that particular subject for which the other have provided, then is there no contradiction between them. In all contradictions, if the one part be true, the other eternally must be false. And therefore if the Principles of Common right, do at any time truly inforce <hi>that particular</hi> not to be good, which Priviledges make good, it argueth invincibly, that such priviledges have been grounded upon errour. But to say, that every Priviledge is opposite unto the Principles of Common right, because it dispenseth with that which Common right doth prohibite, hath gross ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity. For the voyce of Equity and Justice is, that a general Law doth never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from a special Priviledge; whereas if the one were contrariant to the other, a general Law being in force should alwayes dissolve a Priviledge. The reason why many are deceived by imagining that so it should doe, and why men of better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight conclude directly it should not, doth rest in the <hi>subject</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> it self, which matter <hi>indefinitely</hi> considered in Laws of Common right, is in Priviledges considered as <hi>beset and limited with special circumstances,</hi> by means whereof to them which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it, but by way of generality, it seemeth one and the same in both, although it be not the same, if once we descend to particular consideration thereof. Precepts do alwayes propose perfection, not such as none can attain unto, for then in vain should we ask or require it at the hands of men, but such perfection as all men must aim at; to the end that as largely as human providence and care can extend it, it may take place. Moral laws are the rules of Politick; those Politick, which are made to order the whole Church of God, rules unto all particular Churches; and the Laws of every particular Church, Rules unto every particular man, within the body of the same Church; Now, because the higher we ascend in these Rules, the further still we remove from those specialities, which being proper to the subject, whereupon our actions must work, are therefore chiefly considered by us, by them least thought upon that wade altogether in the two first kindes of general directions, their judgment cannot be exact and sound, concerning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laws of Churches, or actions of men in particular, because they determine of effects by a part of the causes onely out of which they grow, they judge conclusions by demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premises and half-principles, they lay them in the balance stript from those necessary material circumstances which should give them weight, and by shew of falling uneven with the scale of most universal and abstracted rules, they pronounce that too light which is not, if they had the skill to weigh it. This is the reason why men altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:66185:205"/>
conversant in study do know how to teach, but not how to govern; men expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced contrariwise govern well, yet know not which way to set down orderly the precepts and reasons of that they do. He that will therefore judge rightly of things done, must joyn with his forms and conceits of general speculation, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein our actions are conversant. For by this shall appear what equity there is in those Priviledges and peculiar grants or favours, which otherwise will seem repugnant to justice, and because in themselves considered, they have a shew of repugnancy; this deceiveth those great Clerks, which hearing a Priviledge defined to be <hi>an especial right brought in by their power and authority, that make it for some publick benefit against the general course of reason,</hi>

For inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the hand of Justice must distribute to every particular what is due, and judge what is due with respect had, no less of particular circumstances than of general rules and axioms; it cannot fit all sorts with one measure, the wills, counsels, qualities and states of men being divers. For example, the Law of Common right bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men to keep their Promises, perform their Compacts, and answer the Faith they have given either for themselves, or others. Notwithstanding he which bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaineth with one under years, can have no benefit by this allegation, because he bringeth it against a Person which is exempt from the Common rule. Shall we then conclude, that thus to exempt certain men from the Law of Common right, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, against Nature, against whatsoever may avail to strengthen and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that Law before alledged, or else acknowledge (as the truth is) that special cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are to be ordered by special rules, that is men grown unto ripe age, disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage themselves by bargaining, yet what they have wittingly done, is strong, and in force against them, because they are able to dispose and manage their own affairs, whereas youth for lack of experience and judgement, being easily subject to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, is therefore justly exempt from the Law of Common-right, whereunto the rest are justly subject. This plain inequality between men of years, and under years, is a cause why Equity and Justice cannot apply equally the same general rule to both, but ordereth the one by Common right, and granteth to the other a special priviledge. Priviledges are either transitory or permanent:<note place="margin">Privilegium personale cum persona extinguitur, &amp;, previle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gium ditum a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of this nature are all immunities and preheminencies, which, for just considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one sort of men enjoyeth above another, both in the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, no man suspecting them of contrariety to any branch of those Laws or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whereupon the general right is grounded. Now there being general Laws and Rules whereby it cannot be denied, but the Church of God standeth bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that the Ministry may be learned, that they which have charge may reside up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and that it may not be free for them in scandalous manner to multiply Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Livings; it remaineth in the next place to be examined, what the Laws of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do admit, which may be thought repugnant to any thing hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alledged, and in what special consideration they seem to admit the same. Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, that to furnish all places of Cure in this Realm, it is not an Army of twelve thousand Learned men that would suffice, nor two Universities that can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways furnish as many as decay in so great a number, nor a fourth part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings with Cure, that when they fall are able to yield sufficient maintenance for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, is it not plain, that unless the greatest part of the People should be left utterly without the publick use and exercise of Religion, there is no remedy but to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ecclesiastical Order, a number of men meanly qualified in respect of Learning? For whatsoever we may imagine in our private Closers, or talk for Communication-sake at our Boords, yea, or write in our Books, through a notional conceit of things needful for performance of each man's duty, if once we come from the Theory of Learning, to take out so many Learned men, let them be diligently viewed, out of whom the choice shall be made, and thereby an estimate made, what degree of skill we must either admit, or else leave numbers utterly destitute of Guides; and I doubt not but that men indued with sense of common equity, will soon discern, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:66185:206"/>
eminent and competent knowledge, we are to descend to a lower step, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge in that degree which is but tolerable. When we commend any man for learning, our speech importeth him to be more than meanly qualified that way; but when Laws do require learning as a quality, which maketh capable of any Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our measure to judge a learned man by, must be some certain degree of learning, beneath which we can hold no man so qualified. And if every man that listeth may set that degree himself, how shall we ever know when Laws are broken, when kept, seeing one man may think a lower degree sufficient, another may judge them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient that are not qualified in some higher degree. Wherefore of necessity either we must have some Judge, in whose conscience they that are thought and pronounced sufficient, are to be so accepted and taken, or else the Law it self is to set down the very lowest degree of fitness that shall be allowable in this kinde. So that the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth grow to this issue. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requireth Learning in Presbyters, yea such Learning as doth inable them to exhort in Doctrine which is sound, and to disprove them that gain-say it. What measure of ability in such things shall serve to make men capable of that kinde of Office, he doth not himself precisely determine, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth it to the Conscience of <hi>Titus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9.</note> and others, which had to deal in ordaining Presbyters. We must therefore of necessity make this demand, whether the Church, lacking such as the Apostle would have chosen, may with good conscience take out of such as it hath in a meaner degree of fitness, them that may serve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the service of publick Prayer, to minister the Sacraments unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to solemnize Marriage, to visit the Sick, and bury the Dead, to instruct by reading, although by Preaching they be not as yet so able to benefit and feed Christ's flock. We constantly hold, that in this case the Apostles Law is not broken. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth more in Presbyters than there is found in many whom the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alloweth. But no man being tyed unto impossibilities, to do that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we are not bound. It is but a stratagem of theirs therefore, and a very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect practise, when they publish large declamations to prove that Learning is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Ministry, and to make the silly people believe that the contrary is maintained by the Bishops, and upheld by the Laws of the Land; whereas the question in truth is not whether Learning be required, but whether a Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is not sufficient store of Learned men to furnish all Congregations, should do better to let thousands of Souls grow savage, to let them live without any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick service of God, to let their Children dye unbaptised, to with-hold the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the other Sacrament from them, to let them depart this World like Pagans, without any thing, so much as readd unto them, concerning the way of life, than, as it doth in this necessity, to make such Presbyters as are so farr forth sufficient, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they want that ability of Preaching which someothers have. In this point therefore we obey necessity, and of two evils we take the less; in the rest a publick utility is sought, and in regard thereof some certain inconveniencies tolerated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are recompenced with greater good. The Law giveth liberty of Non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence for a time to such as will live in Universities, if they faithfully there labour to grow in knowledge, that so they may afterwards the more edifie and the better instruct their Congregations. The Church in their absence is not destitute, the Peoples salvation not neglected for the present time, the time of their absence is in the intendment of Law bestowed to the Churches great advantage and benefit, those necessary helps are procured by it, which turn by many degrees more to the Peoples comfort in time to come, than if their Pastours had continually abidden with them. So that the Law doth hereby provide in some part to remedy and help that evil which the former necessity hath imposed upon the Church. For compare two men of equal meanness, the one perpetually resident, the other absent for a space, in such sort as the Law permitteth. Allot unto both some nine years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Cure of Souls. And must not three years absence in all probability and likelihood make the one more profitable than the other unto God's Church, by so much as the increase of his knowledge, gotten in those three years, may adde unto six years travel following? For the greater ability there is added to the instrument, wherewith it pleaseth God to save Souls, the more facility and expedition it hath to work that which is otherwise hardlier effected. As much may be said touching
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66185:206"/>
absence granted to them that attend in the families of Bishops; which Schools of gravity, discretion, and wisedom, preparing men against the time that they come to reside abroad, are, in my poor opinion, even the fittest places that any ingenious minde can with to enter into, between departure from private study and access to a more publick charge of Souls; yea no less expedient, for men of the best sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and most maturity in knowledge, than the very Universities themselves are for the ripening of such as be raw. Imployment in the Families of Noble-men, or in Princes Courts, hath another end, for which the self-same leave is given, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great respect to the good of the whole Church. For assuredly, whosoever doth well observe, how much all inferiour things depend upon the orderly courses and motions of those greater Orbes, will hardly judge it either meet or good, that the Angels assisting them should be driven to betake themselves unto other stations, although by nature they were not tyed where now they are, but had charge also elsewhere, as long as their absence from beneath might but tolerably be supplyed, and by descending their rooms above should become vacant. For we are not to dream in this case of any platform, which bringeth equally high and low unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, nor of any constraint to maintain at their own charge men suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for that purpose; the one so repugnant to the Majesty and Greatness of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nobility, the other so improbable and unlikely to take effect, that they which mention either of both, seem not indeed to have conceived what either is. But the eye of Law is the eye of God, it looketh into the hearts and secret dispositions of men, it beholdeth how far one star differeth from another in glory, and, as mens several degrees require, accordingly it guideth them; granting unto principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages priviledges correspondent to their high Estates, and that not onely in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but even in Spiritual Affairs, to the end they may love that Religion the more, which no way seeketh to make them vulgar, no way diminisheth their dignity and greatness, but to do them good doth them honour also, and by such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favours teacheth them to be in the Church of God the same which the Church of God esteemeth them, more worth than thousands. It appeareth therefore in what respect the Laws of this Realm have given liberty of non-residence to some, that their knowledge may be increased, and their labours by that mean be made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the more profitable to others, left the Houses of Great-men should want that daily exercise of Religion, wherein their example availeth as much, yea many times peradventure more than the Laws themselves, with the common sort. A third thing respected both in permitting absence, and also in granting to some that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of addition or plurality, which necessarily inforceth their absence, is a meer both just and conscionable regard, that as men are in quality, and as their services are in weight for the publick good, so likewise their rewards and encouragements by special priviledge of Law might somewhat declare how the State it self doth accept their pains, much abhorring from their bestial and savage rudeness, which think that Oxen should onely labour, and Asses feed. Thus to Readers in Universities, whose very Paper and Book-expences, their antient allowances and stipends at this day do either not, or hardly sustain; to Governours of Colledges, lest the great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of charges necessarily inforced upon them, by reason of their place, and very slenderly supplyed, by means of that change in the present condition of things, which their Founders could not fore-see; to men called away from their Cures, and imployed in weightier business, either of the Church or Common-wealth, because to impose upon them a burthen which requireth their absence, and not to release them from the duty of Residence, were a kinde of cruel and barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; to Residents in Cathedral Churches, or upon Dignities Ecclesiastical, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as these being rooms of greater Hospitality, places of more respect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence than the rest, they are the rather to be furnished with men of best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the men for their qualities-sake, to be favoured above others: I say unto all these, in regard of their worth and merit, the Law hath therefore given leave while themselves bear weightier burthens, to supply inferiour by deputation; and in like consideration partly, partly also by way of honour to Learning, Nobility and Authority permitteth, that men which have taken Theological degrees in Schools, the Suffragans of Bishops, the Houshold-Chaplains of men of Honour, or in great
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66185:207"/>
Offices, the Brethren and Sonnes of Lords Temporal, or of Knights, if God shall move the hearts of such to enter at any time into Holy Orders, may obtain to themselves a faculty or licence to hold two Ecclesiastical Livings, though having Cure; any Spiritual Person of the Queens Councel, three such Livings; her Chaplains, what number of promotions her self in her own Princely wisedom thinketh good to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon them. But, as it fareth in such cases, the gap which for just considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we open unto some, letteth in others through corrupt practises, to whom such favours were neither meant, nor should be communicated. The greatness of the Harvest, and the scarcity of able Work-men hath made it necessary, that Law should yield to admit numbers of men but slenderly and meanly qualified. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because whom all other worldly hopes have forsaken, they commonly reserve Ministerial Vocation, as their last and surest refuge ever open to forlorn men; the Church that should nourish them, whose service she needeth, hath obtruded upon her their service, that know not otherwise how to live and sustain themselves. These finding nothing more easie than means to procure the writing of a few lines to some one or other which hath authority; and nothing more usual than too much facility in condescending unto such requests; are often received into that Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereunto their unworthiness is no small disgrace.

                     <hi>He that will undertake so weighty a charge, had need to be a man of great understanding, rarely assisted with Divine grace, for integrity of manners, purity of life, and for all other vertues, to have in him more than a man</hi>; But surely this I will say with <hi>Chrysostom, We need not doubt whether God be highly displeased with us, or what the cause of his anger, is, if things of so great fear and holiness at are the least and lowest duties of his service, be thrown wilfully on them whose not onely mean, but bad and scandalous quality doth defile whatsoever they handle.</hi> These eye-sores and blemishes, in continual attendants about the Service of God's Sanctuary, do make them every day fewer that willingly resort unto it, till at length all affection and zeal towards God be extinct in them through a wearisom contempt of their Persons, which for a time onely live by Religion, and are for recompence, in fine, the death of the Nurse that feedeth them. It is not obscure, how incommodious the Church hath found both this abuse of the liberty, which Law is enforced to grant; and not onely this, but the like abuse of that favour also, which Law in other considerations already mentioned, affordeth toucheth Residence and plurality of Spiritual Livings. Now that which is practised corruptly to the detriment and hurt of the Church, against the purpose of those very Laws, which notwithstanding are pretended in defence and justification thereof, we must needs acknowledge no less repugnant to the grounds and principles of Common right, than the fraudulent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Tyrants, to the principles of just Soveraignty.

                     <hi>Ye know that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and them that are with me.</hi> What think we? Did the Apostle any thing opposite herein, or repugnant to the Rules and Maxims of the Law of Nature? The self-same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that accord his actions with the Law of Nature, shall declare our Priviledges and his Laws no less consonant. Thus therefore we see, that although they urge very colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the Apostles own Sentences, requiring that a Minister should be able to divide rightly the Word of God, that they who are placed in Charge should attend unto it themselves, which in absence they cannot do, and that they which have divers Cures must of necessity be absent from some, whereby the Law Apostolick seemeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently broken, which Law requiring attendance cannot otherwise be understood,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:66185:207"/>
than so as to charge them with perpetual Residence: Again, though in every of these causes, they infinitely heap up the Sentences of Fathers, the Decrees of Popes, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Edicts of Imperial authority, our own National Laws and Ordinances prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, and grounding evermore their Prohibitions, partly on the Laws of God, and partly on reasons drawn from the light of Nature, yet hereby to gather and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr contradiction between those Laws which forbid indefinitely, and ours which in certain cases have allowed the ordaining of sundry Ministers, whose sufficiency for Learning is but mean; Again, the licensing of some to be absent from their Flocks, and of others to hold more than one onely Living which hath Cure of Souls, I say, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude repugnancy between these especial permissions, and the former general prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, which set not down their own limits, is erroneous, and the manifest cause thereof ignorance in differences of matter which both sorts of Law concern. If then the considerations be reasonable, just and good, whereupon we ground whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Laws have by special right permitted; if onely the effects of abused Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges be repugnant to the Maxims of Common right, this main foundation of repugnancy being broken, whatsoever they have built thereupon falleth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to the ground. Whereas therefore, upon surmise, or vain supposal of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition between our special, and the principles of Common right, they gather that such as are with us ordained Ministers, before they can Preach, be neither lawfull, because the Laws already mentioned forbid generally to create such, neither are they indeed Ministers, although we commonly so name them, but whatsoever they execute by vertue of such their pretended Vocation is void<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is crept into the mindes of men, at this day, a secret pernicious and pestilent conceit, that the greatest perfection of a Christian man doth consist in discovery of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens faults, and in wit to discourse of our own profession. When the World most abounded with just, righteous and perfect men, their chiefest study was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of piety, wherein for their safest direction, they reverently hearkened to the Readings of the Law of God, they kept in minde the Oracles and Aphorismes of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which tended unto vertuous life; if any scruple of conscience did trouble them for matter of Actions which they took in hand, nothing was attempted before coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and advice were had, for fear left rashly they might offend.

For which cause they alledge it not so much to that purpose, as to prove that unpreaching Ministers (for so they term them) can have no true nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calling in the Church of God.

If want of Learning and skill to preach did frustrate their Vocation, Ministers ordained before they be grown unto that maturity should receive new Ordination, whensoever it chanceth that study and industry doth make them afterwards more able to perform the Office; than which what conceit can be more absurd? Was not Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> himself contented to admit an Assistant in his own Church, a man of small Erudition, considering that what he wanted in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was supplyed by those vertues which made his life a better Orator, than more Learning could make others whose conversation was less Holy?

To wish that all men were so qualified, as their Places and Dignities require, to hate all sinister and corrupt dealings which hereunto are any lett, to covet speedy redress of those things whatsoever, whereby the Church sustaineth detriment, these good and vertuous desires cannot offend any but ungodly mindes.

The Romans being a People full of generosity, and by nature courteous, did no way more shew their gentle disposition, than by easie condescending to see their Bond-men at liberty. Which benefit in the happier and better times of the Common-wealth, was bestowed for the most part as an ordinary reward of Vertue, some few now and then also purchasing freedom with that which their just labours could gain, and their honest frugality save. But as the Empire daily grew up, so the manners and conditions of men decayed, Wealth was honoured, and Vertue not cared for, neither did any thing seem opprobrious out of which there might arise commodity and profit, so that it could be no marvel in a State thus far degenerated, if when the more ingenious sort were become base, the baser laying aside all shame and face of honesty, did, some by Robberies, Burglaries, and prostitution of their Bodies, gather wherewith to redeem liberty; others obtain the same at the hands of their Lords, by serving them as vile Instruments in those attempts, which had been worthy to be revenged with ten thousand deaths.

                     <hi>Such eye-sores in the Common-wealth have occasioned many vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mindes to condemn altogether the custom of granting liberty to any Bond-slave, for as much as it seemed a thing absurd, that a People which commands all the World should consist of so vile Reffuse.

For which end, at this present, to propose any special inventions of my own, might argue in a man of my Place and Calling more presumption perhaps than wit.

Christ, the safety of men, and the endless good of their own Souls, take heed, lest unnecessarily, and through their default the Church be found worse, or less furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than it might be: Secondly, that they which by right of Patronage have power to present unto Spiritual Livings, and may in that respect much damnifie the Church of God, would, for the ease of their own account in that dreadful day, somewhat consider what it is to betray for gain the Souls which Christ hath redeemed with blood, what to violate the sacred Bond of Fidelity and Solemn promise, given at the first to God and his Church by them, from whose original interest together with the self-same Title of Right, the same Obligation of Duty likewise is descended: Thirdly, that they unto whom the granting of Dispensations is committed, or which otherwise have any stroke in the disposition of such Preferments as appertsin unto Learned men, would bethink themselves what it is to respect any thing either above or besides Merit, considering how hardly the World taketh it, when to men of commendable note and quality there is so little respect had, or so great unto them whose deserts are very mean, that nothing doth seem more strange than the one sort, because they are not accounted of, and the other because they are; it being every man's hope and expectation in the Church of God, especially that the onely purchace of greater rewards should be alwayes greater deserts, and that nothing should ever be able to plant a Thorn where a Vine ought to grow: Fourthly, that honourable Personages, and they, who by vertue of any principal Office in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth are inabled to qualifie a certain number, and make them capable of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours or Faculties above others, suffer not their names to be abused, contrary to the true intent and meaning of wholsom Laws, by men in whom there is nothing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table besides Covetousness and Ambition: Fifthly, that the graver and wiser sort in both Universities, or whosoever they be, with whose approbation the marks and recognizances of all Learning are bestowed, would think the Apostle's caution against unadvised Ordinations not impertinent or unnecessary to be born in minde, even when they grant those degrees of Schools, which degrees are not <hi>gratia gratis da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> kindnesses bestowed by way of humanity, but they are <hi>gratiae gratum sacientes,</hi> favours which always imply a testimony given to the Church and Common-wealth, concerning mens sufficiency for manners and knowledge; a testimony, upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit whereof sundry Statutes of the Realm are built; a testimony so far available, that nothing is more respected for the warrant of divers mens abilitie to serve in the affairs of the Realm; a testimony wherein if they violate that Religion wherewith it ought to be always given, and thereby do induce into errour such as deem it a thing uncivil to call the credit thereof in question, let them look that God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back upon their heads, and cause them in the state of their own Corporations to feel either one way or other the punishment of those harms, which the Church through their negligence doth sustain in that behalf: Finally, and to conclude, that they who enjoy the benefit of any special Indulgence or Favour which the Laws permit, would as well remember what in duty towards the Church, and in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God they ought to do, as what they may do by using of their own advantage whatsoever they see tolerated; no man being ignorant that the cause why absence in some cases hath been yielded unto, and in equity thought sufferable, is the hope of greater fruit through industry elsewhere; the reason likewise wherefore plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are allowed unto men of note, a very soveraign and special care, that as Fathers in the antient World did declare the preheminence of priority in birth, by doubling the worldly portions of their first-born; so the Church by a course not unlike in assigning mens rewards, might testifie an estimation had proportionably of their Vertues,<note place="margin">For the main Hypothesis or foundation of these conclus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, let that before ser down in the 9. be read to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this last the 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of a few Ceremonies, could either have kindled so much fire, or have caused it to flame so long; but that the parties which herein laboured mightily for change and (as they say) for Reformation, had somewhat more then this mark whereat to aim.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore drawn out a compleat Form, as they suppose, of publick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be done to God, and set down their Plot for the Office of the Ministry in that behalf; they very well knew, how little their labours so far forth bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would avail them in the end, without a claim of Jurisdiction to uphold the Fabrick which they had erected; and this neither, likely to be obtained, but by the strong hand of the people, not the people unlikely to favour it; the more, if overture were made of their own Interest, right, and title thereunto. Whereupon there are many which have conjectured this to be the cause, why in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Discipline, (it being manifest that their drift is, to wrest the Key of Spiritual Authority out of the hands of former Governours, and equally to possess therewith the Pastors of all several Congregations) the people first for surer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, and then for better defence thereof, are pretended necessary Actors in those things, whereunto their ability for the most part is as slender, as their title and challenge unjust.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding (whether they saw it necessary for them to perswade the people, without whose help they could do nothing, or else (which I rather think) the affection which they bear towards this new Form of Government, made them to imagin it Gods own Ordinance,) Their Doctrine is, that, by the Law of God, there must be for ever in all Congregations certain Lay-Elders, Ministers of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Jurisdiction, in as much as our Lord and Saviour by Testament (for so they presume) hath left all Ministers or Pastors in the Church Executors equally to the whole power of Spiritual Jurisdiction, and with them hath joyned the people as Colleagues. By maintenance of which Assertion, there is unto that part appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently gained a twofold advantage, both because the people in this respect are much more easily drawn to favour it, as a matter of their own interest; and for that, if they chance to be crossed by such as oppose against them, the colour of Divine Authority, assumed for the Grace and Countenance of that Power in the vulgar sort, furnisheth their Leaders with great abundance of matter behoveful of their encouragement, to proceed alwaies with hope of fortunate success in the end, considering their cause to be as, <hi>David's</hi> was, a just defence of power given them from above, and consequently their Adversaries quarrel the same with <hi>Saul's,</hi> by whom the Ordinance of God was withstood.</p>
                  <p>Now, on the contrary side, if this their surmise prove false; if such, as in Justification whereof no evidence sufficient, either hath been or can be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as I hope it shall clearly appear after due examination and trial) let them then consider whether those words of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> against <hi>Moses,</hi> and against <hi>Aaron,</hi>

                     <p>The Spiritual Power of the Church, being such as neither can be challenged by right of Nature, nor could by humane Authority be instituted, because the forces and effects thereof are Supernatural and Divine; we are to make no doubt or question, but that from him which is the Head, it hath descended unto us that are the Body now invested therewith. He gave it for the benefit and good of Souls, as a mean to keep them in the path which leadeth unto endless fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, a bridle to hold them within their due and convenient bounds, and, if they do go astray, a forcible help to reclaim them: Now although there be no kind of Spiritual Power, for which our Lord Iesus Christ did not give both commission to exercise, and direction how to use the same, although his Laws in that behalf recorded by the holy Evangelists be the only ground and foundation, whereupon the practice of the Church must sustain it self: yet, as all multitudes once grown to the form of Societies are even thereby naturally warranted, to enforce upon their own subjects particularly those things, which publick wisdom shall judge expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the common good: so it were absurd to imagine the Church it self, the most glorious amongst them, abridged of this liberty, or to think that no Law, Constitution or Canon, can be further made, either for Limitation or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification, in the practice of our Saviours Ordinances whatsoever occasion be offered through variety of times, and things, during the state of this inconstant world, which bringeth forth daily such new evills, as must of necessity by new remedies be redrest, did both of old enforce our venerable Predecessor, and will alwaies constrain others, sometime to make, sometime to abrogate, sometime to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and again to abridge sometime; in sum, often to vary alter and change Customs, incident unto the manner of exercising that Power which doth it self continue alwaies one and the same: I therefore conclude, that Spiritual Authority is a Power which Christ hath given to be used over them which are subject unto it for the eternal good of their Souls according to his own most Sacred Laws, and the wholsome positive Constitutions of his Church.</p>

                     <p>The vertue of Repentance in the heart of Man is Gods handy-work, a fruit or effect of Divine Grace, which Grace continually offereth it self, even unto them that have forsaken it, as may appear by the words of Christ in St <hi>Iohns</hi> Revelation, <hi>I stand at the door and knock:</hi> Nor doth he only knock without, but also within assist to open, whereby access and entrance is given to the heavenly presence, of that saving power, which maketh man a repaired Temple for Gods good Spirit again to inhabit. And albeit the whole train of vertues which are implied in the name of Grace, be infused at one instant; yet because when they meet and concurr unto any effect in man, they have their distinct operations rising orderly one from another; It is no unnecessary thing that we note the way or method of the Holy Ghost, in framing mans sinful heart to Repentance: A work, the first foundation whereof is laid by opening and illuminating the eye of Faith, because by Faith are discovered the Principles of this action, whereunto unless the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding do first assent, there can follow in the Will towards Penitency no inclination at all: Contrariwise, the Resurrection of the dead, the Judgement of the World to come, and the endless misery of sinners being apprehended, this worketh fear: such as theirs was, who feeling their own distress and perplexity in that passion, besought our Lords Apostles earnestly to give them counsel what they should do. For, fear is impotent and unable to advise it self; yet this good it hath, that men are thereby made desirous to prevent, if possibly they may, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever evil they dread; The first thing that wrought the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was fear of destruction within fourty daies; signes and miraculous works of God, being extraordinary representations of Divine Power, are commonly wont to stir any the most wicked with terrour, lest the same Power should bend it self against them: And because tractable minds, though guilty of much Sin, are hereby moved to forsake those evil waies which make his power in such sort their astonishment and fear; therefore our Saviour denounced his curse against <hi>Cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> saying, that if <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> had seen that which they did, those signes which prevailed little with the one, would have brought the others to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66185:212"/>
Repentance. As the like thereunto did in the men given to curious Arts, of whom the Apostolick History saith, that <hi>Fear came upon them, and many which had followed vain sciences, burnt openly the very books out of which they had learned the same</hi>; As fear of contumely and disgrace amongst men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other civil punishments, are a bridle to restrain from any hainous Acts, whereinto mens outrage would otherwise break; So the fear of Divine Revenge and punishment where it takes place, doth make men desirous to be rid likewise from that inward guiltiness of Sin, wherein they would else securely continue. Howbeit, when Faith hath wrought a fear of the event of Sin, yet Repentance hereupon ensueth not, unless our belief conceive both the possibility and means to avert evil: The possibility, in as much as God is merciful, and most willing to have Sin cured: The means, because he hath plainly taught what is requisite, and shall suffice unto that purpose. The nature of all wicked men, is, for fear of revenge to hate whom they most wrong? The nature of hatred, to wish that destroyed which it cannot brook; And from hence ariseth the furious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of godless and obdurate sinners, to extinguish in themselves the opinion of God, because they would not have him to Be, whom execution of endless wo doth not suffer them to Love.</p>
                     <p>Every Sin against God abateth, and continuance in Sin extinguisheth, our love towards him: It was therefore said to the Angel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> having sinned, <hi>Thou art fallen away from thy first love</hi>; so that, as we never decay in love till we Sin, in like sort neither can we possibly forsake Sin, unless we first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again to love. What is love towards God, but a desire of union with God? And shall we imagine a Sinner converting himself to God, in whom there is no desire of union with God presupposed? I therefore conclude, that fear worketh no mans inclination to Repentance, till somewhat else have wrought in us love also; Our love and desire of union with God ariseth from the strong conceipt which we have of his admirable goodness: The goodness of God, which particularly moveth unto Repentance, is his mercy towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, notwithstanding Sin: For, let it once sink deeply into the mind of man, that howsoever we have injuried God, his very nature is averse from revenge, except unto Sin we add obstinacy otherwise alwaies ready to accept our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as a full discharge or recompence for all wrongs; and Can we chuse but begin to Love him whom we have offended, or can we but begin to grieve that we have offended him whom we love? Repentance considereth Sin as a breach of the Law of God, an act obnoxious to that revenge, which notwithstanding may be prevented, if we pacifie God in time.</p>
                     <p>The root and beginning of Penitency therefore, is the consideration of our own Sin, as a cause which hath procured the wrath, and a subject which doth need the mercy of God: For unto mans understanding, there being presented, on the one side, tribulation and anguish upon every soul that doth evil: On the other, eternal life unto them which by continuance in well doing, seek Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Immortality; On the one hand a curse to the Children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; On the other, to lovers of righteousness, all grace and benediction: Yet between these extreams, that eternal God from whose unspotted justice and undeserved mercy, the lot of each inheritance proceedeth, is so inclinable, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew compassion then to take revenge, that all his speeches in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are almost nothing else but entreaties of men to prevent destruction by amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their wicked lives; All the works of his providence little other then meer allurements of the just to continue stedfast, and of the unrighteous to change their course; All his dealings and proceedings towards true Converts, as have even filled the grave writings of holy men, with these and the like most sweet sentences: Repentance (if I may so speak) stoppeth God in his way, when being provoked by crimes past, he cometh to revenge them with most just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Yea, it tyeth, as it were, the hands of the Avenger, and doth not suffer him to have his will.

                        </hi> No conclusion such as theirs, Let every man turn from his evil way, but out of premisses such as theirs were, Fear and Love: Wherefore the Well-spring of Repentance is Faith; first breeding Fear, and then Love, which Love causes hope, hope resolution of Attempt: <hi>I will go to my Father, and say, I have sinned against Heaven and against thee</hi>; that is to say, I will do what the Duty of a Convert requireth.</p>
                     <p>Now in a Penitent's or Convert's duty, there are included; first, the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the will from Sin; secondly, the submission of our selves to God, by supplication and Prayer; thirdly, the purpose of a new life, testified with present works of amendment: Which three things do very well seem to be comprised in one definition, by them which handle Repentance, as a vertue that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, bewaileth, and sheweth a purpose to amend Sin: We offend God in thought, word, and deed. To the first of which three, they make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; to the second, Confession; and to the last, our works of Satisfaction, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</p>
                     <p>Contrition doth not here import those sudden Pangs and Convulsions of the mind, which cause sometimes the most forsaken of God, to retract their own doings; it is no Natural passion, or anguish, which riseth in us against our wills; but a deliberate aversion of the Will of Man from Sin, which being alwaies accompanied with grief; and grief oftentimes partly with tears, partly with other external signs; it hath been thought, that in these things, Contrition doth chiefly consist: whereas the chiefest thing in Contrition, is, that alteration whereby the Will which was before delighted with Sin, doth now abhorr and shun nothing more. But forasmuch as we cannot hate Sin in our selves without heaviness and grief, that there should be in us a thing of such hatefull quality, the Will averted from Sin, must needs make the affection suitable; yea, great reason why it should so do: For since the Will by conceiving Sin hath deprived the Soul of Life, and of life there is not recovery without Repentance the death of Sin;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66185:213"/>
Repentance not able to kill Sin, but by withdrawing the Will from it, the Will unpossible to be withdrawn, unless it concur with a contrary affection to that which accompanied it before in evill: Is it not clear, that as an inordinate delight did first begin sin, so Repentance must begin with a just sorrow, a sorrow of heart, and such a sorrow as renteth the heart; neither a feigned nor sleight sorrow; not feigned, blest it increase Sin; nor sleight, lest the pleasures of Sin over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match it<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66185:214"/>
successively, did both use and uphold that Discipline, the end whereof is to heal Mens Consciences, to cure their Sins, to reclaim Offenders from iniquity, and to make them by Repentance just.</p>
                     <p>Neither hath it of Ancient time, for any other respect, been accustomed to bind by Ecclesiastical Censures, to retain so bound till tokens of manifest Repentance appeared, and upon apparent Repentance to Release, saving only because this was received as a most expedient method for the cure of sin.</p>
                     <p>The course of Discipline in former Ages reformed open Transgressors, by putting them into Offices of open Penitence, especially Confession, whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their own crimes in the hearing of the whole Church, and were not from the time of their first Convention capable of the holy Mysteries of Christ, till they had solemnly discharged this duty.</p>
                     <p>Offenders in secret knowing themselves altogether as unworthy to be admitted to the Lords Table, as the other which were with-held; being also perswaded, that if the Church did direct them in the Offices of their Penitency, and assist them with publique Prayer, they should more easily obtain that they sought, than by trusting wholly to their own endeavours; finally, having no impediment to stay them from it but bashfulness, which countervailed not the former inducements; and besides, was greatly cased by the good construction, which the charity of those times gave to such actions, wherein Mens piety and voluntary care to be reconciled to God, did purchase them much more love than their faults (the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of common frailty) were able to procure disgrace, they made it not nice to use some one of the Ministers of God, by whom the rest might take notice of their faults, prescribe them convenient remedies, and in the end after publick Confession, all joyn in Prayer unto God for them.</p>
                     <p>The first beginner of this Custom, had the more followers by means of that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour which alwaies was with good consideration shewed towards voluntary Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents above the rest.</p>
                     <p>But as Professors of Christian belief, grew more in number, so they waxed worse; when Kings and Princes had submitted their Dominions unto the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jesus Christ, by means whereof Persecution ceasing, the Church imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately became subject to those evills which peace and security bringeth forth; there was not now that love which before kept all things in tune, but every where Schisms, Discords, Dissentions amongst Men. Conventicles of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, bent more vehemently against the sounder and better sort than very Infidels and Heathens themselves; faults not corrected in Charity, but noted with delight, and kept for malice to use when the deadliest opportunities should be offered.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, forasmuch as publick Confessions became dangerous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the safety of well-minded Men, and in divers respects advantagious to the Enemies of Gods Church; it seemed first unto some, and afterwards generally requisite, that voluntary Penitents should surcease from open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it shall win the more Repentance, if the Consciences of Sinners be not emptied into the peoples ears</hi>; And to this only cause doth <hi>Sozomen</hi> impure the change, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> made, by ordaining throughout all Churches certain <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> to take the Confessions, and appoint the Penances of secret offenders. <hi>Socrates,</hi> (for this also may be true that more inducements then one, did set forward an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration so generally made) affirmeth the <hi>Grecians</hi> (and not unlikely) to have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially respected therein the occasion, which the <hi>Novatianists</hi> took at the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of publick Penitents, to insult over the Discipline of the Church, against which they still cryed out, wheresoever they had time and place, <hi>He that sheweth Sinners favour, doth but teach the innocent to Sin</hi>: And therefore they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves admitted no man to their Communion upon any Repentance, which once was known to have offended after Baptism, making Sinners thereby not the fewer, but the closer, and the more obdurate, how fair soever their pretence might seem.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> Canon, for some one Presbyter in every Church to undertake the charge of Penitency, and to receive their voluntary Confessions, which had sinned after Baptism; continued in force for the space of above some hundred years, till <hi>Nectarius,</hi> and the Bishops of Churches under him begun a second al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, abolishing even that Confession which their <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> took in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. There came to the <hi>Penitentiary</hi> of the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a certain Gentlewoman, and to him she made particular Confession of her faults committed after Baptism, whom thereupon he advised to continue in Fasting and Prayer, that as with tongue she had acknowledged her Sins, so there might appear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in her some work worthy of Repentance: But the Gentlewoman goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and detecteth her self of a crime, whereby they were forced to dis-robe an Ecclesiastical person, that is, to degrade a Deacon of the same Church. When the matter by this mean came to publick notice, the people were in a kind of tumult offended, not onely at that which was done, but much more, because the Church should thereby endure open infamy and scorn. The Clergy was perplexed and altogether doubtfull what way to take, till one <hi>Eudemon</hi> born in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but at that time a Priest in the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> considering that the causes of voluntary Confession whether publick or private, was, especially to seek the Churches ayd as hath been before declared, lest men should either not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with others, or wittingly hazard their Souls, if so be they did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and that the inconvenience which grew to the whole Church was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise exceeding great, but especially grievous by means of so manifold offensive detections, which must needs be continually more, as the world did it self wax continually worse, for Antiquity together with the gravity and severity thereof (saith <hi>Sozomen</hi>) had already begun by little and little to degenerate into loose and careless living, whereas before offences were less, partly through bashfulness in them which open their own faults, and partly by means of their great austerity, which sate as judges in this business; these things <hi>Eudaemon</hi> having weighed with himself, resolved easily the mind of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> that the <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> office must be taken away, and for participation in Gods holy mysteries every man be left to his own Conscience, which was, as he thought, the onely means to free the Church from danger of Obloquie and Disgrace. Thus much (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) <hi>I am the bolder to relate, because I received it from</hi> Eudaemons <hi>own mouth, to whom mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was at that time; Whether your counsel, Sir, have been for the Churches good, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, God knoweth.

His speech to <hi>Eudemon</hi> before set down, is proof sufficient that he writeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what was famously known to all, and what himself did wish had been otherwise. As for <hi>Sozomen</hi> his correspondency with Hereticks; having shewed to what end the Church did first ordain <hi>Penitentiaries,</hi> he addeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that <hi>Novatianists,</hi> which had no care of Repentance, could have no need of this Office. Are these the words of a Friend or Enemy? Besides, in the entrace of that whole Narration: <hi>Not to sinne</hi> (saith he) <hi>at all, would require a Nature more divine than ours is: But, God hath commanded to pardon Sinners; yea, although they transgresse and offend often.</hi> Could there be any thing spoken more directly opposite to the Doctrine of <hi>Novatian</hi>? <hi>Eudaemon</hi> was Presbyter under <hi>Nectarius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>Novatianists</hi> the Emperour gave liberty of using their Religion quietly by themselves, under a Bishop of their own, even within the City, for that they stood with the Church in defence of the Catholick Faith against all other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks besides. Had therefore <hi>Eudaemon</hi> favoured their heresie; their Camps were not pitched so farr off, but he might at all times have found easie accesse unto them. Is there any man that hath lived with him, and hath touched him that way? if not, why suspect we him more than <hi>Nectarius</hi>? Their report touching Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Catholick Bishops, who gave approbation to that which was done, and did also the like themselves in their own Churches, we have no reason to discredit without some manifest and clear evidence brought against it. For of Catholick Bishops, no likelihood but that their greatest respect to <hi>Nectarius,</hi> a man hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in those parts no lesse than the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> himself in the Western Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, brought them both easily and speedily unto conformity with him, <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Eunomians, Apollinarians,</hi> and the rest that stood divided from the Church, held their <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> as before. <hi>Novatianists</hi> from the beginning had never any, because their opinion touching Penitency, was against the practice of the Church therein, and a cause why they severed themselves from the Church; so that the very state of things, as they then stood, giveth great shew of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66185:219"/>
to his speech, who hath affirmed, <hi>That they onely which held the Sonne consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial with the Father, and Novatianists which joyned with them in the same Opinion, had no Penitentiaries in their Churches; the rest retained them.</hi> By this it appeareth therefore how <hi>Baronius</hi> finding the Relation plain, that <hi>Nectarius</hi> did abolish even those private secret Confessions which the People had been before accustomed to make to him that was <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> laboureth what he may to discredit the Authors of the Report, and to leave it imprinted in mens mindes, that whereas <hi>Nectarius</hi> did but abrogate publick Confession, <hi>Novatianists</hi> have maliciously for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the abolition of Private, as if the oddes between these two were so great in the ballance of their Judgement, which equally hated or contemned both; or, as if it were not more clear than light, that the first alteration which established <hi>Penitentiaries,</hi> took away the burthen of Publick Confession in that kinde of Penitents; and therefore the second must either abrogate Private, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore finding that against the Writers of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is but in vain to stand upon so doubtful terms, and exceptions, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth mightily to prove, even by their report, no other Confession taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then Publick which <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> used in Private, to impose upon Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offenders; <hi>For why? It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>very certain that the Name of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the Fathers Writings signifieth onely Publick Penitents; certain, that to hear the Confessions of the rest now more than one could possibly have done; certain, that</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen, <hi>to shew how the Latine Church retained in his time what the Greek had clean cast off, declareth the whole Order of Publick Penitency used in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but of Private he maketh no mention.</hi> And, in these Considerations, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will have it the meaning both of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Episcopal Constitution, which first did erect <hi>Penitentiaries,</hi> could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any other Offenders, than such as Publickly had sinned after Baptisme. That onely they, were prohibited to come to the Holy Communion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they did first in secret confesse all their Sinnes to the <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> by his appointment openly acknowledge their open Crimes, and doe publick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for them: That whereas before <hi>Novatian</hi>'s uprising, no man was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to confesse publickly any Sinne, this Canon enforced Publick Offenders thereunto, till such time as <hi>Nectarius</hi> thought good to extinguish the Practice thereof.</p>

                        <hi>It seemeth good</hi> (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) <hi>to put down the office of these Priests which had charge of Penitency; what charge that was, the kindes of Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then usual must make manifest.</hi> There is often speech in the Fathers Writings, In their Books frequent mention of Penitency; exercised within the Chambers of our Heart, and seen of God, and not communicated to any other, the whole charge of which Penitency is imposed of God, and doth rest upon the Sinner himself. But if Penitents in secret, being guilty of Crimes whereby they knew they had made themselves unfit Guests for the Table of our Lord, did seek di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for their better performance of that which should set them clear; it was in this case the <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> Office to take their Confessions, to advise them the best way he could for their Souls good, to admonish them, to counsel them, but not to lay upon them more than private Penance. As for notorious wicked Persons, whose Crimes were known, to convict, judge, and punish them, was the Office of the Ecclesiastical Consistory; <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> had their Institution to another end: But unlesse we imagine that the antient time knew no other Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then publick, or that they had little occasion to speak of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or else that in speaking thereof they used continually some other Name, and not the name of Repentance whereby to express private Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, how standeth it with reason, that whensoever they write of Penitents, it should be thought they meant only Publick Penitents? The truth is, they handle all three kindes, but private and voluntary Repentance much oftner, as being of farr more general use, whereas Publick was but incident unto few, and not oftner than once incident unto any. Howbeit, because they do not distinguish
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:66185:219"/>
one kinde of Penitency from another by difference of Names, our safest way for Construction, is, to follow circumstance of Matter, which in this Narration will not yield it self applyable onely unto Publick penance, do what they can, that would so expound it.</p>
                     <p>They boldly and confidently affirm, That, no man being compellable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse publickly any Sinne before <hi>Novatius</hi> time, the end of instituting <hi>Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries</hi> afterwards in the Church, was, that by them, men might be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto publick Confession. Is there any Record in the World which doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie this to be true? There is that testifie the plain contrary; For <hi>Sozomen,</hi> declaring purposely the cause of their Institution, saith, <hi>That whereas men open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly craving Pardon at God's hands (for Publick Confession, the last act of Penitency, was alwayes made in the form of a contrite Prayer unto God,) it could not be avoided, but they must withall confesse what their offences were</hi>; This, is the opinion of their Prelate, seemed, from the first beginning (as we may probably think) to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what burthensome, that men, whose Crimes were unknown, should blaze their own Faults, as it were on the Stage, acquainting all the People with whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they had done amisse. And therefore to remedy this Inconvenience, they laid the charge upon one onely Priest, chosen out of such as were of best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, a silent and a discreet man, to whom they which had offended might resort, and lay open their Lives. He, according to the quality of every one's Transgressions, appointed what they should do or suffer, and left them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it upon themselves. Can we wish a more direct and evident testimonie, that the Office here spoken of, was to ease voluntary Penitents from the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of publick Confessions, and not to constrain notorious Offenders thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? That such Offenders were not compellable to open Confessions till <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s time, that is to say, till after the dayes of Persecution under <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour, they, of all men, should not so peremptorily avouch; which whom, if <hi>Fabian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who suffered Martyrdom in the first year of <hi>Decius,</hi> be of any authority and credit, it must inforce them to reverse their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; his words are so plain and clear against them.<note place="margin">Fab. Decret. Ep. 2. Tom. 1. Conc. p. 358.</note> 
                        <hi>For such as commit those Crimes, whereof the Apostle hath said, They that do them shall never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, must</hi> (saith he) <hi>be forced unto amendment, because they slipp down to Hell, if Ecclesiastical Authority stay them not.</hi> Their conceit of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility that one man should suffice to take the general charge of Penitency in such a Church as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hath risen from a meer erroneous supposal, that the Antient manner of private Confession was like the Shrift at this day usual in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which tyeth all men at one certain time to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, whereas Confession was then neither looked for, till men did offer it, nor offered for the most part by any other, than such as were guilty of hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Transgressions, nor to them any time appointed for that purpose. Finally, The drift which <hi>Sozomen</hi> had in relating the Discipline of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Form of publick Penitency there retained even till his time, is not to signifie that onely publick Confession was abrogated by <hi>Nectarius,</hi> but that the West or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church held still one and the same Order from the very beginning, and had not, as the Greek, first cut off publick voluntary Confession, by ordaining, and then private by removing <hi>Penitentiaries.</hi> Wherefore, to conclude, It standeth, I hope, very plain and clear, first against the one Cardinal, that <hi>Nectarius</hi> did truly abrogate Confession in such sort as the Ecclesiastical History hath reported; and, secondly, as clear against them both, that it was not publick Confession onely which <hi>Nectarius</hi> did abolish.</p>

wherein complaint is made of some inconvenience, which the want of the Office would breed; Finally, repugnant to that which the History declareth concerning other Churches which did as <hi>Nectarius</hi> had done before them, not in deposing the same man (for that was impossible) but in removing the same Office out of their Churches, which <hi>Nectarius</hi> had banished from his. For which cause, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> doth well reject the opinion of <hi>Hessels,</hi> howsoever it please <hi>Pamelius</hi> to admire it as a wonderful happy Invention. But in sum, they are all gravelled, no one of them able to go smoothly away, and to satisfie either others or himself, with his own conceit concerning <hi>Nectarius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Only in this they are stiff, that Auricular Confession <hi>Nectarius</hi> did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, left if so much should be acknowledged, it might enforce them to grant, that the Greek Church at that time held not Confession, as the Latin now doth, to be the part of a Sacrament instituted by our Saviour Jesus Christ, which therefore the Church till the Worlds end hath no power to alter. Yet seeing that as long as publick voluntary Confession of private Crimes did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in either Church (as in the one it remained not much above 200. years, in the other about 400.) the only acts of such Repentance were; first, the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's intimation of those Crimes to some one Presbyter, for which imposition of Penance was sought; Secondly, the undertaking of Penance imposed by the Bishop; Thirdly, after the same performed and ended, open Confession to God in the hearing of the whole Church; Whereupon, Fourthly, ensued the Prayer of the Church; Fifthly, then the Bishop's imposition of hands; and so, Sixthly, the Parties reconciliation or restitution to his former right in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I would gladly know of them which make onely private Confession a part of their Sacrament of Penance, how it could be so in those times: For where the Sacrament of Penance is ministred, they hold that Confession to be Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental which he receiveth who must absolve; whereas during the fore-rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manner of Penance, it can no where be shewed, that the Priest to whom secret information was given, did reconcile, or absolve any: For, how could he? when Publick Confession was to goe before Reconciliation, and Reconciliation likewise in publick thereupon to ensue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would he have willed them as he doth, to make hold of it, that the favour of God being either way recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by fruits of forcible repentance, they should not only receive whatsoever they had lost by sinne, but also after this their new enfranchisement, aspire to the endless joyes of that supernal City</hi>? To conclude, We every where finde the use of Confession, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially publick, allowed of, and commended by the Fathers; but that extream and rigorous necessity of Auricular and private Confession, which is at this day so mightily upheld by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we finde nor. First, it was not then the Faith and Doctrine of God's Church, as of the Papacy at this present. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the onely remedy for Sinne after Baptisme, is Sacramental Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. Thirdly, That Confession in secret, is an essential part thereof. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That God himself cannot now forgive Sin without the Priest. That, because Forgivenesse at the hands of the Priest must arise from Confession in the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Therefore to confesse unto him, is a matter of such necessity, as being not either in deed, or at the least in desire performed, excludeth utterly from all pardon, and must consequently in Scripture be commanded, wheresoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promise or Forgivenesse is made. No, no; these Opinions have Youth in their countenance, Antiquity knew them not, it never thought nor dreamed of them.</p>
                     <p>But to let passe the Papacy. For as much as Repentance doth import al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration within the minde of a sinful man, whereby, through the power of God's most gracious and blessed Spirit, he seeth, and with unfeigned sorrow acknowledgeth former Offences committed against God, hath them in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter detestation, seeketh pardon for them in such sort as a Christian should doe, and with a resolute purpose settleth himself to avoid them, leading, as near as God shall assist him, for ever after an unspotted life; And in the Order (which Christian Religion hath taught for procurement of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards Sinners) Confession is acknowledged a principal duty; Yea, in some cases, Confesion to man, not to God onely;<note place="margin">Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It standeth with us in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as touching Publick Confession, thus:</p>
                     <p>First, seeing day by day we in our Church begin our Publick Prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, with Publick acknowledgement of our Sinnes, in which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession every man, prostrate as it were before his glorious Majesty, cryeth against himself, and the Minister with one Sentence pronounceth universally all clear, whose acknowledgement so made hath proceeded from a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent minde; What reason is there, every man should not, under the general terms of Confession, represent to himself his own Particulars whatsoever, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning thereunto that affection which a contrite spirit worketh, embrace to as full effect the words of Divine Grace, as if the same were severally and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly uttered with addition of Prayers, imposition of hands, or all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Solemnities that might be used for the strengthening of men's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in God's peculiar mercy towards them? Such Complements are helps to support our Weaknesse, and not Causes that serve to procare or produce his Gifts, as <hi>David</hi> speaketh. The difference of general and particular Formes in Confession and Absolution, is not so material, that any man's safety or ghostly good should depend upon it. And for private Confession and Absolution, it standeth thus with us:</p>

First, because there are but few that consider how much that part of Divine Service, which consists in partaking the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, doth import their Souls; what they lose by neglect thereof, and what by devout Practise they might attain unto: therefore, lest carelesnesse of general Confession should, as commonly it doth, extinguish all remorse of mens particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enormous Crimes, our Custome (whensoever men present themselves at the Lords Table) is, solemnly to give themselves fearfull Admonition, what woes

are perpendicularly hanging over the heads of such as dare adventure to put forth their unworthy hands to those admirable Mysteries of Life, which have, by rare Examples, been proved Conduits of irremediable Death to impenitent Receivers; whom therefore, as we repel being known, so being not known we cannot but terrifie. Yet, with us, the Ministers of God's most Holy Word and Sacraments, being all put in trust with the custody and dispensation of those Mysteries, wherein our Communion is, and hath been ever, accounted the highest Grace that men on earth are admitted unto; have therefore all equally the same power to with-hold that sacred Mystical Food from notorious Evil-Livers, from such as have any way wronged their Neighbours, and from Parties, between whom there doth open hatred and malice appear, till the first sort have reformed their wicked Lives, the second recompensed them unto whom they were injurious, and the last condescended unto some course of Christian Reconciliation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon their mutual accord may ensue.

If thou be abashed to tell unto any other, wherein thou hast offended, rehearse them every day between thee and thy Soul. I wish thee not to confesse them to thy fellow-servant, who may upbraid thee with them; Tell them to God, who will cure them; There is no need for thee in the presence of Witnesses to acknowledge them; Let God alone see thee at thy Confession; I pray and beseech you, that you would more often than you do, confesse to God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and reckoning up your Trespasses, desire his Pardon.

And it is happy for the Church of God that we have the Writings of the Fathers, to shew what their meaning was. The name of Satisfaction, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers meant it, containeth whatsoever a Penitent should do in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himself unto God, and testifying by deeds of Contrition, the same which Confession in words pretendeth; <hi>He which by Repentance for Sins</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

                     <p>Satisfaction, as a part, comprehendeth only that which the Papists meant by <hi>worthy of Repentance</hi>; and if we speak of the whole work of Repentance it self, we may, in the phrase of Antiquity, term it very well <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Satisfaction is a work which Justice requireth to be done for contentment of Persons injured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither is it in the eye of Justice a sufficient satisfaction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it fully equal the Injury for which we satisfie. Seeing then that sin against God Eternal and Infinite, must needs be an infinite wrong: Justice, in regard thereof, doth necessarily exact an infinite recompence; or else inflict upon the Offender infinite punishment. Now, because God was thus to be satisfied; and man not able to make satisfaction, in such sort his unspeakable love and inclination to save mankinde from eternal death ordained in our behalf a Mediatour to do that which had been for any other impossible: Wherefore all sin is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the only faith of Christ's passion, and no man without belief thereof justified; <hi>Bonavent. in Sentent. 4. dist. 15. 9. 9.</hi> Faith alone maketh Christ's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ours, howbeit that Faith alone which after sinne maketh us by Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his.</p>
                     <p>For in as much as God will have the benefit of Christ's satisfaction, both thankfully acknowledged, and duly esteemed, of all such as enjoy the same, he therefore imparteth so high a treasure unto no man, whose Faith hath not made him willing, by Repentance, to do even that which of it self, how unavailable soever, yet being required, and accepted with God, we are, in Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made capable, and sit Vessels to receive the fruits of his Satisfaction: Yea, we so farr please and content God, that because when we have offended, he looketh but for Repentance at our hands; our Repentance, and the works thereof, are therefore termed satisfactory, not for that so much is thereby done as the Justice of God can exact, but because such actions of grief and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in man after sinne, are <hi>illices divine misericordiae</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh of them) they draw that pity of God's towards us, wherein he is for Christ's

sake contented, upon our submission, to pardon our rebellion against him; and when that little which his Law appointeth is faithfully executed, it pleaseth him in tender compassion and mercy to require no more.</p>
                     <p>Repentance is a name which noteth the habit and operation of a certain grace, or vertue in us: Satisfaction, the effect which it hath, either with God or man. And it is not in this respect said amiss, that Satisfaction importeth Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, Reconciliation, and Amity; because that, through Satisfaction on the one part made, and allowed on the other, they which before did reject are now content to receive, they to be won again which were lost, and they to love unto whom just cause of hatred was given. We satisfie therefore in doing that which is sufficient to this effect; and they towards whom we do it are satisfied, if they accept it as sufficient, and require no more: Otherwise we satisfie not, although we do satisfie: For so between man and man it oftentimes falleth out, but between man and God, never; It is therefore true, that our Lord Jesus Christ by one most precious and propitiatory Sacrifice, which was his Body, a Gift of infinite worth, offered for the Sins of the whole World, hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by once reconciled us to God, purchased his general free pardon, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine indignation from mankinde. But we are not for that cause to think, any office of Penitence, either needless or fruitless, on our own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. For then would not God require any such Duties at our hands; Christ doth remain everlastingly a gracious Intercessour, even for every particular Penitent. Let this assure us, that God, how highly soever displeased and incensed with our Sins, is notwithstanding, for his sake, by our Tears, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, taking that for Satisfaction, which is due by us, because Christ hath by his Satisfaction made it acceptable. For, as he is the High Priest of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 6.</note> so he hath made us Priests likewise under him, to the end we might offer unto God praise and thankfulness while we continue in the way of life; and when we sin, the satisfactory or propitiatory sacrifice of a broken and a contrite Heart. There is not any thing that we do that could pacifie God, and clear us in his sight from sin, if the goodness and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ were not, whereas now beholding the poor offer of our religions endeavours,<note place="margin">

He fortifieth this with <hi>David</hi>'s example, whose sinne he forgave, and yet afflicted him for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and tryal of his humility. Briefly, a general axiome he hath for all such cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, <hi>Before forgiveness, they are the punishment of Sinners; and after forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they are exercises and tryals of Righteous men.</hi> Which kinde of proceeding is so agreeable with God's nature and man's comfort, that it seemeth even injurious to both, if we should admit those surmised reservations of temporal wrath, in God appeased towards reconciled Sinners. As a Father he delights in his Childrens conversion, neither doth he threaten the Penitent with wrath, or them with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which already mourn; but by promise assureth such of indulgence and mercy, yea, even of plenary Pardon, which taketh away all, both Faults and Penalties: There being no reason, why we should think him the lesse just, because he sheweth him thus mercifull, when they, which before were obstinate, labour to appease his wrath with the pensive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of Contrition, the meek humility which Confession expresseth,

and the deeds wherewith Repentance declareth it self to be an amendment as well of the rotten fruit, as the dryed leaves, and withered root of the tree. For with these duties by us performed, and presented unto God in Heaven by Jesus Christ, whose blood is a continual sacrifice of propitiation for us, we content, please, and satisfie God.

                     <p>Amongst the works of Satisfaction, the most respected have been alwayes these three, Prayers, Fasts, and Alms-deeds; by Prayers, we lift up our Souls to him from whom sinne and iniquity hath withdrawn them; by Fasting, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the body from thraldom under vain delights, and make it serviceable for parts of vertuous conversation; by Alms, we dedicate to Charity those worldly Goods and Possessions, which unrighteousness doth neither get, nor bestow well: The first, a token of piety intended towards God; the second, a pledge of moderation and sobriety in the carriage of our own Persons; the last, a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our meaning to do good to all men. In which three, the Apostle, by way of abridgement, comprehendeth whatsoever may appertain to sanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, holynesse, and good life: as contrariwise, the very masse of general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption throughout the world, what is it but only forgetfulnesse of God, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleasure, immoderate desire after worldly things, prophaness, licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, covetousnesse? All offices to Repentance have these two Properties; there is in performance of them painfulnesse, and in their nature a contrarietie unto sinne.<note place="margin">2.

Notwithstanding, because there was likewise hope, and possibility of shortning the time, this made them in all the Parts and Offices of their Repentance the more fervent. In the first station, while they onely beheld others passing towards the Temple of God, whereunto for themselves to approach it was not lawful, they stood as miserable forlorn men, the very patterns of perplexity and woe. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when they had the favour to wait at the doors of God, where the sound of his comfortable word might be heard, none received it with attention like to theirs: Thirdly, being taken and admitted to the next degree of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, at the feet, yet behinde the back of that Angel representing God, whom the rest saw face to face; their tears, and entreaties both of Pastour and People were such as no man could resist. After the fourth step, which gave them liberty to hear and pray with the rest of the People, being so near the haven, no diligence was then flacked which might hasten admission to the Heavenly Table of Christ, their last desire. It is not therefore a thing to be marvelled at, though Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> took it in very ill part, when open Back-sliders from the faith and sacred Religion of Christ, laboured by sinister practise to procure from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned Saints, those requests for present absolution, which the Church could neither yield unto with safety of Discipline, nor in honour of Martyrdom easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For, what would thereby ensue, they needed not to conjecture, when they saw how every man which came so commended to the Church by Letters, thought that now he needed not to crave, but might challenge of duty his peace, taking the matter very highly, if but any little forbearance, or small delay was used.<note place="margin">Jacens stanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, minatur.

handling destroy them, a grace dangerous for the Giver; and to him which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, nothing at all available. The patient expectation that bringeth health, is, by this means, not regarded; recovery of soundness not sought for by the only medicine available, which is Satisfaction Penitency thrown out of men's hearts, the remembrance of that heaviest and last Judgement clean banish'd; the wounds of dying men, which should be healed, are covered, the stroke of death, which hath gone as deep as any bowels are to receive it, is over-cast with the sleight shew of a cloudy look. From the Altar of Satan to the holy Table of the Lord, men are not afraid to come; even belching in a manner the sacrificed morsels they have eaten, yea, their jaws yet breathing out the irksome savour of their former contagious wickedness, they seize upon the blessed body of our Lord, nothing terrified with that dreadful commination, which saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Whosoever eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, is guilty of the body and blood of Christ.</hi> They vainly think it to be peace which is gotten before they be purged of their faults, before their crime be solemnly confest, before their Conscience be cleared by the sacrifice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Priest's hands, and before they have pacified the indignation of God. Why term they that a Favour, which is an Injury? Wherefore cloak they Impiety with the name of charitable Indulgence? Such facility giveth not, but rather taketh away peace, and is it self another fresh Persecution or tryal, whereby that fraudulent Enemy maketh a secret havock of such as before he had overthrown; and now, to the end that he may clean swallow them, he casteth Sorrow into a dead sleep, putteth Grief to silence, wipeth away the memory of Faults newly done, smothereth the sighs that should rise from a contrite Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, dryeth up Eyes which ought to send forth rivers of Tears, and permitteth not God to be pacified withfull repentance, whom haynous and enormous crimes have displeased.</p>
                     <p>By this then we see, that, in Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s judgement, all Absolutions are void,<note place="margin">The end of Satisfaction.</note> frustrate, and of no effect, without sufficient Repentance first shewed; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwise, if true and full Satisfaction have gone before, the sentence of man here given is ratified of God in Heaven, according to our Saviours own sacred Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, <hi>Whose sins ye remit, they are remitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what works in the Vertue, and by what in the Discipline of Repentance, we are said to satisfie either God or men, cannot now be thought obscure. As for the Inventors of Sacramental Satisfaction, they have both altered the natural order heretofore kept in the Church, by bringing in a strange preposterous course, to absolve before Satisfaction be made, and moreover by this their misorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practise, are grown into sundry errours concerning the end whereunto it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                     <p>They imagine, beyond all conceit of Antiquity, that when God doth remit Sin, and the punishment eternal thereunto belonging, he reserveth the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell-fire to be nevertheless endured for a time, either shorter or longer, according to the quality of men's Crimes. Yet so, that there is between God and man, a certain Composition (as it were) or Contract, by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of works assigned by the Priest to be done after Absolution shall satisfie God, as touching the punishment, which he otherwise would inflict for sin, pardoned and forgiven.</p>
                     <p>Now, because they cannot assure any man, that,<note place="margin">The way of satisfying by others.</note> if he performeth what the Priest appointeth, it shall suffice; This (I say) because they cannot do, in as much as the Priest hath no power to determine or define of equivalency between Sins and Satisfactions; And yet if a Penitent depart this life, the debt of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction being either in whole or in part un-discharged, they stedfastly hold, that the Soul must remain in unspeakable torment till all be paid: Therefore, for help and mittigation in this Case, they advise men to set certain Copes-mates on work, whose Prayers and Sacrifices may satisfie God for such Souls as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in debt. Hence have arisen the infinite Pensions of their Priests, the building of so many Altars and Tombs, the enriching of so many Churches with so many glorious costly Gifts, the bequeathing of Lands, and ample Posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66185:226"/>
to Religious Companies, even with utter forgetfulness of Friends, Parents, Wife and Children, all natural affection giving place unto that desire, which men, doubtful of their own estate, have to deliver their Soals from torment after death.</p>
                     <p>Yet, behold even this being done, how farr forth it shall avail, they are not sure; And therefore the last upshot unto all their former Inventions, is, that as every action of Christ, did both ment for himself, and satisfie partly for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and partly for the temporal punishment, due unto men for sin; So his Saints have obtained the like priviledge of Grace, making every good work they do, not only meritorious in their own behalf, but satisfactory too for the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Or if, having at any time grievously sinned, they do more to satisfie God, then he in justice can exact, of look for at their hands; the surplusage run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to a common stock, out of which treasury, containing whatsoever Christ did by way of Satisfaction for temporal punishment, together with the satisfactory force which resideth in all the vertuous works of Saints; and in their Satisfactions whatsoever doth abound, (I say) <hi>From hence they hold God satisfied for such arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages as men behinde in accompt discharge not by other means; and for disposition hereof, as it is their Doctrine, that Christ remitteth not eternal death without the Priests Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, so, without the grant of the Pope, they cannot but teach it a like unpossible, that Souls in Hell should receive any temporal release of pain. The Sacrament of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from him being to this effect no lesse necessary, than the Priests Absolution to the other.</hi> So that by this Postem-gate commeth in the whole mark of Papal Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, a Gain unestimable to him, to others a Spoyl, a scorn both to God and Man. So many works of satisfaction pretended to be done by Christ, by Saints, and Martyrs, so many vertuous acts possessed with satisfactory force and vertue; so many supererogations in satisfying beyond the exigence of their own necessity; And this that the Pope might make a Monopoly of all, turning all to his own gain, or at least to the gain of those which are his own. Such facilitle they have to convert a pretended Sacrament into a Revenue.</p>

So that no contrition or grief of heart, till the Priest exact it; no acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sins, but that which he doth demand; no Praying, no Fasting, no Alms, no Recompence or Restitution for whatsoever we have done, can help, except by him, it be first imposed. It is the Chain of their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, No remedy for mortal sin committed after Baptism, but the Sacrament of Penance only; No Sacrament of Penance, if either matter or form be wanting; No wayes to make those Duties a material part of the Sacrament, unless we consider them, as required and exacted by the Priest. Our Lord and Saviour, they say, hath ordained his Priests, Judges in such sort, that no man which sinneth after Baptisme, can be reconciled unto God, but by their Sentence. For why? If there were any other way of Reconciliation, the very promise of Christ should be false in saying, <hi>Whatsoever ye binde on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whose sins soever ye retain, are retained.</hi> Except therefore the Priest be willing, God hath by promise hampred himself so, that it is not now in his own power to pardon any man. Let him which is offended crave as the Publican did, <hi>Lord he thou merciful unto me a sinner</hi>; Let him, as <hi>David,</hi> make a thousand times his supplication, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude of thy compassions, put away mine iniquities.</hi> All this doth not help till such time as the pleasure of the Priest be known, till he have signed us a pardon, and given us, our <hi>quietus est.</hi> God himself hath no Answer to make but such as that of his Angel unto <hi>Lot,</hi> I can do nothing.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that our Saviour by these words, <hi>Whose Sins ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> did ordain Judges over our sinful Souls, gave them Authority to absolve from sin, and promise to ratifie in Heaven whatsoever they should do on Earth, in execution of this their Offices to the end that hereby, as well his Ministers might take encouragement to do their Duty with all Faithfulness, as also his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple admonition, gladly, with all reverence, to be ordered by them; both parts knowing that the Functions of the one towards the other have his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual assistance and approbation. Howbeit all this, with two Restraints, which every Jurisdiction in the World hath; the one, that the practice thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in due order; the other, that it do not extend it self beyond due bounds, which bounds or limits have so confined penitential Jurisdiction, that, although there be given unto it power of remitting sinne, yet not such Soveraignty of Power, that no sin should be pardonable in man without it: Thus to enforce our Saviour's words, is as though we should gather, that because,<note place="margin">Christus ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium suam parellarum in Apostolos translusit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>To Remission of Sins, there are two things necessary; Grace, as the only cause which taketh away Iniquity, and Repentance as a Duty or Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in us.

It pleaseth God that men sometimes should, by missing this help, perceive how much they stand bound to him for so precious a Benefit enjoyed.

deprived of Pastors, the doleful rehearsal of their lost felicities hath not any one thing more eminent, than that Sinners distrest should not now know, how or where to unlade their Burthens. Strange it were unto me, that the Fathers, who so much every where extol the Grace of Jesus Christ, in leaving unto his Church this Heavenly and Divine power, should as men, whose simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had universally been abused, agree all to admire the magnifie and needless Office.</p>
                     <p>The Sentence therefore of Ministerial Absolution hath two effects: touching sin, it only declareth us freed from the guiltiness thereof, and restored into God's favour; but concerning right in Sacred and Divine Mysteries, whereof, through Sin we were made unworthy, as the power of the Church did before effectually binde and retain us from access unto them, so, upon our apparent repentance, it truly restoreth our Liberty, looseth and Chains wherewith we were tyed, remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all whatsoever is past, and accepteth us no less returned than if we never had gone astray.</p>
                     <p>For, in as much as the Power which our Saviour gave to his Church, is of two kindes; the one to be exercised over voluntary Penitents only, the other over such as are to be brought to Amendment by Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the words wherein he hath given this Authority, must be so understood as the Subject or Matter whereupon it worketh, will permit. It doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that in the former kinde, (that is to say, in the use of Power over vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie Converts) to binde or loose, remit or retain, should signifie any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than only to pronounce of Sinners according to that which may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by outward signes; because really to effect the removal or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Sinne in the Soul of any Offender, is no Priestly act, but a Work which farr exceedeth their Ability. Contrariwise, in the latter kinde of Spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, which, by Censures, constraineth men to amend their Lives; It is is true, that the Minister of God doth then more declare and signifie what God hath wrought. And this Power, true it is, that the Church hath invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, as other truths, so this hath by errour been oppugned and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, through abuse.

A Spunge steeped in Worm-wood and Gall, a Man through too much seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity merciless, and neither able to endure, nor to be endured of any. His Book entituled concerning Chastity, and written professedly against the Discipline of the Church, hath many fretful and angry Sentences, declaring a minde very much offended with such as would not perswade themselves, that, of Sins, some be pardonable by the Keyes of the Church, some uncapable of Forgiveness; That middle and moderate Offences having received chastisement, may, by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Authority afterwards be remitted: but, greater Transgressions must (as touching Indulgence) be left to the only pleasure of Almighty God in the World to come: That as Idolatry and Bloodshed, so likewise Fornication and sinful Lust, are of this nature; that they, which so farr have fallen from God, ought to continue for ever after barred from access unto his Sanctuary, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to perpetual profusion of Tears, deprived of all expectation and hope to receive any thing at the Churches hands, but publication of their shame.<note place="margin">Securitas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licti etiam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bido di cju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Howbeit, as oftentimes the vices of wicked men do cause other their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable qualities to be abhorred, so the honour of great mens vertues is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Cloak of their Errours: In which respect, <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath past with much less obloquy and reprehension than <hi>Novatian</hi>; who, broaching afterwards the same opinion, had not otherwise wherewith to countervail the Offence he gave, and to procure it the like toleration. <hi>Novatian,</hi> at the first, a Stoical Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher (which kinde of men hath alwayes accounted Stupidity the highest top of Wisdom, and Commiseration the deadlyest sin) became by Institution and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the very same which the other had been before through a secret natural Distemper upon his Conversion to the Christian Faith, and recovery from Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which moved him to receive the Sacrament of Baptisme in his Bed.

That Evangelical Sacraments are causes to effect Grace, through mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of signes legal, according to the same signification and sense wherein E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Sacraments are held by us to be God's Instruments for that purpose. For howsoever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath shrunk up the <hi>Lutherans</hi> sinews, and cut off our Doctrine by the skirts; <hi>Allen,</hi> although he terms us Hereticks, according to the usual bitter venom of his first style, doth yet ingenuously confess, That the old. School-mens Doctrine and ours is one concerning Sacramental effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, derived from God himself assisting by promise those outward signes of Elements and Words, out of which their School-men of the newer mint, are so desirous to hatch Grace. Where God doth work and use these outward means, wherein he neither findeth nor planteth force and aptnesse towards his intended purpose; such means are but signes to bring men to the consideration of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:66185:231"/>
his Omnipotent Power, which, without the use of things sensible, would not be marked.</p>
                     <p>At the time therefore when he giveth his Heavenly Grace, he applyeth, by the hands of his Ministers, that which betokeneth the same; nor only betokeneth, but, being also accompanied for ever with such Power as doth truly work, is in that respect, termed God's Instrument, a true efficient cause of Grace; a cause not in it self, but onely by connexion of that which is in it self a cause, namely, God's own Strength and Power. Sacraments, that is to say, the outward signes in Sacraments, work nothing till they be blessed and sanctified by God.</p>
                     <p>But what is God's Heavenly Benediction and Sanctification, saving onely the association of his Spirit? Shall we say that Sacraments are like Magical signes, if thus they have their effect? Is it Magick for God to manifest by things sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible what he doth, and to do by his most glorious Spirit really, what he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth in his Sacraments? The delivery and administration whereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the hands of mortal men, by whom, as by personal Instruments, God doth apply signes, and with signes inseparably joyn his Spirit, and through the power of his Spirit work Grace. The first is by way of concomitance and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to deliver the rest also that either accompany, or ensue.</p>
                     <p>It is not here, as in Cases of mutual Commerce, where divers Persons have divers acts to be performed in their own behalf; a Creditor to shew his Bill, and a Debtor to pay his Money. But God and Man doe here meet in one Action upon a Third, in whom, as it is the work of God to create Grace, so it is his work by the hand of the Ministry to apply a sign which should betoken, and his work to annex that Spirit which shall effect it. The Action therefore is but one, God the Author thereof, and Man a Co-partner, by him assigned to work for, with, and under him. God the Giver of Grace, by the outward Ministery of man, so farr forth as he authorizeth man to apply the Sacraments of Grace in the Soul, which he alone worketh, without either Instrument or Co-agent.</p>
                     <p>Whereas therefore with us the remission of Sinne is ascribed unto God, as a thing which proceedeth from him only, and presently followeth upon the vertue of true Repentance appearing in man; that which we attribute to the vertue, they do not only impute to the Sacrament of Repentance; but, having made Repentance a Sacrament, and thinking of Sacraments as they do, they are enforced to make the Ministry of the Priests, and their Absolution a cause of that which the sole Omnipotency of God worketh.</p>

                     <p>To rid themselves out of these Bryars, and to make Remission of Sinnes an effect of Absolution, notwithstanding that which hitherto hath been said, they have two shifts: At first, that in many Penitents, there is but Attrition of heart, which Attrition they define to be Grief proceeding from Fear without Love; and to these, they say,<note place="margin">Atritio solum dicit dolorem propter poenas inferni; dum quis accedit at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritus per gratiam Sacramentalem, sit contritus.

if the words of Absolution do infuse Contrition? Have they born us all this while in hand, that Contrition is a part of the matter of their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a Condition or Preparation of the Minde towards Grace to be received by Absolution in the form of their Sacrament? And must we now believe, That the Form doth give the Matter? That Absolution bestoweth Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the words do make presently of <hi>Saul, David</hi>; of <hi>Iudas, Peter?</hi> For what was the Penitency of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> but plain Attrition; horrour of Sinne through fear of punishment, without any long sense, or taste of God's Mercy?</p>
                     <p>Their other Fiction, imputing remission of Sinne to desire of Absolution from the Priest, even in them which are truly contrite, is an evasion somewhat more witty, but no whit more possible for them to prove. Belief of the World and Judgement to come, Faith in the Promises, and Sufferings of Christ for Mankinde, Fear of his Majestie, Love of his Mercy, Grief for Sin, Hope for Pardon, Suit for Grace; These we know to be the Elements of true Contrition: suppose that, besides all this, God did also command that every Penitent should seek his Absolution at the Priests hands; where so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Causes are concurring unto one effect, have they any reason to impute the whole effect unto one; any reason in the choyse of that one to pass by Faith, Fear, Love, Humility, Hope, Prayer, whatsoever else, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronize above them all, A desire of Absolution from the Priest, as if in the whole work of Man's Repentance, God did regard and accept nothing but for and in consideration of this? Why do the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council impute it to Charity, <hi>That Contrites are reconciled in Gods sight, before they receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance, if desired Absolution be the true Cause?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let this passe how it will; seeing the Question is not, What vertue God may accept in penitent Sinners, but what Grace Absolution actually given doth really bestow upon them.</p>
                     <p>If it were, as they would have it, That God regarding the Humiliation of a Contrite Spirit, because there is joyned therewith a lowly desire of the Sacrament of Priestly Absolution, pardoneth immediately, and forgiveth all Offences: Doth this any thing help to prove, that Absolution received af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward from the Priest, can more than declare him already pardoned which did desire it? To desire Absolution, presupposing it commanded, is Obedience: and Obedience in that Case is a Branch of the vertue of Repentance, which Vertue being thereby made effectual to the taking away of Sinnes without the Sacrament of Repentance, Is it not an Argument, that the Sacrament of Absolution hath here no efficacy, but the virtue of Contrition worketh all? For how should any Effect ensue from Causes which actually are not? The Sacrament must be applyed wheresoever any Grace doth proceed from it. <hi>So that where it is but desired only, whatsoever may follow upon Gods acceptation of this desire, the Sacrament, afterwards recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, can be no cause thereof.</hi>

                     <p>Now the last and sometimes hardest to be satisfied by Repentance, are our Mindes; and our Mindes we have then satisfied, when the Conscience is of guilty become clear. For, as long as we are in our selves privy to our own most hainous Crimes, but without sense of God's Mercy and Grace towards us, unlesse the Heart be either brutish for want of Knowledge, or altogether hardned by wilful Atheisme; the remorse of Sinne is in it, as the deadly sting of a Serpent. Which point since very Infidels and Heathens have observed in the nature of Sinne, (for the disease they felt, though they knew no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to help it) we are not rashly to despise those Sentences, which are the testimonies of their experience touching this point. They knew that the eye of a Man's own Conscience is more to be feared by evil doers, than the presence of a thousand Witnesses, in as much as the mouths of other Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers are many wayes stopt, the ears of the accused not alwayes subject to glowing with contumely and exprobation; whereas a guilty Minde being forced to be still both a Martyr and a Tyrant it self, must of necessity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure perpetual Anguish and Grief; For, as the Body is rent with stripes, so the Minde with guiltiness of Cruelty, Lust, and wicked Resolutions. Which Furies brought the Emperour <hi>Tyberius</hi> sometimes into such perplexity, that writing to the Senate, his wonted art of dissimulation failed him utterly in this Case; And whereas it had been ever his peculiar delight so to speak that no man might be able to sound his meaning, he had not the power to conceal what he felt through the secret scourge of an evil Conscience, though no necessity did now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to disclose the same. <hi>What to write, or how to write, at this present, if I know</hi> (saith <hi>Tyberius</hi>) <hi>let the Gods and Goddesses, who thus continually eat me, only be worse to me than they are.</hi> It was not his Imperial Dignity and Power, that could provide a way to protect him against himself; the fears and suspitions which impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity had bred, being strengthned by every occasion, and those Vertues clean ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, which are the only foundation of sound tranquility of minde. For which cause, it hath been truly said, and agreeably with all mens experience, that if the vertuous did excel in no other priviledge, yet farr happier they are than the contrary sort of men, for that their hopes be alwayes better.</p>
                     <p>Neither are we to marvel, that these things, known unto all, do stay so few from being Authors of their own woe.</p>
                     <p>For we see by the antient example of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s unkinde Brethren, how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to remembrance easily when Crimes are once past, what the difference is of good from evil, and of right from wrong: But such consideration when they should have prevented Sinne, were over-match'd by inordinate desires. Are we not bound then with all thankfulnesse to acknowledge his infinite goodnesse and mercy, which hath revealed unto us the way how to rid our selves of these mazes; the way how to shake off that yoke, which no Flesh is able to bear; the way how to change most grisly horror into a comfortable apprehension of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joy?</p>
                     <p>Whereunto there are many which labour with so much the greater difficultie, because imbecillity of minde doth not suffer them to censure rightly their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Some, fearful lest the enormity of their Crimes be so unpardonable that no Repentance can do them good; some, lest the imperfection of their Repentance make it uneffectual to the taking away of Sinne, The one drive all things to this

issue, whether they be not men that have sinned against the Holy Ghost; the other to this, what Repentance is sufficient to clear Sinners, and to assure them that they are delivered.</p>
                     <p>Such as by Error charge themselves of unpardonable Sinne, must think, it may be, they deem that unpardonable, which is not.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour speaketh indeed of Blasphemy which shall never be forgiven: But have they any sure and infallible knowledge what that Blasphemy is? If not, why are they unjust and cruel to their own Souls, imagining certainty of Guiltiness in a Crime, concerning the very nature whereof they are uncertain: For mine own part, although where this Blasphemy is mentioned, the cause why our Saviour spake thereof, was, the Pharisees Blasphemy, which was not afraid to say,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 31.

For it is plain, that many thousands, at the first, professing Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, became afterwards wilful Apostates, moved with no other cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, but mere indignation that the Gentiles should enjoy the benefit of the Gospel as much as they, and yet not be burthened with the yoke of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law.</p>

                     <p>Notwithstanding, for as much as they wrong themselves with over-rigorous and extreme Exactions, by means whereof they fall sometimes into such Perplexities as can hardly be allayed; It hath therefore pleased Almighty God, in tender commiseration over these imbecillities of men, to ordain for their Spiritual and Ghostly comfort, consecrated Persons, which by Sentence of Power and Authority given from above, may, as it were, out of his very mouth ascertain timerous and doubtful mindes in their own particular, ease them of all their scrupulosities, leave them settled in Peace, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied touching the Mercy of God towards them.

Last of all, to set down the like stint, and to shut up the doors of Mercy against Penitents which come short thereof in the devotion of their Prayers, in the continuance of their Falls, in the largeness and bounty of their Almes, or in the course of any other such like Duties, is more than God himself hath thought meet, and consequently more than mortal men should presume to do.</p>

I Have heard that a famous Kingdom in the world being sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to reform such disorders as all men saw the Church exceedingly burthened with, when of each degree great multitudes thereunto inclined, and the number of them did every day so encrease that this intended work was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take no other effect then all good men did wish and labour for: A Principal actor herein (for zeal and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit) thought it good to shew them betimes what it was which must be effected, or else that there could be no work of perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation accomplished. To this purpose, in a solemn Sermon, and in a great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly he described unto them the present quality of their publick Estate, by the parable of a tree, huge and goodly to look upon, but without that fruit which it should and might bring forth; affirming that the only way of redress was a full and perfect establishment of Christs Discipline (for so their manner is to entitle a thing hammered out upon the forge of their own invention) and that to make way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance for it, there must be three great limbs cut off from the body of that stately tree of the Kingdom: Those three limbs were three sorts of men; Nobles, whose high Estate would make them otherwise disdain to put their necks under that yoke: Lawyers, whose Courts being not pulled down, the new Church Consistories were not like to flourish: Finally, Prelates, whose ancient Dignity, and the simplicity of their intended Church-Discipline, could not possibly stand together. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of which device being plausible to active spirits, restless through desire of innovation, whom commonly nothing doth more offend then a change which goeth fearfully on by slow and suspicious paces; the heavier and more experienced sort began presently thereat to pull back their feet again, and exceedingly to fear the stratagem of Reformation for ever after. Whereupon ensued those extream conflicts of the one part with the other, which continuing and encreasing to this very day, have now made the state of that flourishing Kingdom even such, as whereunto we may most fitly apply those words of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah, Thy breach is great like the Sea, who can heal thee</hi>? Whether this were done in truth, according to the constant affirmation of some avouching the same, I take not upon me to examine;
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:66185:235"/>
That which I note therein is, How with us that policie hath been corrected. For to the Authors of pretended Reformation with us, it hath not seemed expedient to offer the edge of the axe unto all three boughs at once, but rather to single them, and strike at the weakest first, making show that the lop of that one shall draw the more abundance of sap to the other two, that they may thereby the better prosper. All prosperity, felicity and peace we wish multiplied on each Estate, as far as their own hearts desire is: But let men know that there is a God, whose eye beholdeth them in all their ways; a God, the usual and ordinary course of whose justice, is to return upon the head of malice the same devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which it contriveth against others The foul practices which have been used for the overthrow of Bishops, may perhaps wax bold in process of time to give the like assault even there, from whence at this present they are most seconded. Nor let it over-dismay them who suffer such things at the hands of this most unkind world, to see that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly estate and dignity thus conculcated, in regard whereof so many their Predecessors were no less esteemed then if they had not been men but Angels amongst men.

But in the hands of Divine Providence we leave the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all such events; and come now to the Question it self which is raised concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishops. For the better understanding whereof we must before hand set down what is meant, when in this Question we name a Bishop.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is, what his name doth import, and what doth belong to his Office as he is a Bishop.</note>II. For whatsoever we bring from Antiquity by way of defence in this cause of Bishops, it is cast off as impertinent matter, all is wiped away with an odd kind of shifting Answer, <hi>That the Bishops which now are, be not like unto them which were.</hi> We therefore beseech all indifferent Judges to weigh sincerely with themselves how the case doth stand. If it should be at this day a controversie whether Kingly Regiment were lawful or no, peradventure in defence thereof, the long continuance which it hath had sithence the first beginning might be alleadged, mention perhaps might be made what Kings there were of old even in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, what Soveraign Princes both before and after. Suppose that herein some man purposely bending his wit against Sovereignty, should think to elude all such allegations by making ample discovery through a number of particularities, wherein the Kings that are, do differ from those that have been, and should therefore in the end conclude, That such ancient examples are no convenient proofs of that Royalty which is now in use. Surely for decision of truth in this case there were no remedy, but only to shew the nature of Sovereignty, to sever it from accidental properties, to make it clear that ancient and present Regality are one and the same in substance, how great odds soever otherwise may seem to be between them. In like manner, whereas a Question of late hath grown, whether Ecclesiastical Regiment by Bishops be lawful in the Church of Christ or no: In which Question, they that hold the Negative, being pressed with that generally received order, according whereunto the most renowned Lights of the Christian World, have governed the same in every age as Bishops; seeing their manner is to reply, that such Bishops as those ancient were, ours are not; There is no remedy but to shew, that to be a Bishop is now the self same thing which it hath been; that one definition agreeth fully and truly as well to those elder, as to these latter Bishops. Sundry dissimilitudes we grant there are, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are not such that they cause any equivocation in the name, whereby we should think a Bishop in those times to have had a clean other definition then doth rightly agree unto Bishops as they are now: Many things there are in the state of Bishops, which the times have changed; Many a Parsonage at this day is larger then some ancient Bishopricks were; many an antient Bishop poorer then at this day sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry under them in degree. The simple hereupon, lacking judgement and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to discern between the nature of things which changeth not, and these outward variable accidents, are made beleeve that a Bishop heretofore and now are things in their very nature so distinct that they cannot be judged the same. Yet to men that have any part of skill, what more evident and plain in Bishops, then that aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or diminution in their precincts, allowances, priviledges, and such like, do make a difference indeed, but no essential difference between one Bishop and another? As for those things in regard whereof we use properly to term them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; those things whereby they essentially differ from other Pastors, those things which the natural definition of a Bishop must contain, what one of them is there more or less appliable unto Bishops now than of old?

                  <p>Again, sith the first things that grow into general observation; and do thereby give men occasion to find Names for them, are those which being in many Subjects, are thereby the easier, the oftner, and the more universally noted; it followeth, that names imposed to signifie common qualities or operations are ancienter, then is the restraint of those names, to note an excellency of such qualities or operations in some one or few amongst others. For example, the name Disciple being invented to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie generally a learner, it cannot choose but in that signification be more ancient then when it signifieth, as it were by a kind of appropriation, those Learners who being taught of Christ were in that respect termed Disciples by an excellency.<note place="margin">So also the name Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to a certain order of Ministers.</note> The like is to be seen in the name Apostle, the use whereof to signifie a messenger, must needs be more ancient then that use which restraineth it unto Messengers sent concerning Evangelical affairs; yea this use more ancient then that whereby the same word is yet restrained farther to signifie only those whom our Saviour himself immediately did send. After the same manner the Title or Name of a Bishop having been used of old to signifie both an Ecclesiastical Overseer in general, and more particularly also a Principal Ecclesiastical Overseer; it followeth, that this latter restrained signification is not so ancient as the former, being more common:<note place="margin">The name likewise of a Minister was common to divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which now is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly among our selves gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only to Pastors, and not as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to Deacons also.</note> Yet because the things themselves are always ancienter then their names; therefore that thing which the restrained use of the word doth import, is likewise ancienter then the restraint of the word is; and consequently that power of chief Ecclesiastical Overseers, which the term of a Bishop importeth, was before the restrained use of the name which doth import it. Wherefore a lame and an impotent kind of reasoning it is, when men go about to prove that in the Apostles times there was no such thing as the restrained name of a Bishop doth now signifie; because in their writings there is found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of that name, but only a general use whereby it reacheth unto all spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Overseers.</p>
                  <p>But to let go the name, and to come to the very nature of that thing which is thereby signified in all kindes of Regiment whether Ecclesiastical or Civil: as there are sundry operations publique, so likewise great inequality there is in the same operations, some being of principal respect, and therefore not fit to be dealt in by every one to whom publique actions, and those of good importance, are notwithstanding well and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itly enough committed. From hence have grown those different degrees of Magistrates or publique persons, even Ecclesiastical as well as Civil. Amongst Ecclesiastical Persons therefore Bishops being chief ones, a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops function must be defined by that wherein his Chiefty consisteth. A Bishop is a Minister of God, unto whom with permanent continuance, there is given not only power of administring the Word and Sacraments, which power other Presbyrers have; but also a further power to ordain Ecclesiastical persons, and a power of Chiefty in Government over Presbyters as well as Lay men, a power to be by way of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction a Pastor even to Pastors themselves. So that this Office, as he is a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter or Pastor, consisteth in those things which are common unto him with other Pastors, as in ministring the Word and Sacraments: But those things incident unto his Office, which do properly make him a Bishop, cannot be common unto him with other Pastors. Now even as Pastors, so likewise Bishops being principal Pastors, are either at large or else with restraint. At large, when the subject of their Regiment is indefinite, and not tyed to any certain place: Bishops with restraint, are they whose Regiment over the Church is contained within some definite, local compass, beyond which compass their jurisdiction reacheth not. Such therefore we always mean when we speak of that Regiment by Bishops which we hold a thing most lawful, divine and holy in the Church of Christ.</p>

In our present regiment by Bishops two things there are complained of, the one their great Authority, and the other their great Honor. Touching the Authority of our Bishops, the first thing which therein displeaseth their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is the Superiority which Bishops have over other Ministers. They which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brook the Superiority which Bishops have, do notwithstanding themselves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that some kind of difference and inequality there may be lawfully amongst Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: Inequality as touching gifts and graces they grant, because this is so plain that no mist in the world can be cast before mens eyes so thick, but that they needs must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thorow it, that one Minister of the Gospel may be more learneder, holier, and wiser, better able to instruct, more apt to rule and guide them then another: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thus much were confest, those men should lose their fame and glory whom they themselves do entitle the Lights and grand Worthies of this present age. Again, a priority of Order they deny not, but that there may be; yea such a priority as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one man amongst many a principal Actor in those things whereunto sundry of them must necessarily concur, so that the same be admitted only during the time of such actions and no longer; that is to say just so much superiority, and neither more nor less may be liked of, then it hath pleased them in their own kind of regiment to set down. The inequality which they complain of, is, <hi>That one Minister of the Word and Sacraments should have a permanent superiority above another, or in any sort a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of power mandatory, judicial and coercive over other Ministers.</hi> By us, on the contrary side, <hi>inequality, even such inequality as unto Bishops being Ministers of the Word and Sacraments granteth a superiority permanent above Ministers, yea a permanent su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of power mandatory, judicial and coercive over them,</hi> is maintained a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, lawful and good. For, superiority of power may be either above them or upon them, in regard of whom it is termed superiority. One Pastor hath superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of power above another, when either some are authorised to do things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier then are permitted unto all, some are preferred to be principal Agents, the rest Agents with dependency and subordination. The former of these two kinds of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority is such as the High-Priest had above other Priests of the Law, in being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to enter once a year the holy place, which the rest of the Priests might not do. The latter superiority such as Presidents have in those actions which are done by others with them, they nevertheless being principal and chief therein. One Pastor hath superiority of power, not only above but upon another, when some are subject unto others commandment and judicial controlment, by vertue of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique jurisdiction. Superiority in this last kinde is utterly denied, to be allowable; in the rest it is only denied that the lasting continuance and settled permanency thereof is lawful. So that if we prove at all the lawfulness of superiority in this last kind, where the same is simply denied, and of permanent superiority in the rest where some kind of superiority is granted, but with restraint to the term and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of certain actions, with which the same must, as they say, expire and cease; If we can show these two things maintainable, we bear up sufficiently that which the adverse party endeavoureth to overthrow. Our desire therefore is, that this issue may be strictly observed, and those things accordingly judged of, which we are to alleadge. This we boldly therefore set down, as a most infallible truth, <hi>That the Church of Christ is at this day lawfully, and so hath been sit hence the first beginning, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Bishops, having permanent superiority, and ruling power over other Ministers of the Word and Sacraments.</hi>

Fourthly, How far the same Episcopal power hath usually extended, unto what number of persons it hath reached, what bounds and limits of place it hath had.

Bishops therefore they were at large. But was it lawful for any of them to be a Bishop with restraint?

If there were many, surely St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in naming but only one of them an Angel, did behold in that one somewhat above the rest. Nor was this order peculiar unto some few Churches, but the whole world universally became subject thereunto; insomuch as they did not account it to be a Church, which was not subject unto a Bishop.

And he saw that the ruling superiority of Bishops was a thing uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally established not by the force of any Councel, (for Councels do all presuppose Bishops, nor can there any Councel be named so ancient, either General, or as much as Provincial, sithence the Apostles own times, but we can shew that Bishops had their Authority before it, and not from it.) Wherefore St. <hi>Augustine</hi> knowing this, could not chuse but reverence the Authority of Bishops, as a thing to him apparently and most clearly apostolical.

                     </note>The drift and purpose of S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> speech doth plainly show what his meaning was; for whereas some did over-extol the Office of the Deacon in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; where Deacons being grown great, through wealth, challenged place above Presbyters: S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> to abate this insolency, writing to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> diminisheth by all means the Deacons estimation, and lifteth up Presbyters as far as possible the truth might bear. <hi>An attendant,</hi> saith he, <hi>upon Tables and Widows proudly to exalt himself above them, at whose prayers is made the body and blood of Christ; above them, between whom and Bishops there was at the first for a time no difference neither in authority nor in title. And whereas after schisms and contentions made it necessary that some one should be placed over them, by which occasion the title of Bishop became proper unto that one, yet was that one chosen out of the Presbyters, as being the chiefest, the highest, the worthiest degree of the Clergie, and not out of Deacons; in which consideration also it seemeth that in Alexandria even from St.</hi> Mark <hi>to</hi> Heraclas <hi>and</hi> Dionysius <hi>Bishops there, the Presbyters evermore have chosen one of themselves, and not a Deacon at any time to be their Bishop. Nor let any man think that Christ hath one Church in</hi> Rome, <hi>and another in the rest of the world; that in</hi> Rome <hi>he alloweth Deacons to be honoured above Presbyters, and otherwhere will have them to be in the next degree to the Bishop.

But ye will say that according to the custom of</hi> Rome <hi>a Deacon presenteth unto the Bishop him which standeth to be ordained Presbyter; and upon the Deacons testimony given concerning his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he receiveth at the Bishops hands Oraïnation: So that in</hi> Rome <hi>the Deacon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this special preheminence, the Presbyter ought there to give place unto him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the custom of one City brought against the practice of the whole World? The pancity of Deacons in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath gotten the credit, as unto Presbyters their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude hath been cause of contempt: Howbeit even in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>Presbyters sit and Deacons stand: an Argument as strong against the superiority of Deacons, as the fore-alleadged reason doth seem for it. Besides, whosoever is promoted must needs be raised from a

lower degree to an higher; wherefore either let him which is Presbyter be made a Deacon, that so the Deacon may appear to be the greater; or if of Deacons Presbyters be made, let them know themselves to be in regard of Deacons, though below in gain, yet above in Office.

                  <p>This answer to Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> seemeth dangerous, I have qualified it as I may, by addition of some words of restraint; yet I satisfie not may self, in my judgment it would be altered. <hi>Now whereas</hi> Jerom <hi>doth term the Government of Bishops by restraint, an Apostolical tradition, acknowledging thereby the same to have been of the Apostles own institution, it may be demanded, how these two will stand together; namely, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by divine instinct, should be as</hi> Jerom <hi>confesseth the Authors of that regiment, and yet the custome of the Church he accompted (for so by</hi> Jerom <hi>it may seem to be in this place accompted) the chiefest prop that upholdeth the same</hi>? To this we answer, <hi>That for as much as the whole body of the Church, hath power to alter with general consent and upon necessary occasions, even the positive law of the Apostles, if there be no commandment to the contrary, and it manifestly appears to her, that change of times have clearly taken away the very reason of Gods first institution, as by sundry examples may be most clearly proved; what laws the universal Church might change, and doth not; if they have long continued without any alteration; it seemeth that St.</hi> Jerom <hi>ascribeth the continuance of such positive laws, though instituted by God himself, to the judgemement of the Church. For
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:66185:240"/>
they which might abrogate a Law and do not, are properly said to uphold, to establish it, and to give it being. The Regiment therefore whereof</hi> Jerom <hi>speaketh being positive, and consequently not absolutely necessary, but of a changeable nature, because there is no Divine voice which in express words forbiddeth it to be changed; he might imagine both that it came by the Apostles by very divine appointment at the first, and notwithstanding be after a sort, said to stand in force, rather by the custome of the Church, choosing to continue in it, than by the necessary constraint of any Commandment from the Word, requiring perpetual continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof.</hi> So that St. <hi>Ieroms</hi> admonition is reasonable, sensible, and plain, being contrived to this effect; The ruling superiority of one Bishop over many Presbyters, in each Church, is an Order descended from Christ to the Apostles, who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Bishops at large, and from the Apostles to those whom they in their steads ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Bishops over particular Countries and Cities, and even from those antient times universally established, thus many years it hath continued throughout the World; for which cause Presbyters must not grudg to continue subject unto their Bishops, unless they will proudly oppose themselves against that which God himself ordained by his Apostles; and the whole Church of Christ approveth and judgeth most convenient. On the other side Bishops albeit they may avouch, with conformity of truth, that their Authority had thus descended even from the very Apostles themselves, yet the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and everlasting continuance of it, they cannot say that any Commandment of the Lord doth injoyn; <hi>And therefore must acknowledge that the Church hath power by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal consent upon urgent cause to take it away, if thereunto she be constrained through the proud, tyrannical, and unreformable dealings of her Bishops, whose Regiment she hath thus long delighted in, because she hath found it good and requisite to be so governed. Wherefore lest Bishops forget themselves, as if none on earth had Authority to touch their states, let them continually bear in mind, that it is rather the force of custom, whereby the Church having so long found it good to continue under the Regiment of her vertuous Bishops, doth still uphold, maintain, and honour them in that respect, than that any such true and heavenly Law can be showed, by the evidence whereof it may of a truth appear that the Lord himself hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Presbyters for ever to be under the Regiment of Bishops, in what sort soever they behave themselves</hi>; let this consideration be a bridle unto them, let it teach them not to disdain the advice of their Presbyters, but to use their authority with so much the greater humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and moderation, as a Sword which the Church hath power to take from them.

Another Argument that the Regiment of Churches by one Bishop over many Presbyters, hath been always held Apostolical, may be this.

The custom of the primitive Church in consecrating holy Virgins,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7 29. 1 Tim. 5. 9.</note> and Widows, unto the service of God and his Church, is a thing not obscure, but easie to be known,<note place="margin">Tettul. de r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Here it will be perhaps Objected that the power of Ordination it self was not every where peculiar and proper unto Bishops, as may be seen by 2 Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which sheweth their Churches Order to have been, That Presbyters should together with the Bishop lay hands upon the ordained. But the answer hereunto is easie, For doth it hereupon follow that the power of Ordination was not principally and originally in the Bishop? Our Saviour hath said unto his Apostles, <hi>With me ye shall sit and judge the Twelve Tribes of Israel</hi>; yet we know that to him alone it belongeth to judge the World, and that to him all judgement is given. With us even at this day Presbyters are licensed to do as much as that Council speaketh of, if any be present. Yet will not any man thereby conclude that in this Church others than Bishops are allowed to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain: The association of Presbyters is no sufficient proof that the power of Ordination is in them; but rather that it never was in them, we may hereby understand, for that no man is able to shew either Deacon or Presbyter ordained by Presbyters only, and his Ordination accounted lawful in any ancient part of the Church; every where exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being found both of Deacons and of Presbyters ordained by Bishops alone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, neither ever in that respect thought unsufficient. Touching that other chiefty, which is of Jurisdiction; amongst the Jews he which was highest through the worthiness of peculiar duties incident into his function in the legal service of God, did bear alwaies in Ecclesiastical jurisdiction the chiefest sway. As long as the glory of the Temple of God did last, there were in it sundry orders of men consecrated unto the service thereof; one sort of them inferior unto another in dignity and degree; the Nathiners subordinate unto the Levites, the Levites unto the Priests, the rest of the Priests to those twenty four which were chief Priests, and they all to the High Priest. If any man surmise that the difference between them was only by distinction in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kind of power, and not in this latter of jurisdiction,<note place="margin">Numb. 3. 32.</note> are not the words of the Law manifest which make <hi>Eleazer</hi> the Son of <hi>Aaron</hi> the Priest chief Captain of the Levites, and overseer of them, unto whom the charge of the Sanctuary was committed?

Which fancy pleaseth so well the humour of all sorts of rebellions spirits that they all seek to shroud themselves under it.

to them, is an office figurative and abrogated by Christs coming in the Ministry; that their exercise of jurisdiction was figurative, yea figurative in such sort, that it had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause of being instituted, but only to serve as a representation of somewhat to come, and that herein the Church of Christ ought not to follow them; this Article is such as must be confirmed, if any way by miracle, otherwise it will hardly enter into the heads of reasonable men, why the High-Priest should more figure Christ in being a Judge then in being whatsoever he might be besides.

                     <hi>What things he spake concerning Bishops, the same are also meet for Presbyters, whom Bishops seem not to excell in any thing but only in the power of Ordination.</hi> Wherefore seeing this doth import no ruling superiority, it follows that Bishops were as then no rulers over that part of the Clergy of God. Whereunto we answer that both S. <hi>Ierom</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> had in those their speeches an eye no farther then only to that function, for which Presbyters and Bishops were consecrated unto God. Now we know that their Consecration had reference to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only that which they did by force and vertue of the power of Order, wherein fithe Bishops received their charge, only by that one degree to speak of, more ample then Presbyters did theirs, it might be well enough said that Presbyters were that way authorized to do, in a manner, even as much as Bishops could do, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what each of them did by vertue of solemn consecration; for as concerning power of regiment and jurisdiction, it was a thing withal added unto Bishops for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use of such certain persons and people, as should be thereunto subject in those particular Churches whereof they were Bishops, and belonged to them only, as Bishops of such or such a Church; whereas the other kind of power had relation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely unto any of the whole society of Christian men, on whom they should chance to exercise the same, and belonged to them absolutely, as they were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops wheresoever they live. St. <hi>Ieroms</hi> conclusion thereof is, <hi>that seeing in the one kind of power, there is no greater difference between a Presbyter and a Bishop, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops should not because of their preeminence in the other, too much lift up themselves, above the Presbyters under them. St. Chrysostom's</hi> collection, <hi>that whereas the Apostle doth set down the qualities, whereof regard should be had in the Consecration of Bishops, there was no need to make a several discourse how Presbyters ought to be qualified when they are Ordained; because there being so little difference in the functions, whereunto the one and the other receive Ordination, the same precepts might well serve for both; at least-wise by the vertues required in the greater, what should need in the less might be easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. As for the difference of jurisdiction, the truth is the Apostles yet living, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves where they were resident, exercising the jurisdiction in their own persons, it was not every where established in Bishops.</hi> When the Apostles prescribed those laws, and when <hi>Chysostom</hi> thus spake concerning them, it was not by him at all respected, but his eye was the same way with <hi>Ieroms</hi>; his cogitation was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein if any man suppose that <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> knew no difference at all between a Presbyter and a Bishop, let him weigh but one or two of their sentences. The pride of insolent Bishops, hath not a sharper enemy then <hi>Ierom,</hi> for which cause he taketh often occasions most severely to inveigh against them, sometimes for<note n="a" place="margin">Velut in a 1 qua sublimi specula <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

But to go forward; degrees of these are, and have been of old, even amongst Bishops also themselves: One sort of Bishops being Superiours unto Presbyters only, another sort having preheminence also above Bishops. It cometh here to be considered in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect inequality of Bishops was thought, at the first, a thing expedient for the Church, and what odds there hath been between them, by how much the power of one hath been larger, higher, and greater then of another.

For where number is, there must be order, or else of force there will be confusion.

Can their Pastoral Synod do any thing, unless they have some President amongst them? In Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, they are forced to give one Pastor preheminence and superiority above the rest. But they answer, That he, who being a Pastor according to the Order of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:66185:244"/>
is, for the time, some little deal mightier than his Brethren, doth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue so longer than only during the Synod. Which Answer serveth not to help them out of the bryars: for, by their practise, they confirm our Principle, touching the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of one man's preheminence wheresoever a concurrency of many is required unto any one solemn action; this Nature teacheth, and this they cannot chuse but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As for the change of his Person to whom they give this preheminence, if they think it expedient to make for every Synod a new Superiour, there is no Law of God which bindeth them so to do, neither any that telleth them, that they might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one and the same man being made President, even to continue so during life; and to leave his preheminence unto his Successours after him, as, by the antient Order of the Church, Archbishops, Presidents amongst Bishops, have used to do. The ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of their preheminence above Bishops, is the necessity of often concurrency of many Bishops about the Publick affairs of the Church, as consecrations of Bishops, consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of remedy of general disorders, audience judicial, when the actions of any Bishop should be called in question, or Appeals are made from his Sentence by such as think themselves wronged. These, and the like affairs usually requiring, that many Bishops should orderly assemble, begin, and conclude somewhat; it hath seemed, in the eyes of Reverend Antiquity, a thing most requisite, that the Church should not only have Bishops, but, even amongst Bishops, some to be in Authority chiefest. Unto which purpose, the very state of the whole World, immediately before Christianity took place, doth seem, by the special providence of God to have been prepared: For we must know, that the Countrys where the Gospel was first planted, were, for the most part, subject to the Roman Empire. The Romans use was commonly, when, by warr they had subdued Foreign Nations, to make them Provinces, that is, to place over them Roman Governors, such as might order them according to the Laws and Customs of <hi>Rome.</hi> And, to the end that all things might be the more easily and orderly done, a whole Country being divided into sundry parts, there was in each part some one City, whereinto they about did resort for Justice.

Wherefore inequality of Bishops being found a thing convenient for the Church of God, in such consideration as hath been shewed; when it came secondly in question, which Bishops should be higher and which lower, it seemed herein not to the civil Monarch only, but to the most, expedient that the dignity and celebrity of Mother-Cities should be respected.

                  <p>Thus we see upon what occasion Metropolitan Bishops became Archbishops.

True it is, they were equals as touching the exercise of Spiritual power within their Dioceses, when they dealt with their own flock. For what is it that one of them might do within the compass of his own precinct, but another within his might do the same? But that there was no subordination at all, of one of them unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that when they all, or sundry of them, were to deal in the same Causes, there was no difference of first and second in degree, no distinction of higher and lower in authority acknowledged amongst them, is most untrue. The Great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was after our Saviour Christ but three hundred twenty four years, and in that Council, certain Metropolitans are said even then to have had antient preheminence and dignity above the rest, namely, the Primate of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Threescore years after this, there were Synods under the Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> which Synod was the first at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>

What he challenged, and was therein as then refused by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; the same, the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in process of time obtained for himself, and having

But Primates, according to their first Institution,<note place="margin">Novel 123. 22.</note> were all in relation unto Archbishops, the same by Prerogative, which Archbishops were, being compared unto Bishops. Before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> albeit there were both Metropolitans and Primates, yet could not this be a means forcible enough to procure the peace of the Church; but all things were wonderful tumultuous and troublesome, by reason of one special practise common unto the Heretiques of those times, which was, That when they had been condemned and cast out of the Church by the Sentence of their own Bishops, they, contrary to the antient recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Orders of the Church, had a custom to wander up and down, and to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselves into favour where they were not known; imagining themselves to be safe enough, and not to be clean cut off from the body of the Church, if they could any where finde a Bishop which was content to communicate with them: whereupon ensued, as in that case there needs must, every day quarrels and jarrs unappeasable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Bishops. The <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, for redress hereof, considered the bounds of every Archbishop's Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions, what they had been in former times; and accordingly appointed unto each grand part of the Christian World some one Primate, from whose Judgement no man living within his Territory might appeal, unless it were to a Council General of all Bishops. The drift and purport of which order was, That neither any man opprest by his own particular Bishop might be destitute of a remedy, through appeal unto the more indifferent Sentence of some other ordinary Judge, not yet every man be lest at such liberty as before, to shift himself out of their hands; for whom it was most meet to have the hearing and determining of his cause. The evil, for remedy whereof this order was taken, annoyed at that present, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where Arianism begun.

His Speech was rather furious than convenient for man to use, <hi>What is,</hi> saith he, <hi>a Bishop more than a Presbyter? The one doth differ from the other nothing. For their Order as one, their Honour one, one their Dignity. A Bishop imposeth his hands, so doth a Presbyter. A Bishop baptizeth, the like doth a Presbyter. The Bishop is a Minister of Divine Service, a Presbyter is the same. The Bishop sitteth as a Iudge in a Throne, even the Presbyter fitteth also. A Presbyter therefore doing thus far the self-same thing which a Bishop did, it was by</hi> Aerius <hi>inforced, that they ought not in any thing to differ.</hi> Are we to think <hi>Aerius</hi> had wrong in being judged an Heretick for holding this opinion? Surely if Heresie be an error, falsely fathered upon Scriptures, but indeed repugnant to the truth of the Word of God, and by the consent of the universal Church, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; or in her contrary uniform practice throughout the whole world, declared to be such, and the opinion of <hi>Aerius</hi> in this point be a plain error of that nature, there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but <hi>Aerius</hi> so schismatically, and stifly maintaining it, must even stand where <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> have placed him. An error repugnant unto the truth of the Word of God is held by them whosoever they be, that stand in defence of any Conclusion drawn erroneously out of Scripture, and untruely thereon fathered. The opinion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erius</hi> therefore being falsely collected out of Scripture, must needs be acknowledged an error repugnant unto the truth of the Word of God. His opinion was, that there ought not to be any difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter. His grounds and reasons for this Opinion, were Sentences of Scripture. Under pretence of which Sentences, whereby it seemed that Bishops and Presbyters at the first did not differ, it was concluded by <hi>Aerius,</hi> that the Church did ill in permitting any difference to be made.

Let it therefore suffice, that <hi>Aerius</hi> did bring nothing unanswerable. The weak Solutions which the one doth give, are to us no prejudice against the Cause, as long as the others oppositions are of no greater strength and validity. Did not <hi>Aerius,</hi> trow you, deserve to be esteemed as a new <hi>Apollos,</hi> mighty and powerful in the Word, which could for maintenance of his Cause, bring forth so plain Divine Authorities, to prove by the Apostles own Writings, that Bishops ought not in any thing to differ from other Presbyters? For example, where it is said that Presbyters made <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop, is it not clear, that a Bishop should not differ from a Presbyter, by having power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Again, if a Bishop might by Order be distinguished from a Presbyter, would the Apostle have given,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14. with the Impesition of the Presbyteries hand.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66185:247"/>
These were the invincible demonstrations wherewith <hi>Aerius</hi> did so fiercely assault Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. But the Sentence of <hi>Aerius</hi> perhaps was only, that the difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter, hath grown by the order and custom of the Church, the Word of God not appointing that any such difference should be. Well, let <hi>Aerius</hi> then finde the favour to have his Sentence so construed; yet his fault in condemning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church, his not submitting himself unto that Order, the Schism which he caused in the Church about it, who can excuse? No, the truth is, that these things did even necessarily ensue, by force of the very opinion which he and his followers did hold. His conclusion was, That there ought to be no difference between a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a Bishop. His proofs, those Scripture-sentences which make mention of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters, without any such distinction or difference. So that if between his Conclusion and the Proofs whereby he laboured to strengthen the same, there be any shew of coherence at all, we must of necessity confess, that when <hi>Aerius</hi> did plead, There is by the Word of God no difference between a Presbyter, and a Bishop; his meaning was, not only that the Word of God it self appointeth nor, but that it enforceth on us the duty of not appointing, nor allowing, that any such difference should be made.</p>

And of the self-same minde are the Enemies of Government by Bishops, even at this present day. They hold, as <hi>Aerius</hi> did, that if Christ and his Apostles were obeyed, a Bishop should not be permitted to ordain: that between a Presbyter and a Bishop the Word of God alloweth not any inequality or difference to be made; that their Order, their Authority, their Power ought to be one; that it is but by usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption, that the one sort are suffered to have rule of the other, or to be any way superiour unto them. Which opinion having now so many Defenders, shall never be able while the World doth stand, to finde in some, believing Antiquity, as much as one which hath given it countenance, or born any friendly affection towards it. Touching these men therefore, whose desire is to have all equal, three ways there are, whereby they usually oppugn the received Order of the Church of Christ. First, by disgracing the inequality of Pastors, as a new and meer Human invention, a thing which was never drawn our of Scripture, where all Pastors are found (they say) to have one and the same power, both of Order and Jurisdiction. Secondly, by gathering together the differences between that power which we give to Bishops, and that which was given them of old in the Church: So that, albeit even the antient took more than was warrantable, yet so farr they swerved not as ours have done. Thirdly, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prove, that the Scripture directly forbiddeth, and that the judgement of the wisest, the holyest, the best in all Ages, condemneth utterly the inequality which we allow.</p>

                     </note> that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture affordeth no evidence for the inequality of Pastors. Secondly, That, albeit the Scripture did no way insinuate the same to be God's Ordinance, and the Apostles to have brought it in, albeit the Church were acknowledged by all men to have been the first beginner thereof, a long time after the Apostles were gone; yet is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Bishops hereby disannulled, it is not hereby proved unfit, or unprofitable for the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Word of God doth acknowledge no inequality of power amongst Pastors of the Church, neither doth it appear by the signification of this word <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor by the indifferent use thereof. For, concerning signification, first it is clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, that no other thing is thereby signified, but only an oversight in respect of a particular Church and Congregation. For, I beseech you, of what Parish, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation was <hi>Matthias</hi> Bishop? His Office Scripture doth term Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal:<note place="margin">Acts 1. 22.</note> which being no other than was common unto all the Apostles of Christ; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as in that number there is not any to whom the oversight of many Pastors did not belong, by force and vertue of that Office; it followeth, that the very Word doth sometimes, even in Scripture, signifie oversight, such as includeth charge over Pastors themselves. And if we look to the use of the Word, being applyed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto some one Church, as <hi>Ephesus, Philippi,</hi> and such like, albeit the Guides of those Churches be interchangeably in Scripture termed sometime Bishops, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Presbyters, to signifie men having oversight and charge, without relation at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other than the, Christian Laity alone, yet this doth not hinder, but that Scripture may in some place have other names, whereby certain of those Presbyters or Bishops, are noted to have the oversight and charge of Pastors, as out of all peradventure they had, whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth intitle Angels.<note place="margin">Revel. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for those things which the Apostle hath set down concerning Tryal, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Ordination of Pastors, that he maketh no difference in the manner of their Calling, this also is but a silly Argument to prove their Office and their Power equal by the Scripture. The form of admitting each sort unto their Offices, needed no particular Instruction: There was no fear, but that such matters of course would easily enough be observed. The Apostle therefore toucheth those things wherein Judgement, Wisdom, and Conscience is required, he carefully admonisheth of what quality Ecclesiastical Persons should be, that their dealing might not be scandalous in the Church. And forasmuch as those things are general, we see that of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons there are delivered, in a manner, the self-same Precepts, which are given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pastors, so farr as concerneth their Tryal, Election, and Ordination. Yet who doth hereby collect, that Scripture maketh Deacons and Pastors equal? If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it be yet demanded, <hi>Wherefore he which teatcheth what kinde of Persons
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66185:248"/>
Deacons and Presbyters should be, hath nothing in particular about the quality of chief Presbyters, whom we call Bishops</hi>? I answer briefly, that there it was no fit place for any such discourse to be made, inasmuch as the Apostle wrote unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who having by Commission Episcopal Authority, were to exercise the same in ordaining, not Bishops (the Apostles themselves yet living, and retaining that power in their own hands) but Presbyters, such as the Apostles at the first did cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate throughout all Churches. Bishops by restraint (only <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) were not yet in being.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. About equality amongst the Apostles, there is by us no Controversie moved. If in the rooms of the Apostles, which were of equal Authority, all Pastors do by Scripture succeed alike, where shall we finde a Commission in Scripture which they speak of, which appointed all to succeed in the self-same equality of power, except that Commission which doth authorize to Preach and Baptise, should be alledged, which maketh nothing to the purpose; for in such things, all Pastors are still equal: We must, I fear me, wait very long before any other will be shewed. For howsoever the Apostles were Equals amongst themselves, all other Pastors were not Equals with the Apostles while they lived, neither are they any where appointed to be afterward each others Equals. Apostles had, as we know, authority over all such as were no Apostles; by force of which their Authority, they might both command and judge. It was for the singular good and benefit of those Disciples whom Christ left behinde him, and of the Pastors which were afterwards chosen; for the great good, I say, of all sorts, that the Apostles were in power above them. Every day brought forth somewhat wherein they saw by experience, how much it stood them in stead to be under controulment of those Superiours and Higher Governours of Gods House. Was it a thing so behoveful, that Pastors should be subject unto Pastors in the Apostles own times? and is there any commandment that this Subjection should cease with them? and that the Pastors of the succeeding Ages should be all Equals? No, no, this strange and absurd conceit of Equality amongst Pastors (the Mother of Schism, and of Confusion) is but a dream newly brought forth, and seen never in the Church before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Power of Censure and Ordination appeareth even by Scripture marvellous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, to have been derived from Christ to his Church, without this surmised Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them to whom he hath committed the same. For I would know, Whether <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were commanded by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to do any thing, more than Christ hath authorized Pastors to do; And to the one it is Scripture which saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Against a Presbyter receive THOU no accusation, saving under two or three Witnesses:</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which likewise hath said to the other,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>For this very cause left I THEE in</hi> Crete, <hi>that THOU shouldst redress the things that remain, and shouldst ORDAIN Presbyters in every City, as I appointed THEE.</hi> In the former place the power of Censure is spoken of, and the power of Ordination in the latter. Will they say that every Pastor there was equal to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in these things? If they do, the Apostle himself is against it, who saith, that, of their two very Persons, he had made choyse, and appointed in those places them, for performances of those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereas, if the same had belonged unto others, no less than to them, and not principally unto them above others, it had been fit for the Apostle accordingly to have directed his Letters concerning these things in general unto them all which had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual interest in them; even as it had been likewise fit to have written those Epistles in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Revelation, unto whole Ecclesiastical Senates, rather than only unto the Angels of each Church, had not some one been above the rest in Authority, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affairs of the Church. Scripture therefore doth most probably make for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of Pastors, even in all Ecclesiastical affairs, and by very express mention, as well in Censures as Ordinations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council there are consumed certain Prerogatives and Dignities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto Primates or Archbishops, and of them it is said, that the antient custom of the Church, had been to give them such preheminence, but no syllable whereby any man should conjecture, that those Fathers did not honor the Superiority which Bishops had over other Pastors, only upon antient custom, and not as a true Apostolical heavenly and divine Ordinance.</p>

There came Chief Priests and Elders unto our Saviour Christ as he was teaching in the Temple, and the Question which they moved unto him was this, <hi>By what Authority dost thou these things, and who gave thee this Authority?</hi> their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion he repelled with a Counter-demand, <hi>The Baptism of</hi> John <hi>whence was it, from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> Hereat they paused, secretly disputing within themselves, <hi>If we shall say from Heaven, he will ask, Wherefore did ye not then believe him? And if we say of men, We fear the People,</hi> for all hold <hi>Iohn</hi> a Prophet. What is it now which hereupon these men would infer? That all-Functions Ecclesiastical, ought in such sort to be from Heaven, as the Function of <hi>Iohn</hi> was I No such matter here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Nay, doth not the contrary rather appear most plainly by that which is here set down? For when our Saviour doth ask concerning the Baptism, that is to say, the whole Spiritual Function of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whether it were from Heaven or of men, he giveth clearly to understand that men give Authority unto some, and some God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from Heaven doth Authorize. Nor is it said, or in any sort signified, that none have lawful Authority which have it not in such manner as <hi>Iohn,</hi> from Heaven. Again, when the Priests and Elders were loth to say, that <hi>Iohn</hi> had his calling from men, the reason was not because they thought that so <hi>Iohn</hi> should not have had any good or lawful Calling, but because they saw, that by this means they should somewhat embase the Calling of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom all men knew to have been sent from God, according to the manner of Prophets, by a meer Celestial vocation. So that out of the evidence here alledged, these things we may directly conclude, first, that who so doth exercise any kinde of Function in the Church, he cannot lawfully so do, except Authority be given him; Secondly, that if Authority be not given him from men, as the Authority of Teaching was given unto Scribes and Pharisees, it must be given him from Heaven, as Authority was given unto <hi>Christ, Elias, Iohn Baptist,</hi> and the Prophets. For these two only wayes there are to have Authority. But a strange Conclusion it is, God himself did from Heaven authorize <hi>Iohn</hi> to bear Witness of the light, to prepare a way for the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> to publish the nearness of the Kingdom of God, to Preach Repentance, and to Baptise (for by this part which was in the Function of <hi>Iohn</hi> most noted, all the rest are together signified;) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of God hath no power upon new occurences to appoint, to ordain an Ecclesiastical Function, as <hi>Moses</hi> did upon <hi>Iethroe</hi>'s advice devise a civil. All things we grant which are in the Church ought to be of God. But, for as much as they may be two wayes accounted such: one, if they be of his own institution, and not of ours; another if they be of ours, and yet with his approbation, this latter way there is no impediment, but that the same thing which is of men, may be also justly and truly said to be of God, the same thing from Heaven which is from Earth. Of all good things God himself is Author, and consequently an Approver of them. The rule to discern when the actions of men are good, when they are such as they ought to be, is more ample and large than the Law which God hath set particular down in his holy Word, the Scripture is but a part of that rule as hath been heretofore at large declared. If therefore all things be of God which are well done;<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> and if all things be well done, which are according unto the rule of well doing; and if the rule of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing be more ample than the Scripture; what necessity is there, that every thing
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66185:249"/>
which is of God, should be set down in holy Scripture? true it is in things of some one kinde, true it is, that what we are now of necessity for ever bound to believe or observe in the special mysteries of Salvation, Scripture must needs give notice of it unto the World; yet true it cannot be, touching all things that are of God. Sufficient it is for the proof of lawfulness in any thing done, if we canshew that God approved it. And of his approbation, the evidence is sufficient, if either himself have by revelation in his word warranted it, or we by some discourse of reason, finde it good of it self, and unrepugnant unto any of his revealed Laws and Ordinances. Wherefore injurious we are unto God, the Author and Giver of Human capacity, Judgement and Wit, when, because of some things wherein he precisely forbiddeth men to use their own inventions, we take occasion to dis-authorize and disgrace the works which he doth produce by the hand, either of nature or of grace in them. We offer contumely, even unto him, when we scornfully reject what we lift without any other exception than this, <hi>The brain of man hath devised it.</hi> Whether we look into the Church or Common-weal, as well in the one as in the other, both the Ordination of Officers, and the very institution of their Offices may be truly derived from God, and approved of him, although they be not always of him in such sort as those things are which are in Scripture. Doth not the Apostle term the Law of Nature even as the Evangelist doth the Law of Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">

Great odds, I grant, there is between things devised by men, although agreeable with the Law of Nature, and things is Scripture set down by the finger of the Holy Ghost. Howbeit the dignity of these is no hinderance, but that those be also reverently accounted of in their Place.

For the Question is about Personal ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality amongst Governors of the Church. Now to shew there was no such thing in the Church at such time as <hi>Cyprian</hi> lived, what bring they forth? Forsooth, that Bishops had then but a small circuit of place for the exercise of their Authority. Be it supposed, that no one Bishop had more than one only Town to govern, one only Congregation to rule: Doth it by <hi>Cyprian</hi> appear, that in any such Town of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, being under the cure and charge of someone Bishops, there were not, besides that one Bishop, others also Ministers of the Word and Sacraments, yet subject to the power of the same Bishop? If this appear not, how can <hi>Cyprian</hi> be alledged for a Witness, that in those times there were no Bishops which did differ from other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as being above them in degree of Ecclesiastical power? But a gross and a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble untruth it is, <hi>That Bishops with</hi> Cyprian, <hi>were as Ministers are with us in Parish-Churches; and that each of them did guide some Parish without any other Pastors under him.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s own Person may serve for a manifest disproof hereof. <hi>Pomius</hi> being Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con under <hi>Cyprian</hi> noteth, that his admirable vertues caused him to be Bishop with the soonest; which advancement therefore himself endeavoured for a while to avoid. It seemed in his own eyes too soon for him to take the title of so great Honor, in regard whereof a Bishop is tenned <hi>Pourisex, Sacerdos, Antistes Dei.</hi> Yet such was his quality, that whereas others did hardly perform that duty, whereunto the Discipline of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, togetherwith the Religion of the Oath they took at their entrance into the Office even constrained them; him the Chair did not make, but receive such a one, as beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that a Bishop should be.

Presbyters of <hi>Carthage</hi> were Ministers of the Word and Sacraments or no, let him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider but that one only place of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where he giveth them this careful advice, how to deal with circumspection in the perilous times of the Church, that neither they which were for the truths sake imprisoned, might want those Ghostly comforts which they ought to have, nor the Church by ministring the same unto them, incurr unnecessary danger and peril. In which Epistle it doth expresly appear, that the Presbyters of whom he speaketh, did offer, that is to say, administer the Eucharist; and that many there were of them in the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> so as they might have every day change for performance of that duty. Nor will any man of sound Judgement I think deny, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was in Authority and Power above the Clergy of that Church, above those Presbyters unto whom he gave direction. It is apparently therefore untrue, that in <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s time, Ministers of the Word and Sacraments were all equal, and that no one of them had either Title more excellent than the rest, or Authority and Government over the rest, <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was clearly Superiour unto all other Ministers there: Yea, <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, by reason of the Dignity of his See an Archbishop, and so consequently Superiour unto Bishops. Bishops, we say, there have been alwayes, even as long as the Church of Christ it self hath been. The Apostles who planted it, did themselves rule as Bishops over it, neither could they so well have kept things in order during their own times, but that Episcopal Authority was given them from above, to exercise far and wice over all other Guides and Pastors of God's Church. The Church indeed for a time continued without Bishops by restraint, every where established in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Cities. But shall we thereby conclude, that the Church hath no use of them, that without them it may stand and flourish? No, the cause wherefore they were so soon universally appointed was, for that it plainly appeared, that, without them, the Church could not have continued long. It was by the special Providence of God no doubt so disposed, that the evil whereof this did serve for remedy, might first be felt, and so the reverend Authority of Bishops be made by so much the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, when our general experience had taught men what it was for Churches to want them. Good Laws are never esteemed so good, not acknowledged so necessary, as when precedent crimes are as seeds out of which they grow. Episcopal Authority was even in a manner sanctified unto the Church of Christ, by that little bitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which it first had of the pestilent evil of Schismes. Again, when this very thing was proposed as a remedy, yet a more suspicions and fearful acceptance it must needs have found, if the self-same provident Wisdom of Almighty God, had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so given before-hand sufficient tryal thereof in the Regiment of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a Mother-Church, which having received the same order even at the first, was by it most peaceably governed, when other Churches without it had trouble. So that by all means, the necessary use of Episcopal Government is confirmed, yea strengthened it is and ratified, even by the not establishment thereof in all Churches every where at the first. 2. When they further dispute, <hi>That if any such thing were usedful, Christ would in Scripture have set down particular Statutes and Laws, appointing that Bishops should be made, and prescribing in what order, even as the Law doth for all kinde of Officers which were needful in the Iewish Regiment</hi>; might not a man that would bend his wit to maintain the fury of the <hi>Petrobrusian</hi> Hereticks, in pulling down Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, use the self-same argument, with as much countenance of reason? <hi>If it were needful that we should assemble our selves in Churches, would that God which taught the Iews so exactly the frame of their sumptuous Temple, leave us no particular instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in writing, no not so much at which way to lay any one stone?</hi> Surely such kinde of Argumentation doth not so strengthen the sinews of their cause, as weaken the credit of their Judgement which are led therewith. 3. And whereas Thirdly, in disproof of that use which Episcopal Authority hath in Judgement of Spiritual Causes, they bring forth the verdict of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who saith,<note place="margin">Cypr. lib. 1.

The Reasons which teach it to be expedient for the one, will shew it to be for the other, at leastwise, not unnecessary.

Be it granted, that ordinarily neither in elections nor deprivations, neither in excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, nor in releasing the excommunicate; in none of the weighty affairs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Bishops of old were wont to do any thing without consultation with their Clergy, and consent of the People under them. Be it granted, that the same Bishops did neither touch any man with corporal punishment, nor meddle with secular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Offices, the whole Clergy of God being then tyed by the strict and severe Canons of the Church, to use no other than ghostly power, to attend no other business than heavenly.<note place="margin">Liv. lib. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was in the Roman Common-wealth deservedly hated, of whose unorderly proceedings the History speaketh thus, <hi>Hic Regum primus traditum à Prioribus morem de omnibus Senatum consulendi solvit; domesticis Consillis Rempub. administravit, bellum, pacem, foedera, societates, perse ipsum cum quibus voluit injussu Populi ac Senatus, fecit diremitque.</hi> Against Bishops the like is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>That they are Invaders of other mens right, and by intolerable usurpation take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to do that alone, wherein antient Laws have appointed, that others, not they onely, should bear sway.</hi> Let the Case of Bishops he put, not in such sort as it is, but even as their very heavyest Adversaries would devise it: Suppose that Bishops at the first had encroached upon the Church, that by sleights and cunning practises they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Ecclesiastical, as <hi>Augustus</hi> did Imperial, power; that they had taken the advantage of mens inclinable affections, which did not suffer them for Revenue-sake to be suspected of Ambition; that in the mean while their usurpation had gone forward by certain easie and unsensible degrees, that being not discerned in the growth, when it was thus farr grown, as we now see it hath proceeded, the world at length perceiving there was just cause of complaint, but no place of remedy left, had assented unto it by a general secret agreement to bear it now as an helpless evil: all this supposed for certain and true, yet surely a thing of this nature, as for the Superiour to do that alone, unto which of right the consent of some other Inferiours should have been required by them; though it had an indirect entrance at the first, must needs through continuance of so many ages as this hath stood be made now a thing more natural to the Church, than that it should be opprest with the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of contrary Orders worn so many ages since quite and clean out of ure. But with Bishops the case is otherwise; For in doing that by themselves, which others together with them have been accustomed to do, they do not any thing, but that whereunto they have been, upon just occasion authorized by orderly means. All things natural, have in them naturally, more or less, the power of providing for their own safety: And, as each particular man hath this power, so every Politick Society of men must needs have the same, that thereby the whole may provide for
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:66185:251"/>
the good of all parts therein. For other benefit we have not any, by sorting our selves into Politick Societies, saving only that by this mean each part hath that relief, which the vertue of the whole is able to yield it. The Church therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Politick Society or Body, cannot possibly want the power of providing for it self: And the chiefest part of that power consisteth in the Authority of making Laws. Now, forasmuch as Corporations are perpetual, the Laws of the antienter Church cannot chuse but binde the latter, while they are in force. But we must note withal, that, because the body of the Church continueth the same, it hath the same Authority still, and may abrogate old Laws, or make new, as need shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Wherefore vainly are the antient Canons and Constitutions objected as Laws, when once they are either let secretly to dye by dis-usage, or are openly abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by contrary Laws. The Antient had cause to do no otherwise than they did; and yet so strictly they judged not themselves in Conscience bound to observe those Orders, but that in sundry cases they easily dispensed therewith, which I suppose they would never have done, had they esteemed them as things whereunto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, immutable, and undispensible observation did belong. The Bishop usually promoted none, which were not first allowed as fit, by conference had with the rest of his Clergy, and with the People: Notwithstanding, in the case of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> did otherwise. In matters of Deliberation and Counsel, for disposing of that which belongeth generally to the whole body of the Church, or which being more particular, is nevertheless of so great consequence, that it needeth the force of many Judgements conferred; in such things the common saying must necessarily take place, <hi>An Eye cannot see that which Eyes can.</hi> As for Clerical Ordinations, there are no such reasons alledged against the Order which is, but that it may be esteemed as good in every respect, as that which hath been; and, in some considerations, better, at leastwise (which is sufficient to our purpose) it may be held in the Church of Christ, without transgressing any Law, either Antient or Late, Divine or Human. which we ought to observe and keep. The form of making Ecclesiastical Officers, hath sundry parts, neither are they all of equal moment. When Deacons having not been before in the Church of Christ, the Apostles saw it needful to have such ordained: They, first, assemble the multitude, and shew them how needful it is that Deacons be made. Secondly, they name unto them what number they judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, what quality the men must be of, and to the People they commit the care of finding such out. Thirdly, the People hereunto assenting, make their choyce of <hi>Stephen</hi> and the rest; those chosen men they bring and present before the Apostles: Howbeit, all this doth not endue them with any Ecclesiastical Power. But when so much was done, the Apostles finding no cause to take exception, did with Prayer and imposition of hands, make them Deacons. This was it which gave them their very being, all other things besides were only preparations unto this. Touching the form of making Presbyters, although it be not wholly of purpose anywhere set down in the Apostles Writings, yet sundry speeches there are, which insinuate the chiefest things that belong unto that Action: As when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are said to have fasted, prayed, and made Presbyters: When <hi>Timothy</hi> is willed to lay hands suddenly on no man, for fear of participating with other mens sins. For this cause the Order of the Primitive Church was, between Choyce and Ordination to have some space for such Probation and Tryal as the Apostle doth mention in Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, saying, <hi>Let them first be proved, and then minister, if so be they be found blameless.</hi>

                     <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> beholding in his time how careful the Church of Christ was, especially for this point; how, after the choyce of their Pastors, they used to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the names of the Parties chosen, and not to give them the final act of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, till they saw whether any lett or impediment would be alledged; he gave Commandment, That the like should also be done in his own Imperial Elections, adding this as a Reason wherefore he so required, namely, <hi>For that both Christians and Iews being so wary about the Ordination of their Priests, it seemed very unequal for him not to be in like sort circumspect, to whom he committed the Government of Provinces, containing power over mens both Estates and Lives.</hi> This the Canon Law it self doth provide for, requiring before Ordination scrutiny:

                  <p>The pretended disorder of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, that Bishops Ordain them, to whose Election the People give no voyces, and so the Bishops make them alone, that is to say, they give Ordination without Popular Election going before, which antient Bishops neither did nor might do. Now in very truth, if the multitude have hereunto a right, which right can never be translated from them for any cause, then is there no remedy but we must yield, that unto the lawful making of Ministers, the voyce of the People is required; and that, according to the Adverse Parties Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as make Ministers without asking the Peoples consent,<note place="margin">Eccl dis p 14</note> do but exercise a certain Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>At the first Erection of the Common-weals of <hi>Rome,</hi> the People (for so it was then fittest) determined of all affairs: Afterwards, this growing troublesome, their Senators did that for them, which themselves before had done: In the end all came to one man's hands, and the Emperour alone was instead of many Senators.</p>
                  <p>In these things, the experience of time may breed both Civil and Ecclesiastical change from that which hath been before received, neither do latter things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways violently exclude former, but the one grawing less convenient then it hath been, giveth place to that which is now become more. That which was fit for the People themselves to do at the first, might afterwards be more convenient for them to do by some other: Which other is not thereby proved a Tyrant, because he alone doth that which a multitude were wont to do, unless by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he take that Authority upon him, against the Order of Law, and without any publick appointment; as with us, if any did, it should (I suppose) not long be safe for him so to do.</p>
                  <p>This Answer (I hope) will seem to be so much the more reasonable, in that themselves, who stand against us, have furnish'd us, therewith, For, whereas against the making of Ministers by Bishops alone, their use hath been to object, What sway the People did bear when <hi>Stephen</hi> and rest were ordained Deacons: They begin to espy how their own Plat-form swerveth not a little from that example wherewith they controul the practices of others. For, touching the form of the Peoples concurrence in that Action, they observe it not; no, they plainly profess, that they are not in this point bound to be followers of the Apostles. The Apostles Ordained whom the People had first chosen. They hold, that their Ecclesiastical Senate ought both to choose, and also to Ordain. Do not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves then take away that which the Apostles gave the People, namely, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of chusing Ecclesiastical Officers? They do. But behold in what sort they answer it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the sixth and the fourteenth of the</hi> Acts (say they) <hi>it doth appear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. Discipl. fol. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>that the people had the chiefest power of chusing. Howbeit that, as unto me it seemeth, was dine upon speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cause, which doth not so much concern us, neither ought it to be drawn unto the ordinary and perpetual form of governing the Church: For, as in establishing Common-weals, not only if they be popular, but even being such as are ordered by the power of a few the chiefest, or as by the sole Authority of one till the same he established, the whole sway is in the Peoples hands, who voluntarily appoint those Magistrates by whose Authority they may be governed; so that afterward not the multitude it self, but those Magistrates which were chosen by the multitude, have the ordering of Publick Affairs: After the self-same manner is fared in establishing also the Church: When there was not as yet any placed over the People, all Authority was in them all; but when they all had chosen certain to whom the Regiment of the Church was committed, this power is not now any longer in the hands of the whole multitude, but wholly in theirs who are appointed Guides of the Church. Besides, in the choyce of Deacons, there was also another special cause wherefore the whole Church as that time should chuse them. For inasmuch as the Grecians murmured against the Hebrews, and complained, that in the duly distribution which was made for relief of the poor, they were
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:66185:252"/>
not indifferently respected, nor such regard had of their Widows as was meet; this made it necessary that they all should have to deal in the choyce of those unto whom that care was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be committed, to the end that all occasion of jealousies and complaints might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Wherefore that which was done by the People for certain Causes, before the Church was sully settled, may not be drawn out, and applyed unto a constant and perpetual form of ordering the Church.</hi>

                  <p>Let them cast the Discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> into the same scales where they weigh their own, let them give us the same measure which here they take, and our strifes shall soon be brought to a quiet end. When they urge the Apostles as Precedents; when they condemn us of Tyranny, because we do not, in making Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the same which the Apostles did; when they plead, <hi>That with us one alone doth ordain, and that our Ordinations are without the Peoples knowledge, contrary to that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which the blessed Apostles gave:</hi> We do not request at their hands allowance as much as of one word we speak in our own defence, if that which we speak be of our own: but that which themselves speak, they must be content to listen unto. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themselves from being over-farr prest with the Apostles example, they can answer, <hi>That which was done by the People once upon special Causes, when the Church was not yet established, is not to be made a rule for the constant and continual ordering of the Church.</hi> In defence of their own Election, although they do not therein depend on the People so much as the Apostles in the choyce of Deacons, they think it a very sufficient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that there were special considerations why Deacons at that time should be chosen by the whole Church, but not so now. In excuse of dissimilitudes between their own and the Apostles Discipline, they are contented to use this Answer, <hi>That many things were done in the Apostles times, before the settling of the Church, which afterward the Church was not tyed to observe.</hi> For countenance of their own proceedings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Governors do more than the Apostles, and their People less than under the Apostles the first Churches are found to have done, at the making of Ecclesiastical Officers, they deem it a marvellous reasonable kinde of Pleading to say, <hi>That even as in Common-wealt, when the multitude have once chosen many, or one to rule over them, the right which was at the first in the whole body of the People, is now derived into those many, or that one which it so chosen; and that this being done, it is not the whole multitude, to whom the administration of such Publick affairs any longer appertaineth, but that which they did, their Rulers may now do lawfully without them: After the self-same manner it slandeth with the Church also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How easie and plain might we make our defence? how clear and allowable even unto them, it we could but obtain of them to admit the same things consonant unto equity in our mouths, which they require to be so taken from their own? If that which is truth, being uttered in maintenance of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> do not cease to be truth when the Church of <hi>England</hi> once alledgeth it; this great crime of Tyranny wherewith we are charged, hath a plain and an easie defence? Yea, But we do not at all aske the Peoples approbation, which they do, whereby they shew themselves more indifferent and more free from taking away the Peoples right. Indeed, when their Lay-Elders have chosen whom they think good, the Peoples consent thereunto is asked, and, if they give their approbation, the thing standeth warranted for sound and good. But if not, is the former choyce overthrown? No, but the People is to yield to reason; and, if they which have made the choyce, do so like the Poeples rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as to reverse their own deed at the hearing of it, then a new election to be made; otherwise the former to stand, notwithstanding the Peoples negative and dislike. What is this else but to deal with the People, as those Nurses do with Infants,<note place="margin">Eccles. Discip. p. 41.</note> whose mouths they besmear with the backside of the spoon, as though they had fed them, when they themselves devour the food. They cry in the ears of the People, that all mens consent should be had unto that which concerns all; they make the People believe we wrong them, and deprive them of their right in making Ministers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, with us, the People have commonly farr more sway and force then with them. For inasmuch as there are but two main things observed in every Ecclesiastical functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Power to exercise the duty it self, and some charge of People whereon to exercise the same; the former of these is received at the hands of the whole visible Catholick Church: For it is not any one particular multitude that can give power, the force

whereof may reach farr and wide indefinitely, as the power of Order doth, which whoso hath once received, there is no action which belongeth thereunto, but he may exercise effectually the same in any part of the World, without iterated Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.

Such were the Apostles, such was <hi>Timothy,</hi> such was <hi>Titus,</hi> such are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.<note place="margin">Neque enim sas crae aut licebat ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter major in: Coment, q.

                        </gap>.</note> To this we answer. That there may be sometimes very just and sufficient reason to allow Ordination made without a Bishop. The whole Church visible being the true original subject of all power, it hath not ordinarily allowed any other than Bishops alone to ordain: Howbeit, as the ordinary course is ordinarily in all things to be observed, so it may be in some cases not unnecessary that we decline from the ordinary wayes. Men may be extraordinarily, yet allowably, two wayes admitted unto Spiritual Functions in the Church. One is, when God himself doth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self raise up any, whose labour be useth without requiring that men should Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize them. But then he doth ratifie their Calling by manifest signes and tokens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from Heaven. And thus even such as believed not our Saviours teaching, did yet acknowledge him a lawful Teacher sent from God: <hi>Thou art a Teacher sent from God, otherwise none could do those things which thou dost. Luther</hi> did but reasonably therefore, in declaring that the Senate of <hi>Mulheuse</hi> should do well to ask of <hi>Muncer,</hi> From whence he received power to teach? who it was that had called him? And if his answer were, that God had given him his Charge, then to require at his hands some evident sign thereof for men's satisfaction; because so God is wont, when he himself is the Author of any extraordinary Calling. Another extraordinary kinde of Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, when the exigence of necessity doth constrain to leave the usual wayes of the Church, which otherwise we would willingly keep: Where the Church must needs have some ordained, and neither hath, nor can have possibly a Bishop to ordain; in case of such necessity, the ordinary Institution of God hath given oftentimes, and may give, place. And therefore we are not, simply without exception, to urge a lineal descent of power from the Apostles by continued succession of Bishops in every effectual Ordination. These cases of inevitable necessity excepted, none may ordain but only Bishops: By the imposition of their hands it is, that the Church giveth power of Order, both unto Presbyters and Deacons. Now, when that power so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived is once to have any certain Subject whereon it may work, and whereunto it is to be tyed, <hi>here cometh in the Peoples consent, and not before.</hi> The power of Order I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receive, without asking leave of any multitude; but that power I cannot exercise upon any one certain People utterly against their wills; Neither is there in the Church of <hi>England</hi> any man, by order of Law, possessed with Pastoral charge over any Parish, but the People in effect do chuse him thereunto. For, albeit they chuse not by giving every man personally his particular voyce, yet can they not say, that they have their Pastors violently obtruded upon them, in as much as their antient and original interest
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:66185:253"/>
therein, hath been by orderly means derived into the Patron who chuseth for them. And if any man be desirous to know how Petrons came to have such interest, we are to consider, that at the first erection of Churches, it seemed but reasonable in the eyes of the whole Christian World, to pass that right to them and their Successors, on whose soyl, and at whose charge the same were founded. This all men gladly and willingly did, both in honor of so great Piety, and for encouragement of many others unto the like, who peradventure else, would have been as slow to erect Churches, or to endow them, as we are forward both to spoyl them, and to pull them down.</p>
                  <p>Its no true assertion therefore, in such sort as the pretended Reformers mean it, <hi>That all Ministers of God's Word ought to be made by consent of many, that is to say, by the Peoples saffrages; that antient Bishops neither did nor might or dain otherwise; and that ours do herein usurp a farr greater power than was, or then lawfully could have been granted unto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops which were of old.</hi> Furthermore, as touching Spiritual Jurisdiction, our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, they say, do that which of all things is most intollerable, and which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient never did, <hi>Our Bishops excommunicate and release alone, whereas the Censures of the Church neither ought, nor were want to be administred otherwise, then by consent of many.</hi> Their meaning here when they speak of Many, is not as before it was: When they hold that Ministers should be made with consent of many, they understand by <hi>Many,</hi> the Multitude, or Common People; but in requiring that many should evermore joyn with the Bishop in the administration of Church-censures, they mean by Many, a few Lay-Elders, chosen out of the rest of the People to that purpose, This, they say,<note place="margin">Cencil.

                  <p>And is it possible, that one so grave and judicious should think it in earnest Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for a Bishop to excommunicate, whom Law and Order hath authorized so to do? or be perswaded, that Ecclesiast<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Surely, farr meaner-witted men than the World accounteth Mr. <hi>Reza,</hi> do easily perceive, that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is Power violently exercised against Order, against Law; and that the difference of these two Regiments, Ecclesiastical and Civil, consisteth in the matter about which the actions of each are conversant; and not in this, that Civil Royalty admitteth but one, Ecclesiastical Government requireth many Supreme Correctors. Which Allegation, were it true, would prove no more than only, that some certain number is necessary for the assistance of the Bishop: But that a number of such as they do require is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, how doth it prove? Wherefore albeit Bishops should now do the very same which the Antients did, using the Colledge of Presbyters under them as their Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, when they administer Church-Censures, yet should they still swerve utterly from that which these men so busily labour for, because the Agents whom they require to assist in those Cases, are a sort of Lay-Elders, such as no antient Bishop ever was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with.</p>
                  <p>Shall these fruitless jarrs and janglings never cease? shall we never see end of them?

Jer, lib. 40. c. 16.</note> So that if judgement of Secular affairs should be committed unto wise men, unto men of chiefest Credit and Account amongst them, when the Pastors of their Souls are such, Who more fit to be also their Judges for the ending of strikes? The wisest in things divine, may be also in things humane the most skilful. At leastwise they are by likelihood commonly more able to know right from wrong than the common un-lettered sort. And what St. <hi>Augustin</hi> did hereby gather,<note place="margin">Aug. de oper.

                        </gap>yed us not of his own accord, but being thereunto directed by that Spirit which speaks in him. His own Apostleship, which drew him to travel up and down, suffered him not to be any where settled for this purpose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wise, faithful and holy men which were seated here and there, and not them which travelled up and down to preach, he made Examiners of such Businesses. Whereupon of him
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:66185:254"/>
it is no where written, that he had leisure to attend these things, from which we cannot excuse our selves although we be simple, because even such he requireth, if wise men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, rather than that the affairs of Christians should be brought into publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Howbeit, not without comfort in our Lord are these travels undertaken by us, for the hopes sake of eternal life, to the end that with patience we may reap fruit.</hi> So farr is Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> from thinking it unlawful for Pastors in such sort to judge Civil Causes, that he plainly collecteth out of the Apostles words, a necessity to undertake that duty; yea himself he comforteth with the hope of a blessed reward, in lieu of travel that way sustained.</p>
                  <p>Again, even where whole Christian Kingdoms are, how troublesome were it for Universities, and other greater Collegiate Societies, erected to serve as Nurseries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Christ, if every thing which civilly doth concern them were to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from their own peculiar Governors, because for the most part they are (as fittest it is they should be) Persons Ecclesiastical Calling? It was by the wisdom of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Predecessors foreseen how unfit this would be, and hereupon provided by grant of special Charters, that it might be, as now it is in the Universities, where their Vice-Chancellors, being for the most part Professors of Divinity, are nevertheless Civil Judges over them in the most of their ordinary Causes.</p>
                  <p>And to go yet some degrees further, A thing impossible it is not, neither altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unusual, for some who are of royal blood to be consecrated unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Jesus Christ, and so to be Nurses of God's Church, not only as the Prophet did fore-tell, but also as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was. Now in case the Crown should by this mean descend unto such Persons, perhaps when they are the very last, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the very best of their Race, so that a greater benefit they are not able to bestow upon a Kingdom, than by accepting their right therein; shall the sanctity of their Order deprive them of that honour whereunto they have right by blood? or shall it be a barr to shut out the publick good that may grow by their vertuous Regiment? If not, then must they cast off the Office which they received by Divine Imposition of hands; or, if they carry a more religious opinion concerning that heavenly Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it followeth, that being invested as well with the one as the other, they remain God's lawfully anointed both ways. With men of skill and mature judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is of this so little doubt, that concerning such as at this day are under the Archbishops of <hi>Ments, Colen,</hi> and <hi>Travers,</hi> being both Archbishops and Princes of the Empire; yea such as live within the Popes own Civil Territories, there is no cause why any should deny to yield them civil obedience in any thing which they command, not repugnant to Christian Piety; yea even that civilly, for such as are under them, not to obey them, were the part of seditious Persons: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit for Persons Ecclesiastical, thus to exercise Civil Dominion of their own, is more than when they onely sustain some Publick Office, or deal in some business Civil, being thereunto even by Supream Authority required. As Nature doth not any thing in vain, so neither Grace: Wherefore, if it please God to bless some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Attendants on his own Sanctuary, and to endue them with extraordinary parts of excellency, some in one kinde, some in another, surely a great derogation it were to the very honour of him who bestowed so precious Graces, except they on whom he hath bestowed them should accordingly be imployed, that the fruit of those Heavenly Gifts might extend it self unto the Body of the Common-wealth wherein they live; which being of purpose instituted (for so all Common-wealths are) to the end, that all might enjoy whatsoever good it pleaseth the Almighty to endue each one with, must needs suffer loss, when it hath not the gain which eminent civil hability in Ecclesiastical Persons is now and then found apt to afford. Shall we then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the People of <hi>Milan</hi> for using <hi>Ambrose</hi> their Bishop as an Ambassadour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Publick and Politick Affairs; the Jews for electing their Priests sometimes to be Leaders in Warr; <hi>David</hi> for making the High Priest his Chiefest Counsellour of State, Finally, all Christian Kings and Princes which have appointed unto like servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Bishops, or other of the Clergy under them? No! they have done in this respect that which most sincere and religious wisdom alloweth. Neither is it allowable only, when either a kinde of necessity doth cast Civil Offices upon them, or when they are thereunto preferred in regard of some extraordinary fitness, but further also, when there
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:66185:254"/>
are even of right annexed unto some of their places, or of course imposed upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their Persons, Functions of Dignity and Account in the Common-wealth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit no other consideration be had therein save this, that their credit and countenance may by such means be augmented. A thing, if ever to be respected, surely most of all now, when God himself is for his own sake generally no where honoured, Religion almost no where, no where religiously adored, the Ministry of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ a very cause of disgrace in the eyes both of high and low, where it hath not somewhat besides it self to be countenanced with.

But irreligious intents are not able to hide themselves, no not when Holiness is made their Cloak. This is plain and simple truth, That the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of wicked men hate always the presence of them, whose vertue, though it should not be able to prevail against their purposes, would notwithstanding be unto their minds a secret corrosive; and therefore, till either by one shift or another they can bring all things to their own hands alone, they are not secure.

                  <p>Against it many things are objected, as first, <hi>That the matters which are noted in the holy Scripture to have belonged unto the ordinary Office of any Minister of God's holy Word and Sacraments, are these which follow, with such like, and no other; namely, The watch of the Sanctuary, the business of God, the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, Oversight of the House of God, Watching over his Flock, Prophesie, Prayer, Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mysteries of God, Charge and care of mens Souls.</hi> If a man would shew what the Offices and Duties of a Chirurgion or Physician are; I suppose it were not his part, so much as to mention any thing belonging to the one or the other, in case either should be also a Souldier or a Merchant, or an House-keeper, or a Magistrate; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Functions of these are different from those of the former, albeit one and the same man may happily be both. The Case is like, when the Scripture teacheth what Duties are required in an Ecclesiastical Minister, in describing of whose Office, to touch any other thing than such as properly and directly toucheth his Office that way, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>

                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:66185:255"/>Yea, <hi>But in the Old Testament the two Powers Civil and Ecclesiastical were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, not onely in Nature, but also in Person: the one committed unto</hi> Moses, <hi>and the Magistrates joyned with him; the other to</hi> Aaron, <hi>and his Sons.</hi> Jehosophat <hi>in his Reformation doth not onely distinguish Causes Ecclesiastical from Civil, and erecteth divers Courts for them, but appointeth also divers Iudges.</hi> With the Jews these two Powers were not so distinguished, but that sometimes they might and did conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

These men which urge the necessity of making always a Personal distinction of these two Powers, as if by <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>'s example the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought not to deal in both Causes, yet are not scrupulous to make men of Civil Place and Calling, Presbyters and Ministers of Spiritual Jurisdiction in their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Consistories.</p>
                  <p>If it be against the Jewish Precedents for us to give Civil Power unto such as have Ecclesiastical; is it not as much against the same for them to give Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Power unto such as have Civil? They will answer perhaps, That their Position is onely against conjunction of Ecclesiastical Power of Order, and the Power of Civil Jurisdiction in one Person. But this Answer will not stand with their Proofs, which make no less against the Power of Civil and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in one Person; for of these two Powers <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>'s example is: Besides, the contrary example of <hi>Heli</hi> and of <hi>Ezra,</hi> by us alledged, do plainly shew, that, amongst the Jewes, even the power of Order Ecclesiastical, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Jurisdiction, were sometimes lawfully united in one and the same Person, Pressed further we are with our Lord and Saviour's example, who <hi>denyeth his Kingdom to be of this Wold, and therefore as not standing with his Calling refused to be made a King, to give sentence in a criminal Cause of Adultery, and in a Civil of dividing an Inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews, imagining that their Messiah should be a Potent Monarch upon Earth, no marvail, though when they did otherwise wonder at Christ's greatness, they sought forthwith to have him invested with that kinde of Dignity, to the end he might presently begin to reign. Others of the Jewes, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had the same imagination of the Messiah, and did somehat incline to think that peradventure this might be He, thought good to try whether he would take upon him that which he might do, being a King, such as they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their true Messiah should be. But Christ refused to be a King over them, because it was no part of the Office of their Messiah, as they did, falsely conceive; and to intermeddle in those Acts of Civil Judgement be refused also, because he had no such Jurisdiction in that Common-wealth, being, in regard of his Civil Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a man of mean and low Calling. As for repugnancy between Ecclesiastical and Civil Power, or any inconvenience that these two Powers should be united, it doth not appear, that this was the cause of his resistance either to reign or else to judge.</p>

In which consideration, that men consecrated unto the Spiritual service of God be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so farr forth to meddle with the Secular affairs of the World, as doth seem for some special good cause requisite, and may be without any grievous prejudice unto the Church; surely, there is not in the Apostles words, being rightly understood, any lett.

sometime there may be, and hath been perhaps just cause to ordain otherwise. Wherefore we are not to urge those things, which heretofore have been either ordered or done as thereby to prejudice those Orders, which, upon contrary occasion, and the exigence of the present time, by like authority have been established. For, what is there which doth let, but that from contrary occasions, contrary Laws may grow, and each he reasoned and disputed for by such as are subiect thereunto, during the time they are in force; and yet neither so opposite to other, but that both may laudably conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, as long as the ages which keep them, do see no necessary cause which may draw them unto alteration? Wherefore in these things, Canons, Constitutions, and Laws which have been at one time meet, do not prove that the Church should alwayes be bound to follow them. Ecclesiastical Persons were by antient Order forbidden to be Executors of any man's Testament, or to undertake the Wardship of Children. Bishops, by the Imperial Law, are forbidden to bequeath by Testament, or otherwise to alienate, any thing grown unto them after they were made Bishops. Is there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but that these, or the like Orders, must therefore every where still be observed? The reason is not always evident, why former Orders have been repealed, and other established in their room: Herein therefore we must remember the axiom used in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws, <hi>That the Prince is alwayes presumed to do that with reason, which is not against reason being done, although no reason of his deed be exprest.</hi> Which being in every respect as true of the Church, and her Divine Authority in making Laws, it should be some bridle unto those malepert and proud spirits, whose wits not conceiving the reason of Laws that are established, they adore their own private fancy, as the supreme Law of all, and accordingly take upon them to judge that whereby they should be judged.

T. C. l. 1. p. 12.</note>XVI. Now where they lastly alledge, <hi>That the Law of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the judgement of the best in all ages, condemn all ruling Superiority of Ministers over Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>; they are in this, as in the rest, more bold to affirm, than able to prove the things which they bring for support of their weak and feeble Cause. <hi>The bearing of Dominion, or the exercising of Authority</hi> (they say) <hi>is this wherein the Civil Magistrate is severed from the Ecclesiastical officer, according to the words of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> Kings of Nations bear rule over them, but it shall not be so with you: <hi>Therefore bearing of Dominion doth not agree to one Minister over another.</hi> This place hath been, and still is, although most falsely, yet with farr greater shew and likelyhood of truth, brought forth by the Anabaptists, to prove that the Church of Christ ought to have no Civil Magistrates, but be ordered only by Christ. Wherefore they urge the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition between Heathens, and them unto whom our Saviour speaketh. For, fith the Apostles were opposite to Heathens, not in that they were Apostles, but in that they were Christians; the Anabaptists inference, is, <hi>That Christ doth-here give a Law, to be for ever observed by all true Christian men, between whom and Heathens there must be alwayes this difference, that whereas Heathens have their Kings and Princes to rule, Christians ought not in this thing to be like unto them.</hi> Wherein their construction hath the more shew, because that which Christ doth speak to his Apostles, is not found alwayes agreeable unto them as Apostles, or as Pastors of mens Souls, but oftentimes it toucheth them in generality, as they are Christians; so that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity being common unto them with all Believers, such specches must be so taken, that they may be applyed unto all, and not onely unto them, They which consent with us, in rejecting such Collections as the Anabaptist maketh with more probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, must give us leave to reject such as themselves have made with less: For a great deal less likely it is, that our Lord should here establish an everlasting difference, not between his Church and Pagans, but between the Pastors of his Church and Civil Governours. For if herein they must always differ, that the one may not bear rule, the other may; How did the Apostles themselves observe this difference, the exercise of whose Authority, both in commanding and in controuling others, the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:66185:256"/>
Scripture hath made so manifest, that no gloss can over-shadow it? Again, it being, as they would have it, our Saviour's purpose to withhold his Apostles, and in them all other Pastors from bearing rule, why should Kingly Dominion be mentioned, which occasions men to gather, that not all Dominion and Rule, but this one only form was prohibited, and that Authority was permitted them, so it were not Regal? Furthermore, in case it had been his purpose to withhold Pastors altogether from bearing Rule, why should Kings of Nations be mentioned, as if they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to exercise, no not Regal Dominion it self, but only such Regal Dominion as Heathen Kings do exercise? The very truth is, our Lord and Saviour did aim at a farr other mark than these men seem to observe. The end of his speech was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their particular mis-perswasion to whom he spake: And their mis-perswasion was, that which was also the common fancy of the Jews at that time, that their Lord being the Messias of the World, should restore unto <hi>Israel</hi> that Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Romans had as then bereaved them; they imagined that he should not onely deliver the State of <hi>Israel,</hi> but himself reign as King in the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> with all Secular Pomp and Dignity; that he should subdue the rest of the World, and make <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the Seat of an Universal Monarchy. Seeing therefore they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken all to follow him, being now in so mean condition, they did not think, but that together with him, they also should rise in state; that they should be the first, and the most advanced by him.</p>
                  <p>Of this conceit it came, that the Mother of the Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> sued for her Childrens preferment; and of this conceit it grew, that the Apostles began to question amongst themselves which of them should be greatest: And, in controulment of this conceit, it was, that our Lord so plainly told them, <hi>that the thoughts of their hearts were vain.</hi> The Kings of Nations have indeed their large and ample Dominions, they reign farr and wide, and their Servants they advance unto honour in the World, they bestow upon them large and ample Secular preferments, in which respect they are also termed many of them Benefactors, because of the liberal hand which they use in rewarding such as have done them service: But, was it the meaning of the antient Prophets of God, that the Messias the King of <hi>Israel</hi> should be like unto these Kings, and his retinue grow in such sort as theirs? Wherefore ye are not to look for at my hands such preferment as Kings of Nations are wont to bestow upon their Attendants, <hi>With you not so.</hi> Your Reward in Heaven shall be most ample, on Earth your Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Honour must be to suffer Persecution for Righteousness sake; Submission, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Meekness are things fitter for you to inure your Mindes withall, than these aspiring Cogitations; if any amongst you be greater than other, let him shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self greatest in being lowlyest; let him be above them in being under them, even as a Servant for their good. These are Affections which you must put on; as for degrees of Preferment and Honour in this World, if ye expect any such thing at my hands, ye deceive your selves, for in the World your Portion is rather the clear contrary. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who alledge this Place against Episcopal Authority abuse it, they many wayes deprave and wrest it, clear from the true understanding wherein our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did utter it.</p>
                  <p>For First, whereas he by way of meer Negation had said, <hi>With you it shall not be so,</hi> fore-telling them onely that it should not so come to pass, as they vainly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; these men take his words in a plain nature of a Prohibition, as if Christ had thereby forbidden all inequality of Ecclesiastical Power. Secondly, Whereas he did but cut off their idle hope of Secular Advancements, all Standing-Superiority amongst Persons Ecclesiastical these men would rase off with the edge of his speech. Thirdly, whereas he in abating their hope even of Secular Advancements spake but onely with relation unto himself, informing them that he would be no such munificent Lord unto them in their Temporal Dignity and Honour, as they did erroneously suppose; so that any Apostle might afterwards have grown by means of others to be even Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> for any thing in those words to the contrary; these men removing quite and clean the hedge of all such restraints, enlarge so farr the bounds of his meaning, as if his very precise intent and purpose had been not to reform the error of his Apostles, conceived as touching him, and to teach what himself would not be towards them; but to prescribe a special Law both to them and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:66185:257"/>
their Successor for ever; a Law determining what they should not be in relation of one to another; a Law forbidding that any such Title should be given to any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as might import or argue in him a Superiority over other Ministers. Being thus defeated of that succour which they thought their cause might have had out of the words of our Saviour Christ,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 10.

The matter which <hi>Cyprian</hi> complaineth of in <hi>Florentinus</hi> was thus: <hi>Novatus</hi> misliking the easiness of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to admit men into the fellowship of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, after they had fallen away from the bold and constant Confession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, took thereby occasion to separate himself from the Church; and being united with certain excommunicate Persons, they joyned their wits together, and drew out against <hi>Cyprian</hi> their lawful Bishop sundry grievous accusations, the crimes such, as being true, had made him uncapable of that Office whereof he was six years as then possessed; they went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to other places, accusing him every where as guilty of those faults, of which themselves had lewdly condemned him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that twenty five <hi>African</hi> Bishops (a thing most false) had heard and examined his Cause in a Solemn Assembly, and that they all had given their Sentence against him, holding his Election by the Canons of the Church void. The same factious and seditious Persons coming also unto <hi>Florentinus,</hi> who was at that time a man imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the testimony of Jesus Christ, but yet a favourer of the error of <hi>Novatus,</hi> their malicious accusations he over-willingly hearkned unto, gave them credit, concurred with them, and unto <hi>Cyprian</hi> in fine wrote his Letters against <hi>Cyprian</hi>: Which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he justly taketh in marvellous evil part, and therefore severely controuleth his so great presumption in making himself a Judge of a Judge, and, as it were, a Bishop's Bishop, to receive accusations against him, as one that had been his Ordinary. <hi>What heigth of pride is this,</hi> saith <hi>Cyprian, what arrogancy of spirit, what a puffing up of minde, to call Guides and Priests to be examined and sifted before him? So that unless we shall be cleared in your Courts, and absolved by your sentence, behold for these six years space, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the Brotherhood have had a Bishop, nor the People a Guide, nor the Flock a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd, nor the Church a Governor, nor Christ a Prelate, nor God a Priest.</hi> This is the pride which <hi>Cyprian</hi> condemneth in <hi>Florentinus,</hi> and not the title or name of Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; about which matter there was not at that time so much as the dream of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie at all between them. A silly collection it is, that because <hi>Cyprian</hi> reproveth <hi>Florentinus</hi> for lightness of belief, and presumptuous rashness of judgement, therefore he held the title of Archbishop to be a vain and a proud name. Archbishops were chief amongst Bishops, yet Archbishops had not over Bishops that full Authority which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Bishop had over his own particular Clergy: Bishops were not subject unto their Archbishop as an Ordinary, by whom at all times they were to be judged, according to the manner of inferiour Pastors, within the compass of each Diocess. A Bishop might suspend, excommunicate, depose such as were of his own Clergy, without any other Bishops Assistants; not so an Archbishop the Bishops that were in his own Province, above whom divers Prerogatives were given him, howbeit no such Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as alone to be Judge over them: For as a Bishop could not be ordained, so neither might he be judged by any one only Bishop, albeit that Bishop were his Metropolitan: Wherefore <hi>Cyprian,</hi> concerning the liberty and freedom which every Bishop had, spake in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. de haer. baptizandis.</note> whereat fourscore and seven Bishops were present, saying, <hi>It resteth that every of us declare, what we think of this matter, neither judging nor severing from the right of Communion, any that shall think otherwise: For of us there is not any which maketh himself a Bishop of Bishops, or with Tyrannical fear constraineth his Collegues unto the necessity of obedience, inasmuch as every Bishop, according to the reach of his liberty and
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:66185:257"/>
power, hath his own free judgement, and can have no more another his Iudge, than himself be Iudge to another.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that, amongst the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, none did use such Authority over any as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did afterwards claim over all; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing upon them opinions by main and absolute power.<note place="margin">Lib. 2.

                  <p>The thing provided for by the Synod of <hi>Carthage,</hi> can be no other therefore, than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the chiefest Metropolitan, where many Archbishops were within any greater Province, should not be termed by those names, as to import the power of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Jurisdiction, belonging in such degree and manner unto him, over the rest of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Archbishops, as did belong unto every Bishop over other Pastors under him.

High time I think it is, to give over the obstinate defence of this most miserable, forsaken Cause; in the favour whereof, neither God, nor, amongst so many wise and vertuous men as Antiquity hath brought forth, any one can be found to have hitherto directly spoken.

It is too much which you take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, too much Power, and too much Honour.</hi> Wherefore, as we have shewed, that there is not in their Power any thing unjust or unlawful, so it resteth that in their Honour also the like be done. The labour we take unto this purpose is by so much the harder, in that we are forced to wraftle with the stream of obstinate Affection, mightily carried by a wilful prejudice, the Dominion whereof is so powerful over them in whom it reigneth, that it giveth them no leave, no not so much as patiently to hearken unto any speech which doth not profess to feed them in this their bitter humour. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, for as much as I am perswaded, that against God they will not strive, if they perceive once that in truth it is he against whom they open their mouths, my hope is their own Confession will be at the length, <hi>Behold we have done exceeding foolishly, It was the Lord, and we know it not, Him in his Ministers we have despised, we have in their honour impugned his.</hi> But the alteration of men's hearts must be His good and gracious work, whose most omnipotent power framed them. Wherefore to come to our present purpose, Honour is no where due, saving only unto such as have in them that whereby they are sound, or at the least presumed, voluntarily beneficial unto them of whom they are honoured. Wheresoever nature seeth the countenance of a Man, it still presumeth, that there is in him a minde willing to do good, if need require, inasmuch as by nature so it should be; for which cause Men unto Men do honor, even for very Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity sake. And unto whom we deny all honor, we seem plainly to take from them all opinion of Human Dignity, to make no account or reckoning of them, to think them so utterly without vertue, as if no good thing in the World could be looked for at their hands. Seeing therefore it seemeth hard, that we should so hardly think of any man, the Precept of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 17.</note>

                  <p>Nor is Honor only an inward estimation, whereby they are reverenced, and well thought of in the mindes of men;<note place="margin">Psal. 72. 15.</note> but Honor, whereof we now speak, is defined to be an External sign, by which we give a sensible testification, that we acknowledge the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Vertue of others. <hi>Sarah</hi> honored her Husband <hi>Abraham</hi>; this appeareth by the Title she gave him. The Brethren of <hi>Ioseph</hi> did him honor in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi>; their lowly and humble gesture sheweth it. Parents will hardly perswade themselves that this intentional Honor, which reacheth no farther than to the Inward conception only, is the Honor which their Children owe them.</p>
                  <p>Touching that Honor which, mystically agreeing unto Christ, was yielded literally and really unto <hi>Solomon</hi>; the words of the Psalmist concerning it are, <hi>Unto him they shall give of the Gold of Sheba, they shall pray for him continually, and daily bless him.</hi> Weigh these things in themselves, Titles, Gestures, Presents, other the like external signs wherein Honor doth consist, and they are matters of no great moment. Howbeit, take them away, let them cease to be required, and they are not things of small importance, which that surcease were likely to draw after it. Let the Lord

Maior of <hi>London,</hi> or any other unto whose Office Honor belongeth, be deprived but of that Title which in itself is a matter of nothing; and suppose we that it would be a small maim unto the credit, force, and countenance of his Office? It hath not without the singular wisdom of God been provided, that the ordinary outward tokens of Honor should for the most part be in themselves things of mean account; for to the end they might easily follow as faithful testimonies of that beneficial vertue whereunto they are due, it behoved them to be of such nature, that to himself no man might over-eagerly challenge them, without blushing; not any man where they are due withhold them, but with manifest appearance of too great malice or pride. Now, forasmuch as, according to the Antient Orders and Customs of this Land, as of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> and of all Christian Kingdoms through the World, the next in degree of Honor unto the Chief Soveraign, are, the Chief Prelates of God's Church; what the reason hereof may be; it resteth next to be enquired.</p>

Is there any man professing, Christian Religion, which holdeth it not as a Maxim, That the Church of Jesus Christ did reap a singular benefit by Apostolical Regiment, not only for other respects, but even in regard of that Prelacy, whereby they had and exercised Power of Jurisdiction over lower Guides of the Church? Preciates are herein the Apostles Successors, as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see, that Prelacy must needs be acknowledged exceedingly beneficial in the Church: and yet for more perspicuities sake, it shall not be pains superstuously ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if the manner how be also declared at large. For this one thing, not understood by the vulgar sort, causeth all contempt to be offered unto higher Powers, not only Ecclesiastical, but Civil: whom when proud men have disgraced, and are therefore reproved by such as carry some dutiful affection of minde, the usual Apologies which they make for themselves, are these: <hi>What more vertue in these Great ones, than in others? we see no such eminent good which they do above other mon.</hi> We grant indeed, that the good which Higher Governors do, is not so immediate and near unto every of us, as many times the meane: labours of others under them, and this doth make it to be less esteemed.</p>
                  <p>But we must note, that it is in this Case, as in a Ship; he that fitteth at the Stern is quiet, he moveth not, he seemeth in a manner to do little or Nothing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of them that sweat about other toil, yet that which he doth is in value and force more than all the labours of the residue laid together. The influence of the Heavens above, worketh infinitely more to our good, and yet appeareth not half so sensible as the force doth of things below. We consider not what it is which we reap by the Authority of our Chiefest Spiritual Governors, not are likely to enter into any consideration thereof, till we want them, and that is the cause why they are at our hands so unthankfully rewarded. Authority is a constraining Power; which Power were needless, if we were all such as we should be, willing to do the things we ought to do without constraint. But, because generally we are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, therefore we all reap singular benefit by that Authority which permitteth no men, though they would, to slack their duty. It doth not suffice, that the Lord of an Houshold appoint Labourers what they should do, unless he set over them some chief Workman to see they do it. Constitutions and Canons made for the ordering of Church-affairs, are dead Task-masters. The due execution of Laws Spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth most upon the vigilant care of the Chiefest Spiritual Governors, whose charge is to see that such Laws be kept by the Clergy and People under them: With those Duties which the Law of God, and the Ecclesiastical Canons require in the Clergy, Lay-Governors, are neither for the most part so well acquainted, nor so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and nearly touched. Requisite therefore it is, that Ecclesiastical Persons have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in such things. Which kinde of Authority, maketh them that have it Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. If then it be a thing confest, as by all good men it needs must be, to have Prayers read in all Churches, to have the Sacraments of God administred, to have the Mysteries of Salvation painfully taught, to have God every where devoutly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, and all this perpetually, and with quietness, bringeth unto the whole Church, and unto every Member thereof, inestimoble good; how can that Authority, which hath been proved the Ordinance of God for preservation of these duties in the Church, how can it choose but deserve to be held a thing publickly most beneficial? It were to be wished, and is to be laboured for, as much as can be, that they who are set in such Rooms, may be furnished with honourable Qualities and Graces, every way fit for their Galling: But, be they otherwise, howsoever so long as they are in Authority, all men reap some good by them, albeit not so much good, as if they were abler men.
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:66185:259"/>
There is not any amongst us all, but is a great deal more apt to exact another man's duty, than the best of us is to discharge exactly his own, and therefore Prelates, although neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting many ways their duty unto God and men, do notwithstanding by their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty great good, in that they keep others at the leastwise in some awe under them.</p>
                  <p>It is our duty therefore in this consideraton, to honor them that rule as Prelates; which Office if they discharge well,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> the Apostles own verdict is, that the honor they have, they be worthy of, yea, though it were double: And if their Government be otherwise, the judgement of sage men hath ever been this, that albeit the dealings of Governors be culpable, yet honourable they must be, in respect of that Authority by which they govern. Great caution must be used, that we neither be emboldned to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in evil, whom for Authorities sake we honor; nor induced in Authority to dishonor them, whom as examples we may not follow. In a word, not to dislike sin, though it should be in the highest, were unrighteous meekness; and proud righteousness it is to contemn or dishonor Highness, though it should be in the sinfullest men that live. But so hard it is to obtain at our hands, especially as now things stand, the yielding of Honor to whom Honor in this case belongeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> that by a brief Declaration only, what the Duties of men are towards the principal Guides and Pastors of their Souls, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not greatly hope to prevail, partly for the malice of their open Adversaries, and partly for the cunning of such as in a sacrilegious intent work their dishonor under covert, by more mystical and secret means. Wherefore requisite, and in a manner necessary it is, that by particular instances we make it even palpably manifest, what singular benefit and use publick, the nature of Prelates is apt to yield.</p>
                  <p>First, no man doubteth, but that unto the happy condition of Common-weals, it is a principal help and furtherance, when in the eye of Foreign States; their estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and credit is great. In which respect, the Lord himself commending his own Laws unto his people, mentioneth this as a thing not meanly to be accounted of, that their careful obedience yielded thereunto, should purchase them a great good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion abroad,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 6.</note> and make them every where famous for wisdom. Fame and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groweth especially by the vertue, not of common ordinary persons, but of them which are in each estate most eminent, by occasion of their higher Place and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The mean man's actions, be they good or evil, they reach not farr, they are not greatly enquired into, except perhaps by such as dwell at the next door; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as men of more ample dignity,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13.</note> are as Cities on the tops of Hills, their lives are view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a farr off; so that the more there are which observe aloof what they do, the greater glory by their well-doing they purchase, both unto God whom they serve, and to the State wherein they live. Wherefore if the Clergy be a beautifying unto the body of this Common-weal in the eyes of Foreign beholders; and if in the Clergy, the Prelacy be most exposed unto the World's eye, what publick benefit doth grow from that Order, in regard of reputation thereby gotten to the Land from abroad, we may soon conjecture. Amongst the Jews (their Kings excepted,) who so renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout the World, as their High-Priest? who so much, or so often spoken of, as their Prelates?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which Order is not for the present only the most in sight, but for that very cause also the most commended unto Posterity: For if we search those Records wherein there hath descended from age to age, whatsoever notice and intelligence we have of those things which were before us, is there any thing almost else, surely not any thing so much kept in memory, as the successions, doings, sufferings, and affairs of Prelates. So that either there is not any publick use of that light which the Church doth receive from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; or if this be absurd to think, then must we necessarily acknowledge our selves beholden more unto Prelates, than unto others their Inferiours, for that good of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which Ecclesiastical actions recorded do always bring.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But to call home our cogitations, and more inwardly to weigh with our selves, what principal commodity that Order yieldeth, or at leastwise is of its own disposition and nature apt to yield; Kings and Princes, partly for information of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, partly for instruction what they have to do in a number of most weighty affairs, intangled with the cause of Religion, having, as all men know, so usual oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of often consultations and conferences with their Clergy; suppose we, that no publick detriment would follow, upon the want of honorable Personages Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

to be used in those Cases? It will be haply said, <hi>That the highest might learn to stoop, and not to disdain the advice of some circumspect, wise, and vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such difference being presupposed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as we have proved already to have been the Ordinance of God, there is no judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man will ever make any question or doubt, but that fit and direct it is, for the highest and chiefest Order in God's Clergy, to be imployed before others, about so near and necessary Offices as the sacred estate of the greatest on earth doth require.

                  <p>Whensoever Sovereign Rulers are willing to admit these so necessary private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences for their Spiritual and ghostly good, inasmuch as they do for the time while they take advice, grant a kinde of Superiority unto them of whom they receive it, albeit haply they can be contented, even so farr to bend to the gravest and chiefest Persons in the Order of God's Clergy, yet this of the very best being rarely and hardly obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, now that there are whose greater and higher Callings do somewhat more proportion them unto that ample conceit and spirit, wherewith the minde of so powerable Persons we possessed; what should we look for in case God himself not authorizing any by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous means, as of old he did his Prophets, the equal meaness of all did leave, in respect of Calling, no more place of decency for one, then for another to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Let unexperienced wits imagin what pleaseth them, in having to deal with so great Personages, these Personal differences are so necessary, that there must be regard had of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Kingdoms being principally (next unto God's Almightiness, and the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the highest under God) upheld by wisdom; and by valour, as by the chiefest human means to cause continuance in safety with honor (for the labors of them who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the service of God, we reckon as means Divine, to procure our protection from Heavens,) from hence it riseth, that men excelling in either of these, or descending from such, as for excellency either way have been enobled, or possesing howsoever the rooms of such as should be in Politick wisdom, or in Martial prowess eminent, are had in singular recommendation. Notwithstanding, because they are by the state of Nobility great, but not thereby made inclinable to good things; such they oftentimes prove even under the best Princes; as under <hi>David</hi> certain of the Jewish Nobility were. In Polity and Council the World had not <hi>Achitophels</hi> equal, nor Hell his equal in dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly malice. <hi>Ioab</hi> the General of the Host of <hi>Israel,</hi> valiant, industrious, fortunate in Warr; but withal head-strong, cruel, treacherous, void of Piety towards God; in a word, so conditioned, that easie it is not to define, whether it were for <hi>David</hi> harder to miss the benefit of his War-like hability or to bear the enormity of his other Crimes. As well for the cherishing of those vertues therefore, wherein if Nobility do chance to flourish, they are both an ornament and a stay to the Common-wealth wherein they live; as also for the bridling of those disorders, which if they loosly run into, they are by reason of their greatness dangerous; what help could thereever have been invented more Divine, than the sorting of the Clergy into such Degrees, that the chiefest of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy being matched in a kinde of equal yoke, as it were, with the higher, the next with the lower degree of Nobility, the reverend Authority of the one, might be to the other as a courteous bridle, a mean to keep them lovingly in aw that are exorbitant, and to correct such excesses in them, as whereunto their Courage, State, and Dignity maketh them over-prone?

                  <p>Thus therefore Prelacy being unto all sorts so beneficial, ought accordingly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honor at the hands of all: But we have just cause exceedingly to fear, that those miserable times of confusion are drawing on, wherein <hi>the people shall be oppressed one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>

                  <p n="19">XIX. Now that we have laid open the causes for which Honor is due unto Prelates,<note place="margin">What kindes of Honor be due unto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</note> the next thing we are to consider is, What kindes of Honor be due. The good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment either of the Church, or the Common-wealth, dependeth scarcely on any one external thing, so much as on the Publick Marks and Tokens, whereby the estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:66185:261"/>
on that Governours are in, is made manifest to the eyes of men. True it is, that Governors are to be esteemed according to the excellency of their vertues; the more vertous they are, the more they ought to be honored, if respect be had unto that which every man should voluntarily perform unto his Superiors. But the question is now, of that Honor which Publick Order doth appoint unto Church-Governors, in that they are Governors; the end whereof is, to give open sensible testimony, that the Place which they hold is judged publickly in such degree beneficial, as the marks of their excellency, the Honors appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done unto them, do import. Wherefore this honor we are to do them, without presuming our selves to examine how worthy they are; and withdrawing it, if by us they be thought unworthy. It is a note of that publick judgement which is given of them; and therefore not tolerable that men in private, should, by refusal to do them such honor, reverse as much as in them lyeth, the Publick judgement. If it deserve so grievous punishment, when any particular Person adventureth to deface those marks whereby is signified what value some small piece of Coyn is publickly esteemed at; is it sufferable that Honors, the Character of that estimation which publickly is had of Publick Estates and Callings in the Church, or Common-wealth, should at every man's pleasure be cancelled? Let us not think that without most necessary cause, the same have been thought expedient. The first Authors thereof were wise and judicious men; they knew it a thing altogether impossible, for each particular in the multitude to judge what benefit doth grow unto them from their Prelates, and thereunto uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly to yield them convenient honor. Wherefore that all sorts might be kept in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and awe, doing that unto their Superiors of every degree, not which every man's special fancy should think meet, but which being before-hand agreed upon as meet, by publick Sentence and Decision, might afterwards stand as a rule for each in particular to follow; they found that nothing was more necessary, than to allet unto all degrees their certain honor, as marks of publick judgement, concerning the dignity of their Places; which mark, when the multitude should behold, they might be thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to know, that of such or such restimation their Governors are, and in token there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do carry those notes of excellency. Hence it groweth, that the different notes and signs of Honor, do leave a correspondent impression in the mindes of common Beholders. Let the people be asked; Who are the chiefest in any kinde of Calling? who whost to be listned unto? who of greatest account and reputation? and see if the very discourse of their mindes, lead them not unto those sensible marks, according to the difference whereof they give their suitable judgement, esteeming them the worthiest persons who carry the principal note, and publick mark of Worthiness. If therefore they see in other estates a number of tokens sensible, whereby testimony is given what account there is publickly made of them, but no such thing in the Clergy; what will they hereby, or what can they else conclude, but that where they behold this, surely in that Common-wealth, Religion, and they that are conversant about it, are not esteemed greatly beneficial? Whereupon in time, the open contempt of God and Godliness must needs ensue:<note place="margin">Psal.l 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Honor done by giving preheminence of Place unto one sort before another, is for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, order, and quietness-sake so needful, that both Imperial Laws and Canons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, have made their special provisions for it. Our Saviour's invective against the vain affectation of Superiority, whether in Title, or in Place, may not hinder these seemly differences usual in giving and taking honor, either according to the one, or the other.</p>
                  <p>Some thing there is even in the Ornaments of Honor also: Otherwise idle it had been for the Wiseman speaking of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to stand so much upon the circumstance of his Priestly attire, and to urge it as an argument of such dignity and greatness in him: <hi>An everlasting Covenant God made with</hi> Aaron, <hi>and gave him the Priesthood among the people, and made him blessed through his comely Ornament, and cloathed him with the garment of Honor.</hi> The Robes of a Judge do not adde to his vertue; the chiefest Ornaments of Kings is Justice; holiness and purity of Conversation doth much more adorn a Bishop, than his peculiar form of Cloathing. Notwithstanding, both Judges, through the garments of Judicial Authority; and through the Ornaments of Soveraignty, Princes; yea, Bishops through the very attire of Bishops, are made blessed, that is to say, marked and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they are to be such, as God hath poured his blessing upon, by advancing them above others, and placing them where they may do him principal good service. Thus to be called is to be blessed, and therefore to be honored with the signs of such a Calling, must needs be in part a blessing also; for of good things, even the signs are good.</p>
                  <p>Of Honor; another part is Attendancy; and therefore in the visions of the glory of God, Angels are spoken of as his Attendants. In setting out the honor of that mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Queen, the Prophet mentioneth the Virgin-Ladies which waited on her. Amongst the tokens of <hi>Solomons</hi> honourable condition, his Servants and Waiters, the sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story omitteth not. This doth prove Attendants a part of Honor: But this as yet doth not shew with what Attendancy Prelates are to be honored. Of the High-Priests retinue amongst the Jews, somewhat the Gospel it self doth intimate: And, albeit our Saviour came to minister, and not, as the Jews did imagine their Messias should, to be ministred unto in this World, yet attended on he was by his blessed Apostles, who followed him not only as Scholars, but even as Servants about him. After that he had sent them, as himself was sent of God, in the midst of that hatred and extreme contempt which they sustained at the World's hands; by Saints and Believers this part of honor was most plentifully done unto them. Attendants they had provided in all places where they went; which Custom of the Church was still continued in Bishops, their Successors, as by <hi>Ignatius</hi> it is plain to be seen. And from hence no doubt, those Acolyths took their beginning, of whom so frequent mention is made; the Bishops Attendants; his Followers they were: in regard of which service, the name of Acolythes seemeth plainly
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:66185:262"/>
to have been given. The custom for Bishops to be attended upon by many, is, as <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> doth shew,<note place="margin">Novel. 6.</note> antient: The affairs of Regiment, wherein Prelates are imployed, make it necessary that they always have many about them, whom they may command, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no such thing did by way of honor belong unto them.</p>
                  <p>Some mens judgement is, that if Clerks, Students, and Religious Persons were moe, common Serving-men and Lay-Retainers fewer than they are in Bishops Palaces, the use, and the honor thereof would be much more suitable than now: But these things, concerning the number and quality of Persons fit to attend on Prelates, either for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, or for honors sake, are rather in particular discretion to be ordered, than to be argued of by disputes. As for the vain imagination of some,<note place="margin">T. C. l. 3. p. 126. out of Jos. l.8. c. 15.</note> who teach the original hereof to have been a preposterous imagination of <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Emperor, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addicted unto Idolatry, chose of the choisest Magistrates to be Priests; and, to the end they might be in great estimation, gave unto each of them a train of Followers: And that Christian Emperors thinking the same would promote Christianity, which promoted Superstition, endeavoured to make their Bishops encounter and match with those Idolatrous Priests; such frivolous conceits having no other ground than conceit, we weigh not so much as to frame any answer unto them; our declaration of the true original of antient attendancy on Bishops being sufficient. Now, if that which the light of sound reason doth teach to be sit, have, upon like inducements reasonable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable and good, approved it self in such wise as to be accepted, not only of us, but of Pagans and Infidels also; doth conformity with them that are evil in that which is good, make that thing which is good, evil? We have not herein followed the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, nor the Heathens us, but both we end they one and the self-same Divine rule, the light of a true and sound understanding, which sheweth what honor is fit for Prelats, and what attendancy convenient to be a part of their honor.</p>

But there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, a lett, which somewhat hindreth those good mens Prayers from taking effect: They, in whose hands the Soveraignty of Power and Dominion over the Church doth rest, are perswaded there is a God; for undoubtedly either the name of Godhead is but a feigned thing; or, if in Heaven there be a God, the Saerilegious intention of Church-Robbers, which lurketh under this plausible name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is in his sight a thousand times more hateful than the plain professed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of those very Miscreants, who threw their Vomit in the open face of our blessed Saviour.</p>
                  <p>They are not words of perswasion by which true men can hold their own, when they are over-beset with Thieves: And therefore to speak in this Cause at all were but labor lost, saving only in respect of them, who being as yet un-joyned unto this Conspiracy, may be haply somewhat stayed, when they shall know betimes, what it is to see Thieves, and to run on with them,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A thing most worthy our consideration, is the wisdom of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for the Common sort being prone unto envy and murmur, little considereth of what necessity, use and importance, the sacred duties of the Clergy are, and for that Cause hardly yieldeth them any such honor, without repining and grudging thereat; they cannot brook it, that when they have laboured, and come to reap, there should so great a portion go out of the fruit of their Labours, and he yielded up unto such as sweat nor for it. But when the Lord doth challenge this as his own due, and require it to be done by way of homage unto him, whose mere liberality and goodness had raised them from a poor and servile estate, to place them where they had all those ample and rich possessions, they must be worse than Brute beasts, if they would storm at any thing which He did receive at their hands. And for him to bestow his own on his own Servants (which liberty is not denied unto the meanest of men) what man liveth that can think it other than most reasonable? Wherefore no cause there was, why that which the Clergy had, should in any man's eye seem too much, unless God himself were thought to be of an over-having disposition.</p>

Neither are we so to judge of their worldly condition, as if they were Servants of men, and at mens hands did receive those earthly benefits by way of stipend in lieu of pains whereunto they are hired: nay that which is paid unto them is homage and tribute due unto the Lord Christ.

Some before they were made Bishops, having been Owners of ample Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, sold them, and gave them away to the Poor:<note n="b" place="margin">Prosp. de vita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templ. l. 2. c <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon, they, who entring into the same Spiritual and high Function, held their Secular Possessions still, were hardly thought of: And even when the Case was fully resolved, that so to do was not unlawful, yet it grew a question, <hi>Whether they lawfully might then take any thing out of the Publick Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ?</hi> a question, <hi>Whether Bishops, holding by Civil Title sufficient to live of their own, were bound in Conscience to leave the Goods of the Church altogether to the use of others.</hi> Of contentions about these matters there was no end, neither appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there any possible way for quietness, otherwise than by making partition of Church-Revenues, according to the several ends and users for which they did serve, that so the Bishops part might be certain. Such partition being made, the Bishop enjoyed his portion several to himself; the rest of the Clergy likewise theirs; a third part was severed to the furnishing and upholding of the Church; a fourth to the erection and maintenance of Houses wherein the Poor might have relief. After which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made, Lands and Livings began every day to be dedicated unto each use severally, by means whereof every of them became in short time much greater than they had been for worldly maintenance, the fervent devotion of men being glad that this new opportunity was given, of shewing zeal to the House of God in more certain order.</p>
                  <p>By these things it plainly appeareth, what proportion of maintenance hath been ever thought reasonable for a Bishop; sith in that very partition agreed on, to bring him unto his certain stint, as much as allowed unto him alone, as unto all the Clergy under him, namely, a fourtli part of the whole yearly Rents and Revenues of the Church. Nor is it likely, that, before those Temporalities, which now are such eye-sores, were added unto the honour of Bishops, their state was so mean, as some imagine: For if we had no other evidence than the covetous and ambitious humour of Hereticks, whose impotent desires of aspiring thereunto, and extreme discontentment as oft as they were defeated, even this doth shew, that the state of Bishops was not a few degrees advanced above the rest. Wherefore of grand Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states which were in the very prime of the Primitive Church, thus <hi>Lactantius</hi> above thirteen hundred years sithence, testified,<note place="margin">Lact. de vera. sap. l. 5. c. 30.</note>

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:66185:266"/>
restrained unto a far more sparing life, their Houses, their Retinue, their Diet limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within a farr more narrow compass than is now kept; we must know, that those Laws and Orders were made, when Bishops lived of the same Purse, which served a well for a number of others, as them, and yet all at their disposing: So that conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient it was to provide, that there might be a moderate stint appointed to measure their expences by, lest others should be injured by their wastefulness. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, there is now no cause wherefore any such Law should be urged, when Bishops live onely of that which hath been peculiarly alloted unto them: They having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Temporalities and other Revenues to bestow for their own private use, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which their state requireth, and no other having with them any such common interest therein, their own discretion is to be their Law for this matter; neither are they to be pressed with the rigour of such antient Canons as were framed for other times, much less so odiously to be upbraided with uncomformity unto the Pattern of our Lord and Saviour's estate, in such circumstances as himself did never minde to require, that the rest of the World should of necessity be like him. Thus against the wealth of the Clergy, they alledge how meanly Christ himself was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; against Bishops Palaces, his want of a hole to hide his Head in; against the service done unto them, that he came to minister, not to be ministred unto in the World. Which things, as they are not unfit to controul covetous, proud, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious desires of the Ministers of Christ, and even of all Christians, whatsoever they be; and to teach men contentment of minde, how mean soever their estate is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that they are but Servants to him, whose condition was farrmore abused than theirs is, or can be; so to prove such difference in State between us and him unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they are of no force or strength at all. If one convented before their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, when he standeth to make this Answer, should break out into Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Authority, and tell them, that Christ, when he was on Earth, did not sit to judge, but stand to be judged; would they hereupon think it requisite to dissolve their Eldership, and to permit no Tribunals, no Judges at all, for fear of swerving from our Saviour's example?

For at this mark it is, that the head Lay-Reformers do all aim. Must these unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prelates give place; What then? Shall Better succeed in their rooms? Is this desired, to the end that others may enjoy their Honours, which shall doe Christ more faithful service than they have done? Bishops are the worst men living upon Earth; therefore let their sanctified Possessions be divided: Amongst whom? O blessed Reformation!

Wherefore, albeit the whole World at this day do already perceive, and Posterity be like hereafter a great deal more plainly to discern; not that the Clergy of God is thus heaved at, because they are wicked, but that means are vsed to put it into the heads of the simple multitude, that they are such indeed: to the end that those who thirst for the spoyl or Spiritual Possessions, may, till such time as they have their purpose, be thought to covet nothing but onely the just extinguishment of un-reformable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; so that in regard of such mens intentions, practices, and machinations against

L. the Bishops, if to their good consideration I offer a view of those sores which are in the kind of their heavenly function, most apt to breed, and which being not in time cured, may procure at the length that which God of his infinite mercy avert. Of Bishops in his time St. <hi>Ierome</hi> complaineth, that they took it in great disdain to have any fault, great or small found with them:<note place="margin">Epiph. contra hares. l. 3.10 1. baer. 70.</note> 
                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> likewise before <hi>Ierome,</hi> noteth their impatiency this way, to have been the very chuse of a Schism in the Church of Christ; at what time one <hi>Audius,</hi> a Man of great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of life, full of faith and zeal towards God, beholding those things which were corruptly done in the Church, told the B B. and Presbyters their faults in such sort as those men are wont, who love the truth from their hearts, and walk in the paths of a most exact life. Whether it were covetousness, or sensuality in their lives; absurdity or error in their teaching; any breach of the laws and Canons of the Church wherein he espied them faulty, certain and sure they were to be thereof most plainly told. Which thing, they whose dealings were justly culpable, could not bear; but, instead of amending their faults, bent their hatred against him who sought their amendment, till at length they drove him by extremity of infestation, through wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of striving against their injuries, to leave both them, and with them the Church. Amongst the manifold accusations, either generally intended against the Bishops of this our Church, or laid particularly to the charge of any of them, I cannot find that hitherto their spitefullest adversaries have been able to say justly, that any man for telling them their personal faults in good and Christian sort, hath sustained in that respect much persecution. Wherefore, notwithstanding mine own inferior estate and calling in Gods Church, the consideration whereof assureth me, that in this kind the sweetest Sacrifice which I can offer unto Christ, is meek Obedience, reverence and aw unto the Prelates which he hath placed in seats of higher Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over me, emboldned I am, so far as may conveniently stand with that duty of humble subjection, meekly to crave, my good L L. your favourable pardon, if it shall seem a fault thus far to presume; or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if otherwise, your wonted courteous accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

or implements which thereunto appertain. If it be, as the Apostle saith, that the Holy Ghost doth make Bishops, and that the whole action of making them is Gods own deed, men being therein but his Agents; what spark of the fear of God can there possibly remain in their hearts, who representing the person of God in naming worthy men to Ecclesiastial charge, do sell that which in his name they are to bestow, or who standing as it were at the Throne of the Living God do bargain for that which at his hands they are to receive? Wo worth such impious and irreligious prophanations. The Church of Christ hath been hereby made, not a den of thieves, but in a manner the very dwelling place of soul spirits; for undoubtedly, such a number of them have been in all ages who thus have climbed into the seat of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Regiment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men may by orderly means be invested with spiritual Authority, and yet do harm by reason of ignorance how to use it to the good of the Church. It is saith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi>

                     </gap>; <hi>a thing highly to be accompted of, but a hard thing to be that which a Bishop should be.</hi> Yea a hard and a toilsom thing it is, for a Bishop to know the things that belong unto a Bishop. A right good man may be a very unfit Magistrate. And for discharge of a Bishops Office, to be well minded is not enough, no not to be well learned also. Skill to instruct is a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, skill to govern much more necessary in a Bishop. It is not safe for the Church of Christ, when Pishops learn what belongeth unto Government, as Empericks learn physick by killing of the sick. Bishops were wont to be men of great learning in the Laws both Civil and of the Church; and while they were so, the wisest men in the land for Counsel and Government were Bishops.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Know we never so well what belongeth unto a charge of so great moment, yet can we not therein proceed but with hazard of publique detriment, if we relye on our selves alone, and use not the benefit of conference with others. A singular mean to unity and concord amongst themselves, a marvellous help unto uniformity in their dealings, no small addition of weight and credit unto that which they do, a strong bridle unto such as watch for occasions to stir against them; finally, a very great stay unto all that are under their Government, it could not chuse but be soon found, if Bishops did often and seriously use the help of mutual consultation, These three rehearsed are things onely preparatory unto the course of Episcopal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But the hurt is more manifestly seen which doth grow to the Church of God by faults inherent in their several actions, as when they carelesly Ordein, when they Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute negligently, when corruptly they bestow Church-Livings, Benefices, Prebends, and rooms especially of Jurisdiction, when they visit for gain-sake, rather then with serious intent to do good, when their Courts erected for the maintenance of good Order are disordered; when they regard not the Clergy under them; when neither Clergy nor Laity are kept in that aw for which this authority should serve; when any thing appeareth in them rather then a fatherly affection towards the flock of Christ when they have no respect to posterity; and finally, when they neglect the true and requisite means whereby their authority should be upheld. Surely the hurt which groweth out of these defects must needs be exceeding great. In a Minister, ignorance and disability to teach is a maim, nor is it held a thing allowable to ordain such, were it not for the avoiding of a greater evil which the Church must needs sustain, if in so great scarcity of able men, and unsufficiency of most Parishes throughout the Land to maintain them, both publick Prayer and the Administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should rather want, then any man thereunto be admitted lacking dexterity and skill to perform that which otherwise was most requisite. Wherefore the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of ordaining such, is no excuse for the rash and careless ordaining of every one that hath but a friend to bestow some two or three words of ordinary commendation in his behalf. By reason whereof the Church groweth burdened with silly creatures more then need, whose noted baseness and insufficiency bringeth their very Order it self into contempt.</p>
                  <p>It may be that the fear of a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> doth cause Institutions to pass more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily then otherwise they would. And to speak plainly the very truth, it may be that Writs of <hi>Quare non impedit,</hi> were for these times most necessary in the others place: Yet where Law will not suffer men to follow their own judgment, to shew their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:66185:267"/>
they are not hindred. And I doubt not but that even conscienceless and wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, of which sort the swarms are too great in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to present unto Bishops any reffuse, by finding so easie acceptation thereof. Somewhat they might redress this sore, notwithstanding so strong impediments. if it did plainly appear that they took it indeed to heart, &amp; were not in a manner contented with it.</p>
                  <p>Shall we look for care in admitting whom others present, if that which some of your selves confer, be at any time corruptly bestowed? A foul and an ugly kind of deformity it hath, if a man do but think what it is for a Bishop to draw commodity and gain from those things whereof he is left a free bestower, and that in trust, without any other obligation then his sacred Order only, and that religious Integrity which hath been presumed on in him. Simoniacal corruption I may not for honors sake suspect to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men of so great place. So often they do not, I trust, offend by sale; as by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised gift of such preferments, wherein that ancient Canon should specially be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, which forbiddeth a Bishop to be led by humane affection,<note place="margin">Can.

A fault no where so hurtful, as in bestowing places of jurisdiction, and in furnishing Cathedral Churches, the Prebendaries and other Dignities whereof are the very true successors of those ancient Presbyters which were at the first as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers unto Bishops. A foul abuse it is, that any one man should be loaded as some are with Livings in this kind, yea some even of them who condemn utterly the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any two Benefices unto the same man, whereas the other is in truth a matter of far greater sequel, as experience would soon shew, if Churches Cathedral being furnished with the residence of a competent number of vertuous, grave, wise and learned Divines, the rest of the Prebends of every such Church were given within the Diocess unto men of worthiest desert, for their better encouragement unto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and travel; unless it seem also convenient to extend the benefit of them unto the learned in Universities, and men of special imployment otherwise in the affairs of the Church of God. But howsoever, surely with the publick good of the Church it will hardly stand, that in any one person such favours be more multiplied, then law permitteth, in those Livings which are with Cure.</p>
                  <p>Touching Bishops Visitations, the first institution of them was profitable, to the end that the state and condition of Churches being known, there might be for evils grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convenient remedies provided in due time. The observation of Church Laws, the correction of faults in the service of God and manners of men, these are things that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors should seek. When these things are inquired of formally, and but for custom sake, fees and pensions being the only thing which is sought, and little else done by Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we are not to marvel if the baseness of the end doth make the action it self loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som. The good which Bishops may do not only by these Visitations belonging ordinarily to their Office, but also in respect of that power which the Founders of Colledges have given them of special trust, charging even fearfully their consciences therewith: the good I say which they might do by this their authority, both within their own Diocess, and in the well-springs themselves, the Universities, is plainly such as cannot chuse but add weight to their heavy accounts in that dreadful Day, if they do it not.</p>
                  <p>In their Courts where nothing but singular integrity and Justice should prevail, if pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and gross corruptions be found, by reason of Offices so often granted unto men who seek nothing but their own gain; and make no account what disgrace doth grow by their unjust dealings unto them under whom they deal the evil hereof shall work more then they which procure it do perhaps imagine.</p>
                  <p>At the hands of a Bishop the first thing looked for, is a care of the Clergy under him, a care that in doing good they may have whatsoever comforts and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements his countenance, authority, and place may yield. Otherwise what heard shall they have to proceed in their painful course, all sorts of men besides being so ready to malign, despise, and every way oppress them? Let them find nothing but disdain in Bishops; in the enemies of present Government, if that way lift to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves, all kind of favourable and friendly help; unto which part think we it likely that men having wit, courage, and stomack will incline?</p>
                  <p>As great a fault is the want of severity when need requireth, as of kindness and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in Bishops. But touching this, what with ill usage of their powe amongst the meaner and what with disuage amongst the higher sort, they are in the eyes of both sorts as Bees have lost their sting. It is a long time sithence any great one hath felt, or almost any
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:66185:268"/>
one much feared the edge of that Ecclesiastical severity, which sometime held Lords and Dukes in a more religious aw then now the meanest are able to be kept.</p>
                  <p>A Bishop, in whom there did plainly appear the marks and tokens of a fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards them are under his charge, what good might he do ten thousand ways more then any man knows how to set down? But the souls of men are not loved; that which Christ shed his blood for, is not esteemed precious. This is the very root, the fountain of all negligence in Church-Government.</p>
                  <p>Most wretched are the terms of mens estate when once they are at a point of wrechles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so extream, that thy bend not their wits any further than only to shift out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, never regarding what shall become of their Successors after them.

It was the barbarous affection of <hi>Nero,</hi> that the ruine of his own Imperial Seat he could have been well enough contented to see, in case he might also have seen it accompanied with the fall of the whole World: An affection not more intolerable then theirs, who care not to overthrow all posterity, so they may purchase a few days of Ignominious safety unto themselves, and their present estates, if it may be termed a safety which tendeth so fast unto their very overthrow, that are the Purchasers of it in so vile and base manner.</p>
                  <p>Men whom it standeth upon to uphold a reverend estimation of themselves in the minds of others, without which the very best things they do are hardly able to escape disgrace, must before it be over-late remember how much easier it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain credit once gotten, then to recover it being lost. The Executors of Bishops are sued if their Mansion-house be suffered to go to decay: But whom shall their Successors sue for the dilapidations which they make of that Credit, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired diminutions whereof will in time bring to pass, that they which would most do good in that calling, shall not be able; by reason of prejudice generally setled in the minds of all sorts against them.

It may be, there hath been partly some show and just suspition of like practice in some, in procuring the undeserved preferments of some unworthy persons, the very cause of whose advancement hath been principally their unworthiness to be advanced. But neither could this be done altogether without the inexcusable fault of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before, and so oft we cannot imagine it to have been done, that either onely or chiefly from thence this decay of their estimation may be thought to grow. Somewhat it is that the malice of their cunning Adversaries, but much more which themselves have effected against themselves. A Bishops estimation doth grow from the excellency of vertues suitable unto his place. Unto the place of a Bishop those high Divine Vertues are judged suitable, which vertues being not easily found in other sorts of greatmen, do make him appear so much the greater in whom they are found.</p>
                  <p>Devotion, and the feeling sense of Religion are not usual in the noblest, wisest, and chiefest Personages of State, by reason their wits are so much imployed another way, and their mindes so seldom conversant in heavenly things. If therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves are defective, they see that Bishops do blessedly excel, it frameth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly their-hearts to a stooping kinde of disposition, clean opposite to contempt: The very countenance of <hi>Moses</hi> was glorious after that God had conferred with him. And where Bishops are the powers and faculties of whose souls God hath possest, those very actions, the kind whereof is common unto them with other men, have notwithstanding in them a more high and heavenly form, which draweth correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentestimation unto it, by vertue of that celestial impression, which deep meditation of holy things, and as it were conversation with God doth leave in their mindes. So that Bishops which will be esteemed of as they ought, must frame themselves to that very pattern from whence those <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops unto whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth were denominated, even so far forth as this our frailty will permit; shine they must as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God in the midst of perverse men. They are not to look that the world should
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:66185:268"/>
always carry the affection of <hi>Constantine,</hi> to bury that which might derogate from them, and to cover their imbecillities. More then high time it is, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themselves of the Apostles admonition; <hi>Attende tibi, Have a vigilant eye to thy self.</hi> They erre if they do not perswade themselves that wheresoever they walk or sit, be it in their Churches or in their Consistories, abmad or at home, at their Tables or in their Closets, they are in the midst of snares laid for them: Wherefore as they are with the Prophet every one of them to make it their hourly prayer unto God, <hi>Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of enemies</hi>; so it is not safe for them, no not for a moment to slacken their industry in seeking every way that estimation which may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their labours unto the Churches good. Absurdity, though but in words, must needs he this way a maim, where nothing but wisdom, gravity, and, judgement is looked for. That which the son of <hi>Syrach</hi> hath concerning the Writings of the old Sages, <hi>Wise sentences are found in them</hi>; should be the proper mark and character of Bishops spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; whose lips, as doors, are not to be opened, but for egress of instruction and sound knowledge. If base servility and dejection of minde be ever espied in them, how should men esteem them as worthy the rooms of the great Ambassadors of God? A wretched desire to gain by bad and unseemly means, standeth not with a mean mans credit, much less with that reputation which Fathers of the Church should be in. But if besides all this, there be also coldness in works of Piety and Charity, utter contempt even of Learning it self, no care to further it by any such helps as they easily might and ought to afford, no not as much as that due respect unto their very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies about them, which all men that are of account do order as neer as they can in such sort, that no grievous offensive deformity be therein noted; if there still continue in that most Reverend Order, such as by so many Engines, work day and night to pull down the whole frame of their own estimation amongst men; some of the rest secretly also permitting others their industrious opposites, every day more and more to seduce the multitude, how should the Church of God hope for great good at their hands?</p>

Such was the Religious affection of <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen 47. 12.</note> that it suffered him not to take that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, no not against the very Idolatrous Priests of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which he took for the purchasing of other mens lands to the King; but he considered, that albeit their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry deserved hatred, yet for the honors sake due unto Priesthood, better it was the King himself should yield them relief in publique extremity, then permit that the same necessity should constrain also them to do as the rest of the people did. But, it may be, men have now found out, that God hath proposed, the Christian Clergy, as a prey for all men freely to seize upon; that God hath left them as the fishes of the Sea, which every man that lifteth to gather into his net may; or that there is no God in Heaven to pity them, and to regard the injuries which man doth lay upon them: Yet the publique good of this Church and Commonwealth doth, I hope, weigh somewhat in the hearts of all honestly disposed men. Unto the publique good, no one thing is more directly availeable, then that such as are in place, whether it be of Civil, or of Ecclesiastical Authority, be so much the more largely furnished even with external helps and ornaments of this life, how much the more highly they are in power and calling advanced above others. For nature is not contented with bare sufficiency unto the sustenance of man, but doth evermore cover a decency proportionable unto the place which man hath in the body or society of others: For according unto the greatness of mens calling, the measure of all their actions doth grow in every mans secret expectation, so that great men do always know, that great things are at their hands expected. In a Bishop great liberality, great hospitality, actions in every kinde great are looked for: And for actions which must be great, mean instruments will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Men are but men, what room soever amongst men they hold: If therefore the measure of their Worldly habilities be beneath that proportion which their calling doth make to be looked for at their hands, a stronger inducement it is then perhaps men are aware of, unto evil and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt dealings, for supply of that defect. For which cause, we must needs think it a thing necessary unto the common good of the Church, that great Jurisdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted unto Bishops over others, a state of wealth proportionable should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be provided for them: where wealth is had in so great admiration, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in this golden age it is, that without it Angelical perfections are not able to deliver from extreme contempt, surely to make Bishops poorer then they are, were to make them of less account and estimation then they should be. Wherefore if detriment and dishonor do grow to Religion, to God, to his Church, when the publique account which is made of the chief of the Clergy decayeth, how should it be, but in this respect, for the good of Religion, of God, of his Church, that the wealth of Bishops be carefully preserved from further dimination? The tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and crosses wherewith Prelacy is never unaccompanied, they which feel them know how heavy, and how great they are. Unless such difficulties therefore, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto that estate, be tempered by co-annexing thereunto things esteemed of in this World, how should we hope that the minds of men, shunning naturally the burthens of each function, will be drawn to undertake the burthen of Episcopal care and labour in the Church of Christ? Wherefore if long we desire to enjoy the peace, quietness, order and stability of Religion, which Predacy (as hath been declared) causeth, then must we necessarily, even in favour of the publique good, uphold those things, the hope whereof being taken away, it is not the meer good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the charge, and the Divine acceptation thereof, that will be able to invite

At the length, what shall become of that Learning, which hath not wherewith any more to encourage her industrious followers? And finally, what shall become of that courage to follow learning, which hath already so much failed through the onely diminution of her chiefest rewards, Bishopricks? Surely, wheresoever this wicked intendment of overthrowing Cathedral Churches, or of taking away those Livings, Lands, and Possessions, which Bishops hitherto have enjoyed, shall once prevail, the hand maids attending thereupon will be Paganism, and extreme Barbarity.

Chron. 9. chap. 19.</note> in providing that the Levites might have encouragement to do the work of the Lord chearfully, was left of God as a fit pattern to be followed in the Church for ever. They considered what promise our Lord and Saviour hath made unto them, at whose hands his Prophets should receive but the least part of the meanest kind of friendliness, though it were but a draught of water: Which promise seemeth not to be taken, as if Christ had made them of any higher courtesie uncapable, and had promised re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not unto such as give them but that, but unto such as leave them but that. They considered how earnest the Apostle is, that if the Ministers of the Law were so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply provided for, less care then ought not to be had of them, who under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Jesus Christ, possess correspondent rooms in the Church. they consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how needful it is, that they who provoke all others unto works of Mercy and Charity, should especially have wherewith to be examples of such things, and by such meons to win them, with whom other means, without those, do commonly take very small effect.</p>
                  <p>In these and the like considerations, the Church-Revenues were in ancient times augmented, our Lord thereby performing manifestly the promise made to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they which did <hi>leave either Father, or Mother, or Lands, or goods for his sake, should receive even in this World an hundred fold.</hi> For some hundreds of years together, they which joyned themselves to the Church, were fain to relinquish all worldly emoluments, and to endure the hardness of an afflicted estate.

Thus albeit they deal with one, whose princely vertue giveth them small hope to prevail in impious and sacrilegious motions; yet shame they not to move her Royal Majesty even with a suit not much unlike unto that wherewith the Jewish High-Priest tried <hi>Iudas,</hi> whom they sollicited unto Treason against his Master and proposed unto him a number of silver-pence in lien of so vertuous and honest a service.

My meaning is not hereby to make the state of Bishopricks, and of those dissolved Companies alike, the one no less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be removed then the other. For those religious persons were men which followed only a special kind of Contemplative life in the Commonwealth, they were properly no portion of Gods Clergy (only such amongst them excepted, as were also Priests) their goods (that excepted, which they unjustly held through the Popes usurped power of appropriating Ecclesiastical livings unto them) may in part seem to be of the nature of Civil possessions, held by other kinds of Corporations such as the City of <hi>London</hi> hath divers. Wherefore, as their institution was human, and their end for the most part superstitious, they had not therein meerly that holy and divine interest which belongeth unto Bishops, who being imployed by Christ in the principal service of his Church, are receivers and disposers of his patrimony, as hath been showed, which whosoever shall with-hold or with-draw at any time from them, he undoubtedly robbeth God himself.

This power they gave into <hi>Simon,</hi> when they consented that he should be their Prince, not only to set men over their Works, and Countrey, and Weapons, but also to provide for the Holy things, and that he should be obeyed of every man, and that the Writings of the Country should be made in his name, and that it should not be lawful for any of the people, or Priests, to withstand his words, or to call any Congregation in the Country without him. And if haply it be surmised, that thus much was given to <hi>Simon,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Prince and High-Priest, which otherwise (being their <hi>Civil Governor</hi>) he could not lawfully have enjoyed; We must note, that all this is no more then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings of that People had, being Kings, and not Priests. By this power, <hi>David, Asa, Iehoshaphat, Iosiaes,</hi> and the rest, made those Laws and Orders which sacred Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry speaketh of, concerning matters of meer Religion, the affairs of the Temple, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, Finally, had it not been by the vertue of this power, how should it possibly have come to pass, that the piety or impiety of the Kings did always accordingly change the publique face of Religion, which things the Prophets by themselves never did, nor at any time could hinde from being done: Had the Priests alone been possest of all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in spiritual affairs, how should any thing concerning matter of Religion have been made but only by them; in had it head been, &amp; not in the King, to change the face of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at any time, the altering of religion, the making of Ecclesiastical Laws, with other the like actions belonging unto the power of Dominion, are still termed <hi>the deeds of the King</hi>; to shew, that in him was placed the supremacy of power in this kinde over all,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:66185:272"/>
and that unto their Priests the same was never committed, saving only at such times as the Priests were also Kings and Princess over them. According to the pattern of which example, the like power in causes Ecclesiastical is by the Laws of this Realm annexed unto the Crown; and there are which do imagine, that Kings being meer Lay-persons, do by this means exceed the lawful bounds of their callings; which thing to the end that they may perswade, they first make a necessary separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perpetual and personal between <hi>the Church</hi> and <hi>the Common-wealth.</hi> Secondly, they so tie all kind of <hi>power Ecclesiastical</hi> unto the Church, as if it were in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree their only right, who are by proper spiritual functions termed Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and might not unto Christian Princes in any wise appertain. To lurk under shifting ambignities, and equivocations of words in matter of principal weight, is childish. A Church and a Common-wealth, we grant, are things in nature one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the other: a Common-wealth is one way, and a Church an other way defined. In their opinions the Church and Common-wealth are corporations, not distinguished only in nature and definition, but in substance perpetually severed: so that they which are of the one, can neither appoint, nor execute, in whole nor in part, the duties which belong to them which are of the other, without open breach of the Law of God which hath divided them; and doth require, that so being divided, they should distinctly or severally work, as depending both upon God, and not hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one upon the others approbation. For that which either hath to do, we say that the care of Religion being common to all societies Politique, such societies as do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the true Religion have the name of the Church given unto every one of them for distinction from the rest; so that every body Politique hath some Religion, but the Church that Religion which is only true. Truth of Religion is the proper difference whereby a Church is distinguished from other Politique societies of men; we here mean true Religion in gross, and not according to every particular: for they which in some particular points of Religion do sever from the truth, may nevertheless truly (if we compare them to men of an heathenish Religion) be said to hold and profess that Religion which is true, For which cause there being of old so many Politique societies stablished through the world, only the Common-wealth of Israel, which had the truth of Religion, was is that respect the Church of God: and the Church of Jesus Christ is every such Politique society of men, as doth in Religion hold that truth which is proper to Christianity. As a Politique society it doth maintain Religion, as a Church, that Religion which God hath revealed by Jesus Christ; with us, therefore, the name of a Church importeth onely a society of men, first united into some publique form of Regiment, and secondly distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other societies by the exercise of Religion, With them on the other side the name of the Church in this present question, importeth not only a maltitude of men so united, and so distinguihed, but also further, the same divided necessarily and perpetually from the body of the Common-wealth: so that even in such a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique society as consisteth of none but Christians, yet the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth are too Corporations, independently subsisting by it self.</p>
                  <p>We hold that seeing there is not any man of the Church of <hi>England</hi> but the same man is also a member of the Common-wealth; nor any, member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which is not also of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Therefore as in a figure Triangle, the base doth differ from the sides thereof, and yet one and the self same line is both a base and also a side; aside simply, a base if it chance to be the bottom and under-lye the rest. So albeit, properties and actions of one do cause the name of a Common-wealth; qualities and functions of another sort, the name of the Church to be given to a multitude; yet one and the self-same multitude may in such sort be both. Nay, it is so with us, that no person appertaining to the one, can be denied also to be of the other: contrariwise, unless they against us should hold that the Church and the Common-wealth are two, both distinct and separate societies; of which two, one comprehendeth alwayes persons not belonging to the other, (that which they do) they could not conclude out of the difference between the Church and the Common-wealth, namely that the Bishops may not meddle with the affairs of the Common wealth, because they are Governours of an other Corporation, which is the Church, nor Kings, with making Lawes for the Church, because they have
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:66185:272"/>
government not of this Corporation, but of another divided from it, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth and the walls of separation between these two, must for ever be upheld: they hold the necessity of personal separation which clean excludeth the power of one mans dealing with both; we of natural, but that one and the same person may in both bear principal sway.</p>
                  <p>The causes of common received Errors in this Point seem to have been especially two: One, That they who embrace true Religion, living in such Common-wealths as are opposite thereunto; and in other publike affairs, retaining civil Communion with such as are constrained for the exercise of their Religion, to have a several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with those who are of the same Religion with them. This was the state of the Jewish Church both in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> the state of Christian Churches a long time after Christ. And in this case, because the proper affairs and actions of the Church, as it is the Church, hath no dependance on the Laws, or upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the civil State; and opinion hath thereby grown, that even so it should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; This was it which deceived <hi>Allen</hi> in the writing of his Apology: <hi>The Apostles</hi> (saith he) <hi>did govern the Church in</hi> Rome, <hi>when</hi> Nero <hi>bare rule, even as at this day in all the Churches dominions: The Church hath a spiritual Regiments without dependance and so ought she to have amongst Heathens, or with Christians.</hi> Another occasion of which mis-conceit is, That things appertaining to Religion are both distinguished from other affairs: and have always had in the Church spiritual persons chosen to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised about them. By which distinction of Spiritual affairs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arist.</hi> pol. l. 3. cap. 16.</note> and persons therein em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed from Temporal, the Error of personal separation always necessary between the Church and Common-wealth hath strengthened it self. For of every Politick Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that being true which <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, namely, <hi>That the scope thereof is not simply to live, nor the duty so much to provide for the life, as for means of living well:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Maccab. 7</note> And that even as the soul is the worthier part of man, so humane Societies are much more to care for that which tendeth properly to the souls estate, then for such tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things which the life hath need of. Other proof there needeth none to shew, that as by all men the Kingdom of God is to be sought first, for so in all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths things spiritual ought above temporal be sought for; and of things spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the chiefest is Religion. For this cause, persons and things imployed peculiarly about the affairs of Religion, are by an excellency termed Spiritual.

The Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self appointing both the one and the other in that Common-wealth, did not thereby distract it into several independent Communities, but institute several Functions of one and the self-same Communitie: Some Reasons therefore must there be alledged why it should be otherwise in the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>I shall not need to spend any great store of words in answering that which is brought out of the Holy Scripture to shew that Secular and Ecclesiastical affairs and offices are distinguished:<note place="margin">Three kinds of their proofs are stakes from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of affairs and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> neither that which hath been borrowed from antiquity, using by phrase of speech to oppose the Common-weal to the Church of Christ; neither yet their Reasons which are wont to be brought forth as witnesses, that the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal were always distinct: for whether a Church or Common-weal do differ, in not the question we strive for; but our controversie is, concerning the kind of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby they are severed the one from the other; whether as under heathen Kings of the Church did deal with her own affairs within her self, without depending at all upon any in Civil authority; and the Common-weal in hers, altogether without the privity of the Church: so it ought to continue still even in such Common-weals as have now publikely embraced the truth of Christian Religion; whether they ought evermore to be two societies in such sort, several and distinct: I ask therefore what society was that in <hi>Rome,</hi> whereunto the Apostle did give the name of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time? If they answer (as needs they must) that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in those dayes was that whole society of men, which in <hi>Rome</hi> professed the Name of Christ, and not that Religion which the Laws of the Common-weal
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:66185:273"/>
did then authorize; we say as much, and therefore grant, that the Common-weal of <hi>Rome</hi> was one society, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> another, in such sort that there was between them no mutual dependance. But when whole <hi>Rome</hi> became Christian, when they all embraced the Gospel, and made Laws in defence thereof, if it be heid that the Church and Common-weal of <hi>Rome</hi> did then remain as before; there is no way how this could be possible, save only one, and that is, They must restrain the name of a Church in a Christian Common-weal to the Clergy, excluding all the rest of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers both Prince and People; For if all that believe be contained in the name of the Church, how should the Church remain by personal subsistence divided from the Common-weal, when the whole Common-weal doth believe? The Church and the Common-weal are in this case therefore personally one Society, which Society being termed a Common-weal as it liveth under whatsoever Form of Secular Law and Regiment, a Church as it liveth under the spiritual Law of Christ, forsomuch as these two Laws contain so many and different Offices, there must of necessity be appointed in it some to one charge, and some to another, yet without dividing the whole, and making it two several impaled Societies.</p>

If one and the same society be both Church and Common-wealth, what sense can there be in that Speech; <hi>That they suffer and flourish together?</hi> What sense is that which maketh one thing to be adjudged to the Church, and another to the Common-weal? Finally, in that which putteth a difference between the causes of the Province and the Church, doth it not hereby appear, that the Church and the Common-weal, are things evermore personally separate? No, it doth not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appear that there is not perpetually any such separation; we speak of them as two, we may sever the rights and the causes of the one well enough from the other, in regard of that difference which we grant is between them, albeit we make no personal difference. For the truth is, that the Church and the Common-wealth, are names which import things really different: but those things are accidents, and such accidents as may and always should lovingly dwell together in one subject. Wherefore the real difference between the accidents signified by these names, doth not prove different subjects for them always to reside in. For albeit the subjects wherein they be resident be sometimes different, as when the people of God have their residence among Infidels. yet the nature of them is not such, but that their subject may be one, and therefore it is but a changeable accident, in those accidents they are to divers: There can be no Errour in our conceit concerning this Point, if we remember still what accident that is, for which a society hath the name of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and what accident that which doth cause it to be termed a Church: A Common-wealth we name it simply in regard of some regiment or policy under which men live; a Church for the truth of that Religion which they pofess. Now Names betokening accidents inabstracted, betoken no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> only the Accidents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but also together with them Subjects whereunto they cleave. As when we name a School-master and a Physitian, those names do not only betoken two accidents, Teaching and Curing, but also some person or persons in whom those accidents are. For there is no impediment but both may be in one man, as well as they are for the most part in divers. The Common-weal and
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:66185:273"/>
the Church therefore being such names, they do not only betoken these Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of civil Government and Christian Religion, which we have mentioned, but also together with them such multitudes as are the subjects of those accidents; Again, their nature being such as they may well enough dwell together in one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it followeth that their names though always implying that difference of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that hath been set down, yet do not always imply different subjects also. When we oppose therefore the Church and the Common-wealth in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society, we mean by the Common-wealth that Society with relation to all the publike affairs thereof, only the matter of true Religion excepted; by the Church, the same Society with only reference unto the matter of true Religion, without any affairs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some other Reasons there are which seem a little more neerly to make for the<note place="margin">3. Taken from the effect of punishment inflicted by the one or the other.</note> purpose, as long as they are but heard, and not sifted: For what though a man being severed by Excommunication from the Church be not thereby deprived of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the City, or being there discommoned, is not therefore forthwith excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and excluded the Church? What though the Church be bound to receive them upon Repentance, whom the Common-weal may refuse again to admit? If it chance the same man to be shut out of both, division of the Church and Common-weal which they contend for, will very hardly hereupon follow: For we must note, that members of a Christian Common-weal have a triple state; a natural, a civil, and a spiritual: No mans natural estate is cut off otherwise then by that capital execution. After which, he that is none of the body of the Common-wealth, doth not I think remain fit in the body of that visible Church. And concerning mans civil estate, the same is subject partly to inferiour abatement of liberty, and partly to diminution in the highest degree, such as banishment is; sith it casteth out quite and clean from the body of the Common-weal, it must needs also consequently cast the banished party even out of the very Church he was of before; because that Church and the Common-weal he was of, were both one and the same Society; So that whatsoever doth utterly separate a mans person from the one, it separateth from the other also. As for such abatements of civil estate as take away only some priviledge, dignity or other benefit, which a man enjoyeth in the Common-weal they reach only to our dealing with publike affairs, from which what may lett, but that men may be excluded, and thereunto restored again, without diminishing or augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of persons, in whom either Church or Common-wealth consisteth. He that by way of punishment loseth his voice in a publike election of Magistrates, ceaseth not thereby to be a Citizen; A man dis-franchised may notwithstanding enjoy as a Subject the common benefit of Protection under Laws and Magistrates; so that these inferiour diminutions which touch men civilly, but neither do clean extinguish their estates, as they belong to the Common-wealth, nor impair a whit
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:66185:274"/>
their condition as they are of the Church of God; These, I say, do clearly prove a difference of the one from the other, but such a difference as maketh nothing for their surmise of distracted Societies.</p>
                  <p>And concerning Excommunication, it curreth off indeed from the Church, and yet not from the Commonwealth; howbeit so, that the party Excommunicate is not thereby severed from one body which subsisteth in it self, and retained by another in like sort subsisting; but he which before had fellowship with that society whereof he was a member, as well touching things spiritual as civil, is now by force of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although not severed from the body in Civil affairs, nevertheless for the time cut off from it as touching Communion in those things which belong to the same body as it is the Church: A man which having been both Excommunicated by the Church, and deprived of Civil dignity in the Common-wealth; is upon his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance necessarily reunited into the one, but not of necessity into the other. What then? That which he is admitted unto, is a Communion in things Divine, whereof both parts are partakers; that from which he is withheld, is the benefit of some humane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, or right, which other Citizens happily enjoy. But are not these Saints and Citizens, one and the same people? are they not one and the same Society? Doth it hereby appear that the Church which received an Excommunicate, can have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency on any pers o which hath chief Authority and Power of these things in the Commonwealth whereunto the same party is not admitted. Wherefore to end this point, I conclude; First, that under the dominions of Infidels, the Church of Christ, and their Common-wealth, were two Societies independent. Secondly, that in those Common-wealths, where the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> beareth sway, one Society is both the Church and the Common-wealth: But the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth divide the body into two divers bodies, and doth not suffer the Church to depend upon the power of any civil Prince and Potenrate. Thirdly, that within this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> the case is neither as in the one, nor as in the other of the former two: but from the state of Pagans we differ, in that with us one Society is both the Church and Common-wealth, which with them it was not; as also from the state of those Nations which subjected themselves to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that our Church hath dependance from the Chief in our Common-wealth, which it hath not when he is suffered to rule. In a word, our state is according to the pattern of Gods own antient elect people, which people was not part of them the Common-wealth, and part of them the Church of God; but the self-same people whole and entire were both under one Chief Governour, on whose Supream Authority they did all depend. Now the drift of all that hath been alledged to prove perpetual separation and independency between the Church and the Commonwealth, is, that this being held necessary, it might consequently be thought fit, that in a Christian Kingdom, he whose power is greatest over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, may not lawfully have supremacy of power also over the Church, that is to say, so far as to order thereby and to dispose of spiritual affairs, so far as the highest uncommanded Commander in them. Whereupon it is grown a Question, whether Government Ecclesiastical, and power of Dominion in such degrees as the Laws of this Land do grant unto the Soveraign Governour thereof, may by the said supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour lawfully be enjoy'd and held: For resolution wherein, we are, First, to define what the power of dominion is. Secondly, then to shew by what right. Thirdly, after what sort. Fourthly, in what measure. Fiftly in what inconveniency. According to whose example Christian Kings may have it. And when these generals are opened, to examine afterwards how lawful that is which we in regard of Dominion do attribute unto our own: namely the title of headship over the Church, so far as the bounds of this Kingdom do reach. Secondly, the Prerogative of calling and dissolving great assemblies, about spiritual affairs publick. Thirdly, the right of assenting unto all those orders concerning Religion, which must after be in force as Law. Fourthly, the advancement of Principal Church-Governours to their rooms of Prelacy. Fifthly, judicial authority higher then others are capable of. And sixthly, exemption from being punishable with such kind of Censures as the platform of Reformation doth teach, that they ought to be subject unto.</p>

The Apostle therefore giving instruction to publike Societies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that all things be orderly done: Order can have no place in things, except it be settled amongst the persons that shall by office be conversant about them. And if things and persons be ordered, this doth imply that they are distinguished by degrees. For or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a gradual disposition: The whole world consisting of parts so many, so different, is by this only thing upheld; he which framed them, hath set them in order: The very Deity it self both keepeth and requireth for ever this to be kept as a Law, that whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a coagmentation of many, the lowest be knit unto the highest, by that which being interjacent, may cause each to cleave to the other, and so all to continue one. This order of things and persons in publike Societies, is the work of Policie, and the proper instrument thereof in every degree is power, power being that hability which we have of our selves, or receive from others for performance of any action. If the action which we have to perform be conversant about matters of meer Religion, the power of performing it is then spiritual; And if that power be such as hath not any other to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule it, we term it Dominion, or Power Supream; so far as the bounds thereof extend. When therefore Christian Kings are said to have Spiritual Dominion or Supream Power in Ecclesiastical affairs and causes, the meaning is, that within their own Precincts and Territories, they have an authority and power to command even in matters of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and that there is no higher nor greater that can in those cases overcommand them, where they are placed to raign as Kings. But withal we must likewise note that their power is termed supremacy, as being the highest, not simply without exception of any thing. For what man is so brain-sick, as not to except in such speeches God himself the King of all Dominion? Who doubteth, but that the King who receiveth it, must hold it of, and order the Law according to that old axiom, <hi>Altribuat Rex legi, quod lex attribuit es potestatem:</hi> And again, <hi>Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo &amp; lege.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas it is altogether without reason, <hi>That Kings are judged to have by vertue of their Dominion, although greater power then any, yet not than all the state of those Societies conjoyned, wherein such Soveraign rule is given them</hi>; there is not any thing hereunto to the contrary by us affirmed, no not when we grant supream Authority unto Kings; because Supremacy is not otherwise intended or meant to exclude partly sorraign powers, and partly the power which belongeth in several unto others, contained as parts in that politick body over which those Kings have Supremacy; <hi>Where the King hath power of Dominion, or Supream power, there no forrain State, or Potentate, no State or Potentate Domestical, whether it consisteth of one or many, can possibly have in the same affairs and causes Authority higher than the King.</hi> Power of Spiritual Dominion, therefore, is in causes Ecclesiastical, that ruling Authority, which neither any forraign State, not yet any part of that politick body at home, wherein the same is established, can lawfully over-rule. It hath been declared already in general, how <hi>the best establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed dominion is, where the Law doth most rule the King</hi>; the true effect whereof particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is found as well in Ecclesiastical as Civil affairs: In these the King, through his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power, may do sundry great things himself, both appertaining to Peace and War, both at home, and by command and by commerce with States abroad, because the Law doth so much permit. Sometimes on the other side, <hi>The King alone hath no right to do without consent of his Lords and Commons in Parliament: The King himself cannot change the nature of Pleas, nor Courts, no not so much as restore blood</hi>; because the Law is a hath unto him: the positive Laws of the Realm have a priviledg therein, and restrain the Kings power; which positive Laws, whether by custom or otherwise established without repugnancy to the Laws of God, and nature, ought not less to be in force even in supernatural affairs of the Church, whether in regard of Ecclesiastical Laws, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace that of <hi>Ambrose, Imperator bonus intrae Ecclesiam, non supra Ecclesiam, est.

First unto me, it seemeth almost out of doubt &amp; controversie, that every independent multitude before any certain form of Regiment established, hath under God Supream Authority, full Dominion over it self, even as a man not tyed with the band of subjection as yet unto any other, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himself the like power. God, creating mankind, did endue it naturally with power to guide it self, in what kind of Society soever he should chuse to live. A man which is born Lord of himself, may be made an others servant. And that power which naturally whole societies have, may be derived unto many, few, or one; under whom the rest shall then live in subjection: Some multitudes are brought into subjection by force, as they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subdued, are fain to submit their necks unto what yoak it pleaseth their Conquerors to lay upon them; which Conquerors by just and lawful Wars do hold their power over such multitudes as a thing descending unto them; Divine Providence it self so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. For it is God who giveth victory in the day of War, and unto whom Dominion in this sort is derived, the same they enjoy according to the Law of Nations; which Law authorizeth Conquerours to reign as absolute Lords over them whom they vanquish.

By which of these means soever it happen, that Kings or Governors be advanced unto their Estates, we must acknowledg both their lawful choice to be approved of God, and themselves to be Gods Lievtenants; and cofess their Power which they have to be his. As for Supream Power in Ecclesiastical affairs, the Word of God doth no where appoint that all Kings should have it, neither that any should not have it; for which cause, it seemeth to stand altogether by humane Right, that unto Christian Kings there is such Dominion given.</p>
                     <p>Again, on whom the same is bestowed at mens discretions, they likewise do hold it by Divine Right: If God in his revealed Word, hath appointed such

Who doth doubt but that sundry duties and affairs depending thereupon are prescribed by the Word of God, and consequently by that very right to be exacted? For example sake, the power which <hi>Romane</hi> Emperors had over foreign Provinces, was not a thing which the Law of God did ever Institute: Neither was <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> by especial Commission from Heaven therewith invested, and yet paiment of Tribute unto <hi>Caesar</hi> being now made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, is the plain Law of Jesus Christ: unto Kings by humane Right, Honor by very Divine Right, is due; mans Ordinances, are many times proposed as grounds in the Statutes of God: And therefore of what kind soever the means be, whereby Governors are lawfully advanced to their States, as we by the Laws of God stand bound meekly to acknowledg them for Gods Lieutenants; and to confess their Power his: So by the same Law they are both authorized, and required to use that Power as far as it may be in any State available to his Honor. The Law appointeth no man to be a husband: but if a man hath betaken himself unto that condition, it giveth him power &amp; Authority over his own Wife. That the Christian world should be ordered by the Kingly Regiment, the Law of God doth not any where command: and yet the Law of God doth give them, which once are exalted unto that place of Estate, right to exact at the hands of their Subjects general obedience in whatsoever affairs their power may serve to command, and God doth ratifie works of that Soveraign Authority, which Kings have received by men. This is therefore the right whereby Kings do hold their power; but yet in what sort the same doth rest and abide in them, it somewhat behoveth further to search, where that we be not enforced to make overlarge discourses about the different conditions of Soveraign or Supream Power; that which we speak of Kings, shall be in respect of the State, and according to the nature of this Kingdom, where the people are in no subjection, but such as willingly themselves have condescended unto for their own most behoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing, <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Supream Head of this Church under Christ,</hi> a charitable conjecture is made, that he spake by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information; howbeit as he professeth utter dislike of that name, so whether the name be used or no, the very Power it self which we give unto Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, he much complaineth of, and protesteth, <hi>That their Power over all things was it which had ever wounded him deeply: That un-advised Persons had made them too Spiritual; that throughout</hi> Germany <hi>this fault did reign; that in these very parts where</hi> Calvin <hi>himself was, it prevailed more than was to be wished; that Rulers by imagining themselves so Spiritual, have taken away Ecclesiastical Government; that they think they cannot reign unless they abolish all the Authority of the Cuurch, and be themselves the chief Iudges, as well in Doctrine, as in the whole Spiritual Regency.</hi> So that, in truth, the Question is, Whether the Magistrate by being Head in such sense as we term him, do use or exercise any part of that Authority, not which belongeth unto Christ, but which other men ought to have.</p>
                     <p>These things being first considered thus, it will be easier to judge concerning our own estate, whether by force of Ecclesiastical Government, Kings have any other kinde of Prerogative that they may lawfully hold and enjoy. It is, as some do imagine, too much, that Kings of <hi>England</hi> should be termed Heads in relation of the Church. That which we do understand by <hi>Headship,</hi> is, their only Supreme Power in Ecclesiastical Affairs and Causes; That which lawful Princes are, what should make it unlawful for men in Spiritual Stiles or Titles to signifie? If the having of Supream Power be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why is the expressing thereof, by the Title of <hi>Head,</hi> condemned? They seem in words, (at leastwise some of them) now at the length to acknowledge, that Kings may have Dominion or Supream Government even over all, both Persons and Causes. We in terming our Princes, <hi>Heads of the Church,</hi> do but testifie that we acknowledge them such Governours. Again, to this it will peradventure be replyed,<note place="margin">T.

                        <hi>That Christ, God had set on his right hand in the Heavenly places above all Regency and Authority, and Power, and Dominion, and whatsoever name is named, not in this World only, but in that which shall be also: and hath under his feet set all things, and hath given him head above all things unto the Church, which is his Body, even the fulness of him which accomplisheth all in all.</hi> To the <hi>Colossians</hi> in like manner,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>That he is the head of the body of the Church, who is a first born Regency out of the dead, to the end he might be made amongst them all such an one as both the Chiefty:</hi> He meaneth, amongst all them whom he mentioned before, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>By him all things that are, were made; the things in the Heavens, and the things in the Earth, the things that are visible, and the things that are invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Regencies,</hi> &amp;c. Unto the fore-alledged Arguments therefore we answer: First, that it is not simply the title of <hi>Head,</hi> in such sort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as the Apostle himself meant it; so that the same being imparted in another sense unto others, doth not any wayes make those others his Equals; in as much as diversity of things is usually to be understood, even when of words there is no diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; and it is onely the adding of one and the same thing unto divers Persons, which doth argue equality in them. If I term Christ and <hi>Cesar</hi> Lords, yet this is no equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Cesar</hi> with Christ, because it is not thereby intended: <hi>To term the Emperor Lord,</hi> (saith Tertullian) <hi>I, for my part, will not refuse, so that I be not required to call him Lord in the same sense that God is so termed.</hi> Neither doth it follow, which is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the second place, that if the Civil Magistrate may be intituled a <hi>Head,</hi> he may as well be termed <hi>the first begotten of all Creatures, the first begotten of the Dead, and the Redeemer of his People.</hi> For albeit the former dignity doth lift him up to less than these, yet these terms are not applyable and apt to signifie any other inferior dignity, as the former term of <hi>Head</hi> was. The Argument of matter which the Apostle follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hath small evidence or proof, that his meaning was to appropriate unto Christ, that the aforesaid title; otherwise than only in such sense as doth make it, being so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, too high to be given to any Creature.</p>
                     <p>As for the force of the Article where our Lord and Saviour is called the <hi>Head,</hi> it serveth to tye that unto him by way of excellency, which in meaner degrees is common to others; it doth not exclude any other utterly from being termed <hi>Head,</hi> but from being intituled as Christ is <hi>the Head,</hi> by way of the very highest degree of excellency: Not in the communication of Names, but in the confusion of things, there is errour. Howbeit, if <hi>Head</hi> were a Name that could not well be, nor never had been used to signifie that which a Magistrate may be in relation to some Church; but were by continual use of speech appropriated unto the onely thing it signifieth, being applyed unto Jesus Christ; then, although we must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our selves a right understanding, yet ought we otherwise rather to speak, unless we interpret our own meaning by some clause of plain speech, because we are else in manifest danger to be understood according to that construction and sense, wherein such words are personally spoken. But here the rarest construction, and most removed from common sense, is that which the Word doth import being applyed unto Christ; that which we signifie by it in giving it to the Magistrate, it is a great deal more familiar in the common conceit of men.</p>

kept in things concerning the first Table; if even hereupon they term him <hi>the Head of the Church,</hi> which is <hi>his Kingdom,</hi> it should not seem so unfit a thing; Which Title surely we could not communicate to any other, no not although it should at our hands be exacted with torments: but that our meaning herein is made known to the World, so that no man which will understand can easily be ignorant, that we do not impart unto Kings, when we term them <hi>Heads,</hi> the honor which is properly given to our Lord and Saviour Christ, when the blessed Apostle in Scripture doth term him the <hi>Head of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The power which we signifie in that name, differeth in three things plainly from that which Christ doth challenge.</p>
                     <p>First, it differeth in order, because God hath given to his Church for the Head,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.21.</note> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Secondly, again, as he differeth in order, so in measure of Power also; because God hath given unto him the ends of the Earth for his Possesion; unto him,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

How Kings are restrained, and how their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is limited, we have shewed before; so that unto him is given by the title of <hi>Headship ever the Church</hi> that largeness of Power, wherein neither Man, nor Angel, can be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not compared with him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the last and greatest difference between him and them, is in the very kinde of their Power. The Head being, of all other parts of the Body, most divine, hath dominion over all the rest; it is the fountain of sense, of motion, the throne where the guide of the Soul doth reign; the Court from whence direction of all things hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man proceedeth. Why Christ is called <hi>the Head of the Church,</hi> these Causes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do yield. As the Head is the chiefest part of a man, above which there is none, alwayes joyned with the Body; so Christ the highest in his Church, is alwayes knit to it. Again, as the Head giveth sense and motion unto all the Body, so he quickneth us, and, together with understanding of heavenly things, giveth strength to walk therein. Seeing therefore that they cannot affirm Christ sensibly present, or alwayes visibly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his Body the Church which is on Earth, in as much as his Corporal resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in Heaven; again, seeing they do not affirm (it were intolerable if they should) that Christ doth personally administer the external Regiment of outward Actions in the Church, but, by the secret inward influence of his Grace, giveth Spiritual life, and the strength of ghostly motions thereunto: Impossible it is, that they should so close up their eyes, as not to discern what odds there is between that kinde of operation, which we imply in the <hi>Headship</hi> of Princes, and that which agreeth to our Saviours dominion over the Church. The <hi>Headship</hi> which we give unto Kings, is altogether visibly exercised, and ordereth only the external frame of the Church-affairs here amongst us; so that it plainly differeth from Christ's, even in very nature and kinde. To be in such sort united unto the Church as he is; to work as he worketh, either on the whole Church or upon any particular Assembly, or in any one man; doth neither agree; nor hath any possibility of agreeing unto any one besides him.</p>

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:66185:279"/>
his Authority cometh from God, simply and immediately, even as our Saviour Christ's doth.</hi> Whereunto the sum of our Answer is, First, that as Christ being Lord or Head over all, doth, by vertue of that Soveraignty, rule all; so he hath no more a Superiour in governing his Church, than in exercising Soveraign Dominion upon the rest of the World besides. Secondly, That all Authority, as well Civil as Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, is subordinate unto him. And Thirdly, the Civil Magistrate being termed Head, by reason of that Authority in Ecclesiastical Affairs which hath been already declared that themselves do acknowledge to be lawful: It followeth, that he is a Head even subordinated of Christ, and to Christ. For more plain explication where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unto God we acknowledge daily, that Kingdom, Power, and Glory, are his; that he is the immortal and invisible King of Ages, as well the future which shall be, as the present which now is. That which the Father doth work as Lord and King over all, he worketh not without, but by the Son, who, through coeternal generation, receiveth of the Father that Power, which the Father hath of himself. And for that cause our Saviours words concerning his own Dominion, are, <hi>To me all Power both in Heaven and in Earth is given</hi>: The Father by the Son did create, and doth guide all, wherfore Christ hath Supream dominion over the whole universal World, Christ is God, Christ is <gap reason="foreign">

The Works of Supream Dominion which have been since the first beginning wrought by the power of the Son of God, are now most properly and truly the Works of the Son of Man: the Word made Flesh doth sit for ever, and reign, as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord over all.

His Works of Dominion are, in sundry degrees and kindes, according to the different conditions of them that are subject unto it: he presently doth govern, and hereafter shall judge the World, intire and wholly; and therefore his Regal power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be with truth restrained unto a proportion of the World only.

The works of his Providence
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:66185:280"/>
for the preservation of Mankinde, by upholding Kingdoms, not only obedient unto, but also obstinate and rebellious against him, are such as proceed from Divine Power; and are not the works of his Providence for safety of God's Elect, by gathering, inspiring, comforting, and every way preserving his Church, such as proceed from the same Power likewise? Surely, if Christ, as God and Man, hath ordained certain means for the gathering and keeping of his Church, seeing this doth belong to the Government of that Church: it must in reason follow, I think, that, as God and Man, he worketh in Church Regiment; and consequently hath no more there any Superiours, than in the Government of the Common-wealth. Again, to be in the midst of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are assembled in his Name, and to be with them to the World's end, are comforts which Christ doth perform to his Church as Lord and Governour; yea, such as he cannot perform but by that very Power wherein he hath no Superiour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unless it can be proved, that all the works of our Saviours Government in the Church, are done by the mere and onely force of his Human nature, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but to acknowledge it a manifest errour, that Christ, in the Government of the World, is equal to the Father, but not in the Government of the Church. Indeed, to the honour of this Dominion, it cannot be said, that God did exalt him otherwise than only according to that Human nature, wherein he was made low. For, as the Son of God, there could no advancement or exaltation grow unto him: And yet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, whereunto he was in his Human nature lifted up, is not without Divine Power exercised. It is by Divine Power, that the Son of man, who sitteth in Heaven, doth work as King and Lord upon us which are on Earth. The exercise of his Dominion over the Church Militant cannot choose but cease, when there is no longer any Militant Church in the World. And therefore, as Generals of Armies when they have finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Work, are wont to yield up such Commissions as were given for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and to remain in the state of Subjects, and not as Lords, as concerning their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer authority; even so, when the end of all things is come, the Son of man (who till then reigneth) shall do the like, as touching Regiment over the Militant Church on the Earth.

Touching that Authority which Civil Magistrates have in Ecclesiastical Affairs, it being from God by Christ,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:66185:280"/>
as all other good things are, cannot chuse but be held as a thing received at his hands; and, because such power is of necessity for the ordering of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the essence and very being of the Church consisteth, can no otherwise slow from him, than according to that special care which he hath to govern and guide his own People: it followeth, that the said Authority is of and under him after a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, in that <hi>he is Head of the Church,</hi> and not in respect of his general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency over the World. <hi>All things</hi> (saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> speaking unto the Church) <hi>are yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is God's.</hi> Kings are Christ's as Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are of the Church, if not collectively, yet divisively understood.

                        <hi>That although, for several Companies of Men, there may be several Heads or Governours, differing in the measure of their Authority from the Chiefest, who is Head over all; yet it cannot be in the Church, for that the reason why Head-Magistrates appoint others for such several places, it, Because they cannot be present every where to perform the Office of an Head. But Christ is never from his Body, nor from any Part of it, and therefore needeth not to substitute any, which may be Heads, some over one Church, and some over another.</hi> Indeed the consideration of Man's imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which maketh many Heads necessary, where the burthen is too great for one, moved <hi>Iethro</hi> to be a Perswader of <hi>Moses,</hi> that a number of Heads of Rulers might be instituted for discharge of that duty by parts, which in whole he saw was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. Now, although there be not in Christ any such defect, or weakness; yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes there be divers, more than we are able to search into, wherefore it might seem unto him expedient to divide his Kingdom into many Provinces, and place many Heads over it, that the Power which each of them hath in particular with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, might illustrate the greatness of his unlimited Authority. Besides, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Christ be Spiritually alwayes united unto every part of his Body, which is the Church: Nevertheless, we do all know, and they themselves who alledge this, will, I doubt not, confess also, that from every Church here visible, Christ, touching visible and corporal presence, is removed as farr as Heaven from the Earth is distant. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Government is a thing necessary for the Church; and it doth not appear, how the exercise of visible Government over such Multitudes every where dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, should consist without sundry visible Governours, whose Power being the greatest in that kinde, so farr as it reacheth, they are in consideration thereof term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so farr Heads. Wherefore, notwithstanding the perpetual conjunction, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof our Saviour, alwayes remaineth spiritually united unto the parts of his Mystical Body, Heads indeed with Supream Power, extending to a certain compasse, are for the exercise of a visible Regiment not unnecessary. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons there are belonging unto this branch, which seem to have been objected, rather for the exercise of mens wits, in dissolving Sophismes, than that the Authors of them could think in likelyhood, thereby to strengthen their cause. For example,<note place="margin">T. C. l. p. 419. Lk <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.6.9.</note> 
                        <hi>If the Magistrate be Head of the Church within his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, then is he none of the Church: For all that are of the Church make the Body of Christ, and every one of the Church fulfilleth the place of one member of the Body: By making the Magistrate therefore Head, we do exclude him from being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber subject to the Head, and so leave him no place in the Church.</hi> By which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the name of a Body Politick, is supposed to be alwayes taken of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour sort alone, excluding the Principal Guides and Governors, contrary to all Mens customes of speech. The Errour ariseth by misconceiving of some Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-sentences, where Christ as the Head, and the Church as the Body, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared or opposed the one to the other. And, because in such comparisons o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppositions, the Body is taken for those only parts which are subject unto the Head;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:66185:281"/>
they imagine, that who so is the Head of any Church, he is therefore even excluded from being a part of that Church; That the Magistrate can be none of the Church, if so we make him the Head of the Church in his own Dominions: A chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the Church therefore. Next, this is surely a strange conclusion, A Church doth indeed make the Body of Christ, being wholly taken together; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the same Church fulfilleth the place of a Member in the Body, but not the place of an inferiour Member, the which hath Supream Authority and Power over all the rest. Wherefore, by making the Magistrate Head in his own Dominions, we exclude him from being a Member subject unto any other Person, which may visibly there rule in place of a Superiour or Head over him; but so farr are we off from leaving him by this means no place in the Church, that we do grant him the hief place. Indeed the Heads of those visible Bodies, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, can be but parts inferiour in that Spiritual Body which is but one; yea, they may from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>As little to the purpose are those other Cavils: <hi>A Church which hath the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate for Head, is perfect man without Christ:</hi> So that the knitting of our Saviour thereunto, should be an addition of that which is too much. Again, <hi>If the Church be the Body of Christ, and of the Civil Magistrate, it shall have two heads, which being monstrous, is to the great dishonour of Christ and his Church.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>If the Church be planted in a popular estate, then, forasmuch as all govern in common, and all have Authority, all shall be Heads there, and no Body at all, which is another Monster.</hi> It might be seared what this birth of so many Monsters together might portend, but that we know how things, natural enough in themselves, may seem monstrous, through misconceit; which errour of minde is indeed a Monster: and the skilful in Nature's mysteryes, have used to term it the Wombe of Monsters; if any be, it is that troubled Understanding, wherein, because things lye confusedly mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what they are it appeareth not. A Church perfect without Christ, I know not how a man shall imagin; unless there may be either Christianity without Christ, or else a Church without Christianity. If Magistrates be Heads of the Church, they are of necessity Christians, then is their Head Christ. The adding of Christ universal Head over all, unto Magistrates particular Headship, is no more superfluous in any Church than, in other Societyes: each is to be both severally subject unto some Head, and to have a Head also general for them all to be subject unto. For so in Armys, in Civil Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, we see it fareth: A Body Politick, in such respects, is not like a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body; in this, more Heads than one is superfluous; in that, not. It is neither mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, nor yet uncomely for a Church to have different Heads: for if Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be in number many, and every of them a perfect Body by it self, Christ being Lord and Head over all; Why should we judge it a thing more monstrous for one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have two Heads, than one Head so many Bodyes? Him that God hath made the Supream Head of the whole Church; the Head, not only of that Mystical Body, which the eye of man is not able to discern, but even of every Christian Politick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, of every visible Church in the World? And whereas, Lastly, it is thought so strange, that in Popular States, a Multitude to it self should be both Body and Head, all this Wonderment doth grow from a little over-sight, in deeming that the Subject wherein Headship ought to reside, should be evermore some one Person; which thing is not necessary. For in the collective Body that hath not derived as yet the Principality of power into some one or few, the whole of necessity must be Head over each part; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it could not have power possibly to make any one certain Person head, inasmuch as the very power of making a Head belongeth unto Headship. These supposed <hi>Monsters</hi> we see therefore are no such <hi>Giants,</hi> as that there should need any <hi>Hercules</hi> to tame them.</p>
                     <p>The last difference which we have between the Title of Head when we give it unto Christ, and when we give it to other Governours, is, that the kinde of Dominion which it importeth, is not the same in both: Christ is Head, as being the Fountain of Life and Ghostly nutriment, the Well-spring of Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings powred into the Body of the Church, they Heads, as being the principal
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:66185:281"/>
instruments for the Churches outward Government; he Head, as Founder of the House, they, as his chiefest Overseers. Against this is exception especially taken, and our Purveyours are herein said to have their provision from the Popish Shambles: for by <hi>Fighius</hi> and <hi>Harding,</hi> to prove that Christ alone is not Head of the Church, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, they say, is brought, that, according to the inward influence of Grace, Christ only is Head: but, according to the outward Government, the being of Head is a thing common to him with others. To raise up Falshoods of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and bring it for confirmation of any thing doubtful, which already hath sufficiently been proved an error, and is worthily so taken, this would justly deserve censuring. But, shall manifest truth therefore be reproached, because men convicted in some things of manifest untruth, have at any time thought or alledged it? If too much eagerness against their Adversaries had not made them forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they might remember, where being charged as Maintainers of those very things, for which others before them have been condemned of Heresie, yet, lest the name of any such Heretick, holding the same which they do, should make them odious; they stick not frankly to confess,<note place="margin">T.

this general we make two distinct kindes; the one invisible, exercised by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his own Person; the other outwardly administred by them, whom Christ doth allow, to be Rulers and Guiders of his Church. Touching the former of these two kindes, we teach that Christ, in regard thereof, is particularly termed <hi>the Head of the Church of God</hi>; neither can any other Creature, in that sense and meaning, be termed Head, besides him, because it importeth the conduct and government of our Souls, by the hand of that blessed Spirit wherewith we are sealed and marked, as being peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly his. Him onely therefore do we acknowledge to be the Lord, which dwelleth, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and reigneth in our hearts; him only to be that Head, which giveth salvation and life unto his Body; him onely to be that Fountain from whence the influence of heavenly Graces distilleth, and is derived into all parts, whether the Word, or the Sacraments, or Discipline, or whatsoever, be the means whereby it floweth. As for the Power of administring these things in the Church of Christ, which Power we call the Power of Order, it is indeed both Spiritual and His; Spiritual, because such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concerns as the Spirit: His, because by him it was instituted. Howbeit, neither Spiritual, as that which is inwardly and invisibly exercised; nor His, as that which he himself, in Person, doth exercise. Again, that power of Dominion, which is indeed the point of this Controversie, and doth also belong to the second kinde of Spiritual Government, namely, unto that Regiment which is external and visible: this likewise being Spiritual in regard of the manner about which it dealeth; and being his, in as much as he approveth whatsoever is done by it, must notwithstanding be distinguished also from that Power whereby he himself in Person administreth the former kinde of his own Spiritual Regiment, because he himself in Person doth not administer this, we do not therefore vainly imagine, but truly and rightly discern a Power external and visible in the Church, exercised by men, and severed in nature from that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power of Christ's own Regiment; which Power is termed Spiritual, because it worketh secretly, inwardly, and invisibly: His, because none doth, nor can it personally exercise, either besides, or together with him, seeing that him onely we may name our Head, in regard of His; and yet, in regard of that other Power from this, term others also, besides him, Heads, without any contradiction at all; which thing may very well serve for answer unto that also which they further alledge against the aforesaid distinction, namely,<note place="margin">T.

                     <p>The Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> together with the Convocation annexed thereunto, is that whereupon the very essence of all Government within this Kingdom doth depend, it is even the body of the whole Realm; it consisteth of the King, and of all that within the Land are subject unto him. The Parliament is a Court, not so merely Temporal, as if it might meddle with nothing but onely Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Wool: Those dayes of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> are not yet forgotten, wherein the Realm did submit it self unto the Legate of Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> at which time, had they been perswaded, as this man seemeth now to be, had they thought, that there is no more force in Laws made by Parliament concerning Church-Affairs, then if men should take upon them to make Orders for the Hierarchies of Angels in Heaven, they might have taken all former Statutes of that kinde as cancelled, and, by reason of nullity, abrogated. What need was there, that they should bargain with the Cardinal, and purchase their Pardon by promise made before-hand, that what Laws they had made, assented unto, or executed, against the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Supremacy, the same they would, in that present Parliament, effectually abrogate and repeal?

The most natural and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious course in making Laws, is, that the matter of them be taken from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wisest in those things which they are to concern. In matters of God, to set down a form of Prayer, a solemn confession of the Articles of the Christian Faith, and Ceremonies meet for the exercise of Religion; It were unnatural not to think the Pastors and Bishops of our Souls a great deal more fit, than men of Secular Trades, and Callings: Howbeit, when all, which the wisdome of all sorts can do, is done for the devising of Laws in the Church, it is the general consent of all that giveth them the form and vigour of Laws, without which they could be no more unto us than the Councel of Physitians to the sick. Well might they seem as wholesom admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and instructions; but Laws could they never be, without consent of the whole Church, to be guided by them; whereunto both Nature and the practise of the Church of God set down in Scripture, is found every way so fully consonant, that God himself would not impose, no not his own Laws, upon his People, by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> without their free and open consent. Wherefore, to define and determine, even of the Churches Affairs by way of assent and approbation, as Laws are defined in that Right of Power, which doth give them the force of Laws; thus to define of our own Churches Regiment, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> hath competent Authority.</p>
                     <p>Touching that Supremacy of Power which our Kings have in this case of making Laws, it resteth principally in the strength of a negative voice, which not to give them, were to deny them that, without which they were Kings but by mere title, and not in exercise of Dominion. Be it in Regiment Popular, Aristocratical, or Regal, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality resteth in that Person, or those Persons unto whom is given right of excluding any kinde of Law whatsoever it be, before establishment. This doth belong unto Kings, as Kings; Pagan Emperors, even <hi>Nero</hi> himself had no less; but much more than this in the Laws of his own Empire. That he challenged not any interest of giving voice in the laws of the Church, I hope no man will so construe, as if the cause were conscience, and fear to encroach upon the Apostles right.

For when Laws were made, the first thing was to have them devised; thesecond to sift them with as much exactness of Judgement as any way might be used; the next by solemn voyce of Soveraign Authority to pass them, and give them the force of Laws. It cannot in any reason seem otherwise than most fit, that unto Ecclesiastical Persons the care of devising Ecclesiastical Laws be committed, even as the care of Civil unto them which are in those Affairs most skilful. This taketh not away from Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Persons, all right of giving voyce with others, when Civil Laws are proposed for Regiment of the Common-wealth, whereof themselves, though now the World would have them annihilated, are notwithstanding as yet a part; much less doth it cut off that part of the power of Princes, whereby, as they claim, so we know no reasonable cause wherefore we may not grant them, without offence to Almighty God, so much Authority in making all manner of Laws within their own Dominions, that neither Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, nor Ecclesiastical do pass without their Royal assent.</p>
                     <p>In devising and discussing of Laws, Wisdom especially is required; but that which establisheth them, and maketh them, is Power; even Power of Dominion; the Chiefty whereof (amongst us) resteth in the Person of the King. Is there any Law of Christs, which forbiddeth Kings and Rulers of the Earth to have such Soveraign and Supream Power in the making of Laws, either Civil or Ecclesiastical? If there be, our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie hathan end. Christ, in his Church, hath not appointed any such Law, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temporal Power, as God did of old unto the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi>; but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that to be at the World's free choice, his chiefest care is, that the Spiritual Law of the Gospel might be published farr and wide. They that received the Law of Christ, were, for a long time, People scattered in sundry Kingdoms, Christianity not exempting them from the Laws which they had been subject unto, saving only in such cases as those Laws did injoyn that which the Religion of Christ did forbid: Hereupon grew their manifold Persecutions throughout all places where they lived; as oft as it thus came to pass, there was no possibility that the Emperours and Kings under whom they lived, should meddle any whit at all with making Laws for the Church. From Christ, therefore, having received Power, who doubteth, but as they did, so they might binde them to such Orders as seemed fittest for the maintenance of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the leave of high or low in the Common-wealth; for as much as in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was divided utterly from them, and they from it. But when the mightiest began to like of the Christian Faith; by their means, whole Free-States and Kingdoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto Christ. Now the question is, Whether Kings, by embracing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, do thereby receive any such Law as taketh from them the weightiest part of that Soveraignty which they had even when they were Heathens: Whether, being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, they might do more in causes of Religion, than now they can by the Laws of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:66185:284"/>
God, being true Believers. For, whereas in Regal States, the King or Supream Head of the Common-wealth, had, before Christianity, a supream stroak in making of Laws for Religion; he must by embracing Christian Religion utterly deprive himself thereof, and in such causes become subject unto his Subjects, having even within his own Dominions them whose commandment he must obey; unlesse his Power be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Head of some foreign Spiritual Potentate: so that either a foreign or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestical Commander upon Earth, he must admit more now, than before he had, and that in the chiefest things whereupon Common-wealths do stand. But ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent it is unto all men which are not Strangers unto the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, that no State of the World receiving Christianity, is, by any Law therein contained, bound to resign the Power which they lawfully held before: but over what Persons, and in what causes soever the same hath been in force, it may so remain and continue still. That which, as Kings, they might do in matters of Religion, and did in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of false Religion, being Idolatrous and Superstitious Kings, the same they are now even in every respect fully authorized to do in all affairs pertinent to the state of true Christian Religion. And,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 3. p. 51.</note> concerning the Supream Power of making Laws for all Persons, in all causes to be guided by, it is not to be let passe, that the head Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this Headship are constrained to acknowledge the King endued even with this very Power, so that he may and ought to exercise the same, taking order for the Church and her affairs, of what nature of kinde soever, in case of necessity: as when there is no lawful Ministry, which they interpret then to be (and this surely is a point very remarkable,) wheresoever the Ministry is wicked. A wicked Ministry is no lawful Ministry; and in such sort no lawful Ministry, that, what doth belong unto them as Ministers by right of their calling, the same to be annihilated in respect of their bad qualities; their wickedness in it self a deprivation of right to deal in the affairs of the Church, and a warrant for others to deal in them which are held to be of a clean other Society, the Members whereof have been before so peremptorily for ever excluded from power of dealing for ever with affairs of the Church. They which once have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughly this Lesson, will quickly be capable perhaps of another equivalent unto it. For the wickedness of the Ministery transfers their right unto the King; In case the King be as wicked as they, to whom then shall the right descend? There is no remedy, all must come by devolution at length, even as the Family of <hi>Brown</hi> will have it, unto the godly among the people, for confusion unto the wise and the great, by the poor and the simple: Some <hi>Kniper doling,</hi> with his retinue, must take this work of the Lord in hand; and the making of Church-Laws and Orders, must prove to be their right in the end: If not for love of the truth, yet for shame of grosse absurdities, let these contentions and stifling fancies be abandoned. The cause which moved them for a time to hold a wicked Ministery no lawful Ministry; and in this defect of a lawful Ministery, authorized Kings to make Laws and Orders for the Affairs of the Church, till it were well established, is surely this. First, They see that whereas the continual dealing of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Affairs of the Church, doth make now very strong against them, the burthen whereof they shall in time well enough shake off, if it may be obtained, that it is indeed lawful for Kings to follow these holy examples; howbeit no longer than during the case of necessity, while the wickednesse, and in respect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the unlawfulness of the Ministery doth continue. Secondly, They perceive right well, that unlesse they should yield Authority unto Kings in case of such supposed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the Discipline they urge were clean excluded, as long as the Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> doth thereunto remain opposite. To open therefore a door for her entrance, there is no remedy but the Tenet must be this: That now when the Ministery of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is universally wicked, and in that respect hath lost all Authority, and is become no lawful Ministery, no such Ministery as hath the right, which otherwise should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them if they were vertuous and godly, as their Adversaries are; in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity the King may do somewhat for the Church: that which we do imply in the name of Headship, he may both have and exercise till they be entered, which will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen and ease him of it: till they come, the King is licensed to hold that Power which we call Headship. But what afterwards? In a Church ordered,<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 19.</note> that which the Supream Magistrate hath to do, is to see that the Laws of God touching his Worship, and touching all matters and orders of the Church, be executed and duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;

Which opinion, because we account as absurd, as they who have fathered the same upon us, we do them to wit, that this is our meaning and no otherwise: There is not within this Realm an Ecclesiastical Officer, that may by the Authority of his own place, command universally throughout the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: but they of this People, whom one may command, are to anothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement unsubject.

Isay, according to order of Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that with us the highest have thereunto so tyed themselves, that, otherwise than so, they take not upon them to command any. And, that Kings should be in such sort Supream Commanders over all men, we hold it requisite, as well for the ordering of Spiritual, as Civil Affairs; in as much as without universal Authority in this kinde, they should not be able when need is, to do as vertuous Kings have done.

must both acknowledge them to be amiss, and endeavour to have them reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But touching that point, what may be objected, shall after appear. Our Judges in Causes Ecclesiastical, are either Ordinary or Commissionary; Ordinary, those whom we term Ordinaries; and such, by the Laws of this Land, are none but Prelates onely, whose Power to do that which they do, is in themselves, and belonging to the nature of their Ecclesiastical calling. In Spiritual Causes, a Lay-Person may be no Ordinary; a Commissionary Judge, there is no lett but that he may be; and, that our Laws do evermore referr the ordinary Judgement of Spiritual Causes unto Spiritual Persons, such as are termed Ordinaries, no man which knoweth any thing of the Practice of this Realm, can easily be ignorant. Now, besides them which are Authorized to judge in several Territories, there is required an universal Power which reacheth over all, imparting Supream Authority of Government, over all Courts, all Judges, all Causes; the operation of which Power, is as well to strengthen, maintain, and uphold particular Jurisdictions, which haply might else be of small effect: as also to remedy that which they are not able to help, and to redress that wherein they at any time do otherwise than they ought to do. This Power being sometime in the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, by sinister Practises had drawn it into his hands, was, for just conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, by Publick consent annexed unto the Kings Royal Seat and Crown; from thence the Authors of Reformation would translate it into their National Assemblies or Synods, which Synods are the onely helps which they think lawful to use against such Evils in the Church, as particular Jurisdictions are not sufficient to redress.<note place="margin">Eliz cap. 1.</note> In which Cause, our Laws have provided, that the Kings supereminent Authority and Power shall serve: As namely, when the whole Ecclesiastical State, or the Principal Persons therein, do need Visitation and Reformation; when in any part of the Church, Errours, Schismes, Herusies, Abuses, Offences, Contempts, Enormities, are grown; which men, in their several Jurisdictions, either do not, or cannot help. Whatsoever any Spiritual Authority and Power (such as Legates from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> did sometimes exercise) hath done or might heretofore have done, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of those Evils in lawful sort, (that is to say, without the violation of the Laws of God, or Nature, in the deed done) as much in every degree our Laws have fully granted, that the King for ever may do, not onely be setting Ecclesiastical Synods on work, that the thing may be their Act, and the King their Motioner unto it, for so much perhaps the Masters of the Reformation will grant: but by Commissions few or many, who having the Kings Letters Patents, may, in the vertue thereof, execute the premises as Agents in the right, not of their own peculiar and ordinary, but of his supereminent Power. When men are wronged by inferiour Judges, or have any just cause to take exception against them; their way for Redress, is to make their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal; and Appeal is a present delivery of him which maketh it, out of the hands of their Power and Jurisdictions from whence it is made.

Surely, forasmuch as in that estate which they all dream of, the whole Church must be divided into Parishes, in which none can have greater or less Authority and Power than another; again, the King himself must be but a common Member in the Body of his own Parish, and the causes of that onely Parish, must be by the Officers thereof determinable: In case the King had so much favour or preferment, as to be made one of those Officers (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

                        <hi>that judgement in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pertaineth to God; Seeing likewise it is evident out of the Apostles, that the High-Priest is set over those matters in Gods behalf: It must needs follow, that the Principality or direction of the Iudgment of them, is, by Gods ordinance, appertaining to the High-Priest, and consequently to the Ministry of the Church; and if it be by Gods Ordinance appertaining unto them, how can it be translated from them to the Civil Magistrate?</hi> Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, briefly drawn into form, lyeth thus: That which belongeth unto God, may not be translated unto any other, but whom he hath appointed to have it in his behalf: But principality of Judgement in Church-matters appertaineth unto God, which hath appointed the High-Priest, and consequently the Ministry of the Church alone, to have it in his behalf, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it may not from them be translated to the Civil Magistrate. The first of which Propositions we grant, as also in the second that branch which ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth unto God Principality in Church-matters. But, that either he did appoint none, but onely the High-Priest to exercise the said Principality for him; or that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Church may in reason from thence be concluded to have alone the same Principality by his appointment, these two Points we deny utterly. For, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the High-Priest, there is, first, no such Ordinance of God to be found: <hi>Every High-Priest</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is taken from amongst men, and is ordained for men in things pertaining to God</hi>; Whereupon it may well be gathered, that the Priest was indeed Ordained of God, to have Power in things appertaining unto God: For the Apostle doth there mention the Power of offering Gifts and Sacrifices for Sin, which kinde of Power, was not onely given of God unto Priests, but restrained unto Priests onely. The power of Jurisdiction and ruling Authority, this also God gave them, but not them alone: For it is held, as all men know, that others of the Laity were herein joyned by the Law with them. But, concerning Principality in Church-affairs, (for of this our Question is, and of no other) the Priest neither had it alone, nor at all, but in Spiritual or Church-affairs, (as hath been already shewed) it was the Royal Prerogative of Kings only. Again, though it were so, that God had appointed the High-Priest to have the said Principality of Government in those maters; yet how can they who alledge this, enforce thereby, that consequently the Ministry of the Church, and no other ought to have the same, when they are so farr off from allowing so much to the Ministry of the Gospel, as the Priest-hood of the Law had by God's appointment: That we but collecting thereout a difference in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Jurisdiction amongst the Clergy, to be for the Polity of the Church not inconvenient; they forthwith think to close up our mouths by answering, <hi>That the Iewish High-Priest, had authority above the rest, onely in that they prefigured the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Iesus Christ; As for the Ministers of the Gospel, it is altogether unlawful to give them as much as the least Title, any syllable whereof may sound to Principality.</hi> And of the Regency which may be granted, they hold others even of the Laity, no less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable than the Pastors themselves. How shall these things cleave together? The truth is, that they have some reason to think it not at all of the fittest for Kings, to sit as ordinary Judges in matters of Faith and Religion. An ordinary Judge must be of the quality which in a Supream Judge is not necessary; Because the Person of the one is charged with that which the other Authority dischargeth, without imploying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally himself therein. It is an Errour to think, that the King's Authority can have no force nor power in the doing of that which himself may not personally do. For first, impossible it is, that at one and the same time, the King in Person should order so many,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:66185:286"/>
and so different affairs, as by his own power every where present, are wont to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered both in peace and warr, at home and abroad. Again, the King in regard of his nonage or minority, may be unable to perform that thing wherein years of discretion are requisite for personal action; and yet his authority even then be of force. For which cause we say, that the King's authority dyeth not, but is, and worketh always alike. Sundry considerations there may be, effectual to with-hold the King's Person from being a doer of that which notwithstanding his Power must give force unto, even in Civil affairs; where nothing doth more either concern the duty, or better beseem the Majesty of Kings, than personally to administer Justice to their People (as most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Princes have done;) yet if it be in case of Felony of Treason, the Learned in the Laws of this Realm do affirm, that well may the King commit his Authority to another,<note place="margin">

                     <p>As therefore the Person of the King may, for just considerations, even where the cause is Civil, be notwithstanding withdrawn from occupying the Seat of Judgment, and others under his Authority be fit, he unfit himself to judge; so the considerations for which it were haply no: convenient for Kings to sit and give Sentence in Spiritual Courts, where Causes Ecclesiastical are usually debated, can be no barr to that force and efficacy which their Soveraign Power hath over those very Consistories, and for which we hold, without any exception, that all Courts are the Kings. All men are not for all things sufficient, and therefore Publick affairs being divided, such Persons must be authorized Judges in each kinde, as Common reason may presume to be most fit. Which cannot of Kings and Princes ordinarily be presumed in Causes merely, Ecclesiastical; so that even Common sense doth rather adjudge this burthen unto other men. We see it hereby a thing necessary, to put a difference, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that Ordinary Jurisdiction which belongeth unto the Clergy alone, and that Commissionary wherein others are for just considerations appointed to joyn with them, as also between both these Jurisdictions; And a third, whereby the King hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Authority, and that in all Causes over both. Why this may not lawfully be granted unto him, there is no reason. A time there was when Kings were not capable of any such Power, as namely, when they professed themselves open Enemies unto Christ and Christianity. A time there followed, when they, being capable, took some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, sometimes less to themselves, as seemed best in their own eyes, because no certainty, touching their right, was as yet determined. The Bishops, who alone were before accustomed to have the ordering of such Affairs, saw very just cause of grief, when the highest, favouring Heresie, withstood, by the strength of Soveraign Authority, Religious proceedings. Whereupon they oftentimes, against this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable power, pleaded the use and custom, which had been to the contrary; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the affairs of the Church should be dealt in by the Clergy, and by no other; unto which purpose, the sentences that then were uttered in defence of unabolished Orders and Laws, against such as did, of their own heads, contrary thereunto; are now altogether impertinently brought in opposition against them, who use but that Power which Laws have given them, unless men can shew, that there is in those Laws some manifest iniquity or injustice.<note place="margin">T.

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66185:287"/>
may by these testimonies drawn from Antiquity, if wellst to consider them, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how requisite it is that Authority should always follow received Laws in the manner of proceeding. For, inasmuch as there was at the first no certain Law, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining what force the principal Civil Magistrates authority should be of, how farr it should reach, and what order it should observe; but Christian Emperors from time to time did what themselves thought most reasonable in those affairs; by this means it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe that they in their practise vary, and are not uniform. Vertuous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, such as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great was, made conscience to swerve unnecessarily from the custom which had been used in the Church, even when it lived under Infidels; <hi>Constantine,</hi> of reverence to Bishops, and their Spiritual Authority, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abstained from that which himself might lawfully do, than was willing to claim a Power, not fit or decent for him to exercise. The Order which hath been before, he ratifieth, exhorting the Bishops to look to the Church, and promising, that he would do the Office of a Bishop over the Common-wealth; which very <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> notwithstanding, did not thereby so renounce all Authority in judging of Special Causes, but that sometime he took, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth, even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal cognition of them; howbeit, whether as purposing to give therein judicially any Sentence, I stand in doubt; for if the other of whom St. <hi>Augustine</hi> elsewhere speaketh, did, in such sort, judge, surely there was cause why he should excuse it as a thing not usually done. Otherwise there is no lett, but that any such great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may hear those Causes to and fro debated, and deliver in the end his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, declaring on which side himself doth judge that the truth is. But this kinde of Sentence bindeth no side to stand thereunto; it is a Sentence of private perswasion, and not of solemn jurisdiction, albeit a King, or an Emperour pronounce it: Again, on the contrary part, when Governours infected with Heresie were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the Highest Power, they thought they might use it as pleased themselves, to further by all means that opinion which they desired should prevail, they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting at all what was meet, presumed to command and judge all men, in all Causes, without either care of orderly proceeding, or regard to such Laws and Customs as the Church had been wont to observe. So that the one sort feared to do even that which they might; and that which the other ought not, they boldly presumed upon; the one sort, of modesty, excused themselves where they scarce needed; the other, though doing that which was inexcusable, bare it out with main power, not enduring to be told by any man how farr they roved beyond their bounds. So great odds was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them whom before we mentioned, and such as the younger <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by whom St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> being commanded to yield up one of the Churches under him unto the <hi>Arrians,</hi> whereas they which were sent on his Message, alledged, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did but use his own right, forasmuch as all things were in his power: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which the holy Bishop gave them, was, <hi>That the Church is the House of God, and that those things that are Gods are not to be yielded up, and disposed of it at the Emperors will and pleasure; His Palaces he might grant to whomsoever he pleaseth, but Gods own Habitation not so.</hi> A cause why many times Emperours do more by their absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than could very well stand with reason, was the over-great importunity of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hereticks, who being Enemies to Peace and Quietness, cannot otherwise than by violent means be supported.</p>
                     <p>In this respect therefore we must needs think the state of our own Church much better settled than theirs was; because our Lawes have with farr more certainty prescribed bounds unto each kinde of Power. All decision of things doubtful, and correction of things amiss are proceeded in by order of Law, what Person soever he be unto whom the administration of Judgment belongeth. It is neither permitted unto Prelates nor Prince to judge and determine at their own discretion, but Law hath prescribed what both shall do. What Power the King hath, he hath it by Law, the bounds and limits of it are known, the intire Community giveth general order by Law, how all things publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to be done, and the King, as the Head thereof, the Highest in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all, causeth, according to the same law, every particular to be framed and ordered thereby. The whole Body Politick maketh Laws, which Laws gave Power unto the King, and the King having bound himself to use according unto
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:66185:287"/>
Law that power, it so falleth out, that the execution of the one is accomplished by the other in most religious and peaceable sort. There is no cause given unto any to make supplication, as <hi>Hilary</hi> did, that Civil Governors, to whom Common-wealth-matters only belong, may not presume to take upon them the Judgement of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical causes. If the cause be Spiritual, Secular Courts do not meddle with it; we need not excuse our selves with <hi>Ambrose,</hi> but boldly and lawfully we may refuse to answer before any Civil Judge in a matter which is not Civil, so that we do not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take either the nature of the Cause, or of the Court, as we easily may do both, without some better direction than can be by the rules of this new-found Discipline.

Finally, the one are but themselves, and their Sentence hath but the weight of their own Judgment; the other represent the whole Clergy, and their voyces are as much as if all did give perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal verdict. Now the question is, Whether the Clergy alone so assembled, ought to have the whole power of making Ecclesiastical Laws, or else consent of the Laity, may thereunto be made necessary, and the King's assent so necessary, that his sole denial may be of force to stay them from being Laws.</p>

But as a man liveth joyned with others in common society, and belongeth to the outward Politick Body of the Church, albeit the same Law of Nature and Scripture have in this respect also made manifest the things that are of greatest necessity; nevertheless, by reason of new occasions still arising, which the Church, having care of Souls, must take order for as need requireth, hereby it

cometh to pass, that there is, and ever will be, so great use even of Human Laws and Ordinances, deducted by way of discourse as a conclusion from the former Divine and Natural, serving as Principals thereunto. No man doubteth, but that for matters of Action and Practice in the Affairs of God, for manner in Divine Service, for order in Ecclesiastical proceedings about the Regiment of the Church, there may be oftentimes cause very urgent to have Laws made: but the reason is not so plain, wherefore Human laws should appoint men what to believe. Wherefore in this we must note two things: 1. That in matters of opinion, the Law doth not make that to be truth which before was not, as in matter of Action is causeth that to be a duty, which was not before; but manifesteth only and giveth men notice of that to be truth, the contrary whereunto they ought not before to have believed. 2. That opinions do cleave to the understanding, and are in heat assented unto, it is not in the power of any Human law to command them, because to prescribe what men shall think belongeth only unto God: <hi>Corde credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ore fit confessio,</hi> saith the Apostle. As opinions are either fit, or inconvenient to be professed, so man's laws hath to determine of them. It may for Publick unities sake require mens professed assent, or prohibit their contradiction to special Articles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as there haply hath been Controversie what is true, so the same were like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still, not without grievous detriment unto a number of Souls; except Law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that evil, should set down a certainty, which no man afterwards is to gain-say. Wherefore, as in regard of Divine laws, which the Church receiveth from God, we may unto every man apply those words of wisdom in <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 6.</note>

In the second place, those things that be convenient and profitable; for it is fit, that matters of the less weight should come after the greater.</note> first thing that Law hath care to provide for. When we speak of the right which naturally belongeth to a Common-wealth, we speak of that which must needs belong to the Church of God. For if the Common-wealth be Christian, if the People which are of it do publickly embrace the true Religion, this very thing doth make it the Church, as hath been shewed. So that unless the verity and purity of Religion do take from them which embrace it, that power wherewith otherwise they are possessed; look what authority, as touching laws for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Common-wealth hath simply, it must of necessity being of the Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>It will be therefore perhaps alledged, that a part of the verity of Christian Religion is to hold the power of making Ecclesiastical Laws a thing appropriated unto the Clergy in their Synods; and whatsoever is by their only voyces agreed upon, it needeth no further approbation to give unto it the strength of a Law, as may plainly appear by the Canons of that first most venerable Assembly: where, those things the Apostle and <hi>Iames</hi> had concluded,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 7,13, 23.</note> were afterwards published and imposed upon the Churches of the Gentiles abroad as Laws, the Records thereof remaining still the Book of God for a testimony, that the power of making Ecclesiastical Laws, belongeth to the Successors of the Apostles, the Bishops and Prelates of the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>To this we answer, That the Councel of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is no Argument for the power of the Clergy to make Laws; For first there hath not been sithence, any Councel of like authority to that in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: Secondly, The cause why that was of such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, came by a special accident: Thirdly, The reason why other Councels being not like unto that in nature, the Clergy in them should have no power to make Laws by themselves alone, is in truth so forcible, that, except some Commandment of God to the contrary can be shewed, it ought, notwithstanding the foresaid example, to prevail.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in as much as the Council of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did chance to consist of men so enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it had authority greater than were meet for any other Council besides to challenge, wherein such kinde of Persons are, as now the state of the Church doth stand; Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not then that which now they are, and the Clergy not now that which then they were. Till it be proved that some special Law of Christ hath for ever annexed unto the Clergy alone the power to make Ecclesiastical laws, we are to hold it a thing most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with equity and reason, that no Ecclesiastical laws be made in a Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, without consent as well of the Laity as of the Clergy, but least of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of the highest Power.</p>

If therefore the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception taken against some part of the Canons contained in that Council, were a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient barr to make them of none effect within his Territories, it followeth that the like exception against any other part, had been also of like efficacy; and so consequently that no part therof had obtained the strength of a Law, if he which excepted against a part, had so done against the whole: as, what reason was there, but that the same Authority which limited, might quite and clean have refused that Council; who so alloweth the said Act of the Catholick Kings for good and lawful, must grant that the Canons, even of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, have but the face of Wise-mens opinions, concerning that whereof they-treat, till they be publickly assented unto, where they are to take place as Laws; and that, in giving such publick assent, as maketh a Christian Kingdome subject unto those Laws, the King's authority is the chiefest. That which an University of Men, a Company, or Corporation, doth without consent of their Rector, is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Except therefore we make the King's Authority over the Clergy, less in the greatest things, than the power of the meanest Governour is in all things over the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Society, which is under him; how should we think it a matter decent, that the Clergy should impose Laws, the Supream Governours assent not asked?</p>
                     <p>Yea, that which is more, the Laws thus made, God himself doth in such sort au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, that to despise them, is to despise in them him. It is a loose and licentious opinion, which the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> have embraced, holding that a Christian man's liberty is lost, and the Soul which Christ hath redeemed unto himself injuriously drawn into servitude under the Yoke of Human power, if any Law be now imposed besides the Gospel of Christ; in obedience whereunto the Spirit of God, and not the constraint of men, is to lead us, according to that of the blessed Apostle, <hi>Such as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, and not such as live in thraldom</hi> unto men. Their Judgement is therefore, That the Church of Christ should admit of no Law-makers but the Evangelists, no Courts but Presbyteries, no Punishments but Ecclesiastical censures: As against this sort, we are to maintain the use of Human laws, and the continual necessity of making them from time to time: as long as this present World doth last; so likewise the Authority of Laws, so made, doth need much more by us to be strengthened against another sort, who, although they do utterly condemn the making of Laws in the Church, yet make they a great deal less account of them than they should do. There are which think simply of Human laws, that they can in no sort touch the Conscience. That to break and transgress them, cannot make men in the sight of God culpable, as Sin doth; onely when we violate such Laws, we do thereby make our selves obnoxious unto external punishment in this World, so that the Magistrate may, in regard of such offence committed, justly correct the Offender, and cause him, without injury, to endure such pains as Law doth appoint, but further it reacheth not: For first, the Conscience is the proper Court of God, the guiltiness thereof is Sin, and the punishment Eternal death; men are not able to make any Law that shall command the Heart, it is not in them to make Inward-conceit a Crime, or to appoint for any crime other punishment than corporal; their Laws therefore can have no power over the Soul, neither can the heart of man be polluted by transgressing them. St. <hi>Austine</hi> rightly desineth Sin to be that which is spoken, done, or desired, not against any Laws, but against the Law of the Living God. The Law of God is proposed unto Man, as a Glass wherein to behold the stains and the spots of their sinful Souls. By it they are to judge themselves, and when they feel themselves to have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed against it, then to bewail their offences with <hi>David, Against thee onely O Lord have I sinned, and done wickedly in thy sight</hi>; that so our present tears may extinguish the flames, which otherwise we are to feel, and which of God in that day shall condemn the Wicked unto, when they shall render account of the Evil which they have done, not by violating Statute-Laws, and Canons, but by disobedience unto his Law and his Word.</p>

Subjection therefore we owe, and that by the Law of God; we are in Conscience bound to yield it even unto every of them that hold the seats of Authority and Power in relation unto us. Howbeit, not all kindes of subjection, unto every such kinde of Power: concerning <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> our Saviour's Precept was, <hi>Whatsoever they shall tell ye, do it.</hi> Was it his meaning, that if they should at any time enjoyn the People to levy an Army, or to sell their Lands and Goods, for the furtherance of so great an enterprize; and, in a word, that simply whatsoever it were which they did command, they ought, without any exception, forth-with to be obeyed. No, but whatsoever they shall tell you, must be understoud <hi>in pertinentibus ad Cathedram,</hi> it must be construed with limitation, and restrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things of that kinde, which did belong to their place and power: For they had not Power general, absolutely given them to command all things. The reason why we are bound in Conscience to be subject unto all such Power, is, because all Powers are of God.</p>
                     <p>They are of God either instituting or permitting them; Power is then of Divine institution, when either God himself doth deliver, or men by light of nature finde out the kinde thereof. So that the power of Parents over Children, and of Husbands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Wives, the power of all sorts of Superiors, made by consent of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths within themselves, or grown from agreement amongst Nations, such power is of God's own Institution in respect of the kinde thereof; Again, if respect be had unto those particular Persons, to whom the same is derived, if they either receive it immediately from God, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did; or from nature, as Parents do; or from men, by a natural and orderly course, as every Governor appointed in any Common wealth, by the order thereof, doth; then is not the kinde of their Power, only of God's institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but the derivation thereof also, into their Persons, is from him. He hath placed them in their rooms, and doth term them his Ministers; Subjection therefore is due unto all such Powers, inasmuch as they are of God's own institution, even then when they are of man's creation, <hi>Omni Humanae Creaturae</hi>: Which things the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do acknowledge.<note place="margin">Hom. 11. 1. 2.

                     <p>As for them that exercise Power altogether against Order, although the kinde of Power which they have may be of God, yet is their exercise thereof against God, and therefore not of God, otherwise than by <hi>Permission,</hi> as all Injustice is.</p>
                     <p>Touching such Acts as are done by that power which is according to his institution, that God in like sort doth authorize them, and account them to be his; though it were not confessed, it might be proved undeniably. For if that be acounted our deed, which others do, whom we have appointed to be our Agents, how should God but approve those deeds, even as his own, which are done by vertue of that Commission and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which he hath given: <hi>Take heed</hi> (saith <hi>Iehosophat</hi> unto his Judges) <hi>be careful and circumspect what ye do ye do not execute the judgments of Man, but of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6.

Usurpers of Power, whereby we do not mean them that by violence have aspired unto places of Highest Authority, but them that use more Authority than they did ever receive in form and manner before-mentioned; (for so they may do, whose Title to the rooms of Authority, which they possess, no man can deny to be just and lawful; even as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise some mens proceedings in Government have been very orderly, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding did not attain to be made Governors, without great violence and disorder) such Usurpers thereof, as in the exercise of their Power do more than they have been authorized to do, cannot in Conscience binde any man unto Obedience.</p>

He that resisteth them, resisteth God: And resisted they be, if either the Authority it self which they exercise be denied, as by Anabaptists all Secular Jurisdiction is; or if resistance be made but only so farr forth, as doth touch their Persons which are invested with Power; (for they which said, <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus hunc regnare,</hi> did not utterly exclude Regiment; nor did they wish all kinde of Government clearly removed; which would not at the first have <hi>David</hi> to govern) or if that which they do by vertue of their Power, namely, their Laws, Edicts, Services, or other Acts of Jurisdiction, be not suffered to take effect, contrary to the blessed Apostles most holy rule, <hi>Obey them which have the oversight of you,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. or if they do take effect, yet is not the will of God thereby satisfied neither, as long as that which we do is contemptuously, or repiningly done, because we can do no otherwise.

Thus, and more than thus, do the Works commend themselves; The Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man needs a better Work-man to commend him</hi>; (Alexander's <hi>Picture requires</hi> Apelles <hi>his Pencil</hi>) <hi>nay, he needs it not,</hi> His own Works commend him in the Gates; <hi>and,</hi> being dead, he yet speaketh; <hi>the Syllables of that memorable name Mr.</hi> Richard Hooker, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming more, than if I should here stile him, a painful Student, a profound Scholar, a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Writer, with other due Titles of his Honor.

                  <p>THE manifold benefits which all the Subjects within this Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do at this present, and have many years enjoyed, under Her Majesties most happy and prosperous reign, by your godly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and careful watching over this Estate night and day; I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unfeignedly acknowledge from the bottom of my heart, ought worthily to binde us all, to pray continually to Almighty God for the continuance and increase of the life and good estate of your Honours, and to be ready, with all good duties, to satisfie and serve the same to our Power. Besides publick benefits common unto all, I must needs, and do willingly confess my self to stand bound by most special Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to serve and honour you more than any other, for the honourable favour it hath pleased you to vouchsafe both oftentimes heretofore, and also now of late, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more dear unto me than any earthly commodity, that is, the upholding and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of my service in the ministring of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For which cause, as I have been always careful so to carry my self as I might by no means give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to be thought unworthy of so great a Benefit, so do I still, next unto her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties gracious countenance, hold nothing more dear and precious to me, than that I may always remain in your Honours favour, which hath oftentimes be an helpful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto me in my Ministry, aud to all such as reaped any fruit of my simple and faithful labour. In which dutiful regard I humbly beseech you? Honours to vouchsafe to do me this grace, to conceive nothing of me otherwise, than according to the duty wherein I ought to live, by any information against me, before your Honours have heard my answer, and been throughly informed of the matter. Which, although it be a thing, that your wisdoms, not in favour, but in justice, yeld to all men, yet the state of the the calling into the Ministery, whereunto it hath pleased God of his goodness to call me, though unworthiest of all, is so subject to mis-information, as, except we may finde this favour with your Honours, we cannot look for any other, but that our unindifferent
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:66185:292"/>
parties may easily procure us to be hardly esteemed of; and that we shall be made like the poor Fisher-boats in the Sea, which every swelling wave and billow raketh and runneth over. Wherein my Estate is yet harder than any others of my Rank and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who are indeed to fight against Flesh and Blood in what part soever of the Lords Host and Field they shall stand mashalled to serve, yet many of them deal with it naked, and unfurnished of Weapons: But my service was in a place where I was to encounter with it well appointed and armed with skill and with authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as I have always thus deserved, and therefore have been careful by all good means to entertain still your Honours favourable respect of me, so have I special cause at this present, wherein mis-information to the Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the High Commission hath been able so farr to prevail against me, that by their Letter they have inhibited me to preach, or execute any Act of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in the Temple or elsewhere, having never once called me before them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by mine answer the truth of such things as had been informed against me. We have a story in our Books wherein the Pharisees proceeding against our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ, without having heard him, is reproved by an honourable Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour (as the Evangelist doth term him) saying, <hi>Doth our Law judge a man before it hear him, and know what he hath done?</hi> Which I do not mention, to the end, that by an indirect and covert speech I might so compare those, who have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever hearing me, pronounced a heavy sentence against me, for notwithstanding such proceedings, I purpose by Gods grace to carry my self towards them in all seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, agreeable to their places: much less do I presume to liken my Cause to our Saviour Christ's, who hold it my chiefest honour and happiness to serve him, though it be but among the hindes and hired Servants, that serve him in the basest corners of his House: But my purpose, in mentioning it, is, to shew by the judgement of a Prince and great man in <hi>Israel,</hi> that such proceeding standeth not with the Lavv of God, and in a Princely Pattern to shew it to be a noble part of an honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, not to allow of indirect dealings, but to allow and affect such a course in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as is agreeable to the Lavv of God. We have also a plain rule in the Word of God, not to proceed any otherwise against any Elder of the Church; much less against one that laboureth in the Word, and in teaching: Which rule is delivered with this most earnest charge and obtestation, <hi>I beseech and charge thee in the sight of God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, and the Elect Angels, that thou keep those [rules] without preferring one before another, doing nothing of partiality or including to either part</hi>; which Apostolical and most earnest charge, I referr to your Honours wisdom how it hath been regarded in so heavy a Judgement against me, without ever hearing my Cause; and whethe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as having God before their eyes, and the Lord Jesus, by whom all former Judgements shall be tried again, and, as in the presence of the Elect Angels, Witnesses and Observers of the Regiment of the Church, they have proceeded thus to such a sentence. They alledge indeed two reasons in their Letters, whereupon they restrain my Ministry, which, if they were as strong against me as they are supposed, yet I referr to your Honours wisdoms, whether the quality of such an Offence as they charge me with, which is in effect but an indiscretion, deserve so grievous a punishment both to the Church and me, in taking away my Ministery, and that poor little commodity which it yieldeth for the necessary maintenance of my life; if so unequal a ballancing of faults and punishments should have place in the Common-wealth, surely we should shortly have no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Case, nor of Trespass, but all should be Pleas of the Crown, nor any man amerced, or fined, but for every light offence put to his ransom. I have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly heard, that some of the Ministery have been committed for grievous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of the Laws of God and men, being of no ability to do other service in the Church than to read, yet hath it been thought charitable, and standing with Christian moderation and temperancy, not to deprive such of Ministry and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but to inflict some more tolerable punishment. Which I write not because such, as I think, were to be favoured, but to shew how unlike their dealing is with me, being through the goodness of God not to be touched with any such blame, and one, who, according to the measure of the gift of God, have laboured now some years painfully, in regard of the weak estate of my Body, in preaching the Gospel,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:66185:292"/>
and, as I hope, not altogether unprofitably in respect of the Church. But I beseech your Honors to give me leave briefly to declare the particular reasons of their Letter, and what Answer I have to make unto it.</p>
                  <p>The first is, That, as they say, <hi>I am not lawfully called to the Function of the Ministry, nor allowed to preach according to the Laws of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>For Answer to this, I had need to divide the Points: and first to make answer to the former, wherein leaving to shew what by the Holy Scriptures is required in a lawful Calling, and that all this is to be found in mine, that I be not too long for your weighty affairs, I rest.</p>
                  <p>I thus answer: My calling to the Ministry was such as in the calling of any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is appointed to be used by the Orders agreed upon in the National Synods of the Low-Countreys, for the direction and guidance of their Churches, which Orders are the same with those whereby the French and Scotish Churches are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, whereof I have shewed such sufficient testimonial to my Lord the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as is requisite in such a Matter: whereby it must needs fall out, if any man be lawfully called to the Ministry in those Churches, then is my Calling, being the same with theirs, also lawful. But I suppose, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they use this general speech, they mean only, my Calling is not sufficient, to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the Ministry within this Land, because I was not made Minister according to that Order which in this Case is ordained by our Laws. Whereunto I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Honours to consider throughly of mine Answer, because exception now again is taken to my Ministery, whereas having been heretofore called in question for it, I so answered the matter, as I continued in my Ministery, and, for any thing I discerned, looked to hear that no more objected unto me. The communion of Saints (which every Christian man professeth to believe) is such, as that the Acts which are done in any true Church of Christs according to his Word, are held as lawful, being done in one Church as in another. Which, as it holdeth in other Acts of Ministery, as Baptism, Mariage, and such like, so doth it in the calling to the Ministery; by reason whereof, all Churches do acknowledge and receive him for a Minister of the Word, who hath been lawfully called thereunto in any Church of the same Profession. A Doctor created in any University of Christendom, is acknowledged sufficiently qualified to teach in any Country. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and the Canon law holdeth it, that being ordered in <hi>Spain,</hi> they may execute that belongeth to their Order in <hi>Italy,</hi> or in any other place. And the Churches of the Gospel never made any question of it; which if they shall now begin to make doubt of, and deny such to be lawfully called to the Ministry, as are called by another Order than our own; then may it well be looked for, that other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will do the like: And if a Minister called in the Low-countries be not lawfully called in <hi>England,</hi> then may they say to our Preachers which are there, that being made of another Order than theirs, they cannot suffer them to execute any Act of Ministry amongst them; which in the end must needs breed a Schism, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous divisions in the Churches. Further, I have heard of those that are learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Laws of this Land, that by express Statute to that purpose, <hi>Anno</hi> 13. upon subscription to the Articles agreed upon, <hi>Anno</hi> 62. that they who pretend to have been ordered by another Order than that which is now established, are of like capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to enjoy any place of Ministry within the Land, as they which have been order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to that which is now by law in this case established. Which comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifestly all, even such as were made Priests, according to the Order of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it must needs be, that the Law of a Christian Land, professing the Gospel, should be as favourable for a Minister of the Word, as for a Popish Priest; which also was so found in Mr. <hi>Whittingham</hi>'s Case, who, notwithstanding such Replies against him, enjoyed still the benefit he had by his Ministry, and might have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day, if God had spared him life so long, which, if it be understood so, and practised in others, why should the change of the Person alter the right, which the Law giveth to all other?</p>
                  <p>The place of Ministry whereunto I was called, was not Presentative: and if it had been so, surely they would never have presented any man whom they never knew, and the order of this Church is agreeable herein to the Word of God, and the antient and
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:66185:293"/>
best Canons, that no man should be made a Minister <hi>sine titulo</hi>: therefore having none, I could not by the Orders of this Church have entred into the Ministry, before I had a Charge to tend upon. When I was at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and to take a Place of Ministry among the People of that Nation, I see no cause why I should have returned again over the Seas for Orders here; nor how I could have done it, without disallowing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Churches provided in the Country where I was to live. Whereby I hope it appeareth, that my Calling to the Ministry is lawful, and maketh me, by our Law, of capacity to enjoy any benefit or commodity, that any other by reason of his Ministry may enjoy. But my Cause is yet more easie, who reaped no benefit of my Ministery by Law, receiving onely a benevolence and voluntary Contribution; and the Ministery I dealt with, being Preaching onely, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Deacon here may do being licensed, and certain that are neither Ministers not Deacons. Thus I answer, the former of these two Points, whereof, if there be yet any doubt, I humbly desire for a final end thereof, that some competent Judges in Law may determine of it; whereunto I referr and submit my self with all reverence and duty.</p>
                  <p>The second is, <hi>That I preached without License.</hi> Whereunto, this is my Answer: I have not presumed, upon the Calling I had to the Ministery abroad, to Preach or deal with any part of the Ministery within this Church, without the consent and allowance of such as were to allow me unto it: my Allowance was from the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> testified by his two several Letters to the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> who without such testimony would by no means rest satified in it; which Letters being by me produced, I referr it to your Honours wisdom, whether I have taken upon me to Preach, without being allowed (as they charge) according to the Orders of the Realm. Thus having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the second point also, I have done with the Objection, <hi>of dealing without Calling or License.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Reason they alledge, is, concerning a late Action, wherein I had to deal with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Master of the <hi>Temple.</hi> In the handling of which Cause, they charge me with an Indiscretion, and want of Duty, <hi>In that I inveighed</hi> (as they say) <hi>against certain Points of Doctrine taught by him as erroneous, not conferring with him, nor complaining of it to them.</hi> My Answer hereunto standeth, in declaring to your Honours the whole course and carriage of that Cause, and the degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in it, which I will do as briefly as I can, and according to the truth. God be my witness, as near as my best memory, and notes of remembrance may serve me thereunto. After that I have taken away that which seemed to have moved them to think me not charitably minded to Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>; which is, Because he was brought in to Mr. <hi>Alveyes</hi> Place, wherein this Church desired that I might have succeeded: which Place, if I would have made suit to have obtained, or if I had ambitiously affected and sought, I would not have refused to have satisfied, by subscription, such as the matter them seemed to depend upon: whereas contrariwise, notwithstanding I would not hinder the Church to do that they thought to be most for their edification and comfort, yet did I, neither by Speech nor Letter, make suit to any for the obtaining of it; following herein that resolution, which I judge to be most agreeable to the Word and Will of God; that is, that labouring and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Places and Charges in the Church is not lawful. Further, whereas at the suit of the Church, some of your Honours entertained the Cause, and brought it to a near issue, that there seemed nothing to remain, but the commendation of my Lord the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when as he could not be satisfied, but by my subscribing to his late Articles; and that my Answer agreeing to subscribe according to any Law, and to the Statute provided in that Case, but praying to be respited for subscribing to any other, which I could not in Conscience do, either for the <hi>Temple</hi> (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he said, he would not commend me to) nor for any other Place in the Church, did so little please my Lord Archbishop, as he resolved, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I should not be commended to it. I had utterly here no cause of offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> whom I did in no sort esteem to have prevented or undermined me, but that God disposed of me as it pleased him, by such means and occasions as I have declared.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as I have taken no cause of offence at Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> for being preferred, so
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:66185:293"/>
there were many Witnesses, that I was glad that the place was given him, hoping to live in all godly peace and comfort with him, both for acquaintance and good-will which hath been between us, and for some kinde of affinity in the marriage of his nearest kindred and mine: Since his comming, I have so carefully endeavoured to entertain all good correspondence and agreement with him, as I think he himself will bear me witness of many earnest Disputations and Conferences with him about the matter; the rather, because that, contrary to my expectation, he inclined from the beginning but smally thereunto, but joyned rather with such as had always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselves to any good order in this Charge, and made themselves to be brought indisposed to his present state and proceedings: For, both knowing that God's Commandement charged me with such Duty, and discerning how much on: peace might further the good service of God and his Church, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comfort of us both, I had resolved constantly to seek for Peace; and though it should flye from me (as I saw it did by means of some, who little desired to see the good of our Church) yet, according to the rule of God's Word, to follow after it: Which being so (as hereof I take God to witnesse, who searcheth the heart and reins, and who by his Son will judge the World, both quick and dead) I hope no charitable Judgement can suppose me to have stood evil-affected towards him for his Place, or desirous to fall into any Controversie with him.</p>
                  <p>Which my resolution I pursued, that, whereas I discovered sundry unsound mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his Doctrine (as many of his Sermons tasted of some sour leaven or other) yet thus I carried my self towards him: Matters of smaller weight, and so covertly discovered, that no great offence to the Church was to be feared in them, I wholly passed by, as one that discerned nothing of them, or had been unfurnished of replies; for others of great moment, and so openly delivered, as there was just cause of fear, left the Truth and Church of God should be prejudiced and perilled by it, and such as the Conscience of my Duty and Calling would not suffer me altogether to pass over, this was my course, to deliver, when I should have just cause by my Text, the truth of such Doctrine as he lead otherwise taught, in general speeches, without touch of his Person in any sort; and further at convenient opportunity to conferr with him in such points.</p>
                  <p>According to which determination, whereas he had taught certain things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Predestination, otherwise than the Word of God doth, as it is understood by all Churches professing the Gospel, and not unlike that wherewith <hi>Coranus</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times troubled his Church, I both delivered the truth of such points in a general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, without any touch of him in particular, and conferred with him also pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately upon such Articles. In which Conference, I remember, when I urged the consent of all Churches and good Writers against him that I knew; and desired, if it were otherwise, What Authors he had seen of such Doctrine? He answered me, That his best Author was his own Reason; which I wished him to take heed of, as a matter standing with Christian modesty and wisdom, in a Doctrine not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Church, not to trust to his own Judgment so farr, as to publish it before he had conferred with others of his Profession, labouring by daily Prayer and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to know the will of God, as he did, to see how they understood such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Notwithstanding, he, with wavering, replyed, That he would some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time deal more largely in the matter; I wished him, and prayed him not so to do, for the peace of the Church, which, by such means, might be hazarded; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not but think, that men, who make any Couscience of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, will judge it a necessarie dutie in them, to teach the truth, and to convince the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>Another time, upon like occasion of this Doctrine of his, <hi>That the assurance of that we believe by the Word, is not so certain, as of that we perceive by sense</hi>; I both taught the Doctrine otherwise, namely, the assurance of Faith to be greater, which assured both of things above, and contrarie to all sense and human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and dealt with him also privately upon that point: According to which course of late, when as he had taught, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true Church of Christ, and a sanctified Church by profession of that Truth, which God both revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:66185:294"/>
unto us by his Son, though not a part and perfect Church</hi>; and further, <hi>That be doubted not, but that thousands of the Fathers, which lived and dyed in the Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Church, were saved, because of their ignorance, which excuseth them</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> mis-alledging to that end a Text of Scripture to prove it: The matter being ofset pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose openly and at large handled by him, and of that moment, that might prejudice the Faith of Christ, encourage the ill-affected to continue still in their damnable ways, and others weak in Faith to suffer themselves easily to be seduced, to the destruction of their Souls, I thought it my most bounden duty of God, and to his Church, whilst I might have opportunitie to speak with him, to teach the Truth in a general speech in such points of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>At which time I taught, <hi>That such as dye, or have died at any time in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>holding in their ignorance that Faith, which is taught in it, and namely, Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in part by Works, could not be said by the Scriptures to be saved.</hi> In which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, foreseeing that if I waded not warily in it, I should be in danger to be reported, (as hath fallen out since notwithstanding) to condemn all the Fathers, I said directly and plainly to all mens understanding, <hi>That it was not indeed to be doubted, but many of the Fathers were saved; but the means</hi> (I said) <hi>was not their ignorance, which excuseth no man with God, but their knowledge and Faith of the Truth, which it appeareth God vouchsafed them, by many notable Monuments and Records extant in all Ages.</hi> Which being the last point in all my Sermon, rising so naturally from the Text I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as would have occasioned me to have delivered such matter, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former Doctrine had been sound; and being dealt in by a general speech, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touch of his particular; I looked not that a matter of Controversie would have been made of it, no more than had been of my like dealing in former time. But, far otherwise than I looked for, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> shewing no grief of Offence taken at my speech all the week long, the next Sabbath, leaving to proceed upon his ordinarie Text, professed to preach again, that he had done the day before, for some question that his Doctrine was drawn into, which he desired might be examined with all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie.</p>
                  <p>So proceeding, he bestowed his whole time in that discourse, concerning his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrine, and answering the places of Scripture, which I had alledged, to prove that a man dying in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not to be judged by the Scriptures to be saved. In which long speech, and utterly impertinent to his Text, under colour of answering for himself, he impugned directly and openly to all mens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the true Doctrine which I had delivered; and, adding to his former Points some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like (as willingly one Error followeth another) that is, <hi>That the Galatians joyning with Faith in Christ, Circumcision, as necessary to Salvation, might not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And that they of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>may be saved by such a Faith of Christ as they had, with a general Repentance of all their Errors, notwithstanding their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iustification in part by their works and merits</hi>: I was necessarily, though not willingly, drawn to say something to the Points he objected against sound Doctrine, which I did in a short speech in the end of my Sermon, with protestation of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no: of any sinister affection to any man, but to bear witness to the Truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Calling; and wished, if the matter should needs further be dealt in, some other more convenient way might be taken for it; wherein, I hope, my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was manifest to the Consciences of all indifferent Hearers of me that day, to have been according to Peace, and without any uncharitableness, being duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
                  <p>For that I conferred with him the first day, I have shewed that the Cause requiring of me the Duty, at the least not to be altogether silent in it, being a matter of such consequence, that the time also being short, wherein I was to preach after him, the hope of the fruit of our communication being small, upon experience of forme. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, my expectation being, that the Church should be no further troubled with it, upon the motion I made of taking some other course of dealing. I suppose my deferring to speak with him till some fit opportunitie, cannot in Charity be judged uncharitable.</p>
                  <p>The second day, his unlooked for opposition with the former Reasons, made it to be a matter that required of necessity some Publick answer; which being so tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:66185:294"/>
as I have shewed, if notwithstanding it be sensured as uncharitable, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so grievously as it is, What should have been my punishment, if (without all such cautions and respects as qualified my speech) I had before all, and in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of all, so reproved him offending openly, that others might have fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to doe the like? which yet, if I had done, might have been warranted by the rule and charge of the Apostle, <hi>Them that offend openly, rebuke openly, that the rest may also fear</hi>; and by his example, who, when <hi>Peter</hi> in this very Case which is now between us, had (not in Preaching) but in a matter of Conversation, not gone with a right foot, as was fit for the truth of the Gospel, conferred not privately with him, but, as his own rule required, reproved him openly before all, that others might hear, and fear, and not dare to do the like. All which reasons together weighed, I hope, will shew the manner of my dealing to have been charitable, and warrantable in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sort.</p>
                  <p>The next Sabbath day after this, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> kept the way he had entred into before, and bestowed his whole hour and more onely upon the Questions he had moved and maintained; wherein he so set forth the agreement of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with us, and their disagreement from us, as if we had consented in the greatest and weightiest Points, and differed onely in certain smaller matters: Which Agreement noted by him in two chief points, is not such as he would have made men believe. The one, in that he said, <hi>They acknowledge all men sinners, even the blessed Virgin,</hi> though some of them freed her from sinne, for the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> holdeth, that she was free from sinne. Another, in that he said, <hi>They teach Christ's Righteousness to be the onely meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause of taking away sinne, and differ from us onely in the applying of it</hi>: For <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> their chief Schoolman, and Archbishop <hi>Catherinus</hi> teach, <hi>That Christ took away onely Original sinne, and that the rest are to be taken away by our selves</hi>; yea, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> teacheth, <hi>That Righteousness whereby we are righteous in God's sight, is an inherent Righteousness</hi>: which must needs be of our own Works, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of the Righteousness inherent onely in Christ's Person, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unto us. Moreover he taught the same time, <hi>That neither the</hi> Galatians, <hi>nor the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>did directly overthrow the foundation of Iustification by Christ alone, but onely by consequent, and therefore might well be saved; or else neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the</hi> Lutherans, <hi>nor any which bold any manner of Errour could be saved; because</hi> (saith he) <hi>every Errour by consequent overthroweth the Foundation.</hi> In which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and such like, he bestowed his whole time and more; which, if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected either the truth of God, or the peace or the Church, he would truly not have done.</p>
                  <p>Whose example could not draw me to leave the Scripture I took in hand, but standing about an hour to deliver the Doctrine of it, in the end, upon just occasion of the Text, leaving sundry other his unsound speeches, and keeping me still to the Principal, I confirmed the believing the Doctrine of Justification by Christ onely, to be necessary to the Justification of all that should be saved, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> directly denieth, that a man is saved by Christ, or by Faith alone, without the works of the Law. Which my Answer, as it was most necessary for the service of God, and the Church, so was it without any immodest or reproachful speech to Mr. <hi>Hooker:</hi> whose unsound and wilful dealings in a Cause of so great importance to the Faith of Christ, and salvation of the Church, notwithstanding I knew well what speech it deserved, and what some zealous earnest man of the spirit of <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi>

                     </gap>irna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Boanerges,</hi> Sons of Thunder, would have said in such a case;<note place="margin">Mark 3. 17.</note> yet I chose rather to content my self in exhorting him to revisit his Doctrine,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.2, 3, 4, 5.</note> as <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet did the device, which, without consulting with God, he had of himself given to <hi>David,</hi> concerning the building of the Temple; and with <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.11.14.</note> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be withstood in such a Case, not unlike unto this. This is effect, was that which passed between us concerning this matter, and the invectives I made against him, wherewith I am charged: Which rehearsal, I hope, may clear me (with all that shall indifferently consider it) of the blames laid upon me for want of Duty to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in not conferring with him, whereof I have spoken sufficiently already; and to the High-Commission, in not revealing the matter to them, which yet now I am further to answer. My Answer is, That I protest, no contempt not wilful neglect of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:66185:295"/>
any lawful Authority, stayed me from complaining unto them, but these Reasons following:</p>
                  <p>First, I was in some hope, that Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> notwithstanding he had been oven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried with a shew of Charity to prejudice the Truth, yet when it should be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved, would have acknowledged it, or at the lest induced with Peace, that it might be offered without either offence to him, or to such as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; either of which would have taken away any cause of just Complaint. When neither of these fell out according to my expectation and desire, but that he replied to the Truth, and objected against it, I thought he might have some doubts and scruples in himself, which yet, if they were cleared, he would either embrace sound Doctrine, or at lest suffer it to have its course: Which hope of him I nourished so long, as the matter was not bitterly and immodestly handled between us.</p>
                  <p>Another Reason was the Cause it self, which, according to the Parable of the Tares (which are said to be sown among the Wheat) sprung up first in his Grass: Therefore, as the Servants in that Place, are not said to have come to complain to the lord, till the Tares came to shew their fruits in their kinde: so, I thinking it yet but a time of discovering of it what it was, desired not their fickle to cutt it down.</p>
                  <p>For further answer, It is to be considered, that the conscience of my Duty to God, and to his Church, did binde me at the first, to deliver sound Doctrine in such Points, as had been otherwise uttered in the Place, where I had now some years taught the Truth;<note place="margin">Ezek. 22.33. Ez. 33.6.</note> Otherwise the rebuke of the Prophet had fallen upon me, for not going up to the breach, and standing in it, and the peril for answering the blood of the City, in whose Watch-Tower I sate; if it had been surprized by my default. Moreover, my publick Protestation, in being unwilling, that if any were not yet satisfied, some other more convenient way might be taken for it. And lastly, that I had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (which I uttered before to some, dealing with me about the matter) to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested the next Sabbath day, that I would no more answer in that Place, any Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Doctrine taught by any means, but some other way satisfie such as should require it.</p>
                  <p>These, I trust, may make it appear, that I failed not in Duty to Authoritie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I did not complain, nor give over so soon dealing in the Case: If I did, how is he clear, which can alledge none of all these for himself; who leaving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the Scriptures, and his ordinarie Calling, voluntarily discoursed upon School-Points and Questions, neither of edification, nor of Truth; who, after all this, as promising to himself, and to untruth, a Victory by my silence, added yet in the next Sabbath day, to the maintenance of his former Opinions, these which follow?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That no additament taketh away the Foundation, except it be a Privative; of which sort, neither the Works added to Christ by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor Circumcision by the</hi> Galatians <hi>were: as one denieth him not to be a man, that saith, he is a Righteous man, but he that saith he is a dead man:</hi> Whereby it might seem, that a man might, without hurt, adde Works to Christ, and pray also that God and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would save them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the</hi> Galatians <hi>Case is harder than the Case of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>because the</hi> Galatians <hi>joyned Circumcision with Christ, which God had forbidden and abolished; but that which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>joyned with Christ, were good Works which God hath commanded.</hi> Wherein he committed a double fault, one, in expounding all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and consequently of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Epistles, of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision onely, and the Ceremonies of the Law (as they doe, who answer for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Writings) contrary to the clear meaning of the Apostle, as may appear by many strong and sufficient reasons: The other, in that he said, <hi>the addition of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was of Works commanded of God.</hi> Whereas the least part of the Works whereby they looked to merit, was of such works; and most were works of Supererogation, and works which God never commanded, but was highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with, as of Masses, Pilgrimages, Pardons, pains of Purgatory, and such like: <hi>That no one sequel urged by the Apostle against the</hi> Galatians <hi>for joyning Circumcision with
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:66185:295"/>
Christ, but might be us well enforced against the</hi> Lutherans; <hi>that is, that for their ubiquity it may be as well said to them, If ye hold the Body of Christ to be in all places, you are fallen from grace, you are under the curse of the Law, saying,</hi> Cursed be he that fulfilleth not all things written in this Book; with such like. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yet further, <hi>That to a Bishop of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>to a Cardinal, yea to the Pope himself, acknowledging Christ to be the Saviour of the World, denying other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and being discomforted for want of Works whereby he might be justified, he would not doubt, but use this speech; Thou holdest the foundation of Christian Faith, though it be but by a slender thred; thou holdest Christ, though but by the hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; why shouldst thou not hope that vertue may pass from Christ to save thee? That which thou holdest of Iustification by thy Works, overthroweth indeed by consequent the foundation of Christian Faith; but be of good chear, thou hast not to do with a captionus Sophister, but with a merciful God, who will justifie thee for that thou holdest, and not take the advantage of doubtful construction to condemn thee. And if this, said he, be an Errour, I hold it willingly; for it is the greatest comfort I have in this World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I would not wish either to speak or to live.</hi> Thus farr; beng not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in it any more, he was bold to proceed, the absurdity of which Speech I need not to stand upon. I think the like to this, and other such in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the rest of this matter, hath not been heard in Publick places within this Land, since Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days. What consequence this Doctrine may be of, if he be not by Authority ordered to revoke it, I beseech your H H. as the truth of God and his Gospel is dear and precious unto you, according to your godly wisdome to consider.</p>
                  <p>I have been bold to offer to your H H. a long and tedious Discourse of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but Speech being like to Tapestry, which if it be folded up, sheweth but part of that which is wrought; and being unlapt and laid open, sheweth plainly to the eye all the work that is in it, I thought it necessary to unfold this Tapestry, and to hang up the whole Chamber of it in your most Honourable Senate, that so you may the more easily discern of all the Pieces, and the sundry Works and Matters contained in it. Wherein my hope is, your H H. may see I have not deserved so great a Punishment, as is laid upon the Church for my sake, and also upon my self, in taking from me the excercise of my Ministerie: Which Punishment, how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy it may seem to the Church, or fall out indeed to be, I referr it to them to judge, and spare to write what I fear; but to my self it is exceeding grievous, for that it taketh from me the excercise of my Calling. Which I do not say is dear unto me, as the means of that little benefit whereby I live (although this be a lawful conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to be regarded of me in due place, and of the Authority under whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection I most willingly live, even by God's Commandment both unto them, and unto me:) but which ought to be more precious unto me than my life, for the love which I should bear to the glory and honour of Almighty God, and to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and salvation of his Church, for that my life cannot any other way be of like service to God, nor of such use and profit to men by any means: For which Cause, as I discern how dear my Ministery ought to be unto me, so it is my hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and most humble request unto God, to your H H. and to all the Authority I live under, to whom any dealing herein belongeth, that I may spend my life according to his Example, who in a word of like sound, of fuller sense, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by it the bestowing of his life to the Offering poured out upon the Sacrifice of the Faith of God's people, and especially of this Church, whereupon I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poured out a great part thereof in the same Calling, from which I stand now restrained. And, if your H H. shall finde it so, that I have not deserved so great a Punishment, but rather performed the Duty, which a good and faithful Servant ought, in such case, to do to his Lord, and the People he putteth them in trust withal carefully to keep: I am a most humble Suiter by these presents to your H H. that, by your godly wisdom, some good course may be taken for the restoring of me to my Ministery and Place again. Which so great a favour, shall binde me yet in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligation of Duty (which is already so great, as it seemed nothing could be added unto it to make it greater) to honour God daily for the continuance and encrease of your good estate, and to be ready with all the poor means God hath given me, to do
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:66185:296"/>
your H H. that faithful Service I may possibly perform: But if, notwithstanding my Cause he never so good, your H H. can by no means pacifie such as are offended, nor restore me again, then am I to rest in the good pleasure of God, and to commend to your H H. protection, under Her Majesties, my private life, while it shall be led in duty; and the Church to him, who hath redeemed to himself a People with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, and is making ready to come to judge both the Quick and the Dead, to give to every one according as he hath done in this life, be it good or evil, to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Unbelievers. Justice unto death; but to the Faithful, and such as love his truth, Mercy and Grace to life everlasting.</p>

                  <head>Mr. <hi>HOOKER'S</hi> ANSVVER TO THE SUPPLICATION THAT Mr. <hi>TRAVERS</hi> Made to the COUNCIL. To my Lord of Canterburie his Grace.</head>
                  <p>MY Duty in my most humble wise remembred: May it please your Grace to understand, That whereas there hath been a late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie raised in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and pursued by Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conceit taken at some words by me uttered, with a most simple and harmless meaning: In the heat of which pursuit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three publick Invectives, silence being enjoyned him by Authority, he hath hereupon, for defence of his proceedings, both presented the Right Honourable Lords, and others of Her Majesties Privy Councel with a Writing; and also caused or suffered the same to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out, and spread through the hands of so many, that well nigh all sorts of men have it in their bosomes: The matters wherewith I am therein charged, being of such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as they are, and my self being better known to your Grace, than to any other of their Honors besides, I have chosen to offer to your Grace's hands a plain Declaration of my Innocence in all those things wherewith I am so hardly, and so heavily charged, lest, if I
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:66185:297"/>
still remain silent, that which I do for quietness sake, be taken as an Argument, that I lack what to speak truly and justly in mine own defence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. First, because M. <hi>Travers</hi> thinketh it an expedient to breed an Opinion in mens mindes, that the root of all inconvenient events which are now sprung out, is, the surly and unpeaceable disposition of the man with whom he hath to do; therefore the first in the rank of Accusations laid against me, is, <hi>my intorformity, which have so little inclined to so many, and so earnest Exhortations and Conferences, as my self,</hi> he saith, <hi>can witness, to have been spent upon me, for my better fashioning unto good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence and agreement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Indeed, when at the first, by means of special Well-willers, without any suit of mine, as they very well know (although I do not think it had been a mortal sinne, in a reasonable sort, to have shewed a moderate desire that way) yet when by their endeavour, without instigation of mine, some Reverend and Honourable, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably affecting me, had procured her Majesties's grant of the Place; At the very point of my eptring thereinto, the Evening before I was first to Preach, he came, and two other Gentlemen joyned with him: The effect of his Conference then was, <hi>That he thought it his Duty to advise me, not to enter with a strong hand, but to change my purpose of Preaching there the next day, and to stay till he had given notice of me to the Congregation, that so their allowance might seal my Calling.</hi> The effect of my Answer was, <hi>That, as in a place where such Order is, I would not break; so here, where in never was, I might not, of my own head, take upon me to begin it</hi>: But liking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well the motion of the Opinion which I had of his good meaning who made it, requested him not to mislike my Answer, though it were not correspondent to his minde.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When this had so displeased some, that whatsoever was afterwards done or spoken by me, it offended their taste, angry informations were daily sent out, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence given farr and wide, what à dangerous Enemy was crept in; the worst that Jealousie could imagine, was spoken and written to so many, that at the length some knowing me well, and perceiving how injurious the Reports were, which grew daily more and more unto my discredit, wrought means to bring Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> and me to a second Conference. Wherein, when a common Friend unto us both, had quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him to utter those things wherewith he found himself any way grieved: He first renewed the memory of my entring into this Charge, by vertue only of an Humane Creature (for so the want of that formality of Popular Allowance was then censured) and unto this was annexed a Catalogue, partly of causeless Surmises, as, <hi>That I had conspired against him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A mere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality it had been to me in that place; where, as no man had ever used it before me, so it could neither fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me if I did use it, nor hinder me if I did not.</note> 
                     <hi>and that I sought Superiority over him</hi>; and partly of Faults, which to note, I should have thought it a greater offence than to commit, if I did account them Faults, and had heard them so curiously observed in any other than myself, they are such silly things, as, <hi>Praying in the entrance of my Sermon onely, and not in the end; naming Bishops in my Prayer, Kneeling when I pray, and Kneeling when I receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> with such like, which I would be as loath to recite, as I was sorry to hear them objected, if the rehearsal thereof were not by him thus wrested from me. These are the Conferences wherewith I have been wooed to entertain Peace and good Agreement.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As for the vehement Exhortations he speaketh of, I would gladly know some reason, wherefore he thought them needful to be used. Was there any thing found in my Speeches or Dealings that gave them occasion, who are studious of Peace, to think that I disposed my self to some unquiet kinde of Proceedings? Surely, the special Providence of God I do now see it was, that the first words I spake in this Place, should make the first thing whereof I am accused, to appear not onely untrue, but improbable, to as many as then heard me with indifferent ears; and do, I doubt not, in their Consciences clear me of this suspition. Howbeit, I grant this were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if it might he shewed, that my Deeds following were not suitable to my words. If I had spoken of Peace at the first, and afterwards sought to molest and grieve him, by crossing him in his Function, by storming, if my pleasure were not asked, and my Will obeyed in the least occurrences, by carping needlesly sometimes at the manner of his Teaching, sometimes at this, sometimes at that Point of his Doctrine: I might then with some likelihood have been blamed, as one disdaining a peaceable hand when
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:66185:297"/>
it had been offered. But if I be able (as I am) to prove that my self have now a full year together, born the continuance of such dealings, not onely without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of resistance, but also without any such complaint, as might lett or hinder him in his course, I see no cause in the world, why of this I should he accused, unlesse it be, lest I should accuse, which I meant not. If therefore I have given him occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to use conferences and exhortations to peace, if when they were bestowed upon me I have despised them, it will not be hard to shew some one Word or Deed wherewith I have gone about to work disturbance: one is not much, I require but one. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I require if any thing be shewed, it may be proved, and not objected onely as this is, <hi>That I have joyned to such as have alwayes opposed to any good order in his Church, and made themselves to be thought indisposed to the present estate and proceedings.</hi> The words have reference, as it seemeth, unto some such things as being attempted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my comming to the Temple, went not so effectually (perhaps) forward, as he that devised them would have wished. An Order, as I learn, there was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that Communicants should neither kneel, as in most places of the Realm; nor sit, as in this Place the Custom is; but walk to the one side of the Table, and there standing till they had received, pass afterwards away round about by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which being on a sudden begun to be practised in the Church, some sate wondering what it should mean, others deliberating what to do: Till such time as at length by name one of them being called openly thereunto, requested that they might do as they had been accustomed, which was granted; and as Mr. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> had ministred this way to the rest, so a Curate was sent to minister to them after their way. Which unprosperous beginning of a thing (saving onely for the inconvenience of needless alterations, otherwise harmlesse) did to disgrace that Order, in their conceit who had to allow or disallow it, that it took no place. For neither could they ever induce themselves to think it good, and it so much offended Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> who supposed it to be the best, that he since that time, although contented to receive it as they do, at the hands of others, yet hath not thought it meet they should ever receive out of his, which would not admit that Order of receiving it, and therefore in my time hath been always present not to minister, but only to be ministred unto.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another Order there was likewise devised, but an Order of much more weight and importance. This soil in respect of certain Immunities and other Special<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties belonging unto it, seemed likely to bear that which in other places of the Realm of <hi>England</hi> doth not take. For which cause, request was made to her Majesties Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councel, that whereas it is provided by a Statute, there should be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors and Sidemen in Churches, which thing, or somewhat correspondent unto it, this place did greatly want; it would please their Honours to motion such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Antients of the Temple. And, according to their honourable manner of helping forward all motions so grounded, they wrote their Letters, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that effect. Whereupon, although these Houses never had use of such Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors and Sidemen as are appointed in other places, yet they both erected a Box to receive mens Devotions for the Poor, appointing the Treasurer of both Houses to take care for bestowing it where need was, and granting further, that if any could he entreated (as in the end some were) to undertake the labour of observing mens slacknesse in Divine duties, they should be allowed, their Complaints heard at all times, and the faults they complained of, if Mr. <hi>Alveyes</hi> private admonition did not serve, then by some other means to be redressed; but according to the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders of both Houses. Whereby the substance of their Honors Letters were indeed fully satisfied. Yet, because Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> intended not this, but, as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another thing; therefore, notwithstanding the Orders which have been taken, and, for any thing I know, do stand still in as much force in this Church now, as at any time heretofore, He complaineth much of the good Orders which he doth mean have been withstood. Now it were hard, if as many as did any ways oppose unto these and the like Orders, in his perswasion good, do thereby make themselves Dislikers of the present state and proceeding. It they, whom he aimeth at, have any other wayes made themselves to be thought such, it is likely he doth known wherein, and will, I hope, disclose wherein it appertaineth, both the Persons whom he thinketh, and
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:66185:298"/>
the causes why he thinketh them so ill-affected. But whatsoever the men be, doe their Faults make me faulty? They doe, if I joyn my self with them. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him therefore to declare wherein I have joyned with them. Other joyning than this with any man here, I cannot imagine: It may be I have talked, or walked, or eaten, or interchangeably used the Duties of common humanity with some such as he is hardly perswaded of. For I know no Law of God or Man, by force whereof they should be as Heathens and Publicans unto me, that are not gracious in the eyes of another man, perhaps without cause, or if with cause: yet such cause as he is privy unto, and not I. Could he, or any reasonable man think it is a charitable course in me, to observe them that shew by external cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies a favourable inclination toward him, and if I spy out any one amongst them, of whom I think not well, hereupon to draw such an accusation as this against him, and to offer it where he hath given up his against me? which notwithstanding, I will acknowledge to be just and reasonable, if he or any man living shall shew that I use as much as the bare familiar company but of one, who, by word, or deed hath ever given me cause to suspect or conjecture him, such as here they are term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with whom complaint is made that I joyn my self. This being spoken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and written without all possibility of proof, doth not Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> give me over-great cause to stand in some fear, lest he make too little conscience how he useth his Tongue or Pen? These things are not laid against me for nothing; they are to some purpose if they take place. For in a minde perswaded that I am, as he deciphereth me, one which refuses to be at peace with such as embrace the truth, and side my self with men sinisterly affected thereunto, any thing that shall be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken conferring the unsoundness of my Doctrine, cannot choose but he favourably entertained. This presupposed, it will have likelihood enough, which afterwards followeth, <hi>that many of my Sermons have tasted of some sour leaven or other, that in them he hath discovered many unsound matters.</hi> A thing much to be lamented, that such a place as this, which might have been so well provided for, hath fallen into the hands of one no better instructed in the truth. But what if in the end it be found, that he judgeth my words, as they do colours, which look upon them with green spectacles, and think that which they see is green, when indeed that is green whereby they see.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Touching the first point of this discovery, which is about the matter of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, to set down that I spake (for I have it written) to declare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the several branches thereof, would be tedious now in this Writing, where I have so many things to touch, that I can but touch them onely. Neither is it herein so needful for me to justifie my speech, when the very place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence where I spake, doth it self speak sufficiently for my clearing. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not broached in a blinde Alley, or uttered where none was to hear it, that had skill with Authority to controll, or covertly insinuated by some gliding Sentence.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That which I taught was at <hi>Pauls Cresse</hi>; it was not hudled in amongst other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr, in such sort that it could passe without noting; it was opened, it was proved, it was some reasonable time stood upon. I see not which way my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> who was present and heard it, can excuse so great a fault, as patiently, without rebuke or controlment afterwards, to hear any man there teach otherwise than <hi>the Word of God doth</hi>; nor as it is understood by the private interpretation of some one or two men, or by a special construction received in some few Books, but, as it is understood <hi>by al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Churches professing the Gospel,</hi> by them all, and therefore even by our own also amongst others. A man that did mean to prove that he speaketh, would surely take the measure of his words shorter.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The next thing discovered, is an opinion about the assurance of mens perswas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in matters of Faith. I have taught, he saith, <hi>That the assurance of things which we believe by the Word, is not so certain as of that we perceive by sense.</hi> And, is it as certain? Yea, I taught as he himself, I trust, will not deny, that the things which God doth promise in his Word, are surerunto us, than any thing which we touch, handle, or see. But are we so sure and certain of them: If we be, why doth God so often prove his Premises unto us, as he
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:66185:298"/>
doth by argument taken from our sensible experience? We must be surer of the proof, than of the thing proved, otherwise it is no proof. How is it, that if ten men doe all look upon the Moon, every one of them knoweth it as certainly to be the Moon as another; but many believing one and the same Promise, all have not one and the same fulnesse of Perswasion? How falleth it out, that men being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of any thing by sense, can be no surer of it than they are; whereas the strongest in faith that liveth upon the earth, hath always need to labour, and strive, and pray, that his assurance concerning Heavenly and Spiritual things, may grow, encrease, and be augmented?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Sermon wherein I have spoken somewhat largely of this point, was long before this late Controversie rose between him and me, upon request of some of my friends, seen and read by many, and amongst many, some who are thought able to discern: And I never heard that any one of them hitherto, hath condemned it as containing unsound matter. My Case were very hard, if as oft as any thing I speak displeasing one man's taste, my Doctrine upon his onely word should be taken for sour leaven.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The rest of this discovery is all about the matter now in question; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath two faults predominant, would tire out any that should answer unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very point severally: un apt speaking of School-Controversies, and of my words so untoward a reciting, that he which should promise to draw a Man's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and did indeed expresse the parts, at leastwise most of them, truly, but perversely place them, could not represent a more offensive Visage, than unto me my own speech seemeth in some places, as he hath ordered it. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer whereunto, that Writing is sufficient, wherein I have set down both my words and meaning in such sort, that where this Accusation doth deprave the one, and either mis-interpret, or, without just cause, mis-like the other, it will appear so plainly, that I may spare very well to take upon me a new needlesse labour here.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Onely at one thing which is there to be found, because Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> doth here seem to take such a special advantage, as if the matter were unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he constraineth me either to detect his oversight, or to confesse mine own in it. In settling the Question between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us, about Grace and Justification, lest I should give them an occasion to say, as commonly they doe, that when we cannot refute their Opinions, we propose to our selves such instead of theirs, as we can refute; I took it for the best and most perspicuous way of teaching, to declare first, how far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> we doe agree, and then to shew our disagreement: not generally (as Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> his<note n="a" place="margin">His word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein he so set the agreement of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with us, and their disagreement from us, as if we had consented in the greatest and weightiest Points, and differed onely in certain smaller matters. Which Agreement noted by him in two Chief Points, is not such as he would have made men believe: The one, in that he said they acknowledge all men Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even the Blessed Virgin, though some of them freed her from Sinne: For the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> holdeth, that she was free from Sinne: Another, In that he said, They reach Christ's Righteousnesse to be the onely meritorions Cause of taking away Sinne, and differ from as onely in the applying of it. For, <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> their Chief Schoolman, and Archbishop <hi>Catherinus,</hi> teach. The Christ took away onely Original sinae, and that the rest are to be taken away by our selves: yea, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> teacheth. That the Righteousness whereby we are righteous in God's sight. Is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse, which must needs be our own works, and cannot be understood of the righteousnesse inherent onely in Christ's Person, and accounted unto us.</note> words would carry it, for the easier fastning that upon me, wherewith, saving onely by him, I was never in my life touched;) but about the matter onely of Justification: for further I had no cause to meddle at this time. What was then my Offence in this Case? I did, as he saith, so set it out, as if we had consented in the greatest and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Points, and differed onely in smaller matters. It will not be found, when it commeth to the balance, a light difference where we disagree, as I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we doe, about the very essence of the Medicine whereby Christ cureth our Disease. Did I goe about to make a shew of Agreement in the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Points, and was I so fond as not to conceal our disagreement about this? I doe with that some indifferency were used by them that have taken the weighing of my words.</p>

                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:66185:299"/>13. Yea, but our Agreement is not such in two of the chiefest Points, as I would have men believe it is? And what are they? The one is, I said, <hi>They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all men sinners, even the Blessed Virgin, though some of them free her from sin.</hi> Put the case I had affirmed, That onely some of them free her from sin, and had delivered it as the most current opinion amongst them, that she was conceived in sin: doth not <hi>Bona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> doth he not bring many reasons wherefore all men should hold it? Were their voyces since that time ever counted, and their number found smaller which hold it, than theirs that hold the contrary? Let the question then be, Whether I might say, The most of them <hi>acknowledged all men sinner, even the Blessed Virgin her selfe.</hi> To shew, that their general received opinion is the contrary, the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, peradventure not altogether so considerately. For if that Council have by resolute determination freed her, if it held as Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> saith it doth, that she was free from sin; then must the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> needs condemn them that hold the contrary: For what thee Council holdeth, the same they all doe and must hold, But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who knoweth not, that it is a thing indifferent to think and defend the one or the other? So that, by this Argument, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> holdeth the Virgin free from sinne; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is plain that none of them may, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore untrue, that most of them do acknowledge her a Sinner, were for able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw my supposed Affection, if it were true that the Council did hold this. But to the end it may clearly appear, how it neither holdeth this not the contrary, I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen what many do conceive of the Canon that concerneth this matter. The Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> perceived, that if they should define of this matter, it would be dangerous howsoever it were determined. If they had freed her from her Original sinne, the reasons against them are unanswerable, which <hi>Bonave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which Question I leave for them to discusse whom it most concerneth. If the Order be such, that it cannot be kept without hazarding a thing so precious as a good Conscience, the peril whereof could be no greater to him, than it needs must be to all others whom it toucheth in like Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; then this is evident, it will be an effectual motive, not onely for <hi>England,</hi> but also for other Reformed Churches, even <hi>Geniva</hi> it self [for they have the like] to change or take that away which cannot but with great inconvenience be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

Now, whereas he confesseth another <hi>way had been more convenient,</hi> and that he found in himself secret unwillingnesse to doe that which he did, doth he not say plainly, in effect, that the light of his own Understanding, proved the way that he took perverse and crooked; Reason was so plain and pregnant against it, that his Minde was alienated, his Will averted to another course? yet somewhat there was that so farr over-ruled, that it must needs be done even against the very stream, what doth it bewray? Finally his purposed Protestation, whereby he meant openly to make it known, that he did not allow this kinde of proceeding, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would satisfie men otherwise, <hi>and deal no more in this Place,</hi> sheweth his good minde in this, that he meant to stay himself from further offending; but it serveth not his turn.

But as in this he standeth perswaded, that he hath done nothing besides duty, so he taketh it hardly, that the High Commissioners should charge him with indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Wherefore, as if he could so wash his hands, he maketh a long and a large declaration concerning the carriage of himself: how he waded in <hi>matters of smaller weight,</hi> and how in things of <hi>greater moment</hi>; how wary he dealt; how <hi>naturally he took his things rising from the Text</hi>; how <hi>closely he kept himself to the Scriptures he took in hand</hi>; how <hi>much pains he took to confirm the necessity of believing Iustification by Christ onely,</hi> and to shew how <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>denieth that a man is saved by Faith alone, without works of the Law</hi>; what <hi>the Sons of Thunder would have done,</hi> if they had been in his case; that his <hi>Answer was very temperate, without immodest or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful speech,</hi> that when he might <hi>before all have reproved me,</hi> he did not, <hi>but contented himself with exhorting me</hi> before all, <hi>to follow</hi> Nathan's <hi>example, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visit my Doctrine</hi>; when he might have followed Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s example in <hi>reproving

Peter,</hi> he did not, but exhorted me with <hi>Peter, to endure to be withstood.</hi> This Testimony of his discreet carrying himself in the handling of his matter, being more agreeably framed and given him by another than by himself, might make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the praise of his Person; but for defence of his action unto them by whom he is thought undiscreet, for not concerning privately before he spake, will it serve to answer, that when he spake, he did it considerately? He perceiveth it will not, and therefore addeth reasons, such as they are: as namely, how he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at the first to take another course, and that was this, <hi>Publickly to deliver the truth of such Doctrine as I had otherwise taught, and at convenient opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr with me upon such points.</hi> Is this the rule of Christ? If thy Brother offend open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his speech, controll it first with contrary speech openly, and conferr with him afterwards upon it, when convenient opportunity serveth? Is there any Law of God or Man, whereupon to ground such a Resolution? any Church extant in the World, where Teachers are allowed thus to doe, or to be done unto? He cannot but see how weak an allegation it is, when he bringeth in his following this course, first in one matter, and so afterwards in another, to approve himself, now following it again. For if the purpose of doing of a thing so uncharitable be a fault, the deed is a greater fault; and doth the doing of it twice, make it the third time fit and allowable to be done? The weight of the Cause, which is his third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, relieveth him as little. The weightier it was, the more it required consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate advice and consultation, the more it stood him upon to take good heed, that nothing were rashly done or spoken in it. But he meaneth weighty, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the wonderful danger, except he had presently withstood me without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a time of Conference. <hi>This Cause being of such moment that might prejudice the Faith of Christ, encourage the ill-affected to continue still in their damnable wayes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weak in Faith, to suffer themselves to be seduced, to the destruction of their Souls, he thought it his bounden duty to speak before he talked with me.</hi> A man that should read this, and not know what I had spoken, might imagine that I had at the least denied the Divinity of Christ. But they which were present at my speech, and can testifie, that nothing passed my lips more than is contained in their Writings, whom, for soundnesse of Doctrine, Learning, and Judgment, Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> himself doth, I dare say, not onely allow, but honour; they which heard, and do know, that the Doctrine here signified in so fearful manner, the Doctrine that was so dangerous to the Faith of Christ, that was so likely <hi>to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ill-affected men to continue still in their damnable wayes</hi>; that gave so great cause to tremble for fear of the present <hi>destruction of Souls,</hi> was onely this, <hi>I doubt not but God was merciful to save thousands of our Fathers, living heretofore in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Superstition, in as much as they sinned ignorantly</hi>; and this spoken in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the greatest part whereof was against Popery, they will hardly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to discern how CHRISTIANITY should herewith be so grievously shaken.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Whereby his fourth excuse is also taken from him. For what doth it boot him to say, <hi>The time was short wherein he was to preach after me,</hi> when his Preaching of this matter perhaps ought, surely might have been either very well omitted, or at least more conveniently for a while deferred; even by their Judgements that cast the most favourable aspect towards these his hasty proceedings. The poyson which men had taken at my hands, was not so quick and strong in operation, as in eight dayes to make them past cure; by eight dayes delay, there was no likelihood that the force and power of his Speech could dye; longer meditation might bring better and stronger proofs to minde, than extemporal dexterity could furnish him with: And, who doth know whether <hi>Time,</hi> the onely Mother of sound Judgement and discreet dealing, might have given that action of his some better ripeness, which, by so great festination hath, as a thing born out of time, brought small joy unto him that begat it? Doth he think it had not been better, that neither my speech had seemed in his eyes as an Arrow sticking in a thigh of Flesh; nor his own as a Childe whereof he must needs be delivered by an hour? His last way of disburthening him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is by casting his Load upon my Back, as if I had brought him by former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences out of hope, that any fruit should ever come of conferring with me.

When I saw that Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> carped at these things, onely because they lay not open, I promised at some convenient time to make them clear as light both to him and all others. Which, if they that reprove me will not grant me leave to doe, they must think that they are for some cause or other more desirous to have me reputed an unsound man, then willing that my sincere meaning should appear and be approved.

I alledged therefore that which might under no pretence in the world be disallowed, namely reasons, not meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mine own reason, as now it is reported, but true, sound, divine reason; reason whereby chose Conclusions might be out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> demonstrated, and not probably discoursed of onely; reason, proper to that science where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the things of God are known; Theological Reason, without Principles in Scripture that are plain, soundly deduced more doubtful inferences, in such sort that being heard they cannot be denied, not any thing repugnant unto them received, but whatsoever was before otherwise by miscollecting gathered out of dark places, is thereby forced to yield it self, and the true consonant meaning of Sentences not understood, is brought to light. This is the reason which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. If it were possible for me to escape the Ferula in any thing I do or speak, I had undoubtedly escaped in this. In this I did that which by some is enjoyned as the only allowable, but granted by all as the most sure and safe way, whereby to resolve things doubted of in matters appertaining to Faith and Christian Religion. So that Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> had here small cause given him to be weary of conferring, unlesse it was in other respects, than that poor one which is here pretended, that is to say, the little hope he had of doing me any good by conference.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Yet behold his first reason of not complaining to the High Commission, is, <hi>That sith I offended onely through an over-charitable inclination, he conceived good hope, when I should see the truth cleared, and some scruples, which where in my minde, removed by his diligence, I would yield.</hi> But what experience soever he had of former Conferences, how small soever his hope was, that fruit would come of it, if he should have conferred, will any man judge this a Cause sufficient, why to open his mouth in publick, without any one word privately spoken: He might have considered the men do sometimes reap, where they sow but wish small hope; he might have considered, that although unto me (whereof he was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain neither) but if to me his labour should be as Water spilt or poured into a torne dish, yet to him it could not be fruitlesse to do that, which Order in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, that which Charity amongst Christian men, that which at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men's hands, even common humanity it self, at his, many other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, did require. What fruit could there come of his open contradicting in so great haste, with so small advice, but such as must needs be unpleasant, and mingled with much ace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely, he which will take upon him to defend, that, in this, there was no over-sight, must beware, left, by such defences, he leave an opinion dwelling in the mindes of men, that he is more stiff to maintain what he hath done, then careful to doe nothing but that which may justly be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Thus have I, as near as I could, seriously answered things of weight: with smaller I have dealt, as I thought their quality did require. I take no joy in striving, I have not been nuzled or trained up in it. I would to Christ they which have at this present enforced me hereunto, had so ruled their hands in any reasonable time, that I might never have been constrained to strike so much as in mine own defence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prosecute this long and redious contention no further, I shall wish that your Grace and their Honours (unto whose intelligence the dutiful regard, which I have of their Judgments, maketh me desirous, that as accusations have been brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, so that this my answer thereunto may likewise come) did both with the

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be convenient to be wished or no, I cannot tell: But sith there can come nothing of contention, but the mutual waste of the Parties contending, till a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy dance in the ashes of them both, I do wish heartily that the grave advice which <hi>Constantine</hi> gave for re-uniting of his Clergy so many times, upon some small occasions, in so lamentable sort divided; or rather the strict Commandment of Christ unto his, that they should not be divided at all; may at the length, if it be his blessed will, prevail so farr, at least in this corner of the Christian world, to the burying and quite forgetting of strife, together with the Causes that have either bred it, or brought it up, that things of small moment never disjoyn them, whom one God, one Lord, one Faith, one Spirit, one Baptism, bands of so great force have linked; that a respectively eye towards things wherewith we should not be disquieted, make us not, as through infirmity the very Patriarchs themselves sometimes were, full gorged, unable to speak peaceably to their own Brother. Finally, that no strife may ever be heard of again, but this, Who shall hate strife most, who shall pursue peace and unity with swiftest paces.</p>

                  <p>FOR the better manifestation of the Prophets meaning in this place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we are first to consider <hi>the wicked,</hi> of whom he saith, that <hi>They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> compass about the righteous</hi>: Secondly, <hi>the righteous,</hi> that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> about by them: and Thirdly, That which is inferred; <hi>Therefore perverse judgement proceedeth.</hi> Touching the first, There are two kinds of wicked men, of whom in the fist of the former to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the blessed Apostle speaketh thus:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Do ye not judge them that are within; But God judgeth them that art without.</hi> There are wicked therefore whom the Church may judge, and there are wicked whom God onely judgeth: wicked within, and wicked without the walls of the Church. If within the Church, particular persons be apparently such, as cannot otherwise be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; the rule of the Apostolical judgment is this, <hi>Separate them from among you:</hi> if whole Assemblies, this:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Separate your selves from among them: For what society hath light with darkness</hi>? But the wicked; whom the Prophet meaneth, were Babylonians, and therefore without. For which cause we heard at large heretofore in what sort he urgeth God to judge them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now concerning the righteous, their neither it, nor ever was any meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man absolutely righteous in himself, that is to say, void of all unrighteousness of all sin. We dare not except, no not the blessed Virgin her self, of whom although we say with St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> for the honour sake which we owe to our Lord and Saviour Christ, we are not willing in this cause, to move any question of his Mother: yet for asmuch as the Schools of <hi>Rome</hi> have made it a question; we may answer with<note n="a" place="margin">Or whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of those Homilies that go under his name.</note>

                     <hi>A peccati enim veteris nexu, per se non est immunis ipsa genitrix Redemptoris</hi>: The Mother of the Redeemer himself, is not otherwise loosed from the bond of antient sinne, than by redemption: if Christ have paid a ransom for all, even for her, it followeth, that all, without exception, were Captives. If one have died for all, then all were dead in sinne; all sinful therefore, none absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous in themselves; but we are absolutely righteous in Christ. The World then must shew a righteous man, otherwise not able to shew a man that is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous: <hi>Christ is made to us Wisdome, Iustice, Sanctification, and Redemption: Wisdom,</hi> because he hath revealed his Fathers will: <hi>Iustice,</hi> because he hath offered up himself a Sacrifice for sin: <hi>Sanctification,</hi> because he hath given us his Spirit, <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> because he hath appointed a day to vindicate his Children out of the bonds of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into liberty which is glorious. How Christ is made <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and how <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it may be declared, when occasion serveth. But how Christ is made the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of men, we are now to declare.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a glorifying Righteousness of men in the World to come: as there is a justifying and sanctifying Righteousness here. The Righteousness, wherewith we shall be clothed in the World to come, is both perfect and inherent. That whereby here we are justified is perfect; but not inherent. That whereby we are sanctified, is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but not perfect. This openeth a way to the understanding of that grand question, which hangeth yet in controversie between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of justifying Righteousness.</p>

This Grace they will have to be applied by infusion, to the end, that as the Body is warm by the heat which is in the Body, so the Soul might be righteous by inherent Grace: which Grace they make capable of increase; as the Body may be more and more
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:66185:304"/>
warm, so the Soul more and more justified, according as Grace should be augmented; the augmentation whereof is merited by good Works, as good Works are made merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by it. Wherefore, the first receit of Grace in their Divinity, is, the first Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the increase thereof, the second Justification. As Grace may be increased by the merit of good Works: so it may be diminished by the demerit of sins venial, it may be lost by mortal sin. In as much therefore as it is needful in the one case to repair, in the other to recover the loss which is made: the infusion of Grace hath her sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry after-meals; for the which cause, they make many ways to apply the infusion of Grace. It is applyed to Infants, through Baptism, without either Faith or Works, and in them really it taketh away Original sinne, and the punishment due unto it; It is applied to Infidels and wicked men in the first Justification, through Baptism without Works, yet not without Faith; and it taketh away both Sinnes Actual and Original together, with all whatsoever punishment, eternal or temporal, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. Unto such as have attained the first Justification, that is to say, the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Grace, it is applied farther by good Works to the increase of former Grace, which is the second Justification. If they work more and more, Grace doth more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and they are more and more justified. To such as diminished it by venial sinnes, it is applied by Holy-water. <hi>Ave Marie's,</hi> Crossings, Papal Salutations, and such like, which serve for reparations of Grace decayed. To such as have lost it through mortal sinne, it is applied by the Sacrament (as they term it) of Penance: which Sacrament hath force to conferr Grace anew, yet in such sort, that being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, it hath not altogether so much power, as at the first. For it onely cleanseth out the stain or guilt of sinne committed; and changeth the punishment eternal into a temporal satisfactory punishment here, if time doe serve; if not, hereafter to be endured, except it be lightned by Masses, Works of Charity, Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Fasts, and such like; or else shortned by pardon for term, or by plenary pardon quite removed, and taken away. This is the mystery of the man of sinne. This maze the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth cause her Followers to tread, when they ask her the way to Justification.

Doubtless, saith the Apostle, <hi>I have counted all things loss, and judge them to be doing, that I may win Christ; and to be found in him, not having my own righteousness, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God through Faith.</hi> Whether they speak of the first or second Justification, they make it the essence of a Divine quality inherent, they make it Righteousnesse which is in us. If it be in us, then is it ours, as our Souls are ours though we have them from God, and can hold them no longer than pleaseth him; for if he withdraw the breath of our nostrils, we fall to dust: but the Righteousness wherein we must be found, if we will be justified, is not our own, therefore we cannot be justified by any inherent quality. Christ hath merited righteousness for as many as are found in him. In him God find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, if we be faithful, for by Faith we are incorporated into Christ. Then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in our selves we be altogether sinful and unrighteous, yet even the man which is impious in himself, full of iniquity, full of sin; him being found in Christ through Faith, and having his sinne remitted through Repentance; him God upholdeth with a gracious eye, putteth away his sinne by not imputing it, taketh quite away the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due thereunto by pardoning it, and accepteth him in Jesus Christ, as perfectly righteous, as if he had fulfilled all that was commanded him in the Law: shall I say more perfectly righteous than if himself had fulfilled the whole Law?

Let it be counted folly or frensie, or fury, whatsoever; it is our comfort, and our wisdom; we care for no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the World but this, That man hath sinned, and God hath suffered; That God hath made himself the Son of Man, and that men are made the righteousness of God.

Sanctification, we deny it not to be inherent: we grant, that unless we work, we have it not: onely we distinguish it as a thing different in nature from the righteousness of Justification: we are righteous the one way, by the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi>; the other way, except we do the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we are not righteous. Of the one St. <hi>Paul, To him that worketh not, but believeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Faith is counted for Righteousness.</hi> Of the other, St. <hi>Iohn, Qui facit Iustitiam, justus est</hi>; He is righteous which worketh Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Of the one, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth prove by <hi>Abrahams</hi> Example, that we have it of Faith without Works. Of the other, St. <hi>Iames</hi> by <hi>Abrahams</hi> Example, that by Works we have it, and not onely by Faith. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly sever these two parts of Christian righteousness one from the other. For in the sixth to the <hi>Romans</hi> thus he writeth, <hi>Being freed from sin</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and made Servants to God, ye have your fruit in Holinesse, and the end everlasting life. Ye are made free from sin, and made Servants unto God</hi>; this is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of <hi>Iustification: ye have your Fruit in Holiness</hi>; this is the righteousness of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. By the one, we are interessed in the right of inheriting; by the other we are brought to the actual possession of eternal bliss, and so the end of both is everlasting life.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Prophet <hi>Habakh,</hi> doth here term the Jews <hi>Righteous men,</hi> not onely because being justified by Faith they were free from sin: but also because they had their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of fruits in Holiness. According to whose example of charitable Judgement, which leaveth it to God to discern what we are, and speaketh of them according to that which they do profess themselves to be, although they be not holy men, whom men do think, but whom God doth know indeed to be such: yet let every Christian man know, that in Christian equity, he standeth bound for to think and speak of his Brethren, as of men that have a measure in the fruit of Holinesse, and a right unto the Titles, wherewith God, in token of special favour and mercy, vouchsafeth to honour his chosen Servants. So we see the Apostle of our Saviour Christ, do use every where the name of <hi>Saints</hi>; so the Prophet the name of <hi>Righteous,</hi> But let us all be such as we desire to be termed: <hi>Reatus impii est pium nomen,</hi> saith, <hi>Salvianus</hi>; Godly names do not justifie godless men. We are but upbraided, when we are hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with names and Titles, whereunto our lives and manners are not suitable, If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have our fruit in Holiness, notwithstanding we must note, that the more we abound therein, the more need we have to crave that we may be strengthened and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: Our very vertues may be snares unto us. The enemy, that waiteth for all occasions to work our ruine, hath found it harder to overthrow an humble Sinner, than a proud Saint. There is no man's case so dangerous, as his whom Sathan hath perswaded, that his own righteousness shall present him pure and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in the sight of God. If we could say, we were not guilty of any thing at all in our Consciences (we know our selves farr from this innocency; we cannot say, we know nothing by our selves; but if we could) should we therefore plead not guilty before the presence of our Judge, that sees further into our hearts than we our selves can do? If our hands did never offer violence to our Brethren, a bloody thought doth prove us Murtherers before him: If we had never open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our mouth to utter any scandalous, offensive, or hurtful word, the cry of our secret cogitations is heard in the ears of God. If we did not commit the sins, which daily and hourly either in deed, word, or thoughts we do commit; yet in the good things which we doe, how many defects are these interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led! God, in that which is done, respecteth the minde and intention of the doer. Cutt off then all those things wherein we have regarded our own glory, those things which men do to please men, and to satisfie our own liking, those things which we do for any by-respect, not sincerely and purely for the love of God: and a small score will serve for the number of our righteous deeds. Let the holiest and best things which we do be considered: we are never better affected unto God than when we pray; yet when we pray, how are our affections many times distracted! how little reverence do we shew unto the grand Majesty of God, unto whom we speak! How little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of our own miseries! How little taste of the sweet influence of his tender mercies do we feel! Are we not as unwilling many times to begin, and as glad to make an ends; as if in saying, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> he had set us a very burthensome task? it may seen somewhat extream, which I will speak; therefore let every one judge of it, even as his own heart shall tell him, and no otherwise; I will but onely make a demand:
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:66185:305"/>
If God should yield unto us, not as unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> If fifty, forty, thirty, twenty, yea, or if ten good Persons could be found in a City, for their sakes that City should not be destroyed: but, and if he should make us an offer thus large; Search all the Generations of men, sithence the Fall of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> finde one man, that hath done one Action, which hath past from him pure, without any strain or blemish at all, and for that one man's onely action, neither Man nor Angel shall feel the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are prepared for both. Do you think that this ransome, to deliver Men and Angels, could be found to be among the Sons of men? The best things which we do, have somewhat in them to be pardoned. How then can we do any thing merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or worthy to be rewarded? Indeed, God doth liberally promise whatsoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to a blessed life, to as many as sincerely keep his Law, though they be not exactly able to keep it. Wherefore we acknowledge a dutiful necessity of doing well, but the meritorious dignity of doing well, we utterly renounce. We see how farr we are from the perfect righteousness of the Law, the little fruit which we have in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it is, God knoweth, corrupt and unfound: we put no confidence at all in it, we challenge nothing in the world for it, we dare not call God to reckoning, as if we had him in our Debt-books: our continual suit to him, is, and must be, to bear with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and pardon our offences.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But the People of whom the Prophet speaketh, were they all, or were the most part of them such as had care to walk uprightly? Did they thirst after righteousness? did they with? did they long with the righteous Prophet? <hi>Oh that our ways were so direct, that we might keep thy Statutes?</hi> Did they lament with the righteous Apostle? <hi>Oh miserable men, the good which we wish and purpose, and strive to do, we cannot</hi>?<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> No, the words of the other Prophet concerning this People, do shew the contrary.

All which notwithstanding, so wide are the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his Compassion enlarged, that he denieth us not, no, not when we were laden with Iniquity, leave to commune familiarly with him, liberty to crave and intreat, that what Plagues soever we have deserved, we may not be in worse case than Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that we may not be hemmed in by Pagans and Infidels. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is a sinful pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted City: but <hi>Ierusalem</hi> compared with <hi>Babylon,</hi> is righteous And shall the Righteous be over-born? shall they be compass'd about by the Wicked? But the Prophet doth not onely complain; Lord how commeth it to passe, that thou handlest us so hardly, of whom thy Name is called, and bearest with the Heathen-Nations, that despise thee? No, he breaketh out through extremity of grief, and inferreth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently: This <hi>proceeding is perverse,</hi> the Righteous are thus handled; <hi>therefore perverse judgment doth proceed.</hi>

Which illation containeth many things, whereof it were better much both for you to hear, and me to speak, if necessity did not draw me to another task. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> being requested to preach the same things again which once they had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Acts 13. 41; 44.</note> thought it their Duty to satisfie the godly desires of men, sincerely affected to the truth.

                     </gap>, was merciful to save thousands of them, though they lived in Popish Superstitions, inasmuch as they sinned ignorantly: but the Truth is now laid before our Eys. The former part of this last Sentence, namely, these words: <hi>I doubt not, but God was merciful to save thousands of our Fathers living in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:66185:306"/>
Superstitions, inasmuch as they seemed ignorantly</hi>: This Sentence, I beseech you to mark, and to fist it with the severity of austere judgement, that if it be found to be gold, it may be suitable to the precious foundation whereon it was then laid, for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, that if it be hay or stubble, my own hand shall see fire on it. Two questions have risen by this speech before alledged: The one, <hi>Whether our Fathers, infected with Popish Errours and Superstitions, may be saved?</hi> The other, <hi>Whether their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be a reasonable inducement to make us think they might?</hi> We are then to examine, first, what possibility; then, what probability there is, that God might be merciful unto so many of our Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So many of our Fathers living in Popish Superstitions, yet by the mercy of God be saved? No; this could not be: God hath spoken by his Angel from Heaven, unto his People concerning <hi>Babylon</hi> (by <hi>Babylon</hi> we understand the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>;<note place="margin">Apoc. 18. 4.</note>) <hi>Go out of her my People, that ye be not Partakers of her Plagues.</hi> For answer whereunto; first, I do not take the words to be meant onely of Temporal plagues; of the Corporal death, sorrow, famine and fire, whereunto God in his wrath had condemned <hi>Babylon</hi>; and that to save his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen People from these Plagues, he saith, <hi>Go out,</hi> with like intent, as in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, speaking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s desolations, he saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Let them that are in</hi> Judea, <hi>flye unto the Mountains, and them that are in the midst thereof depart one:</hi> or, as in the former times to <hi>Lot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Arise, take thy Wife and thy Daughters which are there, lest thou be destroyed in the punishment of the City</hi>: but forasmuch as here it is said, <hi>Go out of Babylon</hi>; we doubt, their everlasting destruction, which are Partakers therein, is either principally meant, or necessarily implyed in this Sentence. How then was it possible for so many of our Fathers to be saved, since they were so farr from depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they took her for their Mother, and in her bosome yielded up the Ghost?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. First, for the Plagues being threatned unto them that are Partakers in the sins of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we can define nothing concerning our Fathers, our of this Sentence: unless we shew what the sins of <hi>Babylon</hi> be; and what they be which are such Partakers of them, that their everlasting plagues are inevitable. The sins which may be common both to them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to others departed thence, must be severed from this question. He which saith, <hi>Department of</hi> Babylon, <hi>lest ye be partakers of her sons</hi>: sheweth plainly, that he meaneth such sins, as, except we separate ourselves, we have no power in the World to avoid; such impieties, as by their Law they have established, and whereunto all that are among them, either do indeed assent, or else are, by powerful means, forced in shew and appearance, to subject themselves. As for example, in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is maintained. That the same credit and reverence that we give to the Scriptures of God, ought also to be given to unwritten verities, That the Pope is Supream head ministerial over the Universal Church-militant; That the Bread in the Eucharist is transubstantiated into Christ; That it is to be adored, and to be offered up unto God, as a Sacrifice propitiatory for quick and dead; That Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are to be worshipped; Saints to be called upon as Intercessors, and such like. Now, because some Heresies do concern things only believed, as, the transubstantiation of the Sacramental Elements in the Eucharist; some concern things which practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and put in ure, as, the adoration of the Elements transubstantiated: we must note, that <hi>erroneously</hi> the practice of that is sometime received, whereof the doctrine, that teacheth it, is not <hi>heretically</hi> maintained. They are all partakers of the maintenance of Heresies, who by word or deed allow them, knowing them, although not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be Heresies; as also they, and that most dangerously of all others, who knowing Heresie to be Heresie, do notwithstanding in worldly respects, make sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of allowing that, which in heart and judgment they condemn: But Heresie is heretically maintained, by such as obstinately hold it, after wholsome admonition. Of the last sort, as of the next before, I make no doubt, but that their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without an actual repentance, is inevitable. Lest any man therefore should think, that in speaking of our Fathers, I should speak indifferently of them all: let my words I beseech you be well marked: <hi>I doubt not, but God was merciful to save them sands of our Fathers:</hi> which thing, I will now, by God's assistance, set more plainly before your eyes.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="517" facs="tcp:66185:306"/>12. Many are partakers of the error, which are not of the heresie of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The people, following the conduct of their guides, and observing as they did, exactly, that which was prescribed, thought they did God good service, when indeed they did dishonour him. This was their error: but the Heresie of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their dogmatical Positions opposite unto Christian truth, what one man amongst ten thousand, did ever understand? Of them, which understand <hi>Roman</hi> Heresies, and allow them, all are not a like partakers in the action of allowing. Some allow them as the first founders and establishers of them: which crime toucheth none but their Popes and Councels; the people are dear and free from this. Of them which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Popish Heresies, not as Authors, but receivers of them from others, all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them not as Masters. In this are not the people partakers neither, but onely the Predicants and Schoolmen. Of them which have been partakers in this sin of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Popish Heresie, there is also a difference; for they have not all been Teachers of all Popish Heresie. <hi>Put a difference,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse.</note> saith S. <hi>Iude, have compassion upon some.</hi> Shall we lap up all in one condition? Shall we cast them all headlong? Shall we plunge them all into that infernal and everlasting flaming lake? Them that have been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the errors of <hi>Babylon,</hi> together with them which are in the Heresie? them which have been the Authors of Heresie, with them that by terror and violence have been forced to receive it? Them who have taught it, with them whose simplicity hath by slights and conveyances of false Teachers, been seduced to believe it? Them which have been partakers in one, with them which have been partakers in many? Them which in many, with them which in all?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Notwithstanding I grant, that although the condemnation of them be more tolerable then of these: yet from the man that laboureth at the plough, to him that sitteth in the Vatican; to all partakers in the sins of <hi>Babylon</hi>; to our Fathers, though they did but erroneously practise that which the guide heretically taught; to all without exception, plagues were due. The pit is ordinarily the end, as well of the guide, as of the guided in blindness. But wo worth the hour wherein we were born, except we might promise our selves better things; things which accompany mans salvation, even where we know that worse, and such as accompany condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are due. Then must we shew some way how possibly they might escape. What way is there that sinners can find to escape the judgement of God, but only by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the seat of his saving mercy? Which mercy, with <hi>origen,</hi> we do not extend to Divels and damned spirits. God hath mercy upon thousands, but there be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands also which he hardneth. Christ hath therefore set the bounds, he hath fixed the limits of his saving mercy within the compass of these termes: <hi>God sent not his own Son to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be saved.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3. 17.</note> In the third of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel mercy is restrained to believers: <hi>Ile that believeth shall not be condemned; Ile that believeth not, is condemned already, because he believeth not in the Son of God.</hi> In the second of the Revelation, mercy is restrained to the penitent. For of <hi>Iezabel</hi> and her Sectarics, thus he speakth: <hi>I gave her space to repent, and she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit fornication with her into great affliction, except they repent them of their works, and I will kill her children with death.</hi> Our hope therefore of the Fathers is, if they were not altogether faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and impenitent, that they are saved.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. They are not all faithless that are weak in assenting to the truth, or stiff in maintaining things opposite to the truth of Christian Doctrine. But as many as hold the foundation which is precious, though they hold it but weakly, and as it were with a slender thred, although they frame many base and unsuitable things upon it, things that cannot abide the tryal of the fire; yet shall they pass the fiery tryal and be saved, which indeed have builded themselves upon the Rock, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church. If then our Fathers did not hold the foundation of Faith, there is no doubt but they were faithless. If many of them held it, then is therein no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, but many of them might be saved. Then let us see what the foundation of Faith is, and whether we may think that thousands of our Fathers being in Popish Superstitions, did notwithstanding hold the foundation.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. If the Foundation of Faith do import the general ground whereupon we rest when we do believe, the Writings of the Evangelists and the Apostles are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <hi>This is Christ the Saviour of the world</hi>: he that directly denieth this, doth utterly raze the very foundation of our Faith. I have proved heretofore, that although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath plaid the Harlot worse then ever did <hi>Israel,</hi> yet are they not, as now the Synagogue of the <hi>Iews</hi> which plainly deny Christ Jesus, quite and clean excluded from the new Covenant. But as <hi>Samaria</hi> compared with <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Aholath,</hi> a Church or Tabernacle of her own; contrariwise, <hi>Ierusalem Aholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> the resting place of the Lord: so, whatsoever we term the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when we compare her with Reformed Churches, still we put a difference, as then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> so now between <hi>Rome</hi> and the Heathenish Assemblies: Which Opinion I must and will recall; I must grant and will, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> together with all her children, is clean excluded. There is no difference in the World between our Fathers and <hi>Saracens, Turks</hi> and <hi>Painims,</hi> if they did directly deny Christ crucified for the salvation of the World.</p>

                     <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches do at this day so stifly and so firmly maintain? For mine own part I dare not here deny the possibility of their salvation which have been the chiefest instruments of ours, albeit they carried to their grave a perswasion so greatly repugnant to the truth. Forasmuch therefore as it may be said of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> she hath yet a little strength, she doth not directly deny the foundation of Christianity: I may, I trust without offence, perswade my self that thousands of our Fathers in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times living and dying within her walls, have found mercy at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. What, although they repented not of their errors? God forbid that I should open my mouth to gain-say that which Christ himself hath spoken: <hi>Except ye repent,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:66185:307"/>
ye shall all perish.</hi> And if they did not repent they perished. But withall note, that we have the benefit of a double Repentance: the least sin which we commit in Deed, Thought, or Word, is death without Repentance. Yet how many things do escape us in every of these, which we do not know? How many, which we do not observe to be sins? And without the knowledge, without the observation of sin, there is no actual Repentance. It cannot then be chosen, but that for as many as hold the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and have holden all Sins and Errors in hatred, the blessing of Repentance for unknown Sins and Errors is obtained at the hands of God, through the gracious mediation of Jesus Christ, for such suiters as cry with the Prophet <hi>David: Purge me, O Lord, from my secret sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. But we wash a wall of lome, we labour in vain, all this is nothing; it doth not prove; it cannot justifie that which we go about to maintain. Infidels and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men are not so godless, but that they may no doubt, cry God mercy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in general to have their sins forgiven them. To such as deny the foundation of Faith there can be no Salvation (according to the ordinary course which God doth use in saving men) without a particular repentance of that Error. The <hi>Galathians</hi> thinking that unless they were circumcised, they could not be saved, overthrew the foundation of Faith directly: therefore if any of them did die so perswaded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after they were told of their Errors, their end is dreadful; there is no way with them but one, death and condemnation. For the Apostle speaketh nothing of men departed, but saith generally of all, <hi>If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. Ye are abolished from Christ, whosoever are justified by the Law; ye are fallen from grace, Gal. 5.</hi> Of them in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the reason is the same.

God hath always had a Church amongst them, which firmly kept his saving truth. As for such as hold with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we cannot be saved by Christ alone without works; they do not only by a circle of consequence, but directly deny the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith; they hold it not, no not so much as by a thred.</p>

This to my remembrance, being all that hath been opposed with any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or shew of reason, I hope, if this be answered, the cause in question is at an end. Concerning general Repentance therefore: what? a Murtherer, a Blasphemer, an unclean person, a Turk, a <hi>Iew,</hi> any sinner to escape the wrath of God by a general Repentance, <hi>God forgive me</hi>? Truly, it never came within my heart, that a general Repentance doth serve for all sins: it serveth only for the common over-sights of our sinful life, and for the faults which either we do not mark, or do not know that they are faults. Our Fathers were actually penitent for sins, wherein they knew they displeased God; or else they fall not within the compass of my first speech. Again, that otherwise they could not be saved, than holding the foundation of Christian Faith, we have not only affirmed, but proved. Why is it not then confessed, that thousands of our Fathers which lived in Popish Superstitions, might yet by the mercy of God be saved? First, if they had directly denied the very foundations of Christianity, without repenting them particularly of that sin, he which saith, There could be no salvation for them, according to the ordinary course which God doth use in saving men, granteth plainly, or at the least closely insinuateth, that an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary priviledge of mercy might deliver their souls from Hell, which is more then I required. Secondly, if the foundation be denied, it is denied for fear of some Heresie which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaineth. But how many were there amongst our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who being seduced by the common Error of that Church, never knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Heresies? So that although all Popish Hereticks did perish; thousands of them which lived in Popish Superstitions might be saved. Thirdly, seeing all that held Popish Heresies, did not hold all the Heresies of the Pope: why might not thousands which were infected with other leaven, live and die unsowred with this, and so be saved?</p>

                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:66185:308"/>Fourthly, If they all held this Heresie, many there were that held it, no doubt; but onely in a general form of words,<note place="margin">For this is the only thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of their salvation: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth works with Christ, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the foundation, and unless we hold the foundation, we cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> which a favourable Interpretation might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in a sense differing far enough from the poysoned conceit of Heresie. As for example; Did they hold, that we cannot be saved by Christ without good works? We our selves do, I think, all say as much, with this Construction, salvation being taken as in that sentence, <hi>Corde creditur ad justitiam, Ore fit confessio ad salutem,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Infants and Men, cut off upon the point of their conversion; of the rest none shall see God, but such as seek peace and holiness, though not as a Cause of their salvation, yet as a Way which they must walk which will be saved. Did they hold, that without works we are not justified? Take justification so as it may also imply sanctification, and St. <hi>Iames</hi> doth say as much. For except there be an ambiguity in the same term, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi> do contradict each the other: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. Now there is no ambiguity in the name either of Faith, or of Works, being meant by them both in one and the same sense. Finding therefore, that Justification is spoken of by St <hi>Paul,</hi> without implying Sanctification, when he proveth that a man is justified by faith without works; finding likewise that justification doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time imply sanctification also with it: I suppose nothing to be more sound, then so to interpret St <hi>Iames,</hi> speaking not in that sense, but in this.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. We have already shewed, that there be two kinds of Christian righteousness: the one without us, which we have by imputation; the other in us which consisteth of faith, hope, and charity, and other Christian Vertues: And S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> had not onely the one, because the thing believed was imputed unto him for righteousness; but also the other, because he offered up his Son. God giveth us both the one justice and the other; the one by accepting us for righteous in Christ, the other by working Christian righteousness in us. The proper and most immediate efficient cause in us of this latter is the Spirit of adoption we have received into our hearts. That whereof it consisteth, whereof it is really and formally made, are those infused vertues, proper and peculiar unto Saints, which the Spirit in the very moment when first it is given of God bringeth with it: the effects whereof are such actions as the Apostle doth call the fruits of works, the operation of the Spirit: The difference of the which operations from the root whereof they spring, maketh it needful to put two kinds likewise of sanctifying righteousness, <hi>Habitual,</hi> and <hi>Actual. Habitual,</hi> that holiness, wherewith our souls are inwardly indued, the same instant, when first we begin to be the Temples of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Actual,</hi> that holiness, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beautifieth all the parts and actions of our life, the holiness for which <hi>Enoch, Iob, Zachary, Elizabeth,</hi> and other Saints, are in the Scriptures so highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Did they think that men do merit rewards in heaven, by the works they perform on earth? The Ancients use <hi>meriting</hi> for <hi>obtaining,</hi> and in that sense they of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> have it in their Confession; <hi>We teach that good works commanded of God, are necessarily to be done, and by the free kindness of God they merit their certain rewards.</hi> Therefore speaking as our Fathers did, and we taking their speech, in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

think that rather the damage of the worst construction did light upon them all, then that the blessing of the better was granted unto thousands? Fiftly, if in the worst construction that may be made, they had generally all imbraced it living, might not many of them dying utterly renounce it? Howsoever men when they sit at ease, do vainly tickle their hearts with the vain conceit of I know not what proportionable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence, between their merits and their rewards, which in the trance of their high speculations they dream that God hath measured, weighed, and laid up, as it were in bundles for them: notwithstanding, we see by daily experience, in a number even of them, that when the hour of death approacheth, when they secretly hear themselves summoned forthwith to appear, and stand at the Bar of that Judge, whose brightness causeth the eyes of the Angels themselves to dazel, all these idle imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations do then begin to hide their faces; to name merits then, is to lay their souls upon the rack, the memory of their own deeds is lothsome unto them, they forsake all things, wherein they have put any trust or confidence; no staff to lean upon, no ease, no rest, no comfort then, but onely in Jesus Christ.</p>

Howbeit because I desire, that the truth even in that also should receive light, I will do mine indeavour to set down somewhat more plainly; First, the foundation of Faith, what it is: Secondly, what is directly to deny the foundation: Thirdly whether they whom God hath chosen to be heirs of life, may fall so far as directly to deny it: Fourthly, whether the <hi>Galathians</hi> did so by admitting the error about <hi>Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi>; Last of all, whether the Church of Rome for this one opinion of Works, may be thought to do the like, and thereupon to be no more a Christian Church, than are the Assemblies of Turks and Jews.</p>

A longing therefore to be saved, without understanding the true way how, hath been the cause of all the Superstitions in the World.

should we offer violence unto it? it offereth violence unto us, and we gather strength to withstand it. But I am besides my purpose, when I fall to bewail the cold affection which we bear towards that whereby we should be saved; my purpose being only to set down, what the ground of salvation is. The Doctrine of the Gospel proposeth salvation as the end: And doth it not teach the way of attaining thereunto? Yet the Damosel possest with a spirit of divination, spake the truth:<note place="margin">Acts 16. 17. Heb. 10. 20.</note>

By this foundation the children of God before the written Law were distinguished from the sons of men;<note place="margin">Gen. 49. Job. 19.</note> the reverend Patriarks both possest it living, and spake expresly of it at the hour of their death. It comforted <hi>Iob</hi> in the midst of grief: as it was afterwards the anker-hold of all the righteous in <hi>Israel,</hi> from the writing of the Law, to the time of grace. Every Prophet making mention of it. It was famously spoken of about the time, when the comming of Christ to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the promises, which were made long before it, drew near, that the sound thereof was heard even amongst the Gentiles. When he was come, as many as were his, acknowledged that he was their Salvation; he, that long expected hope of <hi>Israel</hi>; he, that <hi>Seed, in whom all the Nations of the earth shall be blessed.</hi> So that now he is a name of ruine,<note place="margin">Acts 4.18.</note> a name of death and condemnation, unto such as dream of a new <hi>Messias,</hi> to as many as look for salvation by any other but by him. <hi>For amongst men there is given no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved.</hi> Thus much S. <hi>Mark</hi> doth intimate by that, which he doth put in the front of this book, making his entrance with these words: <hi>The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, the Son of God.</hi> His Doctrine he termeth the Gospel, because it teacheth Salvation; the Gospel of Jesus Christ the son of God, because it teacheth salvation by him. This is then the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon the frame of the Gospel is erected; that very Jesus whom the <hi>Virgin</hi> conceived of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 11. 1 Cor. 3.</note> whom <hi>Simeon</hi> imbraced in his arms, whom <hi>Pilat</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, whom the <hi>Iews</hi> crucified, whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> preached, he is Christ, the Lord, the onely Saviour of the World: <hi>Other foundation can no man lay.</hi> Thus I have briefly opened that principle in Christianity, which we call the foundation of our faith. It followeth now that I declare unto you, what is directly to overthrow it. This will be better opened, if we understand, what it is to hold the foundation of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. There are which defend, that many of the Gentiles, who never heard the Name of Christ, held the foundation of Christianity, and why? they acknowledged many of them, the Providence of God, his infinite wisedom, strength, power; his goodness, and his mercy towards the Children of men; that God hath judgment in store for the wicked, but for the righteous, which serve him, rewards, &amp;c. In this which they confessed, that lyeth covered which we believe; in the Rudiments of their knowledge concerning God, the foundation of our Faith concerning Christ, lyeth secretly wrapt up, and is vertually contained: therefore they held the foundation of Faith, though they never had it. Might we not with as good a colour of Reason defend, that every Plowman hath all the Sciences, wherein Philosophers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled? For no man is ignorant of their first Principles, which do vertually contain, whatsoever by natural means is or can be known. Yea, might we not with as great reason affirm, that a man may put three mighty Oaks wheresoever three Akoms may be put? For vertually an Akom is an Oak. To avoid such Paradoxes, we teach plainly, that, To hold the foundation, is, in express terms to acknowledg it.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Now, because the foundation is an affirmative Proposition, they all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, who deny it; they directly overthrow it, who deny it directly; and they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it by consequent, or indirectly, which hold any one assertion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whereupon the direct denial thereof may be necessarily concluded, What is the Question between the Gentiles and Us, but this, <hi>Whether salvation be by Christ</hi>?

This is to be the main point whereupon Christianity standeth, it is clear by that one sentence of <hi>Festus</hi> concerning <hi>Pauls</hi> accusers: <hi>They brought no crime of such things as I supposed, but had certain questions against him of their superstition, and of one

Iesus, which was dead, whom</hi> Paul <hi>affirmed to be alive.</hi> Where we see that Jesus, dead and raised for the Salvation of the World, is by <hi>Iesus</hi> denied, despised by a Gentile, by a Christian Apostle maintained. The Fathers therefore in the Primitive Church when they wrote; <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the book which he called <hi>Apologeticus; Minutius Faelix,</hi> the Book which he intitleth <hi>Octavius, Arnobius</hi>; the seventh books against the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> his Orations against the Jews; <hi>Eusebius,</hi> his ten books of <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical demonstration</hi>: they stand in defence of Christianity against them, by whom the foundation thereof was directly denied. But the writings of the Fathers against <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians, Pelagians,</hi> and other Hereticks of the like note, refel Positions, whereby the foundation of Christian Faith was overthrown by consequent onely. In the former sort of Writings the foundation is proved; in the latter, it is alledged as a proof, which to men that had been known directly to deny, must needs have seemed a very beggerly kind of disputing. All Infidels therefore deny the foundation of Faith direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by consequent, many a Christian man, yea whole Christian Churches have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, and do deny it at this present day. Christian Churches, the foundation of Christianity: not directly, for then they cease to be Christian Churches; but by consequent, in respect whereof we condemn them as erroneous, although for holding the foundation we do and must hold them Christians.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. We see what it is to hold the foundation; what directly, and what by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to deny it. The next thing which followeth, is, whether they whom God hath chosen to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, may once effectually called, and through faith justified truly, afterwards fall so far, as directly to deny the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which their hearts have before imbraced with joy and comfort in the Holy Ghost; for such is the faith, which indeed doth justifie. Devils know the same things which we believe, and the minds of the most ungodly may be fully perswaded of the Truth; which knowledge in the one, and in the other, is sometimes termed faith, but equivocally, being indeed no such faith as that, whereby a Christian man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. It is the Spirit of Adoption, which worketh faith in us, in them not: the things which we believe, are by us apprehended, not onely as true, but also as good and that to us: as good, they are not by them apprehended; as true, they are. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followeth the third difference; the Christian man the more he encreaseth in faith, the more his joy and comfort aboundeth: but they, the more sure they are of the truth, the more they quake and tremble at it. This begetteth another effect, where the hearts of the one sort have a different disposition from the other. <hi>Non ignoro plerosque consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia meritorum, nihil se esse per mortem magis optare quam credere, Malunt cuim ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui penitus, quam ad supplicia reparari.</hi> I am not ignorant, saith <hi>Minutius,</hi> that there be many, who being conscious what they are to look for, do rather wish that they might, then think that they shall cease, when they cease to live; because they hold it better that death should consume them unto nothing, then God revive them unto punishment. So it is in other Articles of Faith, whereof wicked men think, no doubt, many times they are too true: On the contrary side, to the other, there is no grief or torment greater, then to feel their perswasion weak in things<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> whereof when they are perswaded, they reap such comfort and joy of spirit: such is the faith whereby we are justified; such, I mean, in respect of the quality. For touching the principal object of Faith, longer then it holdeth the foundation whereof we have spoken, it neither justifieth, nor is, but ceaseth to be faith; when it ceaseth to believe, that Jesus Christ is the onely Saviour of the World. The cause of life spiritual in us, is Christ, not carnally or corporally inhabiting, but dwelling in the soul of man, as a thing which (when the minde apprehendeth it) is said to inhabite or possess the minde. The minde conceiveth Christ by hearing the Doctrine of Christianity, as the light of Nature doth the minde to apprehend those truths which are meerly rational, so that saving truth, which is far above the reach of Humane Reason, cannot otherwise, then by the Spirit of the Almighty, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, All these are implied, wheresoever any of them is mentioned as the cause of the spiritual life.

Every errour in things appertaining unto God, is repugnant unto Faith; every fearful cogitation, unto hope; unto love, every stragling inordinate desire; unto holiness, every blemish wherewith either the inward thoughts of our mindes, or the outward actions of our lives are stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But heresie, such as that of <hi>Ebion, Gerinthus,</hi> and others, against whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were forced to bend themselves, both by word, and also by writing; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining discouragement of heart, which tempteth God, whereof we have Israel in the Desart for a pattern; coldness, such as that in the Angels of <hi>Ephesus</hi>; soul sins, known to be expresly against the first, or second table of the Law, such as <hi>Noah, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses, David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> committed: These are each in their kind so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the former vertues, that they leave no place for salvation without an actual repentance.

Whereupon I conclude, that although in the first kind, no man liveth,

Directly to deny the foundation of Faith, is plain Infidelity; where Faith is entred, there Infidelity is for ever excluded: Therefore by him which hath once sincerely believed in Christ, the foundation of Christian Faith can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be directly denied? Did not <hi>Peter?</hi> Did not <hi>Marcellinus?</hi> Did not others both directly deny Christ, after that they had believed; and again believe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had denied? No doubt, as they confesse in words, whose Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nevertheless their not believing: (for example we have <hi>Iudas</hi>:) So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisewise, they may believe in Heart, whose Condemnation, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is their not Confessing. Although therefore, <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest, for whose Faith Christ hath prayed, that it might not fail, did not by denial, sinne the Sinne of Infidelity, which is an inward abnegation of Christ; (for if they had done this, their Faith had clearly failed:) Yet, because they sinned notoriously and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously, committing that which they knew to be expresly forbidden by the Law, which saith, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve,</hi> necessary it was, that he which purposed to save their Souls, should, as he did touch their Hearts with true unfeigned repentance, that his mercy might restore them again to life, whom Sinne had made the children of Death and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Touching the point therefore, I hope I may safely set down, that if the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied erre, as he may, and never come to understand his errour, God doth save him through general repentance: But if he fall into Heresie, he calleth him at one time or other by actual repentance; but from Infidelity, which is an inward direct deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the foundation, he preserveth him by special providence for ever. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may easily know, what to think of those <hi>Galatians,</hi> whose hearts were so possest with the love of the Truth, that, if it had been possible, they would have pluckt out their eyes to bestow upon their Teachers. It is true, that they were greatly<note n="*" place="margin">Howsoever men be changed (for changed they may be, even the best amongst men) if they that have received, as it seemeth some of the <hi>Galatians</hi> which fell into errour, not received the Gifts and Graces of God, which are called, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, such as Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are, which God doth never take away from him, to whom they are given, as less repented him to have given them; if such might be so farr changed by errour, as that the very root of Faith should be quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in them, and so their Salvation utterly lost: It would shake the hearts of the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and stoutest of us all. See this contrary in <hi>Beza</hi> his observations upon the harmony of Confessions.</note> changed, both in perswasion and affection: so that the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote unto them, were not now the <hi>Galatians</hi> which they had been in former time, for that through errour they wandred, although they were his sheep, I do not deny, but that I should deny, that they were his sheep, if I should grant, that through errour they perished. It was a perilous opinion that they held, perilous even in them that held it only as an Errour, because it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the foundation by consequent. But in them which obstinately maintain it, I cannot think it less than a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresie. We must therefore put a difference between them which erre of ignorance, retaining neverthelesse a mind desirous to be instructed in Truth, and them, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Truth is laid open, persist in the stubborn defence of their blindness. Heretical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, froward and stiff-necked Teachers of Circumcision, the blessed Apostle calls Doggs: Silly men, who were seduced to think they taught the Truth, he pitieth, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up in his arms, he lovingly imbraceth, he kisseth, and with more than fatherly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness doth so temper, qualifie, and correct the speech he useth towards them, that a man cannot easily discern, whether did most abound, the love which he bare to to their godly Affection, or the grief which the danger of their Opinion bred him. Their Opinion was dangerous; was not theirs also, who thought the Kingdome of Christ should be Earthly? was not theirs, which thought the Gospel onely should be preached to the Jewes? What more opposite to Prophetical Doctrine, concerning the comming of Christ, than the one? concerning the Catholick Church, than the other? Yet they which had these Fancies, even when they had them, were not the worst men in the World. The Heresie of <hi>Free-will</hi> was a milstone about the <hi>Pelagians</hi> neck; shall we therefore give Sentence of Death inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table against all those Fathers in the Greek Church, which being mis-perswaded,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:66185:311"/>
dyed in the Errour of <hi>Free-will?</hi> Of these <hi>Galatians</hi> therefore, which first were justified, and then deceived, as I can see no cause, why as many as dyed before admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, might not by mercy be received, even in errour; so I make no doubt, but as many as lived till they were admonished, found the mercy of God effectual in converting them from their<note n="a" place="margin">Error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards maintained, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> more than errour; for although opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be the same it was, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I still call it errour, yet they are not now the same they were when they are taught what the Truth is, and plainly raught.</note> errour, lest any one that is Christ's should perish. Of this I take it, there is no Controversie: Only against the Salvation of them that dyed, though before admonition, yet in errour, it is objected; that their opinion was a very plain direct denial of the foundation. If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had been so perswaded, they would haply have used the terms otherwise, speaking of the Masters themselves, who did first set that errour abroach,<note n="b" place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> Certain of the Sect of the Pharisees which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. What difference was there between these Pharisees, and other Pharisees, from whom, by a special description they are distinguished, but this? These which came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> teaching the necessity of Circumcision, were Christians; the other, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christianity. Why then should these be tenned so distinctly Believers, if they did directly deny the foundation of our Belief; besides which, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that made the rest to be no Believers? We need go no farther than Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s very reasoning against them, for proof of this matter; Seeing you know God, or rather are known of God? how turn you again to impotent Rudiments? the<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 4.14.15.</note> Law engendreth Servants, her Children are in bondage:<note n="d" place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> They which are begotten by the Gospel, are free.<note n="e" place="margin">Vers. 21.</note> Brethren, we are not Children of the Servant, but of the Free-woman, and will ye yet be under the Law? That they thought it unto Salvation necessary, for the Church of Christ to<note n="f" place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> observe dayes, and months, and times, and years, to keep the Ceremonies and Sacraments of the Law, this was their errour. Yet he which condemneth their errour, confesseth, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, they knew God, and were known of him; he taketh not the honour from them to be termed Sonnes, begotten of the immortal seed of the Gospel. Let the heaviest words which he useth, be weighed; consider the drift of those dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conclusions: <hi>If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing: As many as are justified by the Law, are fallen from Grace.</hi> It had been to no purpose in the World so to urge them, had not the Apostle been perswaded, that at the hearing of such Sequels, <hi>No benefit by Christ, a defection from Grace,</hi> their hearts would tremble and quake within them: And why? because that they knew, that in Christ, and in Grace, their Salvation lay, which is a plain direct acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Foundation. Lest I should herein seem to hold that which no one learned or godly hath done, let these words be considered, which import as much as I affirm.<note place="margin">

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it had been needlesse for Saint Paul to admonish them, not to condemn such as eat without scrupulosity, whatsoever was set before them. This errour, if you weigh what it is of it self, did at once overthrow all Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are taught Salvation by Faith in Christ, all that ever the Prophets did soretell, all that ever the Apostles did preach of Christ, it drew with it the denial of Christ utterly: Insomuch, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, that his labour was lost upon the <hi>Galatians,</hi> unto whom this errour was obtruded, affirming, that Christ, if so be they were circumcised, should not profit them any thing at all. Yet so farr was Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from striking their names out of Christ's book, that he commandeth others to entertain them, to accept with singular humanity, to use them like Brethren: he knew man's imbecillity, he had a feeling of our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which are mortal men, how great it is, and being sure that they are the Sonnes of God whosoever be endued with his fear, would not have them count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemies of that whereunto they could not as yet frame themselves to be Friends, but did ever upon a very Religious affection to the Truth, willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the truth. They acknowledged Christ to be their onely and perfect Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but saw not how repugnant their believing the necessity of Mosaical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies was to their Faith in Jesus Christ. Hereupon a reply is made, that if they had not directly denied the foundation, they might have been saved; but saved
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:66185:311"/>
they could not be, therefore their opinion was, not onely by consequent, but directly; a denial of the foundation. When the question was about the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Salvation, their denying of the foundation was brought to prove, that they could not be saved: now, that the Question is about their denial of the foundation, the impossibility of their Salvation is alledged to prove, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the foundation. Is there nothing which excludeth men from Salvation, but onely the foundation of Faith denied? I should have thought, that, besides this, many other things are death unto as many as understanding that to cleave thereunto, was to fall from Christ, did notwithstanding cleave unto them. But of this enough.

How farr Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Heresies may prevail over God's Elect, how many God hath kept falling into them, how many have been converted from them, is not the question now in hand: for if Heaven had not received any one of that coat for these thousand years, it may still be true, that the Doctrine which this day they do professe, doth not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the foundation, and so prove them simply to be no Christian Church.

Works are an addition: Be it so, what then? the foundation is not subverted by every kinde of addition: Simply to adde unto those fundamental words, is not to mingle Wine with Water, Heaven and Earth, things polluted with the sanctified blood of Christ: Of which Crime, indict them which attribute those operations in whole or in part to any Creature, which in the work of our Salvation wholly are peculiar unto Christ; and If I open my mouth to speak in their defence, if I hold my peace, and plead not against them as long as breath is within my Body, let me be guilty of all the dishonor that ever hath been done to the Son of God. But the more dreadful a thing it is to deny salvation by Christ alone, the more slow and fearful I am, except it be too manifest, to lay a thing so grievous to any man's charge. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, lest if we make too many ways of denying Christ, we scarce leave any way for our selves truly and soundly to confess him. Salvation only by Christ is the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereupon indeed Christianity standeth. But what if I say, You cannot besaved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Christ, without this addition, Christ believed in heart, confessed with mouth, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in life and conversation? Because I adde, do I therefore deny that which I did direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm? There may be an additament of explication, which overthroweth not, but proveth and concludeth the Proposition, whereunto it is annexed. He which saith, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was a Chief Apostle, doth prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was an Apostle: He which saith, Our Salvation is of the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 1. 13.</note> through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Faith of the Truth, proveth that our Savation is of the Lord. But if that which is added be such a privation as taketh away the very essence of that whereunto it is added, then by the sequel it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth it. He which saith, <hi>Iudas</hi> is a dead man, though in word he granteth <hi>Iudas</hi> to be a man, yet in effect he proveth him by that very speech no man, because death depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him of being. In like sort, he that should say, our Election is of Grace for our Works sake,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> should grant in sound of words; but indeed by consequent deny that our Election is of Grace; for the Grace which electeth us, is no Grace, if it elect us for our Works sake.</p>

This only was a ledged against me? and need I touch more than was all edged?</note> Works is not like the adding of Circumcision unto Christ, Christ came not to abrogate and put away good Works: he did, to change Circumcision, for we see that in place thereof, he hath substituted holy Baptism. To say, Ye cannot be saved by Christ, except ye be circumcised, is to adde a thing excluded, a thing not only not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be kept, but necessary not to be kept by them that will be saved. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, to say, Ye cannot be saved by Christ without Works, is to add things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not excluded, but commanded, as being in their place, and in their kinde necessary, and therefore subordinated unto Christ, by Christ himself, by whom the web of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is spun:<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note>

But we say, our Salvation is by Christ alone; therefore howsoever, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we adde unto Christ in the matter of Salvation, we overthrow Christ. Our Case were very hard, if this Argument, so universally meant as it is proposed, were sound and good. We our selves do not teach Christ alone, excluding our own Faith, unto Justification; Christ alone, excluding our own Works, unto Sanctification; Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, excluding the one or the other unnecessary unto Salvation. It is a childish Cavil wherewith in the matter of Justification, our Adversaries do so greatly please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, exclaiming, that we tread all Christian vertues under our feet, and require nothing in Christians but Faith, because we teach that Faith alone justifieth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by this speech we never meant to excluded either Hope or Charity from being always joyned as inseparable Mates with Faith in the man that is justified; or Works from being added as necessary Duties, required at the hands of every justified man: But to shew that Faith is the onely hand which putteth on Christ unto Justification; and Christ the onely Garment, which, being so put on, covereth the shame of our defiled natures, hideth the imperfection of our Works, preserveth us blameless in the sight of God, before whom otherwise, the weaknesse of our Faith were cause sufficent to make us culpable, yea, to shut us from the Kingdom of Heaven, where nothing that is not absolute can enter. That our dealing with them he not as childish as theirs with us: when we hear of Salvation by Christ alone, considering that [<hi>alone</hi>] as an exclusive Particle, we are to note what it doth exclude, and where. If I say, <hi>Such a Iudge onely ought to determine such a case,</hi> all things incident to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, besides the Person of the Judge, as Laws, Depositions, Evidences, &amp;c. are not hereby excluded; Persons are not excluded from witnessing herein, or assisting, but onely from determining and giving Sentence. How then is our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought by Christ alone: Is it our meaning, that nothing is requisite to man's Salvation but Christ to save, and he to be saved quietly without any more adoe? No, we acknowledge no such Foundation. As we have received, so we teach, that besides the bare and naked work, wherein Christ without any other Associate, finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the parts of our Redemption, and purchased Salvation himself alone; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of this eminent blessing unto us, many things are of necessity required, as to be known and chosen of God before the foundation of the World; in the World to be called, justified, sanctified; after we have lest the World, to be received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory; Christ in every of these hath somewhat which he worketh alone. Through him, according to the Eternal purpose of God,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 7. 15.</note> before the foundation of the World, Born, Crucified, Buried, Raised, &amp;c. we were in a gracious acceptation known unto God, long before we were seen of men: God knew us, loved us, was kinde to us in Jesus Christ, in him we were elected to be Heirs of Life. Thus farr God through Christ hath wrought in such sort alone, that our selves are mere Patients, working no more than dead and senseless Matter, Wood, Stone, or Iron, doth in the Artificers hands; no more than Clay, when the Potter appointeth it to be framed for an honourable use; nay, not so much: for the matter whereupon the Craftsman worketh he chuseth, being moved by the fitness which is in it to serve his turn; in us no such thing. Touching the rest which is laid for the foundation of our Faith, it importeth farther, That<note n="a" place="margin">Gal 3. 8.</note> by him we are called, that we have<note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9. and 5 3.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,<note n="c" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 7.</note> Remission of sins through his<note n="d" place="margin">Isa. 53. 11.

Howbeit, not so by him alone, as if in us to our<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 2. 16. end 3. 3. 2 Thess. 2. 13.</note> Vocation, the hearing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; to our Justification, Faith; to our Sanctification, the fruits of the Spirit; to our entrance into rest, perseverance in Hope, in Faith, in Holinesse, were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>

Then what is the fault of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Not that she requireth Works at their hands which will be saved: but that she attributeth unto Works a power of satisfying God for Sinne; yea, a vertue to merit both Grace here, and in Heaven Glory. That this overthroweth the foundation of Faith, I grant willingly; that it is a direct elenyal thereof, Iutterly deny: What it is to hold, and what directly to deny the foundation of Faith. I have already opened. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it particularly to this Cause, and there needs no more adoe. The thing
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:66185:313"/>
which is handled, if the form under which it is handled be added thereunto, it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the foundation of any Doctrine whatsoever. Christ is the Matter whereof the Doctrin of the Gospel treateth; and it treateth of Christ, as of a Saviour. Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore by Christ is the foundation of Christianity: as for works, they are a thing subordinate, no otherwise than because our Sanctification cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished without them: The Doctrine concerning them is a thing builded upon the foundation; therefore the Doctrin which addeth unto them the power of satisfying, or of meriting, addeth unto a thing sabordinated, builded upon the foundation, not to the very foundation it self; yet is the foundation by this addition consequently overthrown, forasmuch as out of this addition it may be negatively concluded, He which maketh any work good, and acceptable in the sight of God, to proceed from the natural freedom of our will; he which giveth unto any good works of ours, the force of satisfying the wrath of God for sinne, the power of meriting either earthly or heavenly rewards; he which holdeth Works going before our Vocation, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to merit our Vocation. Works following our first, to merit our second Justification, and by condignity our last Reward in the Kingdom of Heaven, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up the Doctrin of Faith by the roots, for out of every of these, the plain direct denial thereof may be necessarily concluded. Not this onely, but what other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is there, that doth not raze the very foundation of Faith by consequent? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we make a difference of Heresies; accounting them in the next degree to infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which directly deny any one thing to be, which is expresly acknowledged in the Articles of our Belief; for out of any one Article so denied, the denial of the very foundation it self is straightway inferred.

                     <hi>If thou dost deny our Lord Iesus Christ, in denying the Son, thou canst not choose but deny the Father; for, according to the voyce of the Father himself,</hi> He that hath not the Son, hath not the Father. <hi>Wherefore denying, him which is begotten, thou deniest him which doth beget. Again, denying the Son of God to have been born in the Flesh, how canst thou believe him to have suffered? believing not his Passion, what remaineth, but that thou deny his Resurrection? For we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him not raised, except we first believe him dead: Neither can the reason of his rising from the dead stand, without the faith of his death going before. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of his Death and Passion, inserreth the denial of his Rising from the Depth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth, that thou also deny his Ascension into Heaven. The Apostle affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> That he which ascended, did first descend; <hi>so that, as much as lieth in thee, our Lord Iesus Christ hath neither risen from the depth, nor is ascended into Heaven, nor sitteth on the right hand of God the Father, neither shall be come at the day of the final account which is looked for, nor shall judge the Quick and the Dead. And da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thou yet set foot in the Church? Canst thou think thy self a Bishop, when thou hast denied all those things whereby thou dost obtain a Bishoply Calling?

The <hi>Pelogians</hi> being over-great friends unto Nature, made themselves Enemies unto Grace, for all their confessing, that men have their Souls, and all the faculties thereof, their wills, and all the ability of their wills from God. And is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> still an Adversary unto
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:66185:314"/>
Christ's Merits, because of her acknowledging, that we have received the power of meriting by the blood of Christ: Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> setteth down the odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the matter of Works,<note place="margin">In his Book of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> thus. <hi>Like as we grant them, that no good work of man is rewardable in Heaven of its own nature, but through the meer goodnesse of God, that lists in set so high a price upon so poor a thing; and that this price God setteth through Christ's Passion, and for that also they be his own Works with us; for good works to God-word worketh no man, without God work in him: and as we grant them also, that no man may be proud of his works, for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect working; and for that in all that man may doe; he can doe God no good, but is a Servant unprofitable, and doth but his bare duty: as we, I say, grant unto them these things, so this one things or twain doe they grant us again, That men are bound to work good works, if they have time and power; and that whose worketh in true faith most, shall be most rewarded: but then set they thereto. That all his Rewards shall be given him for his Faith alone, and nothing for his Works at all, because his Faith is the thing, they say, that forceth him to work well.</hi> I see by this of Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> how easie it is for men of the greatest capacity, to mistake things written or spoken, as well on the one side as on the other. Their Doctrine, as he thought, maketh the work of man rewardable in the World to come, through the goodnesse of God, whom it pleased to set so high a price upon so poor a thing: and ours, that a man doth receive that eternal and high reward, not for his Works, but for his Faiths sake, by which he worketh: whereas in truth our Doctrine is no other than that we have learned at the feet of Christ; namely, That God doth justifie the believing man, yet not for the worthinesse of his belief, but for the worthinesse of him which is believed; God rewardeth abundantly every one which worketh, yet not for any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious dignity which is, or can be in the Work, but through his mere mercy by whose Commandment he worketh. Contrariwise, their Doctrine is, That as pure Water of it self hath no savour, but if it passe through a sweet Pipe, it taketh a pleasant smell of the Pipe through which it passeth: so, although before Grace received, our Works doe neither satisfie nor merit; yet after, they doe both the one and the other. Every vertuous Action hath then power in such to satisfie; that if we our selves commit no mortal sinne, no hainous crime, whereupon to spend this treasure of satisfaction in our own behalf, it turneth to the benefit of other mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease, on whom it shall please the Steward of the House of God to bestow it; so that we may satisfie for our selves and others; but merit onely for our selves. In me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting, our Actions do work with two hands;<note place="margin">Works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peretogation.</note> with one they get their morning sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, the encrease of Grace; with the other their evening hire, the everlasting Crown of Glory. Indeed they teach, that our good Works doe not these things as they come from us, but as they come from Grace in us; which Grace in us is another thing in their Divinity, than is the mere goodnesse of God's mercy towards us in Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. If it were not a long deluded Spirit which hath possession of their Hearts; were it possible but that they should see how plainly they doe herein gain-say the very ground of Apostolick Faith? Is this that Salvation by Grace, whereof so plentiful menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made in the Scriptures of God? Was this their meaning, which first taught the World to look for Salvation onely by Christ? By Grace, the Apostle saith, and by Grace in such sort as a Gift: a thing that commeth not of our selves, nor of our Works, lest any man should boast, and say, <hi>I have wrought out my own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> By Grace they confesse; but by Grace in such sort, that as many as wear the Diadem of Blisse, they wear nothing but what they have won. The Apostle, as if he had foreseen how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would abuse the World in time, by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous terms, to declare in what sense the name of Grace must be taken, when we make it the cause of our Salvation, saith, <hi>He saved us according to his mercy</hi>: which mercy, although it exclude not the washing of our new birth, the renewing of our Hearts by the Holy Ghost, the Means, the Vertues, the Duties which God requireth of our hands which shall be saved; yet it is so repugnant unto Merits, that to say, We are saved for the worthiness of any thing which is ours, is to deny we are saved by Grace. Grace bestoweth freely; and therefore justly requireth the glory of that which is bestowed. We deny the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; we
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:66185:314"/>
abuse, disanul, and annihilate the benefit of his bitter passion, if we test in these proud imaginations, that life is deservedly ours, that we merit it, and that we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Howbeit, considering how many vertuous and just men, how many Saints, how many Martyrs, how many of the Antient Fathers of the Church, have had their sundry perilous Opinions: and amongst sundry of their Opinions this, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to make God some part of amends for their sinnes, by the voluntary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they laid upon themselves, because by a Consequent it may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereupon, that they were injurious unto Christ: shall we therefore make such deadly Epitaphs, and set them upon their Graves, <hi>They denied the foundation of Faith directly, they are damned, there is no Salvation for them?</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith of himself, <hi>Errare passum, Hareticus isse nolo.</hi> And, except we put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that erre, and them that obstinately persist in Errour, how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that ever any man should hope to be saved? Surely, in this Case, I have no respect of any Person either alive or dead. Give me a man, of what estate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soever, yea, a Cardinal or a Pope, whom in the extreme point of his life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hath made to know himself, whose heart God hath touched with true sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for all his sinnes, and filled with love towards the Gospel of Christ, whose eyes are opened to see the Truth, and his mouth to renounce all Heresie and Errour, any wise opposite thereunto: This one opinion of Merits excepted, he thinketh God will require at his hands, and because he wanteth, therefore trembleth, and is discouraged; it may be I am forgetful, and unskilful, not furnished with things new and old, as a wise and learned Scribe should be, nor able to alledge that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, if it were alledged, he doth hear a minde most williing to yield, and so to be recalled, as well from this, as from other Errours: And shall I think, because of this onely Errour, that such a man toucheth not so much as the hem of Christ's garment? If he do, Wherefore should not I have hope, that vertue may proceed from Christ to save him? Because his Errour doth by consequent overthrow his Faith, shall I therefore cast him off, as one that hath utterly cast off Christ? one that holdeth not so much as by a slender thred? No, I will not be afraid to say unto a Pope or Cardinal in this plight, Be of good comfort, we have to do with a merciful God, ready to make the best of a little which we hold well, and not with a captious Sophister. which gathereth the worst out of every thing wherein we erre. Is there any Reason, that I should be suspected, or you offended for this speech? Is it a dangerous thing to imagine that such men may finde mercy?<note place="margin">Let all Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be laid aside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Let the Matter indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently be considered.</note> The hour may come, when we shall think it a blessed thing to hear, that if our sinnes were the sinnes of the Pope and Cardinals, the bowels of the mercy of God are larger. I do propose unto you a Pope with the neck of an Emperour under his feet; a Cardinal, riding his horse to the bridle in the blood of Saints: but a Pope or a Cardinal sorrowful, penitent, dis-robed, stript, not onely of usurpec' power, but also delivered and recalled from Error and Antichrist, converted and lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate at the foot of Christ: and shall I think that Christ shall spurn at him? and shall I cross and gain-say the merciful promises of God, generally made unto penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by opposing the name of a Pope or Cardinal? What difference is there in the world between a Pope and a Cardinal, and <hi>Iohn a Stile</hi> in this Case? If we think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them, if they be once come within that rank, to be afterwards touched with any such remorse, let that he granted. The Apostle saith, <hi>If I, or an Angel from heaven preach unto, &amp;c.</hi> Let it be as likely, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or an Angel from Heaven should preach Heresie, as that a <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Cardinal</hi> should be brought so farr forth to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth: yet if a <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Cardinal</hi> should, what finde we in their Persons why they might not be saved? It is not the Persons you will say, but the Errour wherein I suppose them to dye, which excludeth them from the hope of mercy, the opinion of merits doth take away all possibility of Salvation from them. What if they hold it onely as an Errour? Although they hold the truth truly and sincerely in all other parts of Christian Faith? Although they have in some measure all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces of the Spirit, all other tokens of God's Elect Children in them? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be farr from having any proud presumptuous opinion; that they shall be saved by the worthiness of their deeds? Although the onely thing which troubleth
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:66185:315"/>
and molested them, be but a little too much dejection, somewhat too great a fear, rising from an erroneous conceit, that God would require a worthinesse in them, which they are grieved to finde wanting in themselves? Although they be not obstinate in this perswasion? Although they be willing, and would be glad to forsake it, if any one reason were brought sufficient to dispove it? Although the onely lett, why they doe not forsake it ere they dye, be the ignorance of the means, by which it might be disproved? Although the cause why the ignorance in this point is not removed, be the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in such us should be able, and are not, to remove it? Let me dye, if ever it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that simply an Errour doth exclude a Pope or a Cardinal in such a case, utterly from hope of life. Surely, I must confesse unto you, if it be an Errour, that God may be merciful to save men even when they erre, my greatest Comfort is my Errour; were it not for the love I bear unto this Errour. I would never wish to speak, nor to live.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Wherefore to resume that mother-Sentence, whereof I little thought that so much trouble would have grown, <hi>I doubt not but that God was merciful to save thousands of our Fathers, living in Papish. Superstitions, inasmuch as they sinned ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly.</hi> Alas! what bloody matter is there contained in this Sentence, that it should be an occasion of so many hard Censures? Did I say, that <hi>thousands of our Fathers might be saved?</hi> I have shewed which way it cannot be denied. Did I say, <hi>I doubt not but they were saved?</hi> I see no impiety in this Perswasion, though I had no reason for it. Did I say, <hi>Their ignorance did make me hope they did finde mercy, and so were saved</hi>? What hindreth Salvation but Sinne? Sinnes are not equal; and Ignorance, though it doth not make Sinne to be no Sinne, yet seeing it did make their sinne the less, why should it not make our hope concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their life, the greater? We pity the most, and doubt not but God hath most compassion over them that sinne for want of understanding. As much is confessed by sundry others, almost in the self-same words which I have used. It is but onely my evil hap, that the same Sentences which savour Verity in other mens books, should seem to bolster Heresie, when they are once by me recited. If I be deceived in this point, not they, but the blessed Apostle hath deceived me. What I said of others, the same he said of himself, <hi>I obtained mercy for I did it ignorantly.</hi> Construe his words, and you cannot misconstrue mine. I spake no otherwise, I meant no otherwise, than he did.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Thus have I brought the question concerning our Fathers, at length, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an end. Of whose estate, upon so fit an occasion as was offered me, handling the weighty causes of separation between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us, and the weak motives which are commonly brought to retain men in that Society; amongst which motives, the examples of our Fathers deceased is one; although I saw it convenient to utter the Sentence which I did, to the end that all men might thereby understand, how untruly we are said to condemn as many as have been before us otherwise perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than we our selves are; yet more than that one Sentence, I did not think it expedient to utter, judging it a great deal meeter for us to have regard to our own estate, than to sift over-curiously what is become of other men. And fearing, left that such questions as these, if voluntarily they should be too farr waded in, might seem worthy of that rebuke, which our Saviour thought needfull in a case not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, <hi>What is this unto thee?</hi> When I was forced, much beside my expectation, to render a reason of my speech, I could not but yield at the Call of others, and proceed so farr as Duty bound me, for the fuller satisfying of mindes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have walked, as with Reverence, so with Fear: with Reverence, inregard of our Fathers, which lived in former times; not without Fear, considering them that are alive.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. I am not ignorant, how ready men are to feed and sooth up themselves in evil. Shall I (will the man say, that loveth the present World, more than he loveth Christ) shall I incurr the high displeasure of the mightiest upon Earth? Shall I hazard my Goods, endanger my Estate, put my self into jeopardy, rather than to yield to that which so many of my Fathers imbraced, and yet found favour in the sight of God,? <hi>Curse ye Meroz,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>curse bar Inhabitants, because they helped not the Lord, they helped him not against the Mighty.</hi> If I should not onely not help the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:66185:315"/>
Lord against the Mighty, but help to strengthen them that are mighty, against the Lord; worthily might I fall under the burthen of that Curse, worthy I were to bear to bear my own Judgement: But, if the Doctrine which I reach, be a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gathered in the Garden of the Lord; a part of the saying Truth of the Gospel: from whence notwithstanding, poysonous Creatures do suck-venom: I can but wish it were otherwise, and content my self with the lord that hath befallen me, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because it hath not befallen me alone. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught a Truth, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truth, when he taught, that the greater our misery is, in respect of our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, the readier is the mercy of God for our release. If we seek unto him, the more we have sinned, the more praise, and glory, and honour unto him that pardoneth our sinne. But mark what sewd Collections were made hereupon by some: <hi>Why then am I condemned for a Sinner?</hi> And the Apostle (as we are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and as some affirm that we say, <hi>Why doe we not evil that good may come of it?</hi>) he was accused to teach that which ill-disposed People did gather by his teaching, though it were clean not onely besides, but against his meaning. The Apostle addeth, <hi>Their Condemnation</hi> (which thus doe) <hi>is just.</hi> I am not hasty to apply Sentences of Condemnation. I wish from mine Heart their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whosoever are thus perversly affected. For I must needs say, Their Case is fearful, their Estate dangerous, which harden themselves, presuming on the mercy of God towards others. It is true, that God is merciful, but let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of presumptuous sinnes. God delivered <hi>Ionah</hi> from the bottome of the Sea, will you therefore cast your selves head-long from the tops of Rocks, and say in your Hearts, God shall deliver us? He pitieth the Blinde that would gladly see; but will he pity him that may see, and hardeneth himself in blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? No, Christ hath spoken too much unto you, to claim the priviledge of your Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. As for us that have handled this Cause concerning the condition of our Fathers, whether it be this thing or any other, which we bring unto you, the Counsel is good which the Wise man giveth, <hi>Stand thou fast in thy sure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, in the way and knowledge of the Lord, and have but one manner of word, and follow the Word of peace and righteousnesse.</hi> As a loose tooth is a grief to him that eateth: so doth a wavering and unstable word in speech, that tendeth to instruction, offend. <hi>Shall a wise man speak words of the winde,</hi> saith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> leight, unconstant, unstable words? Surely the wisest may speak words of the winde, such is the untoward Constitution of our nature, that we doe neither so perfectly understand the way and knowledge of the Lord, nor so sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly imbrace it when it is understood; nor so graciously utter it, when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; not so peaceably maintain it, when it is uttered; but that the best of us are over-taken sometime through blindenesse, sometime through hastinesse, sometime through impatience, sometimes through other passions us the minde, whereunto (God doth know) we are too subject. We must therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented both to pardon others, and to crave that others may pardon us for such things. Let no man, that speaketh as a man, think himself, while he liveth, alwayes freed from scapes and over-sights in his speech. The things themselves which I have spoken unto you are sound, howsoever they have seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed otherwise unto some: at whose hands I have, in that respect, received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. I willingly forget it: although indeed, considering the benefit which I have reaped by this necessary speech of Truth, I rather incline to that of the Apostle, <hi>They have not injured me at all.</hi> I have cause to wish them as many Blessings in the Kingdom of Heaven, as they have forced me to utter words and syllables in this Cause; wherein I could not be more sparing of speech than I have been. <hi>It becommeth no man,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ierom, to be patient in the crime of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi> Patient, as I take it, we should be alwayes, though the crime of Heresie were intended; but silent in a thing of so great Consequence I could not, beloved, I durst not be; especially the love which I bear to the truth of Christ Jesus, being hereby some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what called in question. Whereof I beseech them in the meeknesse of Christ, that have been the first original cause, to consider that a Watch-man may cry (<hi>an Enemy</hi>) when indeed a Friend commeth. In which Cause, as I deem such a Watch-man more
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:66185:316"/>
worthy to be loved for his Care, than mis-liked for his Errour: So I have judged it my own part in this, as much as in me lyeth, to take away all suspition of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly intent or meaning against the Truth, from which, God doth know, my heart is free.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Now to you, Beloved, which have heard these things, I will use no other words of admonition, than those that are offered me by St. <hi>Iames, My Brethren, have not the Faith of our glorious Lord Iesus, in respect of Persons.</hi> Ye are not now to learn. that as of it self it is not hurtful, so neither should it be to any scandalous and offensive in doubtful cases, to hear the different judgments of men. Be it that <hi>Cephas</hi> hath hath one interpretation, and <hi>Apollos</hi> hath another; that <hi>Paul</hi> is of this minde, and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> of that; if this offend you, the fault is yours.

                  <p>THE nature of Man being much more delighted to be led than drawn, doth many times stubbornly resist Authority, when to Perswasion it easily yieldeth. Whereupon the Wisest Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers have endeavoured always, that those Laws might seem most reasonable, which they would have most inviolably kept. A Law simply commanding or forbidding, is but dead in comparison of that which expresseth the reason wherefore it doth the one or the other. And surely, even in the Laws of God, although that he hath given Commandment, be in it self a reason sufficient to exact all obedience at the hands of men; yet a forcible inducement it is to obey with greater alacrity and chearfulnesse of minde, when we see plainly, that nothing is imposed more than we must needs yield unto, except we will be unreasonable. In a word, whatsoever be taught, be it Precept for direction of our Manners; or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle for instruction of our Faith; or document any way for information of our mindes, it then taketh root and abideth, when we conceive not onely what God doth speak, but why. Neither is it a small thing, which we derogate as well from the honour of his
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:66185:317"/>
Truth, as from the comfort, joy and delight which we our selves should take by it, when we loosely slide over his speech, as though it were as our own is, commonly vulgar and trivial: Whereas he uttereth nothing but it hath, besides the substance of Doctrine delivered, a depth of wisdom, in the very choice and frame of words to deliver it in: The reason whereof being not perceived; but by greater inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of brain, than our nice mindes for the most part can well away with, fain we would bring the World, if we might, to think it but a needless curiosity, to rip up any thing further than extemporal readness of wit doth serve to reach unto. Which course, if here we did list to follow, we might tell you, that in the first branch of this Sentence, God doth condemn the <hi>Babylonian</hi>'s pride; and in the second teach, what happiness of state shall grow to the righteous by the constancy of their Faith, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the troubles which now they suffer; and after certain notes of wholsome instruction hereupon collected, pass over without detaining your mindes in any further removed speculation. But, as I take it, there is a difference between the talk that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth Nurses among Children, and that which men of Capacity and Judgment do or should receive instruction by.</p>
                  <p>The minde of the Prophet being erected with that which hath been hitherto spoken, receiveth here for full satisfaction a short abridgement of that which is afterwards more particularly unfolded. Wherefore as the question before disputed of doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern two sorts of men, the Wicked flourishing as the Bay, and the righteous like the withered Grass, the one full of pride, the other cast down with utter discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so the answer which God doth make for resolution of doubts hereupon arisen, hath reference unto both sorts, and this present sentence containing a brief Abstract thereof comprehendeth summarily as well the fearful estate of iniquity over-exalted, as the hope laid up for righteousness opprest. In the former branch of which Sentence, let us first examine what this rectitude or straitness importeth, which God denieth to be in the minde of the <hi>Babylonian.</hi> All things which God did create, he made them at the first, true, good, and right. True, in respect of correspondence unto that pattern of their Being, which was eternally drawn in the Counsel of God's fore-knowledge; Good, in regard of the use and benefit which each thing yieldeth unto other; Right, by an'apt conformity of all parts with that end which is outwardly proposed for each thing to tend unto. Other things have ends proposed, but have not the faculty to know, judge, and esteem of them, and therefore as they tend thereunto unwittingly, so likewise in the means whereby they acquire their appointed ends, they are by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity so held, that they cannot divert from them. The ends why the Heavens do move, the Heavens themselves know not, and their motions they cannot but continue. Only men in all their actions know what it is which they seek for, neither are they by any such necessity tyed naturally unto any certain determinate mean to obtain their end by, but that they may, if they will, forsake it. And therefore in the whole World, no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but onely man, which hath the last end of his actions proposed as a recompence and reward, whereunto his minde directly bending it self, is termed right or strait, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perverse.</p>
                  <p>To make this somewhat more plain, we must note, that as they which travel from City to City, enquire ever for the straightest way, because the streightest is that which soonest bringeth them unto their journeys end: So we having here, as the Apostle speaketh, no abiding City, but being always in travel towards that place of joy, immortality, and rest, cannot but in every of our deeds, words, and thoughts, think that to be best, which with most expedition leadeth us thereunto, and is for that very cause termed right. That Soveraign good, which is the eternal fruition of all good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our last and chiefest felicity, there is no desperate Despiser of God and godliness living, which doth not wish for. The difference between right and crooked mindes, is in the means which the one of the other eschew or follow, Certain it is, that all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things which are naturally desired in the world, as Food, Rayment, Honor, Wealth, Pleasure, Knowledge, they are subordinated in such wise unto that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Good which we look for in the World to come, that even in them there lyeth a direct way tending unto this. Otherwise we must think, that God making promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of good things in this life, did seek to pervert men, and to lead them from their right minds. Where is then the obliquity of the minde of man? his minde is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:66185:317"/>
cam, and crooked, not when it bendeth it self unto any of these things, but when it bendeth so, that it swerveth either to the right hand or to the left, by excess or defect, from that exact rule whereby Human actions are measured. The rule to measure and judge them by, is the Law of God. For this cause, the Prophet doth make so often and so earnest suit, <hi>O direct me in the way of thy Commandments: As long as I have respect to thy Statules, I am sure not to tread amiss.</hi> Under the name of the Law; we must comprehend not only that which God hath written in Tables and Leaves, but that which Nature also hath engraven in the hearts of men. Else how should those Heathens which never had Books, but Heaven and Earth to look upon, be convicted of Perverseness? <hi>But the Gentiles which had not the Law in Books, had,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>the effect of the Law written in their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then seeing that the heart of man is not right exactly, unless it be found in all parts such, that God examining and calling it unto account with all severity of rigour, be not able once to charge it with declining or swarving aside, (which absolute perfection when did God ever finde in the Sons of mere mortal men?) Doth it not follow, that all Flesh must of necessity fall down and confess, We are not dust and ashes, but worse, our mindes from the highest to the lowest are not right? If not right, then undoubtedly not capable of that blessedness which we naturally seek, but subject unto that which we most abhorr, Anguish, Tribulation, Death, Wo, endless Misery. For whatsoever misseth the way of Life, the issue thereof cannot be but Perdition. By which reason, all being wrapped up in sinne, and made thereby the Children of Death, the mindes of all men being plainly convicted not to be right, shall we think that God hath indued them with so many excellencies, more not onely than any, but then all the Creatures in the World besides, to leave them in such estate, that they had been happier if they they had never been? Here commeth necessarily in a new way unto Salvation, so that they which were in the other perverse, may in this be found strait and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That the way of Nature, this the way of Grace. The end of that way, Salvation merited, presupposing the righteousness of mens works; their Righteousness, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hability to do them; that hability, the goodness of God which created them in such perfection. But the end of this way, Salvation bestowed upon men as a Gift, presupposing not their righteousness, but the forgiveness of their unrighteousness, Justification; their Justification, not their natural ability to do good, but their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sorrow for their not doing, and unfeigned belief in him, for whose sake not-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are accepted, which is their Vocation; their Vocation, the Election of God, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them out from the number of lost Children; their Election a Mediator in whom to be elect: This Mediation, inexplicable Mercy; his Mercy, their Misery, for whom he vouchsafed to make himself a Mediator. The want of exact distinguishing between these two wayes, and observing what they have common, what peculiar, hath been the cause of the greatest part of that confusion whereof Christianity at this day laboureth. The lack of diligence in searching, laying down, and inuring mens mindes with those hidden grounds of Reason, whereupon the least particular in each of these are most firmly and strongly builded, is the onely reason of all those scruples and uncertainties wherewith we are in such sort intangled, that a number despair of ever discerning what is right or wrong in any thing. But we will let this matter rest, whereinto we stepped to search out a way how some mindes may be, and are right truly, even in the sight of God, though they be simply in themselves not right.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, there is not onely this difference between the just and impious, that the minde of the one is right in the sight of God, because his obliquity is not imputed; the other perverse, because his sin is unrepented of: but even as lines that are drawn with a trembling hand, but yet to the point which they should, are thought ragged and uneven, nevertheless direct in comparison of them which run clean another way; so there is no incongruity in terming them right-minded men, whom though God may charge with many things amiss, yet they are not as those hideous and ugly Monsters, in whom, because there is nothing but wilful opposition of minde against God, a more than tolerable deformity is noted in them, by saying, that their mindes are not right. The Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> unto whom the Son of God sendeth this greeting, <hi>I know thy works, and thy love, and service, and faith, notwithstanding, I have a

few things against thee,</hi> was not as he unto whom Saint <hi>Peter, Thou hast no fellow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship in this business, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</hi> So that whereat the orderly disposition of the minde of man should be this; Perturbation, and sensual Appetites all kept in awe by a moderate and sober will, in all things fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined by Reason; Reason, directed by the Law of God and Nature; this <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> had his minde, as it were, turned upside down: In him unreasonable cecity and blindnesse trampled all Laws both of God and Nature under seet; Wilfulness tyrannized over Reason; and Brutish Sensuality over Will: An evident token, that his out-rage would work his overthrow, and procure his speedy ruine. The Mother whereof was that which the Prophet in these words signified, <hi>His minde doth swell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immoderate swelling, a token of very eminent breach, and of inevitable destruction: Pride, a vice which cleaveth so fast unto the hearts of men, that if we were to strip our selves of all faults one by one, we should undoubtedly finde it the very last and hardest to put off. But I am not here to touch the secret itching humour of vanity wherewith men are generally touched. It was a thing more than meanly inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, wherewith the <hi>Babylonian</hi> did swell. Which that we may both the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and the more easily reap profit by the nature of this vice, which setteth the whole World out of course, and hath put so many even of the wisest besides themselves, is first of all to be inquired into. Secondly, the dangers to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which it draweth inevitably after it, being not cured. And last of all, the ways to cure it.</p>
                  <p>Whether we look upon the gifts of Nature, or of Grace, or whatsoever is in the World admired as a part of man's excellency, adorning his Body, beautifying his Minde, or externally any way commending him in the account and opinion of men, there is in every kinde somewhat possible which no man hath, and somewhat had which few men can attain unto. By occasion whereof, there groweth disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment necessarily; and by occasion of disparagement, Pride through mens ignorance. First therefore, although men be not proud of any thing which is not, at lest in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion good, yet every good thing they are not proud of, but onely of that which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is common unto many, and being desired of all, causeth them which have it, to be honoured above the rest. Now there is no man so void of brain, as to suppose that Pride consisteth in the bare possession of such things; for then to have Vertue were a Vice, and they should be the happiest men who are most wretched, because they have least of that which they would have. And though in speech we do intimate a kinde of vanity to be in them of whom we say, <hi>They are Wise men and they know it,</hi> yet this doth not prove, That every Wiseman is proud which doth not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be blockish. What we may have and know that we have it without offence, do we then make offensive, when we take joy and delight in having it? What dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between men enriched with all aboundance of earthly and heavenly Blessings, and Idols gorgeously attired, but this, <hi>The one takes pleasures in that which they have, the other none?</hi> If we may be possest with Beauty, Strength, Riches, Power, Knowledge, if we may be privy to what we are every way, if glad and joyful for our own wel-fare, and in all this remain unblameable; nevertheless some there are, who granting thus much, doubt whether it may stand with humility to accept those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Praise and Commendation, those Titles, Rooms, and other Honours which the World yieldeth, as acknowledgements of some mens excellencies above others. For inasmuch as Christ hath said unto those that are his; <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles raign over them, and they that bear rule over them are called, Gracious Lords; Be ye not so:</hi> the Anabaptist hereupon urgeth equality amongst Christians, as if all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Authority were nothing else but Heathenish Pride. Our Lord and Saviour had no such meaning. But his Disciples feeding themselves with a vain imagination for the time, that the Messias of the World should in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> erect his Throne, and exercise Dominion with great pomp and outward statelinesse, advanced in honour and Terrene Power above all the Princes of the Earth, began to think how with their Lord's condition, their own would also rise: that having left and forsaken all to follow him, their Place about him should not be mean: and because they were many, it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them much, which of them should be the greatest man. When suit was made
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:66185:318"/>
for two by name, that of them one might sit at his right hand, and the other at his left, the rest began to stomack, each taking it grievously, that any should have what all did affect; their Lord and Master, to correct this humour, turneth aside their cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from these vain and fansieful conceits, giving them plainly to understand, that they did but deceive themselves. His coming was not to purchase an earthly, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on heavenly Kingdom, wherein they (if any) shall be greatest, whom unfeigned Humility maketh in this World lowest and least amongst others: <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations, therefore I leave unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed me, that ye may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom, and sit on Seats, and judge the twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> But my Kingdom is no such Kingdom as ye dream of. And therefore these hungry ambitious contentions are seemlier in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, than in you. Wherefore from Christ's intent and purpose nothing is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, than dislike of distinction in Titles and Callings annexed for Order's sake unto Authority, whether it be Ecclesiastical or Civil. And when we have examined through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the nature of this Vice is, no man knowing it, can be so simple, as not to see an ugly shape thereof apparent many times in rejecting Honours offered, more than in the very exacting of them at the hands of men. For as <hi>Iudas</hi> his care for the Poor was meer covetousness; and that frank-hearted wastfulness spoken of in the Gospel, thrift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> so, there is no doubt, but that going in raggs may be Pride, and Thrones be cloathed with unfeigned humility.</p>
                  <p>We must go further therefore and enter somewhat deeper, before we can come to the Closet wherein this Poyson lyeth. There is in the heart of every proud man, first, an errour of understanding; a vain opinion whereby he thinketh his own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and by reason thereof; his worthiness of estimation, regard and honour, to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in truth it is. This maketh him, in all his affections, accordingly to raise up himself, and by his inward affections his outward acts are fashioned. Which, if you list to have exemplified, you may either by calling to minde things spoken of them, whom God himself hath in Scripture specially noted with this fault; or, by presenting to your secret cogitations that which you daily behold in the odious lives and manners of high-minded men. It were too long to gather together so plentiful an harvest of examples in this kinde as the sacred Scripture affordeth. That which we drink in at our ears, doth not so piercingly enter, as that which the minde doth conceive by sight. Is there any thing written concerning the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarch in the tenth of <hi>Esay,</hi> of his swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, his haughty looks, his great and presumptuous taunts: <hi>By the power of mine own hand I have done all things, and by mine own wisdom I have subdued the World?</hi> Any thing concerning the Dames of <hi>Sion,</hi> in the third of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> of their stretched-out Necks, their immodest Eyes, their Pageant-like, stately, and pompous Gate? Any thing concerning the practises of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to live in subjection, their mutinies, repining at lawful Authority, their grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against their Superiours Ecclesiastical and Civil? Any thing concerning Pride in any sort of Sect, which the present face of the World doth not, as in a glass, represent to the view of all mens beholding? So that if Books, both prophane and holy, were all lost, as long as the manners of men retain the estate they are in: for him that observeth, how that when men have once conceived an over-weening of themselves, it maketh them in all their affections to swell, how deadly their hatred, how heavy their displeasure, how un-appeaseable their indignation and wrath is above other mens, in what manner they compose themselvs to be as <hi>Heteroclits,</hi> without the compass of all such Rules as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort are measured by; how the Oaths which religious hearts do tremble at, they affect as principal graces of speech; what felicity they take to see the enormity of their crimes above the reach of Laws and punishments; how much it delighteth them when they are able to appale with the cloudiness of their looks; how far they exceed the terms wherewith man's nature should be limited; how high they bear their heads over others; how they brow-beat all men which do not receive their Sentences as Oracles, with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous applause and approbation; how they look upon no man, but with an indirect countenance, nor hear any thing saving their own praise, with patience, nor speak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scornfulness and disdain; how they use their Servants, as if they were Beasts, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors as Servants, their Equals as Inferiors, and as for Superiors they acknowledg none; how they admire themselves as venerable, puissant, wise, circumspect provident, every
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:66185:319"/>
way great, taking all men besides themselves for cyphers, poor, inglorious, silly creatures, needless burthens of the earth, off-scowrings, nothing: in a word, for him which marketh how irregular and exorbitant they are in all things, it can be no hard thing hereby to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Pride is nothing but an inordinate elation of the minde, proceeding from a false conceit of mens excellency in things honored, which accordingly frameth also their deeds and behaviour, unless they be cunning to conceal it; For a foul scarr may be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fair cloath: And, as proud as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> may be in outward appearance lowly.</p>
                  <p>No man expecteth Grapes of Thistles; nor from a thing of so bad a nature, can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than suitable fruits be looked for. What harm soever in private Families there groweth by disobedience of Children, stubbornness of Servants, untractableness in them who although they otherwise may rule, yet should, in consideration of the imparity of their sex, be also subject; whatsoever, by strife amongst men combined in the fellowship of greater Societies, by tyranny of Potentates, ambition of Nobles, rebellion of Subjects in Civil States; by Heresies, Schisms, Divisions in the Church; naming Pride, we name the Mother which brought them forth, and the onely Nurse that feedeth them. Give me the hearts of all men humbled; and what is there that can overthrow or disturb the peace of the World? Wherein many things are the cause of much evil; but Pride, of all.</p>
                  <p>To declaim of the swarms of Evils issuing out of Pride, is an easie labour. I rather wish, that I could exactly prescribe, and perswade effectually the remedies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a sore so grievous might be cured, and the means how the pride of swelling mindes might be taken down. Whereunto so much we have already gained, that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Cause, which breedeth it, pointeth directly unto the likeliest and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test helps to take it away: Diseases that come of fulness, emptiness must remove. Pride is not cured, but by abating the Errour which causeth the Minde to swell. Then seeing that they swell by mis-conceit of their own excellency; for this cause, all which tend to the beating down of their Pride, whether it be advertisement from men, or from God himself chastisement; it then maketh them cease to be proud, when in causeth them to see their errour in over-seeing the thing they were proud of. At this mark <hi>Iob,</hi> in his Apology unto his eloquent Friends, aimeth. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how much they delighted to hear themselves talk, as if they had given their poor afflicted familiar a schooling of marvellous deep and rare instruction, as if they had taught him more than all the World besides could acquaint him with: his Answer was to this effect: Ye swell, as though ye had conceived some great matter; but as for that which ye are delivered of, who knoweth it not? Is any man ignorant of these things? At the same mark the blessed Apostle driveth: Ye abound in all things, ye are rich, ye raign, and would to Christ we did raign with you: But boast not. For what have ye, or are ye of your selves? To this mark, all those humble Confessions are referred, which have been always frequent in the mouths of Saints, truly wading in the tryal of themselves: as that of the Prophet's, <hi>We are nothing but soreness and festered corruption:</hi> our very light is darkness, and our righteousness is self unrighteousness; That of GREGORY, <hi>Let no man ever put confidence in his own deserts: Sordet in conspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu Iudicis, quod fulget in conspectu operantis,</hi> In the sight of the dreadful Judge, it is noysom, which in the doer's judgment maketh a beautiful shew: That of ANSELM, <hi>I adore thee, I bless thee, Lord God of Heaven, and Redeemer of the World, with all the power, ability, and strength of my heart and soul, for thy goodness so unmeasurably extended; not in regard of my merits, whereunto onely torments were due, but of thy mere unprocured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity.</hi> If these Fathers should be raised again from the dust, and have the Books laid open before them, wherein such Sentences are found as this: <hi>Works no other than the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, desert, price, and worth of the joyes of the kingdom of Heaven; Heaven, in relation to our works, as the very stipend, which the hired Labourer covenanteth to have of him whose work he doth, as a thing equally and justly answering unto the time and waight of his travels, rather than to a voluntary or bountiful gift.</hi> If, I say, those reverend fore-rehearsed Fathers, whose Books are so full of Sentences, witnessing their Christian humility, should be raised from the dead, and behold with their eyes such things written; would they not plainly pronounce of the Authors of such Writs, that they were fuller of <hi>Lucifer</hi> than of Christ; that they were proud-hearted men, and carried more swelling mindes than sincerely and feelingly known Christianity can tolerate?</p>

                     <pb n="543" facs="tcp:66185:319"/>But as unruly Children, with whom wholsom admonition prevaileth little; are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding brought to fear that everafter, which they have once well smarted for; so the Mind which falleth not with Instruction, yet under the rod of Divine chastisement ceaseth to swell. If therefore the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> instructed by good experience, have acknowledged: Lord, I was even at the point of clean forgetting my self, and so stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my right minde: but thy Rod hath been my Reformer; it hath been good for me, even as much as my Soul is worth, that I have been with sorrow troubled: If the blessed Apostle did need the corrosive of sharp and bitter strokes, left his Heart should swell with too great abundance of heavenly Revelations, surely, upon us whatsoever God in this World doth, or shall inflict, it cannot seem more than our Pride doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, not only by way of revenge, but of remedy. So hard it is to cure a sore of such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as Pride is, in as much as that which rooteth out other Vices, causeth this, and (which is even above all conceit) if we were clean from all spot and blemish both, of other faults; of Pride, the fall of Angels doth make it almost a question, whether we might not need a Preservative still, left we should haply wax proud that we are not proud. What is Vertue, but a medicine, and Vice, but a Wound? Yet we have so often deeply wounded our selves with Medicine; that God hath been fain to make wounds medicinable; to cure by Vice where Vertue hath strucken; to suffer the just man to fall, that being raised, he may be taught what Power it was which upheld him standing: I am not afraid to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it boldly with St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> That men puffed up through a proud opinion of their own sanctity and holiness, receive a benefit at the hands of God, and are assisted with his Grace, when with his Grace they are not assisted, but permitted, and that grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to transgress; whereby, as they were in over-great liking of themselves supplanted, so the dislike of that which did supplant them, may establish them afterwards the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.

                  <p>THE Holy Apostles having gathered themselves together by the special appointment of Christ, and being in expectation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him such Instructions as they had been accustomed with, were told, that which they least looked for, namely, That the time of his departure out of the World was now come. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they fell into consideration: first, of the manifold benefits which his absence should bereave them of; and secondly of the sundry evils which themselves should be subject unto, being once bereaved of so gracious a Master and Patron. The one consideration over-whelmed their Souls with heaviness: the other with fear. Their Lord and Saviour, whose words had cast down their hearts, raiseth them presently again with chosen sentences of sweet encouragement. My dear, it is for your own sakes I leave the World. I know the affections of your hearts are tender, but if your love were directed with that advised and staid judgment which should be in you, my speech of leaving the World, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto my Father, would not a little augment your joy. Desolate and comfortless I will not leave you; in Spirit I am with you to the Worlds end, whether I be present or absent, nothing shall ever take you out of these hands: my going is to take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that, in your names, which is not only for me, but also for you prepared; where I am, you shall be. In the mean while, <hi>my peace I give, not as the World gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, give I unto you: Let not your hearts be troubled, nor fear.</hi> The former part of which Sentence having otherwhere already been spoken of, this unacceptable occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to open the latter part thereof here, I did not look for. But so God disposeth the wayes of men. Him I heartily beseech, that the thing which he hath thus order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:66185:320"/>
by his Providence, may, through his gracious goodnesse turn unto your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>Our Nature for coveteth preservation from things hurtful. Hurtful things being present, do breed heaviness; being future, do cause fear. Our Saviour to abate the one, speaketh thus unto his Disciples: <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled,</hi> and, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the other, addeth <hi>Fear not.</hi> Grief and heaviness in the presence of sensible Evils cannot but trouble the mindes of men. It may therefore seem that Christ requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a thing impossible. Be not troubled. Why, how could they choose? But we must note this being natural, and therefore simply not reproveable, is in us good or bad, according to the causes for which we are grieved, or the measure of our grief. It is not my meaning to speak so largely of this affection, as to go over all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars whereby men do one way or other offend in it, but to teach it so farr onely as it may cause the very Apostles equals to swerve. Our grief and heaviness therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, sometime in respect of the cause from whence, sometime in regard of the measure whereunto it groweth.</p>
                  <p>When Christ, the life of the World, was led unto cruel death, there followed a number of People and Women, which Women bewayled much his heavy case. It was a natural compassion which caused them, where they saw undeserved miseries, there to pour forth unrestrained tears. Nor was this reproved. But in such readiness to lament where they less needed, their blindness in not discerning that for which they ought much rather to have mourned; this our Saviour a little toucheth, putting them in minde that the tears which were wasted for him, might better have been spent upon themselves. <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem, weep not for me, weep for your selves, and for your children.</hi> It is not, as the Stoicks have imagined, a thing unseemly for a Wise man to be touched with grief of minde: but to be sorrowful when we least should; and where we should lament, there to laugh, this argueth our small wisdom. Again, when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> confesseth thus of himself, <hi>I grieved to see the great prosperity of godless men, how they flourish and go untoucht,</hi> Psal. 73. Himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by openeth both our common and his peculiar imperfection, whom this cause should not have made so pensive. To grieve at this, is to grieve where we should not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this grief doth rise from Errour. We erre when we grieve at wicked mens impunity and prosperity, because their Estate being rightly discerned, they neither prosper nor go unpunished. It may seem a Paradox, it is truth, That no wicked man's estate is prosperous, fortunate, or happy. For what though they bless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and think their happinesse great? Have not frantick Persons many times a great opinion of their own wisdome? It may be that such as they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, others also do account them. But what others? Surely such as themselves are. Truth and Reason discerneth far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the name of Peace containeth in it all parts of true happiness, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith plainly, That the Wicked have no peace, how can we think them to have any part of other than vainly imagined Felicity? What wise man did ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Fools happy? If Wicked men were wise, they would cease to be wicked. Their Iniquity therefore proving their Folly, how can we stand in doubt of their misery? They abound in those things which all men desire.

If such things adde nothing to mens happiness, where they are not used, surely Wicked men that use them ill, the more they have, the more wretched. Of their Prosperity therefore we see what we are to think. Touching their Impunity, the same is likewise but supposed. They are oftner plagued than we are aware of. The pangs they feel are not always written in their forehead. Though Wickedness be Sugar in their mouths, and Wantonness as Oyl to make them look with chearful Countenance, nevertheless if their Hearts were disclosed, perhaps their glittering state would not greatly be envied.

surely tokens of the curse which <hi>Zophar</hi> in the Book of <hi>Iob</hi> poureth upon the head of the impious man, <hi>He shall suck the gall of Asps, and the Viper's tongue shall slay him.</hi> If this seem light, because it is secret, shall we think they go unpunished, because no apparent Plague is presently seen upon them? The Judgments of God do not always follow crimes, as Thunder doth Lightning; but sometimes the space of many Ages coming between. When the Sun hath shined fair the space of six dayes upon their Tabernacle, we know not what Clouds the seventh may bring. And when their punishment doth come, let them make their account, in the greatness of their sufferings to pay the interest of that respite which hath been given them. Or if they chance to escape clearly in this World, which they seldome do; in the Day when the Heavens shall shrivel as a scrowl, and the Mountains move as frighted men out of their places, what Cave shall receive them? What Mountain or Rock shall they get by intreaty to fall upon them? What covert to hide them from that wrath, which they shall neither be able to abide or avoid? No man's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery therefore being greater than theirs whose impiety is most fortunate; much more cause there is for them to bewail their own infelicity, than for others to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with their prosperous and happy estate, as if the hand of the Almighty did not, or would not touch them. For these causes, and the like unto these, therefore, Be not troubled.</p>
                  <p>Now, though the cause of our heaviness be just, yet may not our affections herein be yielded unto with too much indulgency and favour. The grief of Compassion, whereby we are touched with the feeling of other mens woes, is of all other least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Yet this is a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> unto sundry duties, by this we are apt to spare sometimes where we ought to strike. The grief which our own sufferings do bring, what temptations have not risen from it? What great advantage Satan hath taken even by the godly grief of hearty contrition for sins committed against God, the near approaching of so many afflicted Souls, whom the conscience of sinne hath brought unto the very brink of extreme despair, doth but too abundantly shew. These things, wheresoever they fall, cannot but trouble and molest the minde. Whether we be therefore moved vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with that which seemeth hurtful, and is not; or have just cause of grief, being pressed indeed with those things which are grievous, our Saviour's Lesson is, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one, Be not troubled; not over-troubled for the other. For, though to have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Naming Patience, I name that vertue which onely hath power to stay our Souls from being over-excessively troubled: A vertue, wherein, if ever any, surely that Soul had good experience, which extremity of pains, having chased out of the Tabernacle of this Flesh, Angels, I nothing doubt, have carried into the bosom of her Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> The death of the Saints of God is precious in his sight. And shall it seem unto us superfluous at such times as these are, to hear in what manner they have ended their lives? The Lord himself hath not disdained so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to register in the Book of Life, after what sort his Servants have closed up their dayes on Earth, that he descendeth even to their very meanest actions, what meat they have longed for in their Sicknesse, what they have spoken unto their Children, Kinsfolks, and Friends, where they have willed their dead Carkas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be laid, how they have framed their Wills and Testaments: yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turning of their Faces to this side or that, the setting of their Eyes, the
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:66185:321"/>
degrees whereby their natural Heat hath departed from them, their Cryes, their Groans, their Pantings, Breathings, and Last-gaspings, he hath most solemnly commended unto the memory of all Generations. The care of the living both to live and dye well, must needs be somewhat encreased, when they know that their departure shall not be foulded up in silence, but the ears of many be made acquainted with it. Again, when they hear how mercifully God hath dealt with others in the hour of their last need, besides the praise which they give to God, and the joy which they have, or should have, by reason of their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Communion of Saints, is not their hope also much confirmed against the day of their own dissolution? Finally, the sound of these things doth not so passe the ears of them that are most loose and dissolute of life, but it causeth them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other to wish in their hearts, <hi>Oh, that we might dye the death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that our end might be like his!</hi> Howbeit, because to spend herein many words, would be to strike even as many wounds into their mindes, whom I rather wish to comfort: Therefore concerning this vertuous Gentlewoman, onely this little I speak, and that of knowledge, <hi>She lived a Dove, and dyed a Lambe.</hi> And, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many Vertues, hearty Devotion towards God, towards Poverty ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Compassion, Motherly Affection toward Servants; towards Friends even ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable kindness, milde behaviour, and harmless meaning towards all, if where so many Vertues were eminent, any be worthy of special mention, I wish her dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friends of that sex to be her nearest Followers in two things: <hi>Silence,</hi> saving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where duty did exact speech; and <hi>Patience,</hi> even then when extremity of pains did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force grief. <hi>Blessed are they that dye in the Lord.</hi> And concerning the dead which are blessed, let not the hearts of any living be over-charged, with grief over-troubled.</p>
                  <p>Touching the latter affection of Fear, which respecteth evil to come, as the other which we have spoken of doth present evils; first, in the nature thereof it is plain, that we are not of every future evil afraid. Perceive we not how they, whose ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse shrinketh at the least rase of a Needle's Point, do kisse the Sword that peirceth their Souls quite thorow? If every Evil did cause Fear, Sinne, because it is Sinne, would be feared; whereas properly Sinne is not feared as Sinne, but onely as having some kinde of harm annexed. To teach men to avoid sinne, it had been sufficient for, the Apostle to say, Flye it. But to make them afraid of committing sinne, because the naming of Sin sufficed not, therefore he addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That it is as a <hi>Serpent which stingeth the Soul.</hi> Again, be it that some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive or hurtful thing be towards us, must fear of necessity follow hereupon? Not, except that hurtful thing doe threaten us either with destruction or vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that such as we, have neither a conceit of ability to resist, nor of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impossibility to avoid. That which we know our selves able to withstand, we fear not; and that which we know are unable to deferr or diminish, or any way avoid, we cease to fear; we give our selves over to bear and sustain it. The evil therefore which is feared, must be in our perswasion unable to be resisted when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, yet not utterly impossible for a time in whole or in part to be shunned. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we much fear such evils, except they be imminent and near at hand; nor if they be near, except we have an opinion that they be so. When we have once conceived an opinion, or apprehended an imagination of such evils prest, and ready to invade us; because they are hurtful unto our nature, we feel in our selves a kinde of abhorring; because they are thought near, yet not present, our nature seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forthwith how to shift and provide for it self; because they are evils which cannot be resisted, therefore she doth not provide to withstand, but to shun and avoid. Hence it is, that in extream fear, the Mother of Life contracting herself, avoiding as much as may be the reach of evil, and drawing the heat together with the spirits of the Body to her, leaveth the outward parts cold, pale, weak, feeble, unapt to perform the functions of Life; as we see in the fear of <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> King of <hi>Babel.</hi> By this it appeareth, that Fear is nothing else but a perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde, through an opinion of some imminent evil, threatning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or great annoyance of our Nature, which to shun, it doth contract and deject it self.</p>

                     <pb n="548" facs="tcp:66185:322"/>
Now because, not in this place onely, but otherwhere often, we hear it repeated, <hi>Fear not</hi>; it is by some made a question, <hi>Whether a man may fear destruction or vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without sinning?</hi> First, the reproof wherewith Christ checketh his Disciples more than once, <hi>O men of little Faith, wherefore are ye afraid</hi>? Secondly, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment threatned in <hi>Revelat.</hi> 21. <hi>viz.</hi> the Lake, and Fire, and Brimstone, not onely to Murtherers, unclean Persons, Sorcerers, Idolaters, Lyers, but also to the fearful and faint-hearted: this seemeth to argue, That Fearfulness cannot but be finne. On the contrary side we see, that he which never felt motion unto sinne, had of this affection more than a slight feeling. How clear is the evidence of the Spirit, That <hi>in the days of his Flesh be offered up Prayers and Supplications, with strong cryes and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was also heard in that which he feared, Heb.</hi> 5.7. Whereupon it followeth, that Fear in it self is a thing not sinful. For, is not Fear a thing natural, and for mens preservation necessary, implanted in us by the provident and most gracious Giver of all good things, to the end, that we might not run head-long upon those mischiefs wherewith we are not able to encounter, but use the remedy of shunning those Evils which we have not ability to withstand? Let that People therefore which receive a benefit by the length of their Prince's days, the Father or Mother which rejoyceth to see the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of their Flesh grow like green and pleasant Plants, let those Children that would have their Parents, those men that would gladly have their Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns dayes prolonged on earth (as there is no natural-hearted man but gladly would) let them bless the Father of Lights, as in other things, so even in this, that he hath given man a fearful heart, and settled naturally that affection in him, which is a preservation against so many ways of death. Fear then, in it self, being meer Nature, cannot, in it self, be Sin, which Sin is not Nature, but thereof an accessary depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>But in the matter of Fear we may sin, and do, two wayes. If any man's danger be great, theirs is greatest that have put the fear of danger farthest from them. Is there any estate more fearful than that Babylonian Strumpet's, that sitteth upon the tops of seven Hills, glorying, and vaunting, <hi>I am a Queen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.7. How much better and happier are they, whose estate hath been always as his who speaketh after this sort of himself, <hi>Lord, from my youth have I born thy yoke</hi>: They which sit at continual ease, and are settled in the lees of their security; look upon them, view their countenance, their speech, their gesture, their deeds, <hi>Put them in fear, O God,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>that so they may know themselves to be but men</hi>; Worms of earth, dust and ashes, frail, corruptible, feeble things. To shake off security therefore, and to breed fear in the hearts of mortal men, so many admonitions are used concerning the power of Evils which beset them, so many threatnings of calamities, so many descriptions of things threatned, and those so lively, to the end they may leave behind them a deep impression of such as have force to keep the heart continually waking. All which doe shew, that we are to stand in fear of nothing more than the extremity of not fearing.</p>
                  <p>When fear hath delivered us from that pit, wherein they are sunk that have put farr from them the evil day; that have made a league with death, and have said, <hi>Tush, we shall feel no harm</hi>; it standeth us upon to take heed it cast us not into that, wherein Souls destitute of all hope are plunged. For our direction, to avoid, as much as may be, both extremities, that we may know, as a Ship-master by his Card, how farr we are wide, either on the one side, or on the other; we must note, that in a Christian man there is, First, Nature: Secondly, Corruption perverting Nature: Thirdly, Grace, correcting and amending Corruption. In fear, all these have their several operations: Nature teacheth simply, to wish preservation and avoidance of things dreadful; for which cause our Saviour himself prayeth, and that often, <hi>Father, if it be possible.</hi> In which cases, corrupt Nature's suggestions are, For the safety of Temporal life, not to stick at things excluding from eternal; wherein how farr, even the best may be led, the chiefest Apostle's frailty teacheth. Were it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for such cogitations as, on the contrary side, Grace and Faith minisheth, such as that of <hi>Iob, Though God kill me</hi>; that of <hi>Paul, Scio cui credidi,</hi> I know him on whom I do rely; small evils would soon be able to overthrow even the best of us. <hi>A

wise man,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, doth see a plague coming, and hideth himself.</hi> It is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> which teacheth a Wise man in fear to <hi>hide</hi> himself, but <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> doth teach him <hi>where.</hi> Fools care not to hide their heads: but where shall a Wise man hide himself, when he feareth a Plague coming? Where should the frighted Childe hide his head, but in the bosom of his loving Father? where a Christian but under the shadow of the Wings of Christ his Saviour? <hi>Come my People,</hi> saith God in the Prophet, <hi>Enter into thy Chamber, hide thy self, &amp;c.</hi> Isa. 26. But because we are in danger; like chased Birds, like Doves, that seek and cannot see the resting holes, that are right before them; therefore our Saviour giveth his Disciples these encouragements before-hand, that Fear might never so amaze them, but that always they might remember, that whatsoever Evils at any time did beset them, to him they should still repair for comfort, counsel, and succour. For their assurance whereof, his <hi>Peace he gave them, his Peace he left unto them, not such Peace as the World offereth,</hi> by whom his name is never so much pretended, as when deepest treachery is meant; but <hi>Peace which passeth all understanding, Peace</hi> that bringeth with it all happinesse, <hi>Peace</hi> that continueth for ever and ever, with them that have it.</p>

                     <q>Whether the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> by admitting this cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into his minde, <hi>The Law doth fail,</hi> did thereby shew himself an Unbeliever?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WEE have seen in the opening of this clause, which concerneth the weakness of the Prophet's Faith? First, what things they are whereunto the Faith of sound Believers doth assent: Secondly, wherefore all men assent not thereunto: and Thirdly, why they that doe, doe it many times with small assurance. Now, because nothing can be so truly spoken, but through mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it may be depraved; therefore to prevent, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, all mis-construction in this cause; where a small errour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rise but with great danger, it is perhaps needful ere we come to the fourth Point, that something be added to that which hath been already spoken concerning the third.</p>
                  <p>That meer natural men do neither know nor acknowledge the things of God, we do not marvel, because they are spiritually to be discerned: but they in whose hearts the light of Grace doth shine, they that are taught of God, why are they so weak in Faith? why is their assenting to the Law so scrupulous? so much mingled with fear and wavering? It seemeth strange, that ever they should imagin the Law to fail. It cannot seem strange if we weigh the reason. If the things which we believe be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in themselves, it may truly be said, that Faith is more certain than any Science: That which we know, either by sense, or by infallible demonstration is not so certain as the Principles. Articles, and Conclusions of Christian Faith. Concerning which we must note, that there is a <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>evidence,</hi> and a <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>adherence. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>evidence</hi> we call that, when the minde doth assent unto this or that, not because it is true in it self, but because the truth is clear, because it is manifest unto us. Of
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:66185:323"/>
things in themselves most certain, except they be also most evident, our perswasion is not so assured, as it is of things more evident, although in themselves they be lesse certain. It is as sure, if not surer, that there be spirits as that there he men: but we be more assured of these than of them, because these are more evident. The truth of some things is so evident, that no man which heareth them can doubt of them: as when we hear that <hi>a part of any thing is less than the whole,</hi> the minde is constrained to say, This is true. If it were so in matters of Faith, then, as all men have equal certainty of this, so no Believer should be more scrupulous and doubtful than another. But we finde the contrary. The Angels and Spirits of the Righteous in Heaven, have certainty most evident of things spiritual: but this they have by the light of glory. That which we see by the light of Grace, though it he indeed more certain, yet it is not to us so evidently certain, as that which sense, or the light of Nature, will not suffer a man to doubt of. Proofs are vain and frivolous, except they be more certain than is the thing proved: and do we not see how the Spirit every where in the Scripture proving matters of Faith, laboureth to confirm us in the things which we believe by things whereof we have sensible knowledge? I conclude therefore, that we have less <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>evidence</hi> concerning things believed, than concerning sensible or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perceived. Of these, who doth doubt at any time? Of them, at somtime, who doubteth not? I will not here alledge the sundry confessions of the perfectest that have lived upon earth, concerning their great imperfections this way; which, if I did, I should dwell too long upon a matter sufficiently known by every faithful man that doth know himself.</p>
                  <p>The other, which we call the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>adherence,</hi> is, when the heart doth cleave and stick unto that which it doth believe: This certainty is greater in us than the other. The reason is this, The faith of a Christian doth apprehend the words of the Law, the promises of God, not onely as true, but also as good; and therefore even then when the evidence which he hath of the Truth is so small, that it grieveth him to feel his weakness in assenting thereto; yet is there in him such a sure adherence unto that which he doth but faintly and fearfully believe, that his Spirit having once truly tasted the heavenly sweetness thereof, all the world is not able quite and clean to remove him from it: but he striveth with himself to hope against all reason of believing, being setled with <hi>Iob</hi> upon this unmoveable resolution, <hi>Though God kill me, I will not give ever trusting in him.</hi> For why? This lesson remaineth for ever imprinted in him, <hi>It is good for me to cleave unto God,</hi> Psal. 37.</p>
                  <p>Now the mindes of all men being so darkned, as they are with the foggy damp of original corruption, it cannot be that any man's heart living should be either so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned in the knowledge, or so established in the love of that wherein his Salvation standeth, as to be perfect, neither doubting nor shrinking at all. If any such were, what doth lett why that man should not be justified by his own inherent righteousness? For Righteousness inherent, being perfect, will justifie. And perfect Faith is a part of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness inherent; yea, a principal part, the root and the Mother of all the rest: so that if the Fruit of every Tree be such as the Root is, Faith being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as it is, if it be not at all mingled with distrust and fear, what is there to exclude other Christian vertues from the like perfections? And then what need we the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ? His Garment is superstuous? we may be honourably cloathed with our own Robes, if it be thus. But let them beware who challenge to themselves a strength which they have not, left they lose the comfortable support of that weakness which indeed they have.</p>
                  <p>Some shew, although no soundness of ground, there is, which may be alledged for defence of this supposed-perfection in certainty touching matters of our Faith: as first that <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe, and doubted not: secondly, that the spirit which God hath given us to no other end, but only to assure us that we are the Sons of God; to embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to call upon him as our Father, to open our eyes, and to make the truth of things believed evident unto our mindes; is much mightier in operation than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon light of nature, whereby we discern sensible things: wherefore we must needs be more sure of that we believe, than of that we see; we must needs be more certain of the mercies of God in Christ Jesus, than we are of the light of the Sun when it shineth upon our faces. To that of <hi>Abraham, He did not doubt:</hi> I answer that this
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:66185:324"/>
                     <hi>negation</hi> doth not exclude all fear, all doubting; but onely that which cannot stand with true Faith. It freeth <hi>Abraham</hi> from doubting through Infidelity, not from doubting through Infirmity; from the doubting of Unbelievers, not of weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; from such a doubting as that whereof the Prince of <hi>Samaria</hi> is attainted, who hearing the promise of sudden Plenty in the midst of Extream Dearth, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Though the Lord would make windows in Heaven, were it possible so to come to pass?</hi> But that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not void of all doubting, what need we any other proof than the plain evidence of his own words? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 17. The reason which is taken from the power of the Spirit were effectual, if God did work like a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Agent, as the fire doth inflame, and the Sun enlighten; according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost ability which they have to bring forth their effects. But the incomprehensible wisdom of God doth limit the effects of his power, to such a measure as seemeth best unto himself. Wherefore he worketh that certainty in all, which sufficeth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to their Salvation in the life to come; but in none so great as attaineth in this life unto perfection. Even so, O Lord, it hath pleased thee; even so it is best and fittest for us, that feeling still our own Infirmities, we may no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er breathe than pray, <hi>Adjuva Domine, Help Lord our incredulity.</hi> Of the third Question, this, I hope, will suffice, being added unto that which hath been thereof already spoken. The fourth Question resteth, and so an end of this Point.</p>
                  <p>That which cometh last of all in this first branch to be considered concerning the weakness of the Prophet's Faith, is, <hi>Whether he did by this very thought,</hi> The Law doth fail, <hi>quench the Spirit, fall from Faith, and shew himself an Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or no?</hi> The Question is of moment; the repose and tranquillity of infinite Souls doth depend upon it. The Prophet's case is the case of many; which way soever we cast for him, the same way it passeth for all others. If in him this cogitation did extinguish Grace; why the like thoughts in us should not take the like effect, there is no cause. Forasmuch therefore as the matter is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, dear and precious, which we have in hand; it behoveth us with so much the greater chariness to wade through it, taking special heed both what we build, and whereon we build, that if our Building be Pearl, our Foundation be not Stubble; if the Doctrine we teach be full of comfort and consolation, the ground whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we gather it be sure: otherwise we shall not save, but deceive both our selves and others In this we know we are not deceived, neither can we deceive you, when we teach that the Faith whereby ye are sanctified, cannot fail; it did not in the Prophet, it shall not in you. If it be so, let the difference be shewed between the condition of Unbelievers and his, in this or in the like imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity and weakness. There was in <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> that which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth call the <hi>seed of God,</hi> meaning thereby, the <hi>first grace</hi> which God powreth into the hearts of them that are incorporated into Christ; which having received, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an adversary to Sinne, we do therefore think we sinne not both other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and also by distrustful and doubtfull apprehending of that which we ought stedfastly to believe, surely, we do but deceive our selves. Yet they which are of God, do not sinne either in this, or in any thing, any such sinne as doth quite extinguish Grace, clean cutt them off from Christ Jesus: because the <hi>seed of God abideth</hi> in them, and doth shield them from receiving any irremediable wound. Their Faith when it is at strongest is but weak; yet even then, when it is at the weakest, so strong, that utterly it never faileth, it never perisheth altogether, no not in them who think it extinguished in themselves. There are, for whose sakes I dare not deal slightly in this Cause, sparing that labour which must be bestowed to make it plain. Men in like agonies unto this of the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi>'s, are, through the extremity of grief, many times in judgement so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that they finde not themselves in themselves. For that which dwelleth in their hearts they seek, they make diligent search and enquiry. It abideth, it worketh in them, yet still they ask where? Still they lament as for a thing which is past finding: they mourn as <hi>Rachel,</hi> and refuse to be comforted, as if that were not which indeed is; and, as if that which is not, were; as if they did not believe when they doe; and, as if they did despair when they do not. Which,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:66185:324"/>
in some, I grant, is but a melancholly passion, proceeding onely from that dejection of minde, the cause whereof is in the Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and by bodily means can be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But where there is no such bodily cause, the minde is not lightly in this mood, but by some of these three occasions: One, that judging by comparison, either with other men, or with themselves at some other time more strong, they think imperfection to be a plain deprivation, weakness to be utter want of Faith. Another cause is: they often mistake one thing for another. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wishing well to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> prayeth for them after this sort: <hi>The God of Hope fill you with all joy of Believing.</hi> Hence an errour groweth, when men in heaviness of Spirit, suppose they lack Faith, because they finde not the sugred joy and delight which indeed doth accompanie Faith, but so as a separable accident, as a thing that may be removed from it; yea, there is a cause why it should be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The light would never be so acceptable, were it not for that usual intercourse of darkness. Too much honey doth turn to gall, and too much joy even spiritual, would make us Wantons. Happier a great deal is that man's case, whose Soul by inward desolation is humbled, than he whose heart is through abundance of Spiritual delight lifted up, and exalted above measure. Better it is sometimes to go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pit with him, who beholding darkness, and bewailing the loss of inward joy and consolation, cryeth from the bottom of the lowest hell, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> than continually to work arm in arm with Angels, to fit, as it were, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom, and to have no thought, no cogitation, but, <hi>I thank my God it is not with me as it is with other men.</hi> No; God will have them that shall walk in light, to feel now and then what it is to sit in the shadow of death. A grieved spirit therefore is no argument of a faithless minde. A third occasion of mens mis-judging themselves, as if they were faithless when they are not, is; They fasten their cogitations upon the distrustful suggestions of the flesh, whereof finding great abundance in themselves, they gather thereby; surely, unbelief hath full domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it, hath taken plenary possession of me; if I were faithful it could not be thus. Not marking the motions of the Spirit, and of Faith, because they lye buried and over-whelmed with the contrary: when notwithstanding, as the blessed Apostle doth acknowledge, that the <hi>Spirit groaneth,</hi> and that God heareth when we do not; so there is no doubt, but that our Faith may have, and hath her private operations se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to us, yet known to him by whom they are. Tell this to a man that hath a minde deceived by too hard an opinion of himself, and it doth but augment his grief: he hath his answer ready, Will you make me think otherwise than I finde, than I feel in my self? I have throughly considered, and exquisitely sifted all the corners of my heart, and I see what there is; never seek to perswade me against my knowledge, <hi>I do not, I know I do not believe.</hi> Well, to favour them a little in their weakness: let that be granted which they do imagine; be it that they be faithless and without belief. But are they not grieved for their unbelief? They are. Do they not wish it might, and also strive that it may be otherwise? We know they do. Whence commeth this, but from a secret love and liking which they have of those things that are believed? No man can love things which in his own opinion are not. And if they think those things to be, which they shew that they love when they desire to believe them; then must it needs be, that by desiring to believe, they prove themselves true Believers: For without Faith, no man thinketh that things believed are. Which argument all the subtilty of infernal powers will never be able to dissolve. The Faith therefore of true Believers, though it hath many and grievous down-falls, yet doth it still continue invincible; it conquereth, and recovereth it self in the end. The dangerous conflicts whereunto it is subject, are not able to prevail against it. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> remained faithful in weakness, though weak in Faith. It is true, such is our weak and wavering nature, we have no sooner received Grace, but we are ready to fall from it; we have no sooner given our assent to the Law that it cannot fall, but the next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which we are ready to embrace, is, that it may, and that it doth fail. Though we finde in our selves a most willing heart to cleave unseparably unto God, even so farr as to think unfeignedly with <hi>Peter, Lord, I am ready to go with thee into Prison and to death:</hi> yet how soon, and how easily, upon how small occasions are we changed, if we be but a while let alone, and left unto our selves? The <hi>Galatians</hi> to day, for their sakes
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:66185:325"/>
which teach them the truth of Christ, are content; if need were, to pluck out their own eyes, and the next day ready to pluck out theirs which taught them. The love of the Angel to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> how greatly enflamed, and how quickly slacked? the higher we flow, the nearer we are unto an ebb, if men be respected as mere men, according to the wonted course of their alterable inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the heavenly support of the Spirit. Again, the desire of our ghostly enemy is so incredible, and his means so forcible to over-throw our Faith, that whom the blessed Apostle knew betrothed and made hand-fast unto Christ, to them he could not write but with great trembling: <hi>I am jealous over you with a godly jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, for I have prepared you to one Husband, to present you a pure Virgin unto Christ: but I fear, lest at the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his subtilty, so your mindes should be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.</hi> The simplicity of Faith which is in Christ, taketh the naked promise of God, his bare Word, and on that it resteth. This simplicity the Serpent laboureth continually to pervert, corrupting the mind with many imaginations of repugnancy and contrariety between the promise of God and those things which sense or experience, or some other fore-conceived perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath imprinted. The word of the promise of God unto his People, is, <hi>I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee:</hi> upon this the simplicity of Faith resteth, and is not afraid of famine. But mark how the subtilty of Satan did corrupt the mindes of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious generation, whose Spirits were not faithful unto God. They beheld the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate state of the desart in which they were, and by the wisdom of their sense con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the promise of God to be but folly: <hi>Can God prepare a Table in the Wildernesse?</hi> The word of the promise to <hi>Sarah,</hi> was, <hi>Thou shalt bear a Son.</hi> Faith is simple, and doubteth not of it: but Satan, to corrupt this simplicity of Faith, entangleth the mind of the Woman with an argument drawn from common experience to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>A woman that is old</hi>; Sarah, <hi>now to be acquainted again with forgotten passions of youth!</hi> The word of the promise of God by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, made the Saviour of the World so apparent unto <hi>Philip,</hi> that his simplicity could conceive no other Messias than <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> the Son of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> But to stay <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> left being invited to come and see, he should also believe, and so be saved, the subtilty of <hi>Satan</hi> casteth a mist before his eyes, putteth in his head, against this, the common conceived perswasion of all men concerning <hi>Nzaareth; Is it possible that any good thing should come from thence?</hi> this stratagem he doth use with so great dexterity, that the minds of all men are so strangely bewitched with it, that it bereaveth them for the time of all percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of that which should relieve them and be their comfort; yea, it taketh all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from them, even of things wherewith they are most familiarly acquainted.

Feeling the hand of God against them in their food, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not his hand in the day that he delivered them from the hand of the Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, <hi>Sarah</hi> was not then to learn, That <hi>with God all things were possible.</hi> Had <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel never</hi> noted how <hi>God doth chuse the base things if this World to disgrace them that are most honourably esteemed?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> knew, that the promises of Grace, protection and favour which God in the Law doth make unto his People, do not grant them any such immunity as can free and exempt them from all chastisements, he knew, that, as God said, <hi>I will continue for ever my mercy towards them</hi>; so he likewise said, <hi>Their transgressions I will punish with a rod</hi>: he knew, that it could not stand with any reason, we should set the measure of our own punishments, and prescribe unto God how great, or how long, our sufferings shall be; he knew, that we were blind, and altogether ignorant what is best for us; that we sue for many things very unwisely against our selves, thinking we ask Fish, when indeed we crave a Serpent: he knew, that when the thing we ask is good, and ye: God seemeth slow to grant it; he doth not deny, but deferr our Petitions, to the end we might learn to desire great things greatly: all this he knew.

                  </p>
                  <p>Of us who is here, which cannot very soberly advice his Brother? Sir, you must learn to strengthen your Faith by that experience which heretofore you have had of God's great goodness towards you, <hi>Per ea quae agnoscas praestita, discas sperare promissa</hi>; By those things which you have known performed, learn to hope for those things which are promised. Doe you acknowledge to have received much? Let that make you certain to receive more: <hi>Habenti debitur, To him that hath, more shall be given.</hi> When you doubt what you shall have, search what you have had at God's hands. Make this reckoning, that the benefits which he hath bestowed, are Bills ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory and sufficient Sureties that he will bestow further. His present Mercy is full a warrant of his future love, because <hi>whom he loveth, he loveth unto the end.</hi> Is it not thus? Yet if we could reckon up as many evident, clear, undoubted signs of God's reconciled love towards us, as there are years, yea dayes, yea hours past over our heads; all these set together have no such force to confirm our Faith, as the loss, and sometimes the onely fear of losing a little transitory goods, credit, honour, or favour of men, a small calamity, a matter of nothing to breed a conceit, and such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as is not easily again removed; that we are clean crost out of God's hook, that he regards us not, that he looketh upon others, but passeth by us like a Stranger, to whom we are not known. Then we think, looking upon others, and comparing them with our selves; Their Tables are furnished day by day, earth and ashes are our bread: they sing to the Lute, and they see their Children dance before them; our hearts are heavy in our bodies as lead, our sighs beat as thick as a swift Pulse, our tears do wash the beds wherein we lye: the Sun shineth fair upon their fore-heads; we are hanged up like Bottles in the smoak, cast into corners like the sherds of a broken Pot: tell not us of the promises of God's favour, tell such as do reap the fruit of them; they belong not to us, they are made to others: the Lord be merciful to our weakness, but thus it is. Well, let the frailty of our Nature, the subtilty of Satan, the force of our deceivable imaginations be, as we cannot deny, but they are things that threaten every moment the utter subversion of our Faith; Faith notwithstanding is not hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by these things.

No man's condition sure as ours: the Prayer of Christ is more than sufficient both to strengthen us, be we never so weak: and to overthrow all adversary power, be it never so strong and potent. His Prayer must not exclude out labour: their thoughts are vain, who think that their watching can preserve the City which God himself is not willing to keep. And are not theirs as vain, who think that God will keep the City, for which they themselves are not careful to watch? The Husband-man may not therefore burn his Plough, nor the Merchant forsake his Trade, because God Hath promised, <hi>I will not forsake thee.</hi> And do the promises of God concerning our stability, think you, make it a matter indifferent for us, to use, or not to use the means whereby to attend, or not to attend to reading? to pray, or not to pray, that we fall not into temptations? Surely, if we look to stand in the faith of the Sons of God, we must

hourly, continually be providing and setting our selves to strive. It was not the meaning of our Lord and Saviour in saying, <hi>Father keep them in thy name,</hi> that we should be careless to keep our selves. To our own safety, our own sedulity is required. And then blessed for ever and ever be that Mothers Child, whose Faith hath made him the Child of God. The Earth may shake, the Pillars of the World may tremble under us: the countenance of the Heaven may be appaled, the Sun may lose his light, the Moon her beauty, the Stars their glory: but concerning the man that trusteth in God, if the fire have proclaimed it self unable, as much as to singe a hair of his head; if Lyons, Beasts ravenous by nature, and keen with hunger, being set to devour, have, as it were, religiously adored the very flesh of the Faithful man, what is there in the World that shall change his Heart, over-throw his Faith, alter his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or the affection of God to him? If I be of this note; who shall make a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between me and my God? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? No, I am perswaded, that neither tribulation, nor anguish, nor persecution, or famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor sword, nor death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, shall ever prevail so far over me.

                     <p>THE occasions whereupon, together with the end wherefore, this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle was written, is opened in the front and entry of the same. There were then, as there are now, many evil and wickedly disposed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not of the Mystical Body, yet within the visible bounds of the Church, men which were of old ordained to condemnation, ungodly men, which turned the grace of our God into wantonness, and denyed the Lord Jesus. For this cause the Spirit of the Lord is in the hand of <hi>Iude,</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> to exhort them that are called, and sanctified of God the Father, that they would earnestly contend to maintain the Faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints. Which Faith, because we cannot maintain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we know perfectly; first, against whom; secondly, in what sort it must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; therefore in the former three verses of that parcel of Scripture which I have read,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:66185:328"/>
the Enemies of the Crosse of Christ are plainly described; and in the latter two, they that love the Lord Jesus, have a sweet Lesson given them, how to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and stablish themselves in the Faith. Let us first therefore examine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of these Reprobates concerning Faith; and afterwards come to the words of the Exhortation; wherein Christians are taught how to rest their hearts on God's eternal and everlasting Truth. The description of these godless Persons is two-fold, <hi>general,</hi> and <hi>special.</hi> The <hi>general</hi> doth point them out, and shew what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men they should be. The <hi>Particular</hi> pointeth at them, and saith plainly, These are they. In the <hi>general</hi> description, we have to consider of these things: <hi>First,</hi> when they were described, <hi>They were told of before. Secondly,</hi> the men by whom they were described, <hi>They were spoken of by the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ. Thirdly,</hi> the days, when they should be manifest unto the World, they told you, <hi>They should be in the last time. Fourthly,</hi> their disposition and whole demeanour, <hi>Mockers, and Walkers after their own ungodly lusts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the third to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the Apostle describeth certain: <hi>They are men,</hi> (saith he) <hi>of whom I have told you often, and now with tears I tell you of them, their God is their belly, their glory and rejoycing is in their own shame, they minde earthly things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were Enemies of the Crosse of Christ, Enemies whom he saw, and his eyes gusht out with tears to behold them. But we are taught in this place, how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles spake also of Enemies, whom as yet they had not seen, described a family of men as yet unheard of, a generation reserved for the end of the World, and for the last time; they had not only declared what they heard and saw in the days wherein they lived, but they have prophesied also of men in time to come. And <hi>you do well</hi> (said St. <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>in that ye take heed to the words of Prophesie, so that ye first know this, that no Prophesie in the Scripture cometh of any man's own resolution.</hi> No Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie in Scripture cometh of any man's own resolution: For all Prophesie, which is in Scripture, came by the secret inspiration of God. But there are Prophesies which are no Scripture; yea, there are Prophesies against the Scripture. My Brethren, beware of such Prophesies, and take heed you heed them not. Remember the things that were spoken of before; but spoken of before by the Apostles of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Take heed to Prophesies, but to Prophesies which are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for both the manner and matter of those Prophesies do shew plainly, that they are of God.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the spirit of Prophesie received from God himself.</note>3. Touching the manner, how men, by the spirit of Prophesie in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have spoken and written of things to come, we must understand, that, as the knowledge of that they spake, so likewise the utterance of that they knew, came not by these usual and ordinary means, whereby we are brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the mysteries of our Salvation, and are wont to instruct others in the same. For whatsoever we know, we have it by the hands and Ministry of men, which lead us along like Children, from a letter to a syllable, from a syllable to a word, from a word to a line, from a line a to a sentence, from a sentence to a side, and so turn over. But God himself was their Instructor, he himself taught them, partly by Dreams and Visions in the Night, partly by Revelations in the Day, taking them aside from amongst their Brethren, and talking with them, as a man would talk with his Neighbour in the way. This they became acquainted even with the secret and hidden Counsels of God, they saw things, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were not able to utter, they behold that whereat men and Angels are asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. They understood in the beginning, what should come to passe in the last dayes.</p>

travail, and much pains, when we open our lips to speak of the wonderful works of God, our tongues do faulter within our mouths, yea many times we disgrace the dreadful mysteries of our Faith, and grieve the spirit of our Hearers by words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury, and unseemly speeches:<note place="margin">Job 15. 2, 3.</note>

                        <hi>Hardly can we discern the things that are on earth, and with great labour finde we out the things that are before us. Who can then seek out the things that are in Heaven</hi>? Sometimes confessing with <hi>Iob</hi> the righteous, in treating of things too wonderful for us, we have spoken we wist not what. Sometimes ending their talk, as doth the History of the <hi>Macchabees</hi>; if we have done well, and as the Cause required, it is that we desire; if we have spoken slenderly and barely, we have done we could. But <hi>God hath made my mouth like a sword,</hi> saith <hi>Esay.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 49. 5.</note> And <hi>we have received,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>not the spirit of the World, but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is of God, that we might know the things that are given to us of God, which things also we speak, not in words, which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost doth teach.</hi> This is that which the Prophets mean by those Books written full within, and without; which Books were so often delivered them to eat, not because God fed them with Ink and Paper, but to teach us, that so oft as he imployed them in this heavenly Work, they neither spake nor wrote any word of their own, but uttered syllable by syllable as the Spirit put it into their mouths, no otherwise than the Harp or the Lute doth give a sound according to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hands that holdeth and striketh it with skill. The difference is only this: An instrument, whether it be a Pipe or Harp, maketh a distinction in the times and sounds, which distinction is well perceived of the Hearer, the Instrument it self understanding not what is Piped or Harped. The Prophets and holy men of God, not so: <hi>I opened my mouth,</hi> saith <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>God reached me a scroul, saying, Son of man, cause thy Belly to eat, and fill thy Bowels with this I give thee; I ate it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezekiel 3.</note> 
                        <hi>and it was sweet in my mouth as honey,</hi> saith the Prophet. Yea sweeter, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, than either honey or the honey comb. For herein they were not like Harps or Lutes, but they felt, they felt, the power and strength of their own words. When they spake of our peace, every corner of their hearts was filled with joy. When they prophesied of mournings, lamentations, and woes to fall upon us, they wept in the bitterness and indignation of Spirit, the arm of the Lord being mighty and strong upon them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. On this manner were all the Prophesie of holy Scripture. Which Prophesies, although they contain nothing which is not profitable for our instruction, yet as one Star differeth from another in glory, so every word of Prophesie hath a treasure of matter in it, but all matters are not of like importance, as all Treasures, are not of equal price. The chief and principal matter of Prophesie is the promise of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Peace, Holiness, Glory, Victory, Immortality, unto every Soul which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that Jesus is Christ, of the <hi>Iew</hi> first, and of the <hi>Gentile.</hi> Now because the doctrine of Salvation to be looked for by Faith in him, who was in outward appearance as it had been a man forsaken of God; in him who was numbred, judged, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wicked; in him whom men did see busseted on the face, scofft at by Souldiers, scourged by Tormentors, hanged on the Cross, pierced to the Heart; in him whom the eyes of many Witnesses did behold, when the anguish of his Soul enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to roar, as if his heart had rent in sunder; <hi>O my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> I say, because the doctrine of Salvation by him, is a thing improbable to a natural man, that whether we preach to the Gentile, or to the Jew, the one condemneth our Faith as madnesse, the other as Blasphemy; therefore to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish, and confirm the certainty of this saving Truth in the hearts of men, the Lord, together with their Preachings, whom he sent immediately from himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal

these things unto the World, mingled Prophesies of things, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, which were to come in every age from time to time, till the very last of the latter dayes, that by those things wherein we see daily their words fulfilled and done, we might have strong consolation in the hope of things which are not seen, because they have revealed as well the one as the other. For when many things are spoken of before in Scripture, whereof we see first one thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and then another, and so a third, perceive we not plainly, that God doth nothing else but lead us along by the hand, till he have settled us upon the rock of an assured hope, that not one jot or tittle of his Word shall pass till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled? It is not therefore said in vain, that these godless wicked ones <hi>were spoken of before.</hi>

                     <p>Hereby it is come to pass, as you see this day, that the Man of Sinne doth war against us, not by men of a Language which we cannot understand, but he cometh as <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> against <hi>Iudah,</hi> and bringeth the fruit of our own Bodies to eat us up, that the bowels of the Childe may be made the Mother's grave; and hath caused no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Brethren to forsake their Native Countrey, and with all disloyalty to cast off the yoke of their Allegiance to our dread Soveraign, whom God in mercy hath set over them; for whose safeguard, if they carried not the hearts of Tygers in the bosomes of men, they would think the dearest blood in their Bodies well spent. But now, saith <hi>Abiah</hi> to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> Ye think ye be able to resist the Kingdom of the Lord, which is in the hands of the Sonnes of <hi>David.</hi> Ye be a great multitude, the golden Calves are with you, which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> made you for gods: Have ye not driven away the Priests of the Lord, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Levites,</hi> and have made you Priests like the People of Nations? Whosoever cometh with a young Bullock, and seven Rams, the same may be a Priest of them that are no gods. If I should follow the Comparison, and here uncover the Cup of those deadly and ugly Abominations wherewith this <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> of whom we speak, hath made the Earth so drunk, that it hath retled under us, I know your godly Hearts would loath to see them. For my own part, I delight not to take in such filth; I had rather take a Garment upon my Shoulders, and go with my face from them, to cover them. The Lord open their Eyes, and cause them, if it be possible, at the length to see, how they are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blinde, and naked! Put it, O Lord, in their hearts, to seek white Rayment, and to cover themselves, that their filthy nakednesse may no longer appear! For, beloved in Christ, we bow our Knees, and lift up our hands to Heaven in our Chambers secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and openly in our Churches we pray heartily and hourly, even for them also: though the Pope hath given out as a Judge, in a solemn Declaratory Sentence of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> against this Land, That our gracious Lady hath quite abolished <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> within her Realm; and his Scholars, whom he hath taken from the midst of us, have in their published Writings charged us: nor onely nor to have any holy Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies unto the Lord for Prayer, but to hold a Common School of Sinne and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; to hold Sacriledge to be God's Service; Unfaithfulnesse, and breach of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to God, to give it to a Strumpet, to be a Vertue; to abandon Fasting, to abhor Confession, to mislike with Penance; to like well of Usury; to charge none with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; to finde no good before God in single life; not in no well-working, that all men, as they fall to us, are much worse, and more, than afore, corrupted. I do not add one word, or syllable, unto that which Mr. <hi>Bristow,</hi> a man both born and sworn amongst us, hath taught his hand to deliver to the view of all. I appeal to the Conscience of every Soul, that hath been truly converted by us, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his heart were never raised up to God by our Preaching; Whether the words of our Exhortation never w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>O merciful God! If Heaven and Earth in this case do not witness with us, and against them, let us be razed out from the Land of the Living! Let the Earth on which we stand, swallow us quick, as it hath done <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram!</hi> But if we belong unto the Lord our God, and have not forsaken him: if our Priests, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> minister unto the Lord, and the Levites in their Office: if we offer unto the Lord every morning and every evening the Burnt-offerings, and sweet Incense of Prayers, and Thanksgiving;<note place="margin">1 Chron. 13.</note> if the Bread be set in order upon the pure Table, and the Candlestick of Gold, with the Lamps thereof, burn every morning; that is to say, if amongst us God's blessed Sacraments be duly administred, his holy Word sincerely and daily preached; if we keep the Watch of the Lord our God, and if ye have forsaken him: then doubt ye not, this God is with us as a Captain, his Priests with sounding Trumpets must cry alarm against you; <hi>O ye Children of Israel, fight not against the Lord God of your Fathers, for ye shall not prosper.</hi>

Wherein first of all, whosoever hath an eye to see, let him open it, and he shall well perceive, how careful the Lord is for his Children, how desirous to see them profit and grow up to a manly stature in Christ, how loath to have them any way mis-led, either by examples of the wicked, or by inticements of the world, and by provocation of the flesh, or by any other means forcible to deceive them, and likely to estrange their hearts from God. For God is not at that point with us, that he careth not whether we sink or swim. No, he hath written our names in the Palm of his Hand, in the Signet upon his Finger are we graven; in Sentences not onely of Mercy, but of Judgement also, we are remembred.

For, sith God doth not dwell in Temples which are unclean, sith a Shrine cannot be a Sanctuary unto him; and this Supper is received as a Seal unto us, that we are his House and his Sanctuary; that his Christ is as truly united to me, and I to him, as my arm is united and knit unto my shoulder; that he dwelleth in me as verily, as the elements of Bread and Wine abide within me; which perswasion, by receiving these dreadful mysteries, we profess our selves to have: a due comfort, if truly; and if in hypocrisie, then wo worth us. Therefore ere we put forth our hands to take this blessed Sacrament, we are charged to examine and to try our hearts, whether God be in us of a truth or no: and if by Faith and love unfeigned we be found the Temples of the Holy Ghost, then to judge, whether we have had such regard every one to our building, that the Spirit which dwelleth in us hath no way been vexed, molested and grieved; or if it have, as no doubt sometimes it hath by incredulity, sometimes by breach of charity, sometimes by want of zeal, sometimes by spots of life, even in the best and most perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; (for who can say his heart is clean?)

No, it is not the worthiness of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, it is the vertue of him in whom we believe, by which we stand sure, as houses that are builded upon a Rock. He is a Wise-man, which hath builded his house upon a Rock; for he hath chosen a good foundation, and no doubt his house will stand; but how shall it stand; Verily, by the strength of the Rock which beareth it, and by nothing else.

For if thou boasteth thy self of thy Faith, know this, That Christ chose his Apostles, his Apostles chose not him; that <hi>Israel</hi> followed not the Rock, but the Rock followed <hi>Israel</hi>; and that thou bearest not the Root,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> but the Root thee. So that every Heart must thus think, and every Tongue must thus speak, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,</hi> nor unto any thing which is within us, but unto thy name onely, onely to thy Name belongeth all the praise of all the Treasures and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of every Temple which is of God.

Can he have any part or fellowship with <hi>Peter,</hi> and with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of <hi>Peter,</hi> which thinketh so vilely of building the precious Temples of the Holy Ghost? Let his money perish with him; and he with it, because he judgeth that the Gift of God may be sold for money.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. But, beloved in the Lord, deceive not your selves, neither suffer ye your selves to be deceived: Ye can receive no more ease nor comfort for your Souls by another man's faith, than warmth for your Bodies by another man's cloaths; or sustenance by the bread which another man doth eat. The just shall live by his own Faith. <hi>Let a Saint, yea a Martyr, content himself, that he hath cleansed himself of his own sins,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>: No Saint or Martyr can cleanse himself of his own sins. But if so be a Saint or a Martyr can cleanse himself of his own sins, it is sufficient that he can do it for himself. Did ever any man by his death deliver another man from death, except onely the Sonne of God? He indeed was able to Safe-conduct a Thief from the Cross to Paradise: for to this end he came, that being himself pure from sinne, he might obey for Sinners. Thou which thinkest to do the like, and supposest that thou canst justifie another by thy Righteousness, if thou be without sinne, then lay down thy life for thy Brother; dye for me. But if thou be a Sinner, even as I am a Sinner, how can the Oyl of thy Lamp be sufficient both for thee and for me? <hi>Virgins</hi> that are wise, get ye Oyl, while ye have day, into your own Lamps: For out of all peradventure, others, though they would, can neither give nor sell. Edifie your selves in your own most holy faith. And let this be observed for the first <hi>property</hi> of that wherein we ought to edifie our selves.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Our Faith being such, is that indeed which St. <hi>Iude</hi> doth here term <hi>Faith</hi>; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a thing most <hi>holy.</hi> The reason is this, We are justified by <hi>Faith</hi>: For <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and this was imputed unto him for Righteousness. Being justified, all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are covered; God beholdeth us in the Righteousness which is imputed, and not in the Sins which we have committed.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. It is true, we are full of sin, both <hi>original</hi> and <hi>actual</hi>; whosoever denieth it, is a double Sinner, for he is both a Sinner and a Lyar. To deny sin, is most plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove it, because he that saith he hath no sin, lyeth, and by lying proveth that he hath sin.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. But <hi>imputation</hi> of Righteousness hath covered the sins of every Soul which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth; God by pardoning our sin, hath taken it away: So that now, although our transgressions be multiplied above the hairs of our head, yet being justified, we are as free, and as clear, as if there were no one spot or stain of any uncleanness in us. For it is God that justifieth; <hi>And who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's chosen?</hi> saith the Apostle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Now sin being taken away, we are made the righteousness of God in Christ: for <hi>David</hi> speaking of this Righteousness, saith, <hi>Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> No man is blessed, but in the righteousness of God. Every man whose sin is taken away, is blessed. Therefore every man whose sin is covered, is made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in Christ. This Righteousness doth make us to appear most holy, most pure, most unblameable before him.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. This then is the sum of that which I say, Faith doth justifie, Justification washeth away sin; sin removed, we are cloathed with the righteousness which is of God; the righteousness of God maketh us most holy. Every of these I have proved by the testimony of God's own mouth. Therefore I conclude, That Faith is that which maketh us most holy, in consideration whereof, it is called in this place, <hi>Our most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="28">28. To make a wicked and a sinful man most holy through his believing, is more than to create a World of nothing. Our faith most holy! Surely, <hi>Solomon</hi> could not shew the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> so much treasure in all his Kingdom, as is lapt up in these words. O that our hearts were stretched out like tenis, and that the eyes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding were as bright as the Sun, that we might thoroughly know the riches of the glorious inheritance of the Saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, whom he accepteth for pure, and most holy, through our believing. O that
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:66185:336"/>
the Spirit of the Lord would give this Doctrine entrance into the slony and brazen heart of the Jew, which followeth the Law of Righteousness, but cannot attain unto the righteousness of the Law! Wherefore, saith the Apostle, they seek righteousness, and not by faith; wherefore they stumble at Christ, they are bruised, shivered to pieces as a ship that hath run herself upon a Rock. O that God would cast down the eyes of the proud, and humble the souls of the high-minded! that they might at the length abhor the garments of their own flesh, which cannot hide their nakedness, and put on the faith of Christ Jesus, as he did put it on which hath said, <hi>Doubtless I think all thing; but loss, for the excellent knowledge-sake of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I have counted all things loss, and do judge them to be dung, that I might win Christ, and might be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the saith of Christ, even the righteousness which is of God through faith.</hi> O that God would open the Ark of Mercy, wherein this Doctrine lyeth, and set it wide before the eys of poor afflicted Consciences, which fly up and down upon the water of their afflictions, and can see nothing but onely the gulf and deluge of their sinnes, wherein there is no place for them to rest their feet. The God of pity and compassion give you all strength and courage, every day, and every hour, and every moment, to build and edifie your selves in this most pure and holy faith. And thus much both of the thing prescribed in this Exhortation, and also of the properties of the thing, <hi>Build your selves in your most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith.</hi> I would come to the next branch, which is of Prayer, but I cannot lay this matter out of my hands, till I have added somewhat for the applying of it, both to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to our selves.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. For your better understanding of matters contained in this Exhortation, <hi>Build your selves,</hi> you must note, that every Church and Congregation doth consist of a multitude of Believers, as every House is built of many Stones. And although the nature of the Mystical body of the Church be such, that it suffereth no distinction in the invisible members, but whether it be <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> Prince or Prophet, he that is taught or he that teacheth, all are equally Christ's, and Christ is equally theirs: yet in the external administration of the Church of God, because God is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace; it is necessary that in every Congregation there be a distinction, if not of inward dignity, yet of outward degree; so that all are Saints, or seem to be Saints, and should be as they seem: But are all Apostles? If the whole Body were an eye, where were then the hearing? God therefore hath given some to be Apostles, and some to be Pastors, &amp;c. for the edification of the body of Christ. In which work, we are God's labourers (saith the Apostle) and ye are God's husbandry, and God's building.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. The Church, respected with reference unto administration Ecclesiastical, doth generally consist but of two sorts of men, the <hi>Labourers,</hi> and the <hi>Building</hi>; they which are ministred unto, and they to whom the work of the Ministery is committed; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> and the <hi>Flock</hi> over whom the Holy Ghost hath made them Overseers. If the <hi>Guide</hi> of a Congregation, be his name or his degree whatsoever, be diligent in his Vocation, feed the flock of God which dependeth upon him, caring for it, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde; not as though he would tyrannize over God's heritage, but as a pattern unto the Flock, wisely guiding them: If the People in their degree do yield themselves frameable to the truth, not like rough stone or flint, refusing to be smoothed and squared for the building: if the Magistrate do carefully and diligently survey the whole order of the work, providing by Statutes and Laws, and bodily punishments, if need require, that all things may be done according to the rule which cannot deceive; even as <hi>Moses</hi> provided, that all things might be done according to the pattern which he saw in the Mount; there the words of this Exhortation are truly and effectually heard. Of such a Congregation every man will say, <hi>Behold a people that are wise, a people that walk in the Statutes and Ordinances of their God, a people full of knowledge and understanding, a people that have skill in building themselves.</hi> Where it is otherwise, there, <hi>at by sloathfulness the roof doth decay</hi>; and as by <hi>idleness of bands the House droppeth thorow,</hi> as it is in <hi>Eccles. 10. 18.</hi> so first one piece, and then another of their building shall fall away, till there be not a stone left upon a stone.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. We see how fruitless this Exhortation hath been to such as bend all their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel

                        </gap> of building themselves in their most holy faith. God's people have enquired at their mouths, <hi>What shall we do to have Eternal life?</hi> Wherein shall we build and edifie our selves? And they have departed home from their Prophets, and from their Priests, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Doctrines which are Precepts of men: they have been taught to tire out themselves with bodily exercise: those things are enjoyned them, which God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver require at their hands, and the things he doth require are kept from them; their eyes are fed with pictures, and their ears are filled with melody, but their souls do wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and starve, and pine away; they cry for bread, and behold stones are offered them; they ask for fish, and see they have Scorpions in their hands. Thou seest, O Lord, that they build themselves, but not in faith; they feed their Children, but not with food: their Rulers say with shame, Bring, and not build. But God is Righteous; their drunkenness stinketh, their abominations are known, their madness is manifest, the wince hath bound them up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed of their doings. <hi>Ephraim,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> I will turn me therefore from the Priests which do minister unto Idols, and apply this Exhortation to them, whom God hath appointed to feed his Chosen in <hi>Israel.</hi>

What is the reason of this? Our own desires are settled where they should not be. We our selves are like those women which have a longing to eat coals, and lime, aud filth; we are fed, some with honour, some with ease, some with wealth; the Gospel waxeth loathsom and unpleasant in our taste; how should we then have a care to feed others with that, which we cannot fancy our selves!

                     <p n="34">34. In the second of <hi>Haggai, Speak now,</hi> saith God to his Prophet, <hi>Speak now to Zerubbabel, the Son of Shealtiel, Prince of Iudah, and to Iehoshua, the Son of Iehosadak the High-priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, Who is left among you, that saw this House in her first glory, and how do you see it now? Is not this House in your eyes, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of it, is nothing?</hi> The Prophet would have all mens eyes turned to the view of themselves, every sort brought to the consideration of their present state. This is no place to shew what duty <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> or <hi>Iehoshuah</hi> doth owe unto God in this respect. They have, I doubt not, such as put them hereof in remembrance. I ask of you, which are a part of the residue of God's Elect and chosen people, Who is there amongst you that hath taken a survey of the House of God, as it was in the days of the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Jesus Christ? Who is there amongst you, that hath seen and considered this Holy Temple in her first glory? And how do you see it now? Is it not in comparison of the other, almost as nothing? when ye look upon them which have undertaken the charge of your Souls, and know how far these are, for the most part, grown out of kind, how few there be that tread the steps of their antient Predecessors, ye are easily filled with indignation, easily drawn unto these complaints, wherein the difference of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, from former times, is bewailed; easily perswaded to think of them that lived to enjoy the days which now are gone, that surely they were happy in comparison of us that have succeeded them: Were not their Bishops men unreproveable, wise, righteous,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:66185:337"/>
holy, temperate, well-reported of, even of those which were without? Were not their Pastors, Guides, and Teachers, able and willing to exhort with wholsome Doctrine, and to reprove those which gain-said the Truth? had they Priests made of the reffuse of the people? were men, like to the children which were in <hi>Niniveh,</hi> unable to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the right hand and the left, presented to the charge of their Congregations? did their Teachers leave their flocks over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers? did their Prophets enter upon holy things as spoils, without a reverend calling? were their Leaders so unkindly affected towards them, that they could finde in their hearts to sell them as sheep or oxen, not caring how they made them away? But, Beloved, deceive not your selves. Do the faults of your Guides and Pastors offend you? it is your fault if they be thus faulty. <hi>Nullus quimalum Rectorem patitur, cum accuset; quia sai fuit meriti, perversi Pastoris subjacere ditioni,</hi> saith St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> whosoever thou art, whom the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of an evil Governor doth press, accuse thy self, and not him; his being such, is thy deserving. <hi>O ye disobedient Children, turn again,</hi> saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Jer. 3. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>and then will I give you Pastors according to mine own heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> So that the onely way to repair all ruines, breaches, and offensive decays in others, is to begin reformation at your selves. Which that we may all sincerely, seriously, and speedily do, God the Father grant for his Son our Saviour Jesus sake, unto whom, with the Holy Ghost, three Persons, one Eternal, and Everlasting God, be honour, and glory, and praise for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
