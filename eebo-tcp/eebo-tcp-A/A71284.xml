            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

impudent, Socinian Sectarie: but because I desire that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Goodwins</hi> reputation might bee rais'd in none, by any other engine, then by a reall and evident conviction of his deservings: for though to thinke well of those we know not, is counted charity; yet to applaud, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire any, upon no surer ground then the generall vote, is folly, and may prove dangerous: the wombe of our times hath beene too abundantly fruitfull with instances herein many have we seene cast upon perplexing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and some yoaked with desperate errours, and that by those whose persons they have ignorantly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after And I am perswaded, that many tenents in religion (which are now confidently given, and greedily received as wholesome foode) would hardly downe, were they not wrapt up in the sweet fame of such or such mens names. I would not that <hi>Truth</hi> her selfe were entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon such termes: certainely she accompts none her true subjects, but those onely, who are brought under her scepter, by the love of her commanding beauty; not by the parts, learning, holinesse of her choysest agents. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reply (here presented to thy consideration) I gather thus much from the Authours <note place="margin">Vid Preface.</note> words: that it was a worke of recreation, not of labour; and therefore no marvell, if it came into the world with a smiling countenance: and though in this respect, it may be judged by some unlike its father, who is of a wonderfull grave and sober temper; yet upon a strict view, many of his lyneaments are to bee seene in the face of it; I meane, soundnesse of judgement, quickenesse of wit, fairenesse of carriage, yea and mercy too towards his adversary: for had he strucke him in every place, where hee found him naked, hee had left him so blacke and blew, that even <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Walkers</hi> friends would hardly say, this is hee. If any shall except, against the manner of managing this
<pb facs="tcp:42398:3"/>
warfare, and censure his expressions as too light, to hold out with the weightinesse of his matter; I referre such for satisfaction to his owne preface. As far as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, no wiser course can be taken, to charme downe the spirit of anger into sobernesse, then to deale with it in a pleasant way: whether <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Walker</hi> doth strongly sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie with this turbulent passion, none will question, but such as are strangers to his dealings: and I verily beleeve, when the Authour put his Reply into this dresse, he had respect to him alone, to whom he privately sent it, not once deeming (as I conceive) that ever it should be look't upon by so many, and such juditious eyes, as it is now likely to fall under. For it is probable, that neither he nor <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

But wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le the performance thereof was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he brings into the world, a confused medley of the strangest S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cianisme and Christianisme, that was ever heard of. By what figure hee will bee able to salve the breach of his promise, I cannot guesse; though hee hath forc't them to doe him service (as hee conceives) else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, yet I much feare they will here all faile him: for through the whole comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Goodwins Reply.</hi> But if his passion so farre transported him beyond his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualls,
<pb facs="tcp:42398:4"/>
as to charge so innocent a peece with such capitoll crimes; I pittie the man; and expect its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the hands of such as are not infested with so mortall an enemie unto reason. Nor hath hee kept touch with his promise about his owne answer: for though the most part hereof may bee gathered from thence, yet is it made so unlike to what it was, by adding some thing, and substracting others; that in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, it was thought requisite, to print it in that very shape, in which it came at first from betweene his hands, (for to this alone hath the Reply reference) and to couple both it and the Reply in one volume.</p>
            <p>I am consious of no other designe, that the publisher propounded to himselfe, but onely this: to cleare the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and the Authour of it, from those false and foule imputations of lying, forging, &amp;c and to wash off from the face of that truth, they pleade for, those blacke coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Socinianisme, and Arminianisme, which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Walkers</hi> pencill hath drawne over it; that appearing to the eye of the world out of his cloathing; their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency might bee acknowledged in the judgements and consciences of reasonable men. The accomplishment of which designe, will (I dare say) satisfyingly recompence his cost and labour; and inlarge his heart towards the God of peace and truth, who hath given successe to so just, so pious, so commendable an undertaking.</p>

                  <p>FOr the right understanding of the <hi>Apostles</hi> wordes, three things are first to be considered and explained: First, what is here meant by <hi>faith</hi> and beleeving. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what <hi>righteousnes</hi> is here meant. Thirdly what is meant by imputation.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>faith</hi> in this place wee must not understand that naturall habit, and power which is common to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men, who upon their knowledge of things spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or promised, doe give willing assent unto them that they are true, either for the Authority of the speaker, whom they doe respect and judge to bee faithfull: or because they see good reason in the things spoken and promised, and if the things promised tend to their owne good, they rest upon them confidently, and perswade themselves that they are sure and certaine of them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or shall receive and enjoy them in due time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile. But here, by <hi>faith</hi> we are to understand that supernaturall guift and grace of beleeving wrought in the elect, regenerate by the <hi>spirit</hi> shed on them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly through <hi>Iesus Christ, Tit.</hi> 3. 6. which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called most holy <hi>faith, Iude</hi> 20. this <hi>faith</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the other in these foure poynts.</p>
                  <p>First, as that is an habit and power of beleeving, so <note place="margin">1</note> is this, secondly, as that containes in it, <hi>notitiam in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2</note> 
                     <hi>intellectu,</hi> a knowledge and notice of the things spoken &amp; beleeved; so doth this; And as that containes in it <hi>assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum in voluntate</hi> an assent of the wil, so doth this also; And <note place="margin">3</note> as that <hi>faith</hi> when it goeth no further is called historical;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42398:8"/>
so this also: And as that <hi>faith</hi> when it reacheth to good <note place="margin">4.</note> things promised to our selves particularly, to apply them and rest on them, hath also <hi>fiduciam in corde &amp; affectionibus,</hi> a trust and confidence of the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in it; so hath this also, and is cald a firme perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, trust, confidence; but they differ in divers things. First that is a naturall power or habit. This is spirituall, wrought in men by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> dwelling in them and uniting them to <hi>Christ</hi> in one mysticall body. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that hath in it no knowledge but naturall ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from light of naturall reason, nor any assent of the will or confidence in the heart and affections; but such as are drawne, stirred up, and wrought, by meanes of naturall light and common causes; this hath in it a <hi>spirituall</hi> knowledge arising from the spirit of <hi>God,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the understanding; the <hi>Spirit</hi> also enclines and moves the will to give assent, and confirmes the heart with confidence and firme perswasion. Thirdly that is common to all reasonable men; This is proper to the <hi>elect, regenerate,</hi> and <hi>sanctified</hi> by the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> shed on them through <hi>Christ;</hi> and is the first and the radicall grace and vertue of renovation. 4. That hath for the object or things beleeved, either naturall and worldly things onely, or things heavenly and supernaturall, seene and discern'd through the darke mist of naturall reason and assented to, &amp; rested on with a carnall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified will and heart. This hath for the object, things supernaturall, and heavenly and spirituall, discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by supernaturall light, assented to with an holy and sanctified will: confirmed to the heart by a <hi>spirituall</hi> sence: and sweet taste of the things promised, wrought by the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> in the true beleever, apprehending and applying them.</p>
                  <p>But to come neere to the <hi>Text,</hi> the beleeving which the <hi>Apostle</hi> speakes of in the 3. <hi>verse,</hi> and also in the 9. and 22. <hi>verses,</hi> is the <hi>faith</hi> and beleeving of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who divers yeares before this beleeving which is

These were the <hi>promises</hi> which <hi>God</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved to be true, and resting upon the <hi>Lord</hi> by firme <hi>faith</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe for the performance of them, the <hi>Lord</hi> counted it to him for <hi>righteousnes, Gen.</hi> 15. 6. or, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresseth the same sentence in the same sence, though in wordes somewhat different, it was counted to him, <hi>verse</hi> 5. even <hi>faith</hi> was reckoned to him for <hi>righteousnes, verse.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>faith</hi> and beleeving was first an holy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>beleefe:</hi> and the <hi>faith</hi> of a man long before called of <hi>God,</hi> and sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctified by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and made obedient to <hi>God</hi> and his word. Secondly, It was a beleefe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> the blessed <hi>seed</hi> in generall; but more specially that <hi>Christ</hi> according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> should come out of his owne bowels, and that by <hi>Christ</hi> the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> made man of his <hi>seed,</hi> the redemption both of him, and of all his <hi>faithfull seed,</hi> that is, all true beleevers should be wrought and performed, <hi>Gods</hi> wrath appeased, the <hi>Law</hi> fulfilled, <hi>Justice</hi> satisfied, perfect <hi>righteousnes</hi> brought in for their <hi>justification,</hi> and

by his and their union with <hi>Christ</hi> by one spirit, and Communion of all his <hi>benefits,</hi> they should have <hi>God</hi> for their portion and reward, for their <hi>sheild</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and should not need to seeke the blessing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eternall life from their owne <hi>workes,</hi> or their owne <hi>righteousnes;</hi> and fulfilling of the <hi>Law</hi> in their owne persons, but meerely from the free <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of his free gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t in <hi>Christ,</hi> as a reward of <hi>Christs righteousnesse</hi> freely given to them, and of them appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith and beleeving. Thirdly, this faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was not a weake, but a strong <hi>faith,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe without staggering, even a full perswasion, that <hi>God</hi> who quickneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not, as if they were, and was able to make good, and to performe what hee had promised; yea it was a beleeving in hope against hope; that <hi>God</hi> could out of a dead body and womb raise up a lively <hi>seed,</hi> and make them spiritually righteous: who are by nature and according to the <hi>Law</hi> wicked sinners. All these things are manifest by the places before cited, <hi>Gen:</hi> 15. and by the expresse wordes of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this chap: from the tenth <hi>verse</hi> to the end of the Chapter. And thus you see what is meant by <hi>faith</hi> which is here said to be counted for righteous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>righteousnes</hi> here meant is not the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> which is according to the strictnesse and tenour of the <hi>Law;</hi> that is, <hi>righteousnes</hi> of a mans own <hi>works,</hi> performed by every man in his owne person to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> for the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth dispute altogether against that <hi>righteousnes</hi> and proves, that neither <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified or counted of <hi>God</hi> righteous for it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the 2. 5. 6. 13. <hi>verses,</hi> nor any other at any time, as appeares in the Chapter before. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 3. and 9. 32. 10. 3. But here is meant an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which doth not consist in any worke or workes performed by a man himselfe in his owne person, nor in any grace or vertue inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42398:9"/>
but is a <hi>righteousnesse</hi> which <hi>God</hi> of his owne free <hi>grace</hi> doth impute to the true <hi>Beleever;</hi> who by one <hi>Spirit</hi> is united to <hi>Christ,</hi> and hath communion with him, and is called the <hi>righteousnes of Faith,</hi> and doth exclude legal <hi>justification,</hi> by <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of a mans owne <hi>workes,</hi> as appeares in the whole discourse of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this and the former Chapter, and in diverse other places of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> especially <hi>ver.</hi> 13. of this 4 <hi>Chap.</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 27. 28.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the phrase of <hi>imputing,</hi> or counting a thing to one signifies both in the Old and New <hi>Testament,</hi> an Act of <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>estimation,</hi> by which a thing is <hi>judged, esteemed, reckoned, and accounted</hi> to be as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and then it is <hi>just,</hi> and according to <hi>truth:</hi> but when a thing is <hi>counted,</hi> or <hi>judged, thought, and esteemed,</hi> to be as it is not, then it is <hi>unjust,</hi> and not according to <hi>truth.</hi> Now <hi>Gods thoughts</hi> are alwaies <hi>just,</hi> and his <hi>judgement</hi> is according to <hi>truth. Rom.</hi> 2. 2. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>lust imputing and counting,</hi> is here ment, for <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>account,</hi> and <hi>Iudge</hi> of all <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> so as they are. Of <hi>uniust counting,</hi> and <hi>imputing</hi> fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing truely as the thing is, we have examples also, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13. 13. where it is said of the chosen <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> that they were counted <hi>faithfull, viz</hi> upon former experience of their <hi>faithfulnes,</hi> and therefore the Office of distributing to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> was counted to them. And <hi>Levit</hi> 17. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here it is said, <hi>Blood shall be imputed to that man he hath shed blood, and shall be cut off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people.</hi> And <hi>Psal 22. 30. a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, this word <hi>impute</hi> or <hi>count,</hi> signifies some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the most proper sense a bare Act of the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>thought,</hi> as <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 28. where a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to be counted wise when he holdeth his peace; that is, men for the present judge or thinke him wise, at least in that point of <hi>silence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes it signifies in a more full sense, not onely <hi>thinking, Iudging,</hi> and <hi>counting persons</hi> to be good or bad, just, or unjust, innocent, or guilty; but also dealing with them, and using them accordingly, as in the places before named, 1 <hi>Kings 1. 21. Nehem.</hi> 13. 13. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 4. and <hi>Psal</hi> 22. 30. also 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 15. where <hi>Abimelech</hi> purging himselfe before <hi>Saul,</hi> from the offence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy with <hi>David</hi> against him (as <hi>Doeg</hi> had falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused him) saith, <hi>Let not the King impute any thing unto his servant,</hi> that is, Let him not thinke or judge his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>guilty,</hi> nor deale with him, or use him as a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it signifies by a Metonymie of the <hi>cause</hi> for the <hi>effect,</hi> condemning, and punishing an offence in a guilty person as he hath deserved, and to deale with him and use him as hee is justly thought and judged to have deserved, as 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 19. Shimei</hi> said, <hi>Let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me:</hi> he doth not desire that <hi>David</hi> would not thinke, nor judge, nor count his <hi>iniquitie</hi> to be no <hi>iniquitie,</hi> that had beene against all reason, but that for the <hi>satisfaction</hi> which he had made, in coming first of all to the house of <hi>Joseph</hi> to meet <hi>David,</hi> and to bring him againe to his Kingdome, <hi>David</hi> would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pardon his offence, and not proceed against him, and punish him as justly, and worthy of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it signifies by a Metaphor, to count one thing as it were another, or no better then another, or of the same value, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 14. where a flattering salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or blessing, given with a loud voyce, is said to be counted a <hi>Curse,</hi> that is, esteemed no better then if it were a <hi>Curse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Somtimes to use one, as if he counted him of another <hi>Condition,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 15. where it is said of <hi>Laban, that

he counted his Daughters strangers;</hi> that is, used them as if he had counted them strangers: and <hi>Iob.</hi> 31. 10. where <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>that God counteth him for his enemy;</hi> that is, <hi>afflicteth,</hi> and plagueth him, as if he counted him an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes the word signifies to <hi>skore up</hi> or to put upon a mans <hi>account</hi> or <hi>reckoning,</hi> either the <hi>offence</hi> or <hi>debt</hi> which he himselfe runs into; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. where it is said, <hi>that sinne is not imputed when there is no Law:</hi> that is, it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now all laid together the meaning of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in these wordes is this, that if a man <hi>uncircumcised</hi> doe keepe all the Commandements, and performe the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of the Law,</hi> his state of Gentilisme comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it the <hi>righteousnes of the Law,</hi> shall be counted and accepted for the state of an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous man circumcised</hi> in <hi>heart,</hi> and hee though <hi>uncircumcised in flesh,</hi> and a Gentile in <hi>outward estate,</hi> shall be counted of <hi>God</hi> a <hi>true Israelite without guile,</hi> truely <hi>circumcised</hi> with <hi>inward spirituall circumcision of the heart</hi> in the <hi>spirit, whose praise is not of men, but of God.</hi> This sence and meaning of the wordes, and of this phrase is so cleere and manifest, and so perfectly agreeable to all true reason, that none can deny it, unlesse hee will set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to rebell against the light; and this phrase being the same which this <hi>Apostle</hi> doth use againe, where hee mentions counting and imputing of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beleeving for righteousnes to Abraham,</hi> and to every true <hi>beleever,</hi> doth give light for the discovering of the true sense and meaning of the wordes, the phrase being the very same. Wherefore if we will follow the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe, and tread after him in the same steps, being the surest guide, and best expounder of his owne wordes and meaning, we must by <hi>Abrahams beleeving</hi> by a <hi>Metalepsis</hi> or double trope, with our learned Divines, understand <hi>Abraham standing in the state of a true beleever, united by one spirit unto God in Christ, and having communion of his satisfaction and righteousnes, which were of force from the beginning to save and iustifie, and to make God the reward of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</hi> And <hi>by faith imputed</hi> or <hi>counted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> wee must not understand <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>a proper sense,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42398:12"/>
but by a double <hi>trope,</hi> for the state and condition of a <hi>true faithfull man,</hi> and for that which <hi>faith comprehends</hi> and <hi>includes</hi> in it, even the <hi>perfect righteousnes and full satisfaction of Christ God and man:</hi> By <hi>righteousnes</hi> we must understand the state of a <hi>man justified,</hi> or <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall righteousnes communicated</hi> to the <hi>justified man,</hi> and made <hi>his</hi> for <hi>iustification.</hi> And by <hi>counting</hi> and <hi>imputing</hi> we must understand the <hi>accepting, approving, esteeming</hi> &amp; <hi>iudging</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and every true <hi>beleever,</hi> so soone as he appeares <hi>faithfull</hi> to be in the state of a man <hi>iustified,</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> setting on his skore, and <hi>counting,</hi> &amp; <hi>imputing</hi> to him being <hi>faithfull,</hi> the <hi>righteousnes of Christ</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>faith,</hi> which is indeed and in truth made <hi>his</hi> by <hi>spirituall union</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heare then the true paraphrase upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> words, shewing the true sense and meaning of them, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> upon a true <hi>inward spirituall sense</hi> of his <hi>union</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> did beleeve and was surely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that <hi>God</hi> was his <hi>reward,</hi> and this his <hi>beleefe</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> comprehending <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and containing in it after a sort the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ, God</hi> counted it to him for <hi>righteousnes;</hi> that is, set it on his skore, and reckoned it to him for <hi>iustification,</hi> and judged, esteemed and accepted him for a man truly <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> as indeed he was, and so whosoever doth not rest on his owne <hi>workes</hi> for <hi>iustification,</hi> nor seeketh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be <hi>iustified,</hi> but by <hi>faith</hi> seeketh that <hi>righteousnes</hi> which makes him <hi>righteous</hi> by the <hi>communion</hi> of it, when in himselfe by nature he is ungodly, his <hi>faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending</hi> in it <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is counted for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> because it settles him in the state of a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man;</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> setting on his skore <hi>Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>righteousnes,</hi> doth accept him for a man <hi>iustified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second argument confirming the <hi>exposition</hi> is drawn from the <hi>Apostles</hi> owne wordes in the fourth <hi>verse:</hi> now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

counted for <hi>righteousnes</hi> brings with it a <hi>reward,</hi> also to the <hi>beleever</hi> which is counted, not of debt, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>grace,</hi> now there is nothing which can bring the <hi>reward</hi> of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> to a <hi>beleever,</hi> when it is counted to him and set on his skore, but the perfect <hi>righteousnes</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> that, all grant to bee meritoribus of <hi>eternall life</hi> to all that are partakers of it, and because the <hi>communion</hi> and <hi>imputation</hi> of it is of <hi>Gods</hi> free <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>faith</hi> by which we receive, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and enjoy it, is <hi>Gods free gift,</hi> therefore the <hi>reward,</hi> to wit, <hi>eternall life</hi> is of <hi>free Grace,</hi> and not of debt, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> here saith. Whereupon the the Conclusion followes, that the thing counted for <hi>righteousnes</hi> is the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> apprehended by <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the 6. and 7. <hi>verses</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth expressely; that the thing <hi>imputed</hi> by <hi>God</hi> is <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes;</hi> and such a <hi>righteousnes,</hi> as being <hi>imputed,</hi> brings <hi>forgivenesse</hi> of iniquity, and covers <hi>sinnes,</hi> and so makes the <hi>beleever</hi> blessed. Now there is no <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to be found among all mankinde, besides <hi>Christs</hi> perfect <hi>righteousnes</hi> and full <hi>satisfaction;</hi> and that is a perfect <hi>propitiation</hi> for all <hi>sinnes,</hi> and an <hi>expiation</hi> of all <hi>iniquity</hi> to them who by <hi>faith</hi> have put on <hi>Christ,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the true <hi>righteousnes</hi> which is <hi>imputed</hi> to every <hi>beleever</hi> for <hi>justification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that which is here said to be <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and to every <hi>beleever,</hi> is for <hi>righteousnesse</hi> to <hi>iustification,</hi> for the discourse of the <hi>Apostle</hi> here, and in the 3. and 5. <hi>chap.</hi> is altogether of <hi>iustifying,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verse</hi> 20. 24. 26. 28. 30 and also <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 1. 16. 18, 19. in all which places he mentions <hi>iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>iustifying;</hi> And here in this 4. <hi>chap.</hi> he brings <hi>Abrahams</hi> example, and <hi>Davids</hi> testimony to shew how we are <hi>iustified:</hi> now there is nothing which doth serve to us for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to <hi>iustification,</hi> but that which is found in <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Mediatour,</hi> even his <hi>righteousnes</hi> and perfect fulfilling of the <hi>Law;</hi> so this <hi>Apostle</hi> doth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42398:13"/>
plainely affirme and teach <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 19. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 3. 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 3. 4. Therefore this <hi>righteousnes</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true <hi>beleeving</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the faithfull <hi>counted</hi> and <hi>imputed</hi> to them, and set on their skore for their <hi>iustification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that <hi>exposition</hi> of a phrase or speech of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which is warranted by other places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> wherefore that <hi>phrase</hi> is used, is to be judged the best <hi>exposition;</hi> this none can with any reason deny, for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> speaking in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is the best <hi>expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of his owne meaning. Now this <hi>exposition,</hi> that <hi>imputing</hi> or <hi>counting</hi> a thing for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is no more but declaring a man thereby to be <hi>righteous,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the Testimony of <hi>righteousnes,</hi> is warranted by other <hi>Scriptures</hi> wheresoever it is used. Therefore this is to be judged the best <hi>exposition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For confirmation of the <hi>assumption</hi> or <hi>minor</hi> we have that place of holy <hi>Scripture, Psal.</hi> 106. in which onely and no where else, a thing is said to be <hi>imputed</hi> or <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to a man for <hi>righteousnes; viz.

                        </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> then <hi>Phineas</hi> stood up (saith the <hi>Psalmist)</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted judgement, and that was <hi>counted</hi> to him for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> now no man can understand, that this act was <hi>accepted</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to <hi>justification,</hi> for then a man may be <hi>iustified</hi> before <hi>God</hi> by one god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealous act of his owne, which is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> utterly condemneth for a grosse errour, and bends his whole discourse against it. The true sense and meaning of this <hi>phrase</hi> is no more but this, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> performing such a godly zealous act, as is proper to a faithfull <hi>righteous</hi> man onely, who hath the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>regeneration,</hi> and of <hi>sanctification</hi> dwelling in him: uniting him to <hi>Christ,</hi> and making him by <hi>faith</hi> a true partaker of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>righteousnes, God</hi> upon this act gave him the Testimony of <hi>righteousnes:</hi> and declared him to be a <hi>righteous</hi> man truely <hi>iustified.</hi> Therefore the

                     <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>imputing</hi> or <hi>counting faith</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth no more but this, that the true <hi>beleever</hi> is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a <hi>righteous</hi> man, and <hi>God</hi> giveth him the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>righteousnes,</hi> because he is indeed partaker of <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> which he hath apprehended and applied by <hi>faith.</hi> If I should insist upon humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, and the opinions of Orthodox <hi>expositours</hi> of these wordes both ancient and <hi>moderne</hi> for the further proofe of this <hi>exposition,</hi> a large volume would be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough: for the particular rehearsing of them all, let these five arguments suffice.</p>

               <p>FIrst, whereas they hould, that <hi>faith</hi> in a proper li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall sense; that is, considered in it selfe without relation to any other thing, is counted to every true <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to <hi>iustification,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in and of us, no other thing for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>workes</hi> performed in our owne persons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Law,</hi> nor <hi>Christs</hi> perfect <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and fulfilling of the <hi>Law,</hi> made ours by <hi>spirituall union</hi> and <hi>communion,</hi> and accepted of <hi>God</hi> for us. This I prove to be <hi>false, hereticall,</hi> and <hi>blasphemous</hi> by these Arguments following.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Faith taken in a proper sense, is a part of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and obedience to the Law of</hi> God, <hi>which above all things requires that we give honour to</hi> God, <hi>by beleeving him and his word, and trusting in him as our onely Rock, and the God of our strength and salvation. They therefore teaching, That faith in a proper sense is counted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, do teach, that we are iustified by a worke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law performed in our owne persons, and that this is the onely righteousnes which God requires any way of us
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42398:14"/>
for iustification: Therefore their opinion is hereticall, more impious then the Pelagian and Popish Heresies concerning iustification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that which was imputed to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and is imputed to true beleevers, is righteousnes, so the Apostle affirmes, ver.</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>But faith is not righteousnes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a proper sense, for righteousnes is a perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law, as sinne is transgression of the Law:</hi> Therefore <hi>faith in a proper sense is not righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>that which chargeth</hi> God <hi>with error, and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in his iudgement, is blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This opinion, that</hi> God <hi>counts faith for righteousnes, that is, thinketh, iudgeth, and esteemeth it to be righteousnesse taken in a proper sense, chargeth</hi> God <hi>with error and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in his Iudgement;</hi> Therefore <hi>it is blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they pleade, that <hi>God</hi> by <hi>his soveraigne power,</hi> may <hi>graciously count</hi> that which is not <hi>righteousnes,</hi> for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> to the <hi>beleever:</hi> I answere, that <hi>God</hi> by <hi>his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power,</hi> cannotly, nor erre, nor <hi>Iudge unrighteously,</hi> it is contrary to <hi>his infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal Iustice,</hi> which wil not be <hi>satisfied</hi> without <hi>fulfilling</hi> of his <hi>iust Law,</hi> and <hi>perfect righteousnes communicated,</hi> and <hi>imputed</hi> to us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a base <hi>shift,</hi> and wicked <hi>pretence,</hi> devised to cover their <hi>blasphemy,</hi> by that which is indeed, a greater <hi>blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> that opinion which denyeth, and taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the meanes by which <hi>God</hi> is revealed to be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iust, mercifull,</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> and makes the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>perfect fulfilling of the Law,</hi> a vaine and needlesse thing, is most <hi>Hereticall, impious,</hi> and <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion, that <hi>God</hi> by his soveraigne power can, and doth <hi>count,</hi> and <hi>accept, faith</hi> in a <hi>proper sense</hi> for <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> to <hi>Iustification,</hi> without <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> and <hi>righteousnes,</hi> takes away these meanes, and makes <hi>Christs fulfilling of the Law,</hi> a <hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse</hi>

thing. Therefore it is an <hi>impious hereticall</hi> and <hi>blasphemous opinion.</hi> The meanes by which <hi>God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be <hi>infinitly Iust, mercifull</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> are these: Namely, First, that he cannot be reconciled to man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a full <hi>satisfaction</hi> made to his <hi>iust</hi> Law by mens <hi>surety</hi> in their stead, and by him <hi>communicated</hi> to them, and made theirs as truely as if they had <hi>fulfilled</hi> the Law in their owne <hi>persons,</hi> and though the <hi>satisfaction</hi> be of <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite valve,</hi> yet it cannot profit them till they have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of it, and be <hi>partakers</hi> thereof: this is that which reveales <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>infinitely Iust,</hi> and that his <hi>infinit iustice</hi> being so <hi>strict,</hi> he would <hi>mercifully</hi> give his owne Son to become <hi>man,</hi> and in <hi>mans</hi> nature, to make such a full <hi>satisfaction</hi> for <hi>men,</hi> and by his <hi>Spirit</hi> shed on them through <hi>Christ,</hi> would <hi>unite</hi> them unto him in one <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>communicate</hi> him with all his <hi>benefits</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> to them, to be truely <hi>theirs,</hi> and to <hi>satisfy</hi> for <hi>them.</hi> This reveales his <hi>infinite mercy, bounty,</hi> and <hi>wisedome:</hi> And by these meanes, this opinion takes away <hi>Gods iustice,</hi> while it sets <hi>God</hi> forth to be such a one as can dispence with is <hi>iustice</hi> and accept <hi>faith</hi> in a proper sense for <hi>righteousnes</hi> which is no <hi>righteousnes,</hi> but onely a weake imperfect <hi>worke</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> which we owe to the Law. If Gods <hi>justice</hi> may thus be dispensed with, and a weake thing in fraile man, counted for <hi>righteousnes</hi> without any <hi>communion,</hi> or <hi>imputation.</hi> What need was there of <hi>Christs Death, suffering,</hi> and <hi>obedience; God</hi> might as well have accepted the sacrifice of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> or the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and <hi>obedience</hi> of a meere man, and so the <hi>full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is vaine and <hi>needlesse,</hi> and it was want of <hi>wisedome</hi> in <hi>God</hi> to spend so much of <hi>Christs blood</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> in <hi>vaine,</hi> when by his <hi>soveraigne power</hi> he might have accounted a lesse thing for <hi>mans ransome.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this opinion is <hi>blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> that opinion which overthrowes the <hi>sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the true use of them, is <hi>hereticall</hi> and <hi>blasphemous.</hi>

                     <hi>The third, which hee calls his second mayne Argument or proofe, is drawne from the scope of the place, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>

                     <hi>of the</hi> Apostle <hi>in his discourse of</hi> justification, <hi>here in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42398:20"/>
these Chapters of this</hi> Epistle, <hi>it runs thus being reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a</hi> Syllogisme. <hi>The scope of the place, and intent of the</hi> Apostle, <hi>is to hedge up as it were with thornes the false way of</hi> justification <hi>which lay through workes, and to put men by from attempting any going that way; and also to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the true way of</hi> justification <hi>to them; that is; to to make knowne unto them; what they must doe, and what God requires of them for</hi> justification, <hi>and what hee will accept at their hands, instead of the workes of the Law, and that is it which he heare saith, is</hi> imputed <hi>for</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. <hi>Now</hi> faith <hi>and</hi> beleeving <hi>in the proper and formall signification is that which they must doe and performe to their</hi> justification, <hi>which also</hi> God <hi>requires of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st ad of the</hi> workes <hi>of the</hi> Law, <hi>and will accept at their hands instead of them. Therefore it is</hi> faith <hi>in a proper sense which is here by the</hi> Apostle <hi>to be counted for</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</p>
                  <p>In the first proposition we have an heape of lyes mixt <note place="margin">Ans.</note> with contradiction, first, in that he saith, the <hi>scope</hi> of the <hi>Apostle</hi> is to put men from the false way of <hi>justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> which lies through <hi>workes,</hi> and to discover the true way by making them know what they must doe, and performe for <hi>justification;</hi> here like a mad or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man he contradicts himselfe, for, who doth not see that the way of doing and performing is the way which lyes through workes, and that if a thing done and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us be counted for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to <hi>iustification,</hi> then the way of <hi>iustification</hi> lies through workes done by us: which if they be iust and lawfull, are <hi>workes</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> Secondly, if he by the way which lay through <hi>workes</hi> understands mens owne <hi>workes</hi> done in obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> it is true which he saith; that this is the false way; and that which hee calls the true way; <hi>viz.</hi> by mens doing and performing, is either the same with it, or else worse; and so hee speakes a most grosse untruth, in calling it the true way, being the same with the false way; but if by the way which lies through
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42398:21"/>
                     <hi>workes</hi> he meanes seeking after <hi>Christs righteousnes</hi> which consists in <hi>workes</hi> of obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> then his wordes are most false, wicked and blasphemous, in that he calls this the false way to <hi>iustification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that he saith, <hi>God</hi> requires something to be don, and performed by men for their <hi>iustification,</hi> and that is it, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith is <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> this is most false, neither doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any such thing in this place, for this is to set up <hi>iustification</hi> by doing, and <hi>workes</hi> of our owne, which he altogether opposeth, and his whole scope is bent against it, and to shew; that all which we are to looke to, is to receive that which is freely given of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>imputed</hi> to us for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> that is, the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of him who is <hi>God;</hi> as he often calls it in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. and 10. 3. here then behold how hee makes the new <hi>covenant</hi> a conditionall <hi>Covenant,</hi> and not of free <hi>grace;</hi> promising <hi>iustification</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mens doing.</p>
                  <p>In briefe, besides the contradictions and other absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and untruthes in this <hi>Argument</hi> before noted, I finde these grosse errours in the carriage of it, One is; in that he saith, <hi>God</hi> doth not require of us the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>iustification,</hi> this hee required of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer; that <hi>God</hi> requires nothing of us for our <hi>iustification,</hi> for wee are <hi>iustified</hi> freely by his <hi>grace</hi> through the redemption that is in <hi>Iesus Christ Rom.</hi> 3. 24, that is, by the free gift and communion of the <hi>satisfaction</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> made for our <hi>redemption;</hi> but yet the thing which <hi>God</hi> requires in our behalfe, is that <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us for the receiving, applying and enjoying of that <hi>righteousnes</hi> for <hi>iustification,</hi> is <hi>faith,</hi> which is not of our selves, but is the gift of <hi>God, Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. for <hi>God</hi> worketh in us the will and power to beleeve, and actuall beleeving also, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. and all this by his <hi>spirit</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42398:21"/>
dwelling in us uniting us to <hi>Christ,</hi> and so bringing us to communion of all his benefits, even of his <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> to <hi>iustification:</hi> and this is the true intent and scope of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> to draw us from seeking <hi>iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by any <hi>worke,</hi> which we can doe, or which <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us for that end, and to make us looke up to the <hi>redemption</hi> which is in <hi>Christ;</hi> and in his satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on apprehended by <hi>faith</hi> to rest for <hi>iustification:</hi> as for this phrase, of <hi>Gods</hi> requiring <hi>Christs righteousnes</hi> of us, it is harsh and unsavoury, yea absurd; as if one should say <hi>God</hi> requires, that the particular and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall act done by another, bee not done by him, but by us; which implies a contradiction; but this, that <hi>God</hi> requires the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> not for our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe; this implies; that <hi>Christ</hi> had need of <hi>iustification,</hi> and was bound to fulfill the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for himselfe; and savours of <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Samosatenian</hi> Heresie which denies <hi>Christs God-head;</hi> for if <hi>Christs</hi> humane nature being from the first conception most pure, upright and holy, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally united to his <hi>God-head,</hi> and so the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heire</hi> of all things; who can doubt but that in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe he was worthy of all Glory, at <hi>Gods</hi> right hand from his birth, as his taking of our nature upon him was altogether for us, so his infirmities, sufferings, death, and continuance on Earth for the performance of all <hi>righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to the whole <hi>Law,</hi> was for us, and for all the Elect, who of old beleeved in him to come for them, and who now doe in beleeve him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to Glory according to his humanity, to thinke or say that he had need to justifie himselfe, and to merit by his <hi>righteousnes</hi> the state of Glory, is in effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he was <hi>God</hi> infinitely worthy of all Glory, as he was the onely begotten Sonne of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heire</hi> of all things. Another grosse error is, that he calls <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving</hi> a thing don and performed by us, when as the <hi>Apostle</hi> affirmes, and all Christians confesse, that our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42398:22"/>
                     <hi>beleeving</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> is not of our selves, <hi>but the gift of God,</hi> and the <hi>worke</hi> and motion of his <hi>Spirit</hi> in us.</p>
                  <p>A third untruth and grosse absurdity or rather blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is in the last wordes, where he affirmes, that if the <hi>Apostle</hi> had said unto them, that they must bee <hi>justified</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> or by <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> this had beene rather to cast a snare upon them, then to have opened a dore of life and <hi>saluation</hi> unto them. Farre bee it from mee and all true Christians not to detest, and curse with the curse of <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> that mouth which proclaimes and obstinately maintaines, that teaching <hi>iustification</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> and by his <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> is casting of a snare on men, and not opening a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dore of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>In the third place he layes down his <hi>arguments</hi> against the true <hi>Orthodox</hi> interpretation of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, concerning imputation of <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which interpretation he goeth about to overthrow, by severall circumstances or passages in the context.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first Argument reduced into forme runs thus, that the Apostle who desired to speake to mens understanding,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Arg.</note> 
                     <hi>should in the weighty point of iustification, time after time, and often without ever explaining himselfe, or changing his speech, use so strange harsh and uncouth an expression, and figure of speech as is not to be found in all his writings, is a thing most unlikely and not to be beleeved: But this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preta ion</hi> viz. <hi>Fathers upon him such an harsh expression, and figure of speech, without ever explaining of himselfe, as is not to be found in all his writings, saying, that</hi> faith <hi>or beleeving is imputed for</hi> righteousnes <hi>time after time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out over changing his speech, and meaning, that indeed</hi> Christs righteousnes <hi>is imputed, which was to speake ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he might conceale his mind then reveale it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this interpretation layeth on the Apostle a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and is false and not to be beleeved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42398:22"/>
To the <hi>Assumption</hi> I answer, that it is an heape of <note place="margin">Ans.</note> manifest and impudent lies. First, it is no harsh, strange, and uncouth expression to use a <hi>figure</hi> of speech, and by <hi>saith</hi> and <hi>beleeving</hi> to meane the state, or a man in the state of a true faithfull <hi>beleever,</hi> and by <hi>righteousnes,</hi> the state, or a man in the state of <hi>righteousnes,</hi> or of a righteous man, and to say that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beleeving</hi> is counted for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> meaning that the state of a <hi>beleever</hi> having by <hi>faith</hi> spirituall communion with <hi>Christ,</hi> is a state of <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and the man which is in that estate, is <hi>reputed</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the state of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> for this same expression and <hi>figure</hi> of speech, the <hi>Apostle</hi> useth severall times in the foure last <hi>verses</hi> of the 2. <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Epistle;</hi> where by <hi>circumcision</hi> he understands <hi>sanctification</hi> of the heart in the <hi>Spirit, verse</hi> 29. and also 26. and also a circumcised <hi>Jew, v.</hi> 27. and by <hi>uncircumcision</hi> he meanes an uncircumcised <hi>Gentile,</hi> and also the state of <hi>Gentilisme,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, and common sense teacheth; and here is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a second impudent lye, in that he saith, this <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of speech is not to bee found in all the <hi>Apostles</hi> writings. A third bold lye and manifest falshood is, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> time after time useth the <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>beleeving imputed</hi> without ever explaining himselfe, or changing his speech, for that which hee calls <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beleeving,</hi> and <hi>saith</hi> it is <hi>imputed</hi> in the third and 5. <hi>ver.</hi> he explaining himselfe, and changing his speech both in the 6. and 11. <hi>verses,</hi> calls it <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and <hi>saith, God imputeth righteousnes,</hi> and <hi>righteousnes</hi> is <hi>imputed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see how hee hath bent his tongue and pen like a bow for lyes, and shootes them forth thick and threefold like poysoned <hi>arrowes,</hi> as if his <hi>quiver</hi> were the armory of the <hi>Father</hi> of lyers, the <hi>Prince</hi> of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second Argument is briefly this, that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi>

                     <hi>for righteousnes, is called his faith, first before it is

imputed, verse 5. to him that beleeveth his faith is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for righteousnes; But the righteousnes of</hi> Christ <hi>cannot truely and properly be called his: who is a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before it is imputed. Therefore the righteousnes of</hi> Christ <hi>is not here to be understood under the name of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> by spirituall <hi>union</hi> and <note place="margin">1. Ans.</note> 
                     <hi>common</hi> with <hi>Christ:</hi> is as truely the true <hi>beleevers</hi> as his <hi>faith</hi> is his, <hi>for Christ is made unto him righteousnes, 1 Cor. 1. 30. and he is made the righteousnes of God in Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and that in order of nature, before it is counted his <hi>righteousnes.</hi> For <hi>God,</hi> whose judgement is according to <hi>truth,</hi> doth not count that to the <hi>beleever</hi> which he hath not before, or at the same time doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I answer, that if <hi>faith</hi> which is here called <note place="margin">2. Ans.</note> (his <hi>faith)</hi> be <hi>faith</hi> in a proper sense, and bee <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> then is man justified by his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and by a worke done and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his owne person, which is worse then <hi>Popery.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The object of that faith which is here said to be imputed,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Arg.</note> 
                     <hi>is God himselfe, or the promise of God, and not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of Christ: for to understand, that the righteousnes of Christ is meant by God, is to set up a trope, which is not a figure of speech, but a monster of speech. Therefore Christs righteousnes is not here said to be imputed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The object of <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> was the promise of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that in <hi>Christ God</hi> was his sheild and his <note place="margin">Ans.</note> great reward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. Now no man can in <hi>beleeving</hi> by true <hi>faith,</hi> separate <hi>Christs satisfaction</hi> and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: if he enjoy <hi>Christ</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> he enjoyes <hi>Christs</hi> benefits also; and to beleeve <hi>God</hi> to be our <hi>reward,</hi> is to beleeve that <hi>God</hi> is become our <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and so our <hi>reward,</hi> for the blessed <hi>reward</hi> is the <hi>reward</hi> of <hi>righteousnes;</hi> and therefore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42398:23"/>
rightly framed out of the 3. <hi>v.</hi> from <hi>Abrahams beleeving God,</hi> is strong against him; Here againe I note his ignorance in Rhetoricall <hi>tropes,</hi> in that hee saith, a double <hi>trope</hi> in one word, is a monster of speech; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Rhetorick calls it a <hi>Metalepsis,</hi> and counts it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of speech. I here also observe his vaine tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; for hee saith, that the Holy <hi>Ghost</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of the things which belong to the object of <hi>faith</hi> and which are <hi>beleeved,</hi> doth never make the least mention of <hi>Christs righteousnes;</hi> and immediately reckons many things which we are in <hi>Scripture</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>beleeve;</hi> amongst which is <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, and the doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony which <hi>God</hi> hath given of his Sonne; and the resurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> every one of which includes <hi>Christs righteousnes;</hi> for if we beleeve in <hi>Christ</hi> aright, we cannot but <hi>beleeve</hi> in him as a <hi>fulfiller</hi> of all <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> the Doctrine concerning <hi>Christ</hi> is, that he is made unto us of <hi>God righteousnes;</hi> that hee is the end of the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> to every <hi>beleever;</hi> The <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> of old was, that <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, Ier.</hi> 23. 6. and that he would cloath us with the <hi>Robe</hi> of <hi>righteousnes, Isay</hi> 61. 10. the Testimony which <hi>God</hi> hath given of him is, that in him wee have eternall life, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 11. which is the reward of his <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and therefore <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> in him: His resurrection is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his <hi>righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>perfect satisfaction,</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> testifie.

                     <hi>faith</hi> in a <hi>proper sense,</hi> is more plaine and cleare, and better <hi>beleeving</hi> the Apostle in this <hi>discourse,</hi> where he largely handles the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>justification:</hi> Therefore he here meanes <hi>faith</hi> in a <hi>proper sense,</hi> for that is more <hi>comfortable</hi> then to teach <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Christs righteousnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle plainely <hi>expresseth,</hi> that <hi>faith imputed,</hi> is <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>righteousnes imputed. verse</hi> 6. 11. and it is more <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> for us to rest on <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> (besides which, there is no <hi>true</hi> and <hi>perfect righteousnes</hi> to be found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in <hi>our nature)</hi> then to build on <hi>faith,</hi> which in the best is <hi>mingled</hi> and <hi>stayned</hi> with many <hi>doubtings</hi> often times. Therefore the Apostle undoubtedly intends <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> and so he doth expresse in plaine <hi>wordes,</hi> Chap. 5. 19. Chap. 8. 4. and Chap. 10. 4.</p>
                  <p>After these <hi>Arguments,</hi> he takes upon him to <hi>answere</hi>

                     <hi>trifling.</hi> First, he grants, that the Apostle useth such <hi>tropes</hi> of <hi>speech,</hi> for indeed, it is undenyable.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he grants that the <hi>act</hi> sometimes may be put for the <hi>object,</hi> but then he flees to his <hi>old shift</hi> that <hi>Christs righteousnes</hi> is not the <hi>obiect</hi> of <hi>beleeving,</hi> which I have before proved it to be:</p>
                  <p>Lastly, contrary to all <hi>reason</hi> he denies <hi>Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> to be the <hi>obiect</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> as it is <hi>iustifying,</hi> whereas it is indeed the onely <hi>proper obiect</hi> of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Testimony</hi> which he cites out of <hi>Musculus,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely contrary to his <hi>interpretation;</hi> for the wordes are, <hi>Commendata esse debebat hac fides, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propriae qualitatis, sed propositi Dei respectu,</hi> that is, This <hi>faith</hi> ought to be commended, not in respect of the <hi>proper quality</hi> of it, that is, Not in a <hi>proper sense,</hi> but in respect of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>God,</hi> wherby he hath appointed, that to <hi>beleeve</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> he wil <hi>impute</hi> it for <hi>righteousnes; propter ipsum,</hi> that is because of Christ himselfe, in whom they <hi>beleeve:</hi> By

                  </p>
                  <p>The wordes which he cites out of <hi>Aretius,</hi> are also strong for us, against <hi>himselfe, viz.</hi> That <hi>God imputed righteousnes</hi> to Abraham, that is, so accepted his <hi>faith,</hi> that hereupon he counted him for a <hi>righteous man,</hi> by <hi>imputative righteousnes,</hi> which <hi>righteousnes</hi> cannot be any thing <hi>inherent</hi> (as <hi>faith</hi> and our owne <hi>workes</hi> are) but the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> besides which, there is no <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes</hi> to be found in all the world perfect and fit to <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify man</hi> before <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Illyricus</hi> his wordes are as plaine against him as our hearts can wish, <hi>viz.</hi> That begging <hi>faith apprehending</hi> the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> to him in sted of his owne <hi>righteousnes:</hi> where note, that the reason why <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>impute faith</hi> for <hi>righteousnes</hi> is, because it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <hi>Christs righteousnes,</hi> not because it of it selfe in a <hi>proper sense</hi> is fit to be counted <hi>righteousnes:</hi> being but a poore begging hand, and being <hi>inherent</hi> in the <hi>beleever,</hi> which <hi>imputative righteousnes</hi> can in no wise be.</p>
                  <p>Thus in all his <hi>testimonies</hi> we have not one word to prove that <hi>faith</hi> taken in a <hi>proper sense</hi> is onely <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteousnes,</hi> and not the <hi>righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> But many <hi>Testimonies</hi> by him cited prove directly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>interpretation.</hi>
