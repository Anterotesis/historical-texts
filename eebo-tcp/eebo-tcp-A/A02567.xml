            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Church of Rome, ſo fixes her ſelfe (in her adoration) vpon the Croſſe of Chriſt, as if ſhee forgat his glory: Many of vs ſo conceiue of him glorious, that we neglect the meditation of his Croſſe, the way to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ours.

feared: he ſaw the heauy burden of our ſinnes to bee vndertaken; and thereupon, beſides feare, iuſtly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; hee ſaw the neceſsity of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, if hee ſuffered not: if he did ſuffer, of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore his loue incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered both griefe and feare.

            <p>Can we yet ſay any more?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21644:25"/>
is a puniſhment; but for euill is a torment. No paſsion works vpon an vnknown obiect: as no loue, ſo no feare is of what we know not.

He ſaw the burden of all particular ſinnes to be laid vpon him; euery dramme of his fathers wrath, was meaſured out to him, ere he toucht this potion; this cup was full, and hee knew that it muſt bee wringd, not a drop left: it muſt bee finiſhed.

not doe, becauſe they had no leaue. Hee alone would bow his head, and giue vp his Ghoſt: <hi>I haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to lay downe my life:</hi> Man gaue him not his life; man could not bereaue it. <hi>No man takes it from me.</hi> Alas, who could?

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, when hee ſaw that impotent man could not take away his ſoule, he gaue it vp, and would die, that we might liue. See here a Sauiour, that can contemne his own life for ours: &amp; cares not to be diſſolued in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that we might be vnited to his Father. <hi>Skinne for skinne,</hi> ſaith the Diuell, <hi>and all that hee hath, a man will giue for his life.</hi> Loe here to proue Sathan a lyer, skin and life and all, hath Chriſt Ieſus giuen for vs. We

are beſotted with the earth, and make baſe ſhifts to liue; one with a maimed bodie, another with a periured ſoule, a third with a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten name: and how many had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect their ſoule, then their life, and will rather renounce and curſe GOD, then die? It is a ſhame to tell; many of vs Chriſtians dote vpon life, and tremble at death; and ſhew our ſelues fooles in our exceſſe of loue, Cowards in our feare. <hi>Peter</hi> denies Chriſt thrice, and forſweares him; <hi>Marcellinus</hi> twice caſts graines of incenſe into the Idolles fire; <hi>Ecebolius</hi> turnes thrice; <hi>Spira</hi> reuolts and deſpaires: Oh let mee liue, ſaith the fearefull ſoule.

not thus learned Chriſt: hee dies voluntarily for thee, thou wilt not bee forced to die for him: hee gaue vp the Ghoſt for thee: thou wilt not let others take it from thee for him, thou wilt not let him take it for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>VVhen I looke backe to the firſt Chriſtians, and compare their zealous contempt of death with our backewardneſſe: I am at once ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and aſhamed: I ſee there euen women (the feebler ſexe) running with their little ones in their armes, for the preferment of martyrdome, and ambitiouſly ſtriuing for the next blow.
