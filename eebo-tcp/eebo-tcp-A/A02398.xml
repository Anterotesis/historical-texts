            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That the perfit Body of man ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and yet the outward eyes of thoſe which entertain Him ſhall not ſee it. 5. That theſe ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth wonders ſhall be wrought at the call of mortall men (euery Prieſt) vnto the end of the world, &amp;c.

               </gap>iſor of theſe ſo inglorious, and (to ſay nothing of the quality of them) inſuperfluous miracles.</p>
            <p>Alſo wee further adde, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:21654:8"/>
blaſphemeth his Power; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes it the inſtrument of ſuch operations as are diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and repugnant vnto His Wiſdome, His Maieſty, His Iuſtice, and euen all His condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and attributes; whereas the power of God on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry does ſo infinitely apply it ſelfe to the honour and glory of God, as that it doth continually reſiſt, confound and deſtroy whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer does offer the leaſt diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Laſt of all, it blaſphemeth his Word; and that both His crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Word, and alſo His reuealed Word.</p>
            <p>For what is his created Word, but the faculties of Senſe &amp; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? What word, or what light had man in his innocency, to ſhew him which was the middle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21654:8"/>
tree in the garden (which vpon paine of death he was forbidden to taſte of) but his common Senſe? And what other word or light haue men now in the ſtate of recouery, to tell them which is a man, and which is a beaſt; which is a fiſh, and which is a ſerpent; and to lay them out their particular taskes, portion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and callings, but their common Senſe? This therefore ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately created and ſacred light, if it bee made a notorious lyar, (for what is it elſe if it conſtantly affirmes that to bee a morſell of bread which indeed is the perfit Body of a man?) Is not therein the Word of God blaſphemed?</p>
            <p>And as for his Reuealed Word, both His Originall Word (the Scriptures) and alſo His deriued Word (the Fathers) are not they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21654:9"/>
alſo contradicted and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by this poſition.</p>
            <p>For firſt, concerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does not that euery where tell vs, That our Sauiour was in euery point like a man? That He had the face, limbs, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a man? That Hee did eat, drinke, and ſpeake like a man? Alſo doe not the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, <hi>That the Heauens muſt containe him till all things bee reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Acts</hi> 3.20. And that He ſhall ſo deſcend from heauen; as Hee firſt aſcended vp into heauen? Whereas by this poſition Hee hath for theſe 1600. yeeres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually deſcended bodily from heauen, not once in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſcend, as Hee firſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Yea, the Scripture euery where tells vs that now Hee is in the ſtate of Glory; whereas this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21654:9"/>
poſition contriues Him into a more vile forme than euer man had, and tyes Him to a more baſe condition than euer any man (or indeed any liuing creature) did vndergoe.
