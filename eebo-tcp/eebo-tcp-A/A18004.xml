            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIrst I proue by Scripture that Peter could not be at Rome vntill the .6. or as Hierom and others collect vntil the .8. yere of Claudius. Secondly I proue by the order of time and place that he could not be at Rome vntill the second yeare of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian which was after the passion of Christ .52. or 53. yeares which should haue bin after the destruction of Hierusalem which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ .73. yeares, the 8. day of September. In the second dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course I proue that neither Peter nor the Pope, is the head of the Church, confuting such obiections as they alledge to the contrary, wherein yee shall finde their arguments refelled, their Cannon law confuted, the Popes errours in Doctrine detected, their sillogismes answered, and finally certain antitheses betweene Christ and the Pope prouing him Antichrist, with an interpretation vppon the place of Paule. 2.

Then sayde I, <hi>Cur non respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haeretice, haereticorum haereticissime.</hi> Dyd not I handle hym well? Then denyed hée the minor, which I proued thus: Christ met Peter goeing out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and sayed, good morrowe Peter, whether goest thou? Peter aunswered, good morrowe good man, whether goest thou? Then sayde Chryste, I goe to Rome too suffer, what? sayeth Peter, I trowe, onlesse I take my markes amisse, you are Ihesus Christe, good Lorde, howe doo you? I am

glad I haue met you here. Then sayd hée to Peter, goe backe and suffer, or else I must <hi>et pro te &amp; me.</hi> When Rydley had heard this my profe, and <hi>Abdias</hi> authoritie, a Doctoure auncient and irrefragable, hée aunswered neuer a woorde.

If Dauid and Paule prooue the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, power, and prouidence of God by his creatures, so must wée allowe the scriptures by the same meanes, bycause they differ not from the discourse. Wherefore the church taketh no authoritie of it selfe, but of God: nor the scriptures any power of men, whiche are full of erroures.</p>

If a Lawyer aunswere by the Lawe, hée dooth his dutie: but if hée aunswere of his own brayne, it is nought, neyther will any man beléeue him. Hée is a wicked Iudge that attributeth more to hys owne witte and will, than to the lawe. This doth the Pope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all the auncient Doctours, and vertuous writers, who affirme no man to bée beléeued, onlesse hée alleadge the scriptures. If an Ambassadour goe from one Prince to an other, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded neyther to adde to his commission, nor diminishe, hée is a traytour if hée doo. How much more the Pope, who by his false embassage, dooth not onely adde and diminishe where hee lusteth, but also chaungeth, peruerteth, correcteth, depraueth, and abolis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the Scriptures, setting vppe hys owne constitutions and braynelesse Decréees. The Prince to whome this Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour is sent, cannot tell whether his commission is true or no, but by conferring of the other Princes letters, out of the which he must haue the truthe: So must wée runne to the scriptures, and trye by them whether the Pope and other impure spirits doo well in vsurping such authoritie.

I aunswere, that God commaunded Ieremie to pull vp the wéedes of superstition, and to pull downe all the monumentes of Idolatrie. But the Pope draweth this godly sentence to the defence of his vsurped power, peruerting the mynde of the holy ghost, and deprauing the Text of Ieremie: and by this Text hée vsurpeth that hée may pull down the Gospell, and set vp his decréees: roote out the truthe, &amp; plante heresie or superstition, as it is written of him in another place: <hi>Diruit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis.</hi>

If of God, or of Peter, or of them selues, why did they not resist? why were they put too death? If they had none, as none they had in deede, than of whom had the Popes following their power &amp; tyrannie, to kill innocentes, to depose Emperours, to disgrade Bishoppes, to rule in hell, heauen, earth, and purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to absolue <hi>à poena &amp; culpa,</hi> to do what they lust, to oppresse, banish, and murther?</p>
