            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Pulpit-POPERY, True POPERY: IN ANSWER TO Pulpit-Sayings.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Author of the <hi>Pulpit-Sayings</hi> first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World, he undertook to shew what the Papist is not, or how he is Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; and what he really is, and how he is to be Represented. The first, he tells us,<note place="margin">Papist. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repr. pref. Doctr. and Pract. p. 11.</note> He <hi>exactly describ'd according to the Apprehension he had, when a Protestant:</hi> And the latter he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents according to his own private Opinion, when a Papist, as he is told. So that in the issue the whole is resolv'd into himself. Thus it was, and thus he still maintains the Humour; for what are the Characters he gives of a Papist, but for the most part, the fruits of his own Imagination? And what doth he bring to confirm it, but, <hi>it is the Papist I am?</hi> What course doth he take to confute his Adversaries, to confront their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but, <hi>if that be a Papist, I am none,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pulpit-Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, p. 55. Epist. to the Reader.</note> 
               <hi>I profess I renounce such Popery.</hi> Nay, as if he acted <hi>sub sigillo Piscatoris,</hi> and had by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation the Authority of the Chair, to determine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce; and the Keys of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to bind and loose, to let in and out of their Communion, as he sees fit; he assures us, that <hi>whoever will be a good Papist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>must disclaim every point that is here set down by the Pulpits as Articles of Religion.</hi> And again <hi>the Papist Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented I own it, it's the Papist I am</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 55.</note> 
               <hi>and whoever assents to that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107008:5"/>
Character in that very Form</hi> [of the Papist Represented] <hi>has done what is required, as to those particulars, to be made a Member of our Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if <hi>I declare, I profess I renounce</hi> on one side; and <hi>I am, I do own,</hi> on the other, is sufficient to determine the Point, and will be taken for an Answer by his Adversaries, there is no more to be said.</p>
            <p>But though our Author may suitably enough to the temper of the Church he is now of, be thus assuming and dogmatical, and may for ought we know, thus expound, transform, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with Allowance; yet there is no reason why he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the Church he has forsaken, and that his <hi>Apprehensions</hi> be taken for the Apprehensions of all of that Communion. This he now thinks a little unreasonable, and could be content for once to own it, if his present Undertaking be allowed to come in the place of it.<note place="margin">P. 55.</note> For thus he saith, <hi>If any make Exceptions against the Character of a Papist thus disguis'd, as 'twas drawn there,</hi> [in the Papist Misrepresented] <hi>I'le never quarrel upon that score, let that be raz'd out.</hi>—</p>
            <p>But however, tho he thus drops his own <hi>Apprehensions,</hi> (as well as he had his 37. Points of Representation) and at once gives away half his Labour; yet like a true Master of Defence, he mounts the Stage again, and renews the Fight; for by the help of some <hi>Pulpit-Sayings,</hi> he thinks he has given life to his otherwise dying Cause. <hi>Let that,</hi> saith he, <hi>be raz'd out, and these others take place, which 'tis likely are more Authentick.</hi> What! more <hi>Authentick</hi> than his own <hi>Apprehensions!</hi>
               <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> O yes, for <hi>its such a Popery, and such a Papist as is describ'd by Ministers in their Pulpits.— In which there are many things charged upon them, without either Truth and Sincerity; and consequently, 'tis not without grounds they complain of Misrepresenting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. But why the Pulpits? Are not the same things in Books of Controversy; and are they not there more fully explain'd and debated? Thither therefore in reason we ought to be sent to understand how the Protestants Represent the Papist. But then our Author had not had the opportunity of exclaiming against those <hi>high Places</hi> (as he Phrases it) from whence, it seems, they have received no little Damage; or which is worse, he had been engaged in a Dispute, which is not his <hi>Province,</hi> as he tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 28.)</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107008:5"/>
2. But if some Pulpits have misrepresented them in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, what is that to the Pulpits in general? What is that to our Church? He has been already told,<note place="margin">Doctr. and Pract. p 9, 10.</note> that <hi>we are far from defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such Misrepresentations, if such there be. That which we adhere to, is the Doctrine and Sense of our Church, as it is by Law established; and what Representations are made agreeable thereto, we undertake to defend, and no other.</hi> Can he think we are any more concern'd in the mistakes or infirmities of others, then he thinks himself to be <hi>in the loose and extravagant opinions of their own Doctors, Schoolmen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and p. 56.</note> 
               <hi>and Casuists?</hi> And is it not reasonable he should allow the same Law to others he is forced so frequently to plead in his own defence?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But further, supposing that some of the Pulpits have Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Papist in some points, and in those points he disclaims; yet are there no points besides they differ in? And if these were set aside, would the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> be one? What thinks he of the many points I find in the same Sermons he quotes, that he civilly passes by? Such as these, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is alone the Catholick Church out of which is no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That the Pope is the Universal Head of that Church. That that Church is Infallible? What thinks he of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, Communion in one kind, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service and Scriptures in an Unknown Tongue, Merit and Works of Supererogation, the Worship of Images, Implicit Faith, Indulgences, Deposition of Princes, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Lastly, What thinks he of the great point he all along omitted (as he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) that <hi>a Papist doth not only believe the Doctrines defin'd in the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>to be true, but also to be necessary to Salvation?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctr. and Pract. p. 12.</note> Are not these the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>? And are not the Pulpits as much employ'd in confuting these, as those <hi>of praying to Images, and putting their trust in them,</hi> and the other <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Abominations</hi> (as he calls them) charged on his Church? And do not the Protestants think as ill of those points he owns, as of those he disclaims?</p>
            <p n="4">4. But how come they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to start this charge of Misrepresentation, who are of all Churches in the world the most guilty of it? Or how comes our Author to continue it, who neither durst so much as vindicate others or himself when convicted of it? The learned Author of the <hi>View</hi> enter'd the Field, and threw down the Gantlet,<note place="margin">View, p. 106. to 119.</note> but our Author fairly slinks aside, and leaves his Brethren to sink under the imputation of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107008:6"/>
the soulest Misrepresentations.<note place="margin">P. 61.102, 103.</note> And this is not to be wonder'd at, when he has not one word of Reply to all the Accusations of that kind there produced against himself. And yet to give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Specimen how far this disingenuous quality has prevail'd upon his temper, he still proceeds in the same course, and to be quit with the Pulpits, which he saith, are <hi>forward in making cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Papists,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> he is as forward in making characters of the Pulpits. <hi>The business of so many Pulpits</hi> [ten thousand, open every week he saith] <hi>is chiefly to make exceptions, pick holes, quarrel, ridicule: and the more excellent they are at their work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pulpit Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>the more they gain upon their Auditory.</hi> And that he may not be wanting, he will be at his Plots too, and follow what he calls <hi>Oat's Divine</hi> way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.<note place="margin">Good Advice to the Pulpits p. 67.</note> He had tried once before to form a design of this kind, when he would have Sermons preach'd many years ago against Popery to contain <hi>severe reflections</hi> upon his present Majesty. But that he was soon made sensible of,<note place="margin">Apology for the Pulpits, p. 3.</note> and has not a syllable to excuse. And yet he will be again at his <hi>Innuendo</hi>'s, for thus he lays the Scene, <hi>Methinks the Pulpits,</hi> saith he, <hi>should be more tender of their Soveraign than to venture upon the same Method</hi> (which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charges them with) <hi>with the Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pulpit Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>which prov'd so fatal to the Father, and dangerous to the Brother. But I fear the excess of jealousie for their Religion, puts them upon being too bold with their Prince; and that by a just judgment of Heaven, they are blindly practising the very principles they have so often charged upon the Papists, making their Churches Interest the center of their Religion, Preaching Faction instead of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such expressions as these are not thrown out at all adventure; and we may soon guess what they tend to, and it's a <hi>fair warning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far for the Pulpits; but to shew what a Talent he has at Character-making, he will furnish us also with that of the <hi>true Son of the Church of England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> viz. <hi>A Genuine Son of the Church of England, is to have a good stock of this implicit Faith by him, and to believe and speak, though he knows nothing at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>This is to the Protestant Tune, If a man can't tell how to run down Popery, though he knows nothing of it, he's no true Son of the Church of England.</hi> So that quarrelling and ridiculing is the work it seems of the Preachers, and a delight in it, the temper of their Auditors; and to speak all at once, Ignorance and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, Slander and Impudence are in his opinion the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of a true Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is the faithful
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107008:6"/>
Representer, the soft Adviser, the prudent Cautioner, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Character-maker, the Preacher of Charity, the Detecter of Impostures and disguisements, and the great undertaker of setting every thing upon its proper Basis, and bringing it into its true place and order.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But what if after all, this <hi>Pulpit-Popery</hi> is true Popery; and that nothing is charged upon them as a Principle, but what the Pulpits learn'd from themselves?</p>
            <p>But, <hi>says some Body,</hi> hold your hand, and make no such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, for can that be done after all his <hi>Detestations, Renouncings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> 
               <hi>Disclaimings, Abborrings,</hi> and <hi>Abominatings?</hi> Does not he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that <hi>these Doctrines as here set down by the Ministers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the Papists, he not only <hi>abominates,</hi> but that if that so to believe, be a Papist, <hi>he would be a Turk as soon as a Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these <hi>Rhodomantado</hi>'s come so often in, that I perceive they are words of course with him; and shall therefore file them up with his <hi>Anathema's</hi> in his <hi>Papist Represented and Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,</hi> till I find due place for a further Animadversion; and so pass on to the Examination of this his Vindication of his <hi>Good Advice to the Pulpits.</hi> For the better grace of which his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, he has distributed his matter into fourteen Characters of a <hi>Pulpit-Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what's become of the former method observed in his <hi>Good Advice?</hi> What of the five Cautions? What of the twenty-eight Assertions extracted out of the Sermons, as instances of their foul Misrepresentations? Certainly had he in earnest intended to have given a just Answer to his Adversary, or was conscious to himself of having performed it, he would have kept as much as might be to his former Method, which the Apologist carefully followed him in, that the whole might lye fair before the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's eye, and he might lay his finger upon the point in debate betwixt them. But that was not to his purpose; he thought he might give the matter a more clever turn, if he slid off from his Cautions and Assertions, and dispos'd the whole into Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters. Assertions are dangerous points, and require proof and debate; and it would be expected the matter should in that way be brought to an issue. But for Characters, a Writer may go on eternally, it requires only a little skill in Representation, and the work is done.<note place="margin">Pulpit-Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Pag. 13.</note> And it requires but a spark of confidence to tell his Reader that he <hi>proceeds to this Examen</hi> [of the Apology] <hi>in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107008:7"/>
Method of the Good Advice to the Pulpits,</hi> and presently his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters fall back into Cautions and Assertions, by the Figure of making two things to be one, and of denying and affirming without a contradiction. But if he will be at his Characters, how come particular <hi>matters of Fact</hi> to belong to a Character? Or how is it that what belongs to a particular fort, is applied to the whole? Would it not be very ridiculous to describe a Papist after the way taken by our Author, and to tell the world, A Papist is one that was <hi>engaged in an execrable Plot to take away the Life of his late Majesty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. p. 13, &amp;c.</note> A Papist is one, that <hi>had a Hand in the Horrid Plot of the Murder of King</hi> Charles <hi>the First.</hi> A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist is one <hi>that fired</hi> London.

Did ever the Pulpits talk at this loose and sensless rate, so as to draw Characters from a particular Fact? And might it not as well be said, A Papist is one that writes <hi>Representations,</hi> and <hi>Good Advices,</hi> and <hi>Pulpit-Sayings?</hi> This is a way peculiar to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for ought I have observed, among Writers of Characters; and I'le assure him he was very secure, when he offered this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Let them take this Pulpit-draught along with them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with all the Papists they know, or can hear of; let them see, whether they answer that Character.</hi> Would it not be more proper if we were to give the Character of a Papist, and will proceed upon Particulars, to resolve them into a General, and to see whether, for example, they have not such Principles in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as not only have put them upon, but do oblige them to some Practices too near a kin to some of these before spoken of: And for an instance of which I shall refer him to <hi>Doctrines and Practices,</hi> p. 102 and 163, and to a <hi>Papist not Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented,</hi> p. 49. Now the producing the Anathema's of his Church against these Points, and an Authoritative Abrenuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, would do more to <hi>remove the occasion of our so many years Disturbances,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> 
               <hi>and to wipe off the Scandals urged against them from the Pulpit,</hi> or elsewhere, than all the <hi>Tracts</hi> that he was <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi>; and is as much a Satisfaction they owe to the World, as any he would prescribe to the Pulpits in his <hi>first Character</hi>: when we hear of this, I dare assure him there shall be no want in the other. But however 'tis but reasonable to give him the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

And therefore it's very wide from the <hi>Sayer's</hi> purpose, to shew this to be impossible, because of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty,</hi> that fought and <hi>lost their Lives in Defence</hi> of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. For it has been no strange thing for many of all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to go one way, and yet the Jesuit to go another. The times of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. and 4. of <hi>France,</hi> will give us instances enough of this matter. I could wish that he had kept the Challenge to himself, for having made it, he has made it necessary to answer it. It's this, <hi>The Challenge has been made to all sorts of Protestants,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Papists have their Emissaries up and down to preach Schism and Sedition into the Peoples ears. By such Arts as these, they insinuate themselves among the poor deluded People of our separate Congregations, and joyning with them in their Clamours against the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>crying it down for Superstitious, and Popishly affected, they pass for gifted Brethren, and real Popery is carry'd on by such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here our Author first of all inveighs against the thing, and then against the Pulpits for charging it upon them. <hi>Here,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Papists are set forth in a Sermon before the Honourable the Judges, as great Hypocrites, Religious Cheats and Impostors.— A foul Crime! and if true, sufficient to cast the Papists</hi> [he should say, such spiritual Factors] <hi>out of the number of Christians; but if false, and not as here set out, as sufficient on the other side, to bring the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits under that as black Character of Misrepresenting.</hi> This is indeed to come up to the point, and I shall readily close with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>The Apologist to shorten his Work, and to take down the Confidence of the <hi>Adviser</hi> without bearing too hard upon the Party, contented himself with pointing his Adversary to three or four Authors for Information in this Case; such as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmask'd, the New Discovery, the false Jew,</hi> and <hi>Foxes and Firebrands.</hi> Now to this he replies, <hi>Who would not have expected that the Answerer would have spent a few Lines in making good such Authorities, and proving them to be Authentick beyond Exception?</hi>— And then after his manner, breaks forth into a wonderful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>Good God! that Men should pretend to teach their Auditory the Gospel, and when they are thus challenged in a particular of this Moment, then to fly to</hi> Foxes and Firebrands, <hi>and laying by the Scripture, take Refuge in Libels and Street-Pamphlets!</hi> Now <hi>who would not have expected</hi> that he <hi>would have spent a few Lines</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving these <hi>Authorities?</hi> If he could have done this; he had done somewhat; but it's easier to call a thing a <hi>Libel,</hi> than to prove it. Well! What is the proof he expects? That it be <hi>Authentick beyond Exception?</hi> But when shall it pass for <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick beyond Exception?</hi> Nothing less, it seems, than <hi>Scripture,</hi> is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. For, saith he, <hi>when they are thus challenged, laying by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107008:9"/>
Scripture, they take refuge in Libels and Street-Pamphlets.</hi> Here I must ingenuously confess, that we are at a loss, and that we read no more in the Scripture of such Emissaries, as <hi>Faithful Commin,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Heth,</hi> than he does of the <hi>Miracles of</hi> Xaverius, or <hi>the Revelations of St.</hi> Bridget, and the Extasies of <hi>Magdalen de Pazzi.</hi> But did ever any man in the World, before our Author, put a case upon this issue, and require Scripture-proof for matters of Fact, or charge his Adversary with <hi>laying aside Scripture,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he brings not Scripture to prove it?</p>
               <p>But supposing they have as good Authority, as what they can produce for the <hi>Legends</hi> of their Church; will it not be as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick?</hi> Let us therefore proceed (as he calls it) to the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The first Book (which he has a particular pique against) is what is call'd <hi>Foxes and Firebrands</hi>; which is full of Relations of this kind.<note place="margin">

And yet all this while acted a part, to delude the People, and do Service to his Church.</p>
               <p>This Narrative is an Extract out of the Memorials of the Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> and was transmitted to Bishop <hi>

                     <hi>The Copy of this was taken out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistry of the Episcopal See of</hi> Rochester.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas Heth</hi> a Jesuit, who pretended much to spiritual Prayers declaiming against Set-Forms; and when brought before the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> said he thereby <hi>endeavoured to make Religion the purer,— and that he laboured to refine the Protestants, and to take off all smacks of Ceremonies, that in the least do tend to the Romish Faith</hi>; and the better to conceal himself, spoke against the Jesuits, and declared that he was <hi>fallen from that Society.</hi> And yet all this while was as much theirs, as ever, and did all by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. For he was discovered by a Letter drop'd out of his Pocket in the Pulpit at <hi>Rochester,</hi> and written from one <hi>Samuel Malt</hi> a Jesuit of Note; which, after Directions given to him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107008:9"/>
how to govern himself in these matters, thus concludes: <hi>This we have certified to the Council and Cardinals, That there is no other way to prevent People from turning Hereticks, and for the recalling of others back again to the Mother Church, than by the Diversities of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</hi> There was besides, found in his Boots, a <hi>License</hi> from the Jesuits, and a Bull dated the first of <hi>Pius Quintus, to teach what Doctrine that Society pleased, for the dividing of Protestants.</hi> And in his Trunk were several Books <hi>for denying Baptism to Infants,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Tho Dissimulation and Delusion be abominable every where, yet never more than in spiritual Matters, and concerns of the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for this Book, and its Authority. Proceed we to the next, the <hi>False Jew</hi>; this Book contains the History of one <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ramsey,</hi> Son to Doctor <hi>Ramsey,</hi> Physician to the King, who being bred up in the Jesuits College in <hi>Rome,</hi> and well instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, was sent forth, and became a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Jew</hi> under the name of <hi>Joseph Ben Israel</hi> (having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Circumcised) and coming for <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Newcastle</hi> professed himself a Christian Convert; but soon struck in among the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> and was baptized by them at <hi>Hexham.</hi> The whole cause, after the Discovery, was heard before <hi>H.

               <head>Fifth Character of a Pulpit-Papist.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The different Orders of Religion amongst the Papists, are neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor worse than so many Sects, and several Casts of Religion; only they have that advantage in managing their Divisions, which we have not; to pack up their Fanaticks in Convents and Cloysters, and so bring them under some kind of Rule and Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Apologist</hi> had charged the <hi>Adviser</hi> with a Falsification, but he is so kind to himself as to pass it over, and truly so will the <hi>Apologist</hi> in consideration of the kindness he hath now done, in giving him a further account of the Sermon here quoted, which (for want of direction as to Author or Bookseller) he could not procure. <hi>The Preacher being desirous,</hi> saith our Author, <hi>to take off that foul blemish of so many Sects and Divisions rending the Protestant Church</hi> (it seems there is now in his opinion another Church) <hi>of</hi> England <hi>inconsistent with the unity of Christ's true Church, and so often objected against them by Catholicks, falls into that common Topick of covering the defects of his own Church, by calumniating that of his Neighbour, and therefore he boldly makes up to his Auditory, and tells them, That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity the Papists boast of in their Communion, is but a pretence, whereas they have really more Divisions in their Religion, than they charge ours with; and then goes on in the words of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter above cited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this Discourse of the Preacher, our Author draws three Particulars, <hi>pag.</hi> 27.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>there are more Divisions than they charge ours with.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That their Religious Orders are neither better nor worse than so many Sects and several Casts of Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That they have their Fanaticks packt up in Convents.</hi> And he should have added another from the <hi>Apology,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That thus to pack them up in Convents, is an advantage their Church makes of it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Our Author having thus drawn out the sense of the Preacher, and made what he will of the sense of the <hi>Apologist,</hi> concludes, <hi>He must give me leave to set down these three Assertions of the Pulpit for so many clear Instances of most foul Misrepresenting.</hi> But by his <hi>leave</hi> I shall review his account of this matter. I am not obliged in strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to concern my self in the first Head, being neither charged
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107008:10"/>
upon the Preacher in the <hi>Good Advice,</hi> nor so much as mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Apology</hi>; but yet he shall find me a fair Adversary, and not willing to stand upon my Terms, but take the work as he has cut it out for me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity the Papists boast of, is but a pretence; whereas they have really more Divisions in their Religion than they charge ours with.</hi> This our Author saith is a <hi>Calumniating</hi> of them; and is one of his <hi>Foul Misrepresentations.</hi> And yet after all, I doubt it will return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself: For if there be a real and perfect Union, it's surely to be seen in their <hi>present obedience to the same Church-Authority,</hi> as our Author words it, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. or in a perfect Union of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers among themselves, in charity. Or in being of <hi>the same belief,</hi> as our Author suggests. And yet if we come to examine it in this Method, we shall find Breach upon Breach. For,</p>
               <p>(1.) What Schisms have there been in that <hi>Church-Authority?</hi> no less than thirty (as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> reckons) in the Papacy, some of which continued ten, some twenty, and one fifty years?</p>
               <p>(2.) What actual Disobediences to that Authority in the times of <hi>Innocent</hi> 4<hi>th. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> and at this season are in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church?</p>
               <p>(3.) What infinite Quarrels betwixt the Bishops and the Friers, the Friers and Parish-Priests, in the times of <hi>Gregory</hi> 9<hi>th. Innocent</hi> 4<hi>th. Alexander</hi> 4<hi>th. Martin</hi> 4<hi>th. Boniface</hi> 8. <hi>Clement</hi> 5<hi>th. Benedict</hi> 10<hi>th. &amp;c.</hi> from age to age, even to that infamous one in the last age here betwixt the Seculars and Regulars? One Pope revoking anothers Decrees, and oftentimes annulling their own, as did <hi>Innocent, Martin</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(4.) Come we to their Union in Doctrine, and we shall find that but a <hi>pretence.</hi> For where have there been sharper conflicts than among them about the Seat and Extent of Infallibility, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination, and the Immaculate Conception, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Each char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the other with Heresie: as the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Jansenists</hi> about the First; the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> about the second; the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> about the third. Thus far therefore we are not agreed with our Author; for if actual and material Divisions betwixt Head and Head, Head and Members, Members and Members, will make a plea to Union to be but a <hi>pretence,</hi> then so it is with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their Religious Orders are neither better nor worse than so many Sects and Casts of Religion. This,</hi> saith our Author, <hi>is an absolute
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107008:11"/>
Falshood</hi>; and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> that undertakes to defend the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>is</hi> in his opinion no better than <hi>a vain Trister, in publishing such an idle Apology.</hi> But why so? Because when the Preacher had said, that <hi>the Orders among the Papists are so many Sects,</hi> the account he gives of it is, that <hi>they are so many distinct Bodies, that having differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Founders-, Rules, Habits, and Opinions, by which an Emulation is begot betwixt Order and Order, they become divided among themselves, and when occasion is offer'd, do actually war upon one another in their way.</hi> Now, saith our Author, <hi>would not a School-boy have been scourged for such a sleeveless frivolous excuse?</hi> which he saith, may be as well applied to our Colleges in the Universities, as to their Convents. But was this all the Apologist undertook? and did he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his defence of the Preacher?</p>
               <p>When he had thus shewn what is meant by their Orders, and how Emulations and Quarrels might arise, and what occasions were given for them in point of Rules, Habits and Opinions, did he not proceed to shew of what sort these Differences were in the very next words after those quoted by the <hi>Sayer?</hi> Surely he might in his Transports have so far condescended, as to touch upon those points, and shewed a little of his skill in proving the Differences betwixt the <hi>Franciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> about the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception,</hi> to have been no other than a <hi>School-opinion</hi> in our Colleges; and that notwithstanding all the Feuds betwixt the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the <hi>Franciscans</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> there mentioned, they <hi>are</hi> (as he would have it) <hi>only different parts, not dividing but making up the whole.</hi> He complains of the Preacher that he so worded it, <hi>that no Protestant of his Auditory but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Notion, that as in</hi> England, <hi>so likewise in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>there are different Sects of Religion, and Fanaticks to divide it.</hi> And let any Protestant or other read the History of their long conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the size of their Hoods, and the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and he will read a notable Comment upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's words, and see that he has not misrepresented them. I would fain know of our Author what he thinks of a Controversie that hath filled Kingdoms, Cities, Universities, Cloysters, with Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Disorders; Pulpits and Schools with contentions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and Revilings; that hath concerned Kings, Popes and Councils in composing; and at last grew to that height, that after 300 years bickerings, Popes themselves, though solicited from time to time not only by the Heads of the Faction, but by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107008:11"/>
Princes themselves, yet either could not, or thought it not safe and adviseable to determine it?</p>
               <p>Let me sum it up in the Words of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador to the Pope, to move him to come to a Resolution upon it.<note place="margin">Legatio Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, 3. and 4. Paulo 5. &amp; Gregor. 15. per Luc. Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. p. 89.</note> 
                  <hi>Consider the loss of many Souls, the Discord of the Church, the Dissentions of Cities, the great Dangers that hang over the Kingdom.</hi> Let our Author consider this, and tell me for what reason he took no notice of this case laid before him, or how he could, after he had read it, charge the Preacher with an <hi>absolute Falshood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this, I shall refer him further to a late Book call'd, <hi>The Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>Misrepresented by the</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi> §. 3, and 4.</p>
               <p>But here our Author relieves himself, That this <hi>may be seen in the Queen</hi> Dowager'<hi>s Chappel, in which officiate Monks, Friers,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, <hi>Jesuits, and Clergy, that is, so many different Orders of Men, and yet without any difference in Religion, or disagreement in Faith.</hi> But will he say, there are no differences between the Friers and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the Jesuits and the Clergy in those Cases, when they charge each other with Heresy? or because they seem to agree, or do there agree, there is then nothing of this between Order and Order? This is much such an Argument, as if one that had seen the Fox and the Sheep, and other Creatures quietly sitting upon one and the same Hill in the <hi>West,</hi> when drove thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a sudden Inundation, should from thence conclude, and would perswade others to believe that these were all at a perfect Accord, and that there was no Enmity in their Nature, nor had ever been in Fact. I shall conclude this with what <hi>Antoninus,</hi> A.B. of <hi>Florence,</hi> saith in this case. <hi>Let every one take heed of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this matter</hi> [the immaculate Conception] <hi>before the People, with a charge upon the contrary Party, because it's Scandalous to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> People;</hi> and accordingly it was forbidden by several Popes.</p>
               <p>Another of the <hi>Falshoods</hi> charged upon the Preacher is, the asserting, <hi>they have Fanaticks pack'd up in their Convents.</hi> The best Answer I can give to the <hi>Sayer</hi> upon this, is to set before the Reader, an account of the Method taken by the Apologist in handling this Argument.</p>
               <p>1. Who shew'd <hi rend="margQuotes">what Fanaticism is, and that it's a general Name, comprehending in it Superstition and Enthuasiasm. The former is the placing Religion in those things, which Religion is not concerned in. The latter is when Persons are acted and governed by some suppos'd Communications from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107008:12"/>
Heaven, by Revelations, Visions, Inspirations, by Raptures and Illuminations, and unaccountable Impulses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He shew'd there was such Fanaticism amongst them, and in their Convents; of the former sort, he instanced in their Monkish Orders, Habits, Rules and Privileges granted to them, and depended upon. To which our Author gives not one word of Reply.</p>
               <p>To the latter [<hi>Enthusiasm</hi>] the Apologist refers.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) The Institution of their Orders, which with their Rules they say, were first instituted by the Holy Ghost.</item>
                  <item>(2.) Many of their Doctrines, as <hi>Purgatory, Transubstantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Immaculate Conception,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>(3.) Many of the things defined and observed in the Church, as Sacraments, Festivals, Canonizations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which they plead Revelation.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">3. He shewed further, that these Revelations, were only <hi>suppos'd,</hi> not truly so. And that 1. Because it derogates from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. And 2. Because they agree not amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Of which there is given a notorious Instance in the case of the Immaculate Conception, where Revelation is pleaded on both sides; and each side charges the other with Imposture about it.</p>
               <p>But here our Author is wholly silent. However something must be said upon this Head, and that amounts to this.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>those in Convents in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>embrace a retired Life, dedicate themselves to the Service of God, in Praying, Fasting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>some according to the Institution of St.</hi> Benedict, <hi>others of St.</hi> Francis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what follows? therefore they are not Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, therefore they are not Superstitious and Enthusiasts, that is, they are not Fanaticks, because they are not. Surely no Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>could have fallen into this account, without the assistance of such a</hi> Representer.</p>
               <p>2. He adds, <hi>Religious men in Convents, are Fanaticks, forsooth, because they are acted by some suppos'd Revelations, Visions, Raptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What Controversial Stuff is this! Why at this rate, he might make Fanaticks of all the Patriarchs and Prophets, of St.</hi> Joseph, <hi>St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and the rest of the Apostles; and most of all St.</hi> John, <hi>whose whole Book of Revelation, is nothing now, it seems, but so much Fanaticism.</hi> Surely our Author is here driven to some Extremity, when he has no other Refuge, but by making the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107008:12"/>
Case in dispute betwixt us parallel with the Case of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles; and that when the <hi>Apologist</hi> calls those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, <hi>Supposed Revelations, Visions and Raptures,</hi> it's as Criminal as if he had said as much of the Divine Writers. <hi>At this rate,</hi> saith he, <hi>he might make Fanaticks of all the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles.</hi> At what rate? What, because he saith those pretended to in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are <hi>supposed?</hi> will it follow therefore that those of the Prophets and Apostles are <hi>supposed</hi> too? No surely, no more than it will follow, because the Revelations of the Prophets and Apostles are Divine, therefore those alledged in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are Divine also. Our Author saith of the <hi>Apologists</hi> account of Fanaticism, <hi>What Controversial stuff is this</hi>! But I may with good reason return it, <hi>What</hi> impious <hi>stuff is this!</hi> that will make the Inspirations of <hi>Magdalen</hi> of <hi>Pazzi,</hi> and the Revelations of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> (how fond and contradictory soever) to stand upon the same foundation with the Revelations of St. <hi>John:</hi> And those which some of their own Authors call <hi>Humane Dreams, Fantastick Visions,</hi> and others call <hi>Impostures,</hi> to be as much from God, as the Visions of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the Dream of <hi>Joseph,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>disposes her Fanaticks into Convents for advantage,</hi> is another Charge produced against them by the Preacher, and insisted upon by the <hi>Apologist</hi>; but that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for reasons best known to himself, left as he found it.</p>

               <head>Sixth Character of a Pulpit-Papist.</head>
               <p> 
                  <note place="margin">Char. 6.</note>In the <hi>Roman</hi> Church the Sacrament must now be no longer a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative, but a Real Propitiatory Sacrifice; And Christ's Natural Body must be brought down upon a Thousand Altars at once, and there Really broken—and his Blood actually spilt a Thousand times every day. Here the <hi>Apologist</hi> charges our Author with altering the sense of the Preacher, when he makes the Preacher to declare that was a positive Assertion of the Papists, which was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Consequence of the Preacher's from their Assertion; and that for this purpose he had left out the words <hi>Now,</hi> and <hi>must be,</hi> that were the Indications of it. All that our Author has to reply to this Charge is, that it's <hi>a Nice point the Vindicator is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, to bring off the Preacher:</hi> But it's not so <hi>Nice</hi> as 'tis evident that our Author's account of it is a <hi>Foul Misrepresentation.</hi> If the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107008:13"/>
Preacher had charged it as a Doctrine own'd by the Papists, then so far as they disown it, it had been a Misrepresentation; but as it's an Argument against them (as it's plain it was) then it's no more a Misrepresentation, than it's false, and that belongs not to Representation, but Dispute. And therefore so far as an Argument of the Preacher against the Papists, differs from a Concession and Assertion of the Papists, so far has our Author misrepresented the Preacher; when he saith, <hi>That the Protestants awkard Reasoning is set out for their Doctrine.</hi> Well at length however it shall be own'd for <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning and Inference</hi>; and though it's not his <hi>Province</hi> (he saith) <hi>to examine the truth of such Reasoning,</hi> yet he fancies that <hi>'tis easily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable with Reason and Scripture, and so intelligible—that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Altar is Representative of that upon the Cross:</hi> That is, if he will speak to the purpose, That though the Sacrament be a Real and Propitiatory Sacrifice, yet it's still Representative. But how will he prove it? His Argument is this, <hi>Christ really present in the Sacrament may be offer'd to God upon the Altar by the Hands of the Priest, in Remembrance of the same Christ offering himself a Victim up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross for the Redemption of man: and consequently, the Sacrifice of the Altar is Representative of that upon the Cross.</hi> Where I would only ask him, what is the difference betwixt <hi>Christ's being really present in the Sacrament when offer'd,</hi> and <hi>the Sacrifice of the Altar?</hi> What again is the difference 'twixt the <hi>being offer'd in Remembrance of Christ's offering himself upon the Cross,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of that upon the Cross</hi>; and consequently, whether he has not proved what he intended after this manner, that <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Altar is Representative of that upon the Cross,</hi> because it's Representative? Methinks he might have shewn some little respect, when he is on the Arguing part, to what the <hi>Apologist</hi> had offer'd against this.</p>
               <p>But however, though his Argument may signifie little, yet he hopes Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>'s may be of some Authority, <hi>who,</hi> he saith, <hi>never scrupled the least at this</hi>;<note place="margin">Epil. to <hi>Trag.</hi> l. 3. c. 5. p. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>expresly owning the</hi> [<hi>Elements changed into the Body and Blood of Christ, to be truly the Sacrifice of Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, and to be both Propitiatory and Impetratory</hi>] <hi>and yet never deni'd it to be perform'd in Remembrance of Christ crucified.</hi> But here our Author has grosly injur'd Mr. <hi>Thorndike.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> owns no such thing (as I can find) that <hi>the Elements are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> But he speaks things plainly inconsistent with it, as he saith, <hi>N.</hi> 1. <hi>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107008:13"/>
containing Mystically, Spiritually and Sacramentally (that is, as in and by a Sacrament) tendreth and exhibiteth,</hi> not the Body of Christ, much less turn'd into it. Nay further he saith, <hi>The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is Nothing else but the Representation here upon Earth of what is done in Heaven. N.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither doth he say, <hi>the Elements are truly the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross,</hi> but the Eucharist, and the Eucharist as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting. For thus he saith, <hi>N.</hi> 10. Not the Elements, <hi>but the breaking, pouring forth, distributing, dealing, are all parts of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as the whole action is that Sacrifice by which the Covenant of Grace is confirmed.</hi> N. 10. And further, <hi>the Eucharist</hi> [that is as thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred] <hi>is the same Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross.</hi> How? <hi>As that which representeth is truly said to be the thing which it representeth?</hi> That is, so far as the Representer of the thing may be said to be the thing Represented, so far is the <hi>Eucharist the same Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When he saith, the Eucharist is <hi>Propitiatory and Impetratory</hi>; he doth not in the least own that it is after the same manner that the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross was <hi>Propitiatory</hi> and <hi>Impetratory.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) Because he saith, <hi>Whether the Eucharist in regard of the Oblation, so in regard of the Consecration, may be call'd a Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> is a Question among some of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> N. 6.</item>
                  <item>(2.) He refers it wholly to the Participation of it. <hi>If men,</hi> saith he, <hi>did but consider, that the Eucharist had never been instituted but to be participated, they would find it impertinent to alledg any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it should be a Sacrifice, that tendeth not to the participation of it</hi>; which is directed against the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> N. 10.</item>
                  <item>(3.) He most peculiarly makes the Propitiation and Impetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Sacrament to respect the Prayers of the Church there offer'd up. <hi>N.</hi> 11. For thus he concludes, <hi>Is not the Sacrament a Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory and Impetratory Sacrifice by vertue of the Consecration, though in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Oblation and Presentation of it by the Prayers of their Church?</hi> So that the Case remains still where it was; if it be a Real Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice, it's not Representative, for the one implies the Presence, the other the Absence of the same thing; the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it's the thing, the other implies it's only the sign or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of it; and so a thing can be no more the Representative of it self, than it can be it self and not it self at the same time.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But he undertakes further, that <hi>the other is not more difficult to be conceived,</hi> viz. <hi>How Christ's Body may be Really present in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107008:14"/>
and yet his Body not really Broken there, nor his Blood actually spilt.</hi> Here the <hi>Apologist</hi> took up the Cause after this manner: <hi rend="margQuotes">Something is really broken and actually spilt, if it be a Real and Propitiatory Sacrifice; something is really broken and actually spilt, as our senses tell us, and as they acknowledg: And now that the Body and Blood should only be there, and yet that not be the Body that is broken, nor that be the Blood that is spilt, is next to the affirming, that it's broken, and not broken, spilt and not spilt.</hi> But our Author here unties the knot, as he presumes; For, saith he, all this may yet be, that <hi>his Body may be there, and his Body not be broken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Since 'tis not present there Corporeally, but Sacramentally only; which manner of presence is no more consistent with real Breaking or Spilling, than are Spirits, or the Glorified Bodies of the Blessed, which though Real and Substantial Bodies still, are notwithstanding not at all susceptible of those Corporeal Accidents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to this, let us consider,</p>
               <p>What is that Body of Christ which is said to be <hi>Really present in the Sacrament.</hi> And that is the same Body which our Saviour lived in, and that hung upon the Cross, and which the Elements are turn'd into by Consecration. But will he say the Question is not concerning the nature of the Body, which is granted to be a proper Body consisting of Flesh and Blood; but the presence of that Body, which is <hi>not Corporeal but Sacramental only, which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of presence is no more consistent with real Breaking,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>than the Glorified Bodies of the Blessed, which though Real and Substantial Bodies, are not susceptible of those Corporeal Accidents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Body we speak of, is not a Glorified Body, but the same Body which hung upon the Cross, which consisted of Flesh and Blood, and had Flesh that might be broken, and Blood that might be spilt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Sacramental Presence</hi> of a Substantial Body consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Flesh and Blood, Bones and Sinews (which they grant the Body in the Sacrament to have) whatever our Author thinks, is surely one of the most <hi>difficult</hi> things <hi>to be conceived</hi> in the world. For it is to suppose a thing to be without being that thing which it is; to suppose a Body to be there, and yet to be divested of all the Properties belonging to that Body. Nay it's to suppose that which is a Real and Substantial Body to be only representatively
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107008:14"/>
present, and by way of Signification; which is as much as to say, the Body is not present, for the same thing cannot be the thing, and the Representation of the thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no more reason for this <hi>Sacramental Presence</hi> of a Real Body, than there is for its being a Sacramental and not a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Body: For what is the reason why they ascribe a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Presence</hi> to a Real Body, but because they know there are none of the Tokens belonging to such a Presence; and then why should it not be a Real Body, but Sacramental, when there are none of the Properties belonging to a Real Body to be discerned, or existent in it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this I add; therefore there can be no such thing as what he calls a <hi>Sacramental Breaking and Spilling</hi> of Real Body and Blood. For such as the Body is, such is the Presence, such the Breaking and Spilling; and why he should argue from a Sacramental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to a Sacramental Breaking and Spilling, and not argue from a Substantial existence of a Body to Real Presence and Real Spilling, is a thing may <hi>not be difficult</hi> to our Author, but is surely in reason not to be conceiv'd. If the <hi>Absurdities</hi> be <hi>gross,</hi> let them thank themselves for it, for they are no other than they first offer to the world, and it's no wonder the world returns them upon them with advantage.</p>

1. <hi>It asserts that Popery puts out the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding of those of her own Communion.</hi> This Assertion was not introduced here either by the <hi>Adviser</hi> in his <hi>Assertions,</hi> or by the <hi>Apologist.</hi> But it was particularly handled in the <hi>Apology,</hi> Assert. 14. <hi>p.</hi> 29. and <hi>Assert.</hi> 25. <hi>p.</hi> 48. where it's proved, (1.) That in their Church, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church, without a reason, is not only <hi>safe,</hi> but <hi>meritó<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>; and that whoever thus implicitly believes, is a <hi>good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi> (2.) That <hi>Ignorance</hi> is in their Opinion <hi>the Mother of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> (3.) That it's a mortal sin so much as to doubt, and so no room is left for enquiry. (4.) That they take away the Key of all Spiritual and Divine knowledg, the Holy Scriptures. Now instead of an Answer, our Author has in his <hi>Sayings</hi> whólly left out <hi>Assert.</hi> 14. and blows off all that is said in <hi>Assert.</hi> 15. with this one word, <hi>it's a great Calumny,</hi> p. 51. And what he now offers upon this Head, is, (1.) that <hi>they have many Books, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms,</hi> &amp;c. I wish he could say the Scriptures, <hi>to be ignorant of which is to be ignorant of Christ, saith their Canon Law,</hi> Dist. 38. <hi>Si juxta</hi>; but That the people are not allowed so much as a <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> of. And the time was in the Reign of <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> and before Heresie disturb'd the peace of its Empire, that persons have been burnt for teaching their Children the Creed and the Lord's-Prayer in the Vulgar Tongue. (2.) He saith, <hi>There's none but knows, that whoever will be a Christian must submit his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to such Mysteries that are above it.</hi> Therefore will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he must not so much as enquire what those Mysteries are, and whether they are of that kind, as he must <hi>submit his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding to</hi>; whether, that is, they are of the Doctrines of our Saviour, or of men?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Popery tears out the Hearts of all others out of her Communion; whom she cannot deceive, she will destroy.</hi> This, saith our Author, <hi>is false.</hi> How so? (1.) because <hi>though Catholicks are bound to go and teach all Nations, yet when men are so obstinate as to reject all Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are taught to go elsewhere, and only to pity and pray for such blind souls, but not to destroy them.</hi> Witness the course they took in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> in the Conversion of the poor Natives, a course that made them abhor Christianity, as <hi>Bartholomaeus Casas,</hi> a Bishop of theirs present, relates, to whom I refer our Author.</p>
               <p>(2.) He answers, <hi>'Tis true, in the Catholick Church care is taken to preserve all such as are her Members, firm in her Communion, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107008:15"/>
there are not wanting Threats to keep the inconstant from being misled into Error; as likewise punishments to reduce such as leave her, and blindly run after false Guides.</hi> A fair Concession! And which will lead us into an examination of the case, and teach the world what they are to expect. For if all within her Communion are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to their <hi>Threats</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> we know how large a share of the world, according to their computation, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, since they claim a Jurisdiction over all Christians and Churches. But,</p>
               <p>(3.) He saith, <hi>If for this reason</hi> [such Punishments] <hi>she must be said to tear out their Hearts, and destroy such as she cannot deceive; what is to be the Character of this Preacher's Church, which by the consent of Bishops is fenced with such Laws as punishes with loss of Goods, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment and Death, not only those who leave her Communion, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise those who were never members of it?</hi> But we are not concern'd for the present so much to understand what the Preacher's Church is, as that Church which the Preacher is not of. Was there never no <hi>Tearing</hi> or <hi>Destroying</hi> elsewhere? Yes surely, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what looks that way; <hi>I cannot say,</hi> saith our Author, <hi>but that rash Zeal, headlong Revenge, or detestable Avarice, may have hurried some of ours upon such barbarous attempts. But certainly never did any Christians deliberately and with counsel thus deeply engage themselves in Blood.</hi> So that if he is to be credited, if there have been <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Attempts,</hi> it was only <hi>rash zeal,</hi> &amp;c. but not <hi>deliberate,</hi> not <hi>with Counsel</hi> and Law. And it has been only <hi>some</hi> that have been thus <hi>hurried</hi> to such <hi>attempts,</hi> but not a considerable Body among them; and much less such as have had the Supreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in their Church. As for the <hi>Laws</hi> the Preacher's Church is <hi>fenced</hi> with, our Author surely knows from what occasion they arose, and whose practices they were that gave birth to them; and he ought to know again, that the Laws in their Execution never produced such <hi>Barbarous Attempts,</hi> as what he calls their own <hi>rash Zeal, Headlong Revenge, and Detestable Avarice.</hi> So that if Law and no Law be compared, the state of no Law (if such it was) has been far more mischievous than that of Law. But were there <hi>never any Christians that did thus deliberately and with counsel engage themselves in Blood,</hi> as, he saith, the Preacher's Church has done? What thinks he of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> are they not Christians? And were there never any such things <hi>deliberately and with Counsel</hi> perpetrated amongst them? Have they no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107008:16"/>
no Laws that touch upon this point? And were there never any <hi>Christians engaged in Blood</hi> upon pursuance of those Laws? Is there no such thing as Excommunicating and Anathematizing Hereticks among them? No delivering over persons so convicted and condemned, to the Secular Power? And is there no such thing as compelling such Secular Powers to exterminate those Hereticks out of their Dominions? Is there no <hi>Confiscations of Goods, Imprisonment,</hi> no <hi>Death</hi> for such as are obstinate? And were there never Persons, Families, Countries that suffer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Crusado's issued out against them, in obedience to such Laws, Canons and Decrees? Surely our Author is much to seek in the state of his present Church, if he is ignorant of this, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more than I shall now tell him; and is very ignorant in the state of the Preacher's Church he has left, if he thinks his New Mother falls short of <hi>the</hi> old, as he saith. But if he saith one thing and thinks another, how fit he may be to be a Member of the Church he is now in, I know not; but surely he could be no fit Member then of the Church he left. For a Conclusion of this, I shall crave our Author's patience to turn to the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, <hi>Can.</hi> 3. and he will see I have not said this without Book, or wrong'd his Church, however he may have wrong'd the Preacher's Church in his account of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Absurdity of Auricular Confession is endless, where a man unlades himself of all his sins, by whispering them into the Priests Ears.</hi> Of this, he saith, <hi>it's a Calumny and Misrepresentation; since no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks teach that Only whispering sins in the Ears of a Priest is sufficient for their Remission.</hi> Nor doth the Preacher say that <hi>only</hi> whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is sufficient, for he must needs know that there is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up their Cross, and saying <hi>Mea Culpa,</hi> and many other things to be done.

                  <note place="margin">De Sacram. Poenit. Sect. 70.</note> Is it because it's called <hi>whispering?</hi> For what then serve their Boxes, and why is it call'd a Seal? Is it because of the easiness of it? That is the case at the last. For, saith he, <hi>every one will see how insincere this Preacher was in saying, that a man unlades himself,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To make his Followers believe the Papists to be so sottish as to think their sins forgiven by a whisper only?</hi> He may e'ne turn his anger upon his own

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Of Transubstantiation, where men must renounce all their Five Senses at once.</hi> Here the <hi>Apologist</hi> charged our Author with a small Falsification, which indeed he has now mended, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. But he will make up that defect by the force of his Argument; for now he seriously undertakes to prove that in <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> they don't <hi>renounce all their Five Senses.</hi> As for three of them he has nothing to say; but then <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> are so far from being against, that they eminently serve for the proof of it. As how! <hi>If,</hi> saith he, <hi>we follow our Hearing, which is the sense by which Faith comes, we are oblig'd to believe it. Christ's words expresly signifie and declare the Sacrament is his Body. These words we hear deliver'd by those whom he has appointed to Teach and Instruct the Flock, to wit, the Pastors of the Church; these words we see likewise, and read in Holy Scripture. So that if we follow our Ears and our Eyes directed by the Word of God, we are bound to believe this Mystery, and consequently do not Renounce all our Five Senses at once.</hi> Well! but do we hear Christ thus declaring? No, but we hear the Church. Has the Church then such an Organical voice to speak, as we have Ears to hear? No, but the Church teaches by its Pastors. But are the Pastors we hear, all Infallible in their Teaching? And are we to believe them, although they teach contrary to sense and reason? There indeed he has lost the Case. But however he brings in <hi>Sight</hi> to his relief. For <hi>these words,</hi> saith he, <hi>we see like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and read in Holy Scripture.—And whilst we let both our Senses and Reason be immediately directed by God's Word, which is Infallible, we more reverence the Scriptures, and believe upon better Grounds than the Protestants.</hi> Thus we are at last led to a Private Spirit, and the Protestant way of resolving Faith into the Scriptures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of any Infallible Interpreter. For 'tis but <hi>letting our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Reason be immediately directed by God's Word, which is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> and we may soon be satisfied. I heartily thank our Author for this free Concession; for these are the Grounds Protestants do believe upon. But yet he will needs have it, that they <hi>believe upon better Grounds than the Protestants.</hi> This I am apt to think he will no more be able to prove, than that they <hi>Reverence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107008:17"/>
more than Protestants.</hi> However this he attempts and gives this reason for, that <hi>Protestants let natural Objects, ever about Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Faith, have the direction of their Senses, in which they are so often deceived, rather than the Word of God, which cannot deceive them.</hi> But where has the Word of God taught us that we are not to judg of <hi>Natural Objects</hi> by those Senses which he has given us to judg of Natural Objects by? Will he undertake to prov<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this also? When he himself <hi>acknowledges that to frame a judgment of the nature or substance of a thing, we must depend upon the information of sense, and that the common and natural way is to judg according to the relation the senses give, from the external and natural accidents of the thing.</hi> And now is not a Wafer a Sensible Object, and are we not to judg of it according to the <hi>Relation the Senses give</hi> of it, and from its <hi>external and natural accidents?</hi> How will our Author salve this difficulty? That he proceeds in after this manner: <hi>But if we desire to frame a true judgment</hi> [as if the other was a false one] <hi>of what is the Nature and Substance of such an Object, not according to a Natural Being, but according to the Divine Power, and what it may have of Supernatural; the Senses ought not to be laid aside, but we must consider here too the information these give, not now from the Natural Accidents, but from the Word of God.</hi> I should have thought the Conclusion to be infer'd from hence would rather <hi>be, the Senses ought to be laid aside,</hi> forasmuch as we are not in such case to judg of the <hi>Natural Accidents</hi> according to what they report. For I must confess he is one of the first I have met with that has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Argument this way, and that appeals to the Senses for the proof of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which their Church so cautiously warns them against in this matter. But he will <hi>illustrate this by an instance in another matter. A Friend,</hi> saith he, <hi>sends me a transparent Stone, of which when I would make a judgment, I cannot do it without the information of my Senses. These may inform me two ways, either by looking upon the thing it self, or by reading the Letter, sent along with it, or the report of the Bearer. If I take the information of my Senses from the view of the Stone, I judg it to be a pebble; if from the Letter (wrote by an excellent Artist) and the Bearer (a skilful Jeweller) I judg it to be a true Diamond, upon their authority and greater skill. Now in which judgment of these ought I to acquiesce? Certainly in this last, and yet in so doing I hope I should not renounce all my Five Senses at once.— So since my Senses assure me from Scripture and the Pastors of God's Church, that the Sacrament is Christ's Body; I am bound in reason to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107008:17"/>
judg of it so, rather than from the Natural Accidents, to judg it to be Bread: So that in thus believing this Mystery, we do not renounce, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our Senses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his Instance reaches not the Case:</p>
               <p>1. Because the judging, whether a Transparent Stone be a Counterfeit or a Diamond, is not a matter of mere sense, but judgment, skill and experience, and belongs to an Artist. But Sense will teach every one whether it be a Stone or a Pea, hard, or soft, transparent, or opacous. But now the Case before us is, whether what we see is a bit of Bread, or the Body of a Man; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it's broken or whole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore to put the case right, and make it parallel, he must suppose the Stone to be a known Diamond, as known to him it's sent to, as to him that sent it; and that the Letter and Bearer both affirm this small Stone which he now holds betwixt his fingers, and knows by his Senses to be a Stone and not a Man, is yet the great <hi>Mogul</hi> in person, and so is every Diamond besides that comes over, and yet that Prince is still in his own Country. Must that person now, because of their <hi>Authority and greater skill,</hi> think himself bound to <hi>acquiesce</hi> in their judgment against the testimony of sense; or must he not renounce his senses to do it?</p>
               <p>2. He supposes further, that the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is as plainly contained in Scripture, as it is in the Letter that the <hi>Transparent Stone</hi> then sent is a Diamond. But that he knows we deny; and when he can find these or the like words, This Bread is turn'd into my Natural Body, or is upon Consecration my true Substantial Body, it will be time enough to prepare a further Answer for him. The Question being not, whether what God teaches is not to be believed; but whether he hath so taught. So that it still remains true what the Preacher charged upon him, <hi>that in believing Transubstantiation, a man must renounce his five Senses at once,</hi> even <hi>hearing</hi> it self, which will not only teach us to distinguish betwixt the Host's, and the Priest's falling into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (though we are blindfold) but we must in their way renounce that Sense to believe it, when we hear all Mankind concurring in it, that the report of Sense is to be believed, and that in our Author's words, <hi>To frame a judgment of the nature or substance of a thing, we must depend upon Sense.</hi>

               <p>5. <hi>The Pope alone cannot err, and all others without some of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, cannot but err.</hi> Here are two Propositions: 1. <hi>The Pope
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107008:18"/>
cannot err.</hi> This our Author now calls <hi>an Opinion of some School-Divines,</hi> whereas the <hi>Apologist</hi> shewed it to be the prevailing <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of their Church, whether in respect of number or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>It's the most common opinion of almost all Catholicks,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin. It's the Catholick Truth, and what all Catholick Doctors teach in these days,</hi> saith <hi>Suarez.</hi> But to this not a word. (2.) <hi>All others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but err.</hi> Here our Author is guilty of a new Misrepresentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is <hi>charged upon us,</hi> saith he, <hi>because we believe the members of our Church to be fallible, that therefore they cannot but err.</hi> Where he changes the Proposition into a Conclusion, by foysting in the word, <hi>Therefore,</hi> and then running it down as <hi>a most Illogical and absurd consequence</hi>; but let him answer for the faults of it, whose conseqeunce it is. The consequence then be to himself, and let the Proposition be the Preacher's, that <hi>all others without some of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance cannot but err. This is absolutely false,</hi> saith our Author, and so say I too; but it is true Popery.</p>
               <p>Let their Catechism decide the Case,<note place="margin">Catech Trid. Art. Symb. 9. Sect. 19. Edit. Lugd. 1676.</note> to that I appeal, which thus delivers the sense of their Church upon it, <hi>But as this one Church</hi> (which the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is at the Head of, <hi>Sect.</hi> 15.) <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err in delivering the Doctrine of Faith and Manners, seeing it's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Ghost: So all the rest, which assume to themselves the name of a Church, must of necessity be engaged in the most pernicious Errors of Doctrine and Manners, as being led by the spirit of the Devil.</hi> Now here is the whole <hi>Calummy</hi> at large. If men submit to the Pope, and are in his Church, they have the benefit and assistance of his Infallibility, and are under the Guidance of it as secure as in the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi>; but if they leave it, they are drown'd in error and perdition. And surely, while they are in actual Error, they cannot but err, according to the known Axiom, <hi>Quicquid est quamdiu est, necesse est esse.</hi> Because the <hi>Apologist</hi> before was modest, and having not seen the Sermon it self, and so not fully understanding the sense of it) would neither too hastily condemn or acquit, but after he had said what he thought fit upon it, concludes, <hi>If the Preacher went beyond this, what Author or Authors he had for it, I know not, they do not at present occur to me</hi>; our Author begins to exult, saying, <hi>It's such a Consequence as the Apologizer himself knows not how to justifie,</hi> (nor need not as a Consequence, for that's his own) <hi>and yet he has not goodness enough to acquit us from so foul a Calumny.</hi> The matter it seems is <hi>foul,</hi> and is prov'd upon them, let him now she his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in confessing the Charge, or more of his strength to prove it a <hi>Calumny.</hi>

               <p>The first shall be considered in another place, <hi>Char.</hi> 14.

Because the Apostle there distinguishes it from <hi>Doctrine,</hi> v. 6. (2.)

               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apologist</hi> shew'd farther, it was not reasonable to fix this sence upon the Preacher, because he must needs know it to be otherwise. To this our Author briskly returns, <hi>Marry, if they never Preached contrary to what they knew, this would be a good Rule.</hi> And he has found it by woful experience to be a hard task to discover it; though it has been plainly made out that some write <hi>contrary to what they know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He shew'd farther, that the Preacher was speaking about Worship, and so consequently it must be what is so accounted; and therefore that this must be rather the Reading of Lessons out of Scripture and Hymns (which are sometimes call'd <hi>Prophesie,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.1.) and which are in their Church-Service in an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue.</hi> This our Author passes by, as also the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge following it.</p>
               <p>But yet he will have it a <hi>Calumny, whilst he asserts a thing of the Papists, which in the common acceptation of the word is absolutely false.</hi> But what if it was the <hi>common acceptation of the word,</hi> if not the acceptation the Apostle takes it in, in that place which the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107008:19"/>
Preacher refers to? But what if it be not the common accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, but that it's taken vulgarly for foretelling things to come? Who then is the Calumniator?</p>
               <p n="4">2. <hi>They make no other use of Confession, than what profest Drunkards do of Vomiting.</hi> Our Author saith, <hi>This is a most putid Calumny, and that the Vindicator dares not defend, but only that so it is in the practice of many of their Church.</hi> This he complains of, and with good reason; but then what shall be said of one that after he has told a story of one that declaim'd against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, for a <hi>Generation of Vipers, and a profligate sort of men, knowing but two Families, and those good men</hi>; from thence takes occasion to exclaim, <hi>But this is to the Protestant-tune: if a man can't tell how to run down Popery, though he knows nothing of it, he's no true Son of the Church of England.</hi> This is Case for Case.</p>
               <p>But was this all the <hi>Apologist</hi> had to say in defence of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? did not he produce Authorities of their own as to the General practice? Did he not refer to their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the <hi>Taxa Camerae Apostolicae</hi> in confirmation of it?

               <p>Here our Author observes against the <hi>Apologist,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he proves first it may so happen, which is as much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as for one to say the Church-of</hi>-England-<hi>men are corrupters of God's Word, because 'tis possible they may be so.</hi> But the case is far otherwise; for if there be no certainty, but that the Pope may Canonize a Rebel for a Saint, then there is no certainty but that the Saint may be no Saint.

               <p>(2.) <hi>He saith it has been done, and in the next line comes in with an instance, where it had like to have been done.</hi> The instance was of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107008:19"/>
                  <hi>Maria Visitationis,</hi> where indeed it was not done; but that it was not, was more from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Jealousie, than the Pope's Sagaciousness, who sanctified her by Letters under his own hand. Our Author, I perceive, dares not so much as name this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>(3.) As for the Instance of <hi>Thomas à Becket,</hi> he saith he was Canoniz'd not for Rebellion, and because he adhered to the Pope against his Prince, but <hi>for his Virtuous Life and Martyrdom, and the attestation of his Sanctity by undeniable Miracles.</hi> Not for Rebellion! as if that would be exprest in the Reasons for his Canonization! I have read it was a Moot question, Whether he was damn'd for Treason, or Glorified as a Martyr.<note place="margin">Caesar. Hist.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>They pray to a Crucifix of Wood or Stone, as well as to Christ himself, and attribute as much satisfaction to it, as to the Blood of Christ.</hi> Our Author rejoyns, that <hi>This is every word an Infamous Falshood.</hi> And continues, <hi>Though the Vindicator appeals to the Words and Forms of some of our Prayers, and then says, That</hi> [<hi>if words will make it plain, the Preacher was not mistaken</hi>] <hi>yet this is so childish a plea, that methinks it ought to be beneath a Divine, especially a man of conscience, to charge so gross an abomination upon such a frothy pretext.</hi> And then he gives his reason. I must confess that if the Vindicator had only the <hi>Words and Forms</hi> of their Prayers to plead in Vindication of the Preacher, without attending to the sense and reason of the thing, that it might be as <hi>childish and frothy</hi> as he represents it; and he would have <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.1. and the <hi>Benedicite</hi> used in our Church against him, as our Author argues.

In Conclusion, it appears to be no more true, that they are <hi>defamed</hi> by the <hi>method</hi> used in the <hi>Church of</hi> England, than that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Mother-Church</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as our Author suggests.)</p>

can call to mind to the Priest, from whom they expect Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without which Absolution is not to be expected; nor can they have any benefit of the Absolution. It's of this the Preacher saith, That the <hi>Consequence of it, is to run an apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being undone in many Cases by Knaves for Interest, or by Fools out of Levity and Inconstancy, and a blabling Humor, that lets them into the Secrets of Families,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Besides, instead of keeping up a wholesome Discipline, it's the way to corrupt it, and tends to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching both Laity and Clergy, in as many ways as there are Sins to be committed, when the Confessor and the Penitent begin to discover and understand one another.</hi> And this the <hi>Apologist</hi> confirmed from the Complaints made by good Men of their own Communion, from the shameful Cases to be found in their Casuists, from the Bulls of Popes, <hi>Contra solicitantes in Confessione.</hi>

As to the latter, the <hi>Apologist</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a <hi>Constitution</hi> of the Jesuits; but this the <hi>Sayer</hi> saith, is a <hi>wrested Interpretation, contrary to its plain meaning.</hi> But, why then did not our Author venture to assign this <hi>plain meaning</hi> of it; and to shew the <hi>meaning</hi> the <hi>Apologist</hi> thought belong'd to it, to be thus <hi>wrested?</hi> Who without doubt would have thought one good Argument of much better Authority, than a hundred bare Affirmations, tho never so positive.

               <p n="1">1.

                  <note place="margin">Char. 11.</note>This he breaks into four parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He changes Scripture into Legends.</hi> Hereby the <hi>Apologist</hi> shew'd was understood either that the Legends are of as good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Scripture; or that in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices, they used Legends, where they should have used the Scripture. He shews there is too much occasion given for the former amongst them, as when they own in their publick Offices, that St. <hi>Bridget</hi>'s Revelations <hi>came immediately from God to Her.</hi> But here our Author interposes, and saith, <hi>How does the Papist change the Scripture into Legends, when he's commanded by his Church to own the Scripture, as the Word of God?</hi> But if he owns the Scripture as the Word of God, because it's <hi>commanded by his Church</hi>; then, wherein is the difference, if he be <hi>commanded by his Church</hi> to believe a Legend to be of Divine Revelation? Our Author would have done a kind part if he had set us right in this matter between Divine Revelation and Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between the Revelation for Scripture, and the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for the Legends. But he saith, for all this, a Person is not alike obliged to assent. No! altho the Church requires it? But that, saith he, the Church doth not; for <hi>tho he may read Legends if he pleases, yet he is not bound by his Church or Religion to give assent to, or believe any one passage in any one Legend whatsoever.</hi> If he has no better Authority for the latter Branch, than the former, for <hi>he is not bound to assent</hi>; than, for <hi>he may read them if he pleases</hi>; his Cause is uncapable of his support. For, how can he be at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether he will <hi>read</hi> [hear] them if he pleases, when they are inserted into the Body of their Church-Service; and are Lessons chosen out for their Instruction? And he can as little say, they are not obliged to <hi>Assent</hi> to them, when the Church it self saith in its publick Office, <hi>They come immediately from God.</hi> Is it at last all come to this, that when things are <hi>instituted</hi> by <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sayings, p. 21.</note> For tho some <hi>pretended Reformers</hi> (as he calls them) have been so easy and forward (it seems) as to have judged those things <hi>worthy of Credit,</hi> which he was Canonized for; yet no Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is bound to <hi>assent or believe,</hi> but he may believe, as well as <hi>read the Legends of them,</hi> if he pleases; and if he pleases he may forbear and suspend. And this our Author doth abundantly confirm, by approving what the <hi>Apologist</hi> produced out of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> That <hi>all things contained in the Lives of the Saints, tho mentioned even in the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, depend upon human Testimony, as to matters of Fact, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently are subject to Error. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>proves they are not bound to believe:</hi> I grant it as far as that goes; but then they are <hi>not bound to believe</hi> what their Church Representative doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and to <hi>come immediately from God.</hi> Let him take which he pleases, if that will content him. But if in the mean time, their Church contradicts her self, and owns that at one time to be <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> which at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time has only human Testimony, is the Apologist bound to reconcile her to her self? Surely that is an Office becoming our Author himself. And till he has done it, he must excuse us if we a little doubt of the certainty of Faith so much magnified in their Church. Here our Author concludes this matter; but the <hi>Apologist</hi> went on to the latter Branch, that <hi>in their publick Offices they often use Legends instead of Scripture, and have put out Scripture to bring in Legends.</hi> This he proves from the design of Cardinal <hi>Quignonius,</hi> who in the Reformation of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> put Scripture instead of Legends; but that was condemn'd, and the Office so far brought back to its former state. This was so full a proof of what the Preacher suggested, that our Author thought it best to let it drop. But if he will see the Character of the design, against he writes again, let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use

               <p>This puts me in mind of a debt I am in to our Author at his fourth Character,<note place="margin">P. 21, 22.</note> who there tells us, that <hi>he cannot but admire some Protestant Preachers, Writers, and otherwise sober Lay-men of late, who take upon them to ridicule, and slightingly to wonder at the Papists for this their fond credulity, forsooth, in relation to old Legends, and Modern Lives of the Saints.</hi>— This I <hi>admir'd</hi> at in him, because I find <hi>some Popish Preachers, Writers, and otherwise sober Lay-men,</hi> that are as hard to believe as the Protestants, and think as meanly of them.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>inventions of men (how incredible soever)</hi> may in our Author's opinion be allowed (as he suggests). For, saith he, <hi>there is scarce any thing in all those Books objected upon this score against the Papists, whether Ancient or Modern Legends, but however incredible it may appear, yet generally is all in order to a good end, and the working Christian effects in the Reader.</hi> Here is now a Gate of <hi>Mindus</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to let in the whole Shoal of not only the <hi>Mendaciola</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> but all the Heroical Fictions of Ecclesiastical <hi>Quixotism,</hi> and to make them to become Authentick. But because our Author is so grave upon this Argument, that I doubt he may be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, let me for once recommend to him some few instances, for an Exercise of his Talent this way, to shew how they serve <hi>a good End, and raise the Admiration of God's Power, Goodness and Mercy.</hi> Doubtless he will quit himself exceeding well, if he can inform us where <hi>the great spiritual Advantage</hi> is in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of St. <hi>Aldern</hi>'s and <hi>Deicoala</hi>'s hanging their Garments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sun-beams; of St. <hi>Kentigern</hi>'s setting a <hi>Robin Red-breasts</hi> Head to its Body; of St. <hi>Odoaceus</hi>'s turning a Pound of Butter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

I might run into a Volume upon this Theme, if it were worth the while: But I suppose these may serve for the present to entertain his thoughts, and to shew the Reader how impertinent his Vindication of their Legends is.

                  <hi>as when the Saints are said in the Agony of Death, to have warned or requir'd, that when translated out of this World, they should be worshipp'd, and be invoked in Afflictions and Dangers.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He changes Sacraments into Shews, Priests into Puppets.</hi> Of this the <hi>Apologist</hi> produced his Instances, as 1. When they <hi>shew</hi> the Cup to the Laity, but suffer them not to partake of it. 2. When in their <hi>Solitary Masses,</hi> the Priest alone Communicates, and the People are only Spectators of the Solemnity, a Practice that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> approves of, and commends. 3. When the Host is elevated at Mass for Adoration. 4. When it's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in publick Processions. In which cases the Sacrament is only <hi>shew</hi>'d to the People, and is contrary to the end for which it was instituted. For as it was to be <hi>in Remembrance of Christ,</hi> so it was to be partook of, and by partaking of which, we do <hi>shew forth his Death,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. But to shew the Sacrament, and not to partake of it, is to <hi>change the Sacrament into a shew.</hi> To this our Author replies, <hi>Might not a</hi> Jew <hi>here step in, and with this Argument pretend, that Christ crucified was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew upon</hi> Calvary? <hi>but all this is nothing but a method to teach Atheists, how to make the greatest Mysteries of Christianity ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</hi> As if Christianity in its first Institution was a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing; and he that will bring it back to its first State, and have the Sacrament only so Administred, and used only to those ends for which it was ordain'd, must expose the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of it to the Scorn of <hi>Atheists.</hi> Cannot Christianity subsist, or the Mysteries of it be sacred, without we depart from the Simplicity and Purity of it, and set up new Institutions, or give new Ends to those Institutions? And because we are for partaking of it, and not making it an empty <hi>shew</hi>; because we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107008:23"/>
are for the People's partaking of it, as well as the Priest; and for their partaking of it in both Kinds, and not in one, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Primitive Institution; Must we <hi>teach Atheists a method, how to make the Mysteries of Christianity ridiculous?</hi> And because we declare against their Elevations, and exposing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their publick Processions, and their Adoration of it; may, by the same reason, <hi>A</hi> Jew <hi>step in, and with this Argument pretend that Christ crucified was another shew upon</hi> Calvary? But may not the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Atheist</hi> both step in, and deride the <hi>Mysteries of Christianity,</hi> when they are thus dress'd up for the Stage, and are turn'd into empty <hi>Shows?</hi> When they pretend to show our Saviour as upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and that concludes in showing the Host; and when the Sacrament is call'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and it concludes in the Elevation, Procession, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Participation only? I am loth to return him his own words, <hi>Those who make a shew of this, are within one step of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing</hi> Jews. It had certainly better become our Author to have vindicated the Practice of his Church, in the Charge exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited against them, and proved <hi>it absolutely false</hi>; or tho it was true, that they do not change the Sacrament into a <hi>shew,</hi> by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing other ends than it was instituted for, and neglecting those that were proper to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He preaches Purgatory instead of Repentance.</hi> Our Author here replies, <hi>'Tis absolutely false, inasmuch as in the plain import of the Words, it imprints this Notion in the Hearers,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists don't preach Repentance to the People, but instead of this they preach Purgatory.</hi> But our Author may remember, that when it was said upon occasion,<note place="margin">Sayings, p. 37.</note> that [if Words will make it plain, the Preacher was not mistaken] it was put by with this, that it was a <hi>Childish Plea.</hi> And why should not this Priviledg be allowed of retorting in the same way? But how comes this to be more the <hi>plain import of the Words,</hi> than what immediately precedes? For would it not equally follow, that when the Preacher said [<hi>They change Scripture into Legends, Sacraments into Shews, Priests into Puppets</hi>], That <hi>the plain import of the Words is,</hi> they have no Scripture, but Legends; no Sacraments, but Shows; no Priests, but Puppets? But if there be no reason to take the Words in that Sense in the three former, there is none to take them so in the last. And therefore, the meaning of the Preacher is no other than that, whereas they should preach Repentance sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107008:23"/>
according as the Gospel teaches, they preach Purgatory, which invalidates it (as the <hi>Apologist</hi> shewed). This our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith, is a <hi>mincing the Matters</hi>; but however it's the true Representation of it. But if we so take it, it's yet, he saith, <hi>False in it self.</hi> Here I expected a smart Answer to the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist,</hi> who undertakes the Proof of what he asserted four ways. 1. As the Doctrine of Purgatory takes People off from one of the most powerful Arguments to Repentance, which is the fear of Hell. 2. It makes them more studious of what will set them safe, than what will make them happy. 3. It makes them defer their Repentance, because of a further Allowance of time in another state. 4. As they may be delivered thence by the Masses, Alms, and Prayers of the Living. Surely these are points of some Consequence, and if they are truly infer'd, do shrewdly shake the Foundations of a Purgatory: If false, it would have been some gratification to have the Proof of it attempted. But our Author is here silent; and falls to the proving it <hi>false in it self,</hi> forasmuch as he himself has <hi>heard many Sermons of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Purgatory never so much as mentioned, unless it were to shew the insufferable Torments of the place, and how great the hazard is, even of getting thither.</hi> But how doth this Answer the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist</hi>'s Arguments to the contrary? He adds further, a Challenge to the <hi>Apologizer,</hi> to <hi>find out one Sermon of</hi> Spaniards, French, <hi>&amp;c. in Latin, that sets out Purgatory to the People, as to make them neglect Repentance.</hi> But this is to beg the Question; for the Point in dispute is, whether the Doctrine of Purgatory doth not invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Repentance, and dispose People to neglect it. And then the preaching Purgatory, as it's <hi>set out</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is the preaching People into a neglect of Repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He preaches Faction instead of Faith.</hi> If either the Preacher, or the <hi>Apologist</hi> thought it worth the while to write a Comment upon this, and to enlarge upon the subsequent Discourse in the Sermon, Volumes might be fill'd, beginning at the Apostolical Chair, (as it's call'd) and so descending to the parts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Communion; but the <hi>Apologist</hi> contented himself with a bare mentioning of the <hi>Pope's Jurisdiction over Princes, and the Power be challenges of deposing them.</hi> But here instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his Church, our Author carries the War amongst his Neighbours, always serving himself of a point, which he knows he may be safe in. However at length he appeals to their own
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107008:24"/>
Sermons, and fairly offers, <hi>As for the Faction they can discover in our preaching, let them do their best, to find even half so much; we freely give them a thousand years to review, for to match these four of theirs.</hi> And I will dare to return the Challenge, to find <hi>even half so much</hi> said for Obedience and Loyalty to Princes in all their Sermons for a <hi>Thousand years</hi> as in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of those <hi>Four years</hi> preach'd amongst us. We find among them Sermons upon Sermons, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> the Exaltation of the Pope's Power, and the Power of Holy Church over Princes; but as to Allegiance and Fealty to Princes, whether of their own or of another Religion, it's a difficult Theme, and rarely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But for that, saith he, <hi>Let them take in likewise the Sermons that are now preached in our Chappels</hi>; as if they would there preach up Faction, when it is to preach against themselves.

Here our Author inveighs against the Doctor for writing in a strain becoming rather a <hi>Play</hi> than a <hi>Sermon</hi>; because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes their Practices too much like what they are in themselves, and which he has rather fallen short of, than set forth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they deserved. As for instance, What are their ways of Exorcising, but Conjurations sanctified, and bring that into the Church, which should be by an Anathema thrust out of it? Being such as a very valuable Person, could not reflect upon without the highest Indignation: and who after he had describ'd it from the <hi>Ordo Baptizandi, cum modo visitandi; the Pastorals, Rituals,</hi>

For the Sin can hurt him no more, than if he had a Liccense to commit it.</hi> If a Malefactor be sure of a Pardon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has committed the Crime, it's as to himself the same, as if he had a Dispensation before-hand for it? And so it has been determined among themselves, That <hi>he that willingly commits a Sin in hope of a Jubile, or an Indulgence afterwards to be granted, doth not lose the benefit of it.</hi> This is a case propos'd by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. 1. c. 10. de Indulg. Sect. <hi>Altera.</hi>
                  </note> and which like a cautious Person he would not interpose in. Here our Author declares, <hi>This is most contradictory to the Doctrine we are taught, and to the received Notion of Indulgences amongst Catholicks, who are so far from presuming upon leave to Sin, upon the grant of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, that they don't think that any one Sin that is past, can be forgiven by an Indulgence.</hi> But this is <hi>protestatio Contra factum</hi>; where he has been taught his <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> I know not; but the time has been, when his Catholicks were taught otherwise; Or else, what needed it to have been complain'd of?<note place="margin">Review du Concile de Trent l. 5. c. 1. Gravam. Ger. n. 3.</note> Thus we are told that the Popes both have given, and their Pardoners have thus told the People, and the People have thus believed, that Indulgences were as well for the time to <hi>come,</hi> as the time past.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107008:28"/>
have a dormant Faculty for a plenary Pardon to be used when they please. But for all this, if our Author be to be credited, <hi>They don't think that any one Sin that is past, can be forgiven by an Indulgence.</hi> And in Confirmation of this, he saith, <hi>Indulgences are only for the Relaxation of Canonical Penalties due to Sin, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assigned by the Church, may likewise by the same Authority be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd.</hi> The whole of this matter will be determined by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what Indulgences are, and to what ends they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, and are esteem'd to serve in their Church.</p>
               <p>But here I observe, that the Account given by our Author of Indulgences, is the same that is own'd by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the rest of the Hereticks,<note place="margin">De Indulgent l. 1. c. 7. Sect. 4. <hi>Propositio, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> who, saith <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> held, that <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence amongst the Ancients, was nothing but a Relaxation of the Punishment which the Church commanded.</hi> And which he therefore disputes against by several Arguments; as 1. There would be no need of the Treasure of the Church. 2. That then an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence would be rather hurtful than profitable, and the Church would deceive her Children. 3. That they could not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the dead. 4. That many of them, who receive Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, do often, and are sometimes obliged to undergo Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Penance. 5. The form of them proves it. This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member has formerly been put to our Author,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrines and Practices,</hi> c. 8. p. 66.</note> and I should be glad to find him to confute <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or to reconcile <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to him. To this I may add, 6. That Relaxation of Penances, and Remission of Sins, are distinctly provided for in the Indulgences. So in the Bull of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Bullar. To. 3. p. 74.</note> is a grant not only of Relaxation, but Remission.</p>
               <p>But here our Author interposes, and saith, <hi>That they are so far from presuming upon leave to Sin, that they don't think any one Sin that is past, can be forgiven by an Indulgence.</hi> And for this he will be giving a Reason, because saith he, <hi>We are taught that no Sin is forgiven, even in the Sacrament of Confession, without a sincere Repentance.</hi> Whether the latter be true, will remain to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered under the next Character; but what will a Reason sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify against Matter of Fact? For it's still a question, whether Sin is not pretended to be forgiven by Indulgence? And what more common in Indulgences, than a promise of Remission, and plenary Remission? As for that, saith he, <hi>Whoever considers, that they were many times forgiven for many hundred years; nay, as the Doctor hath it</hi> [and surely he hath it from themselves] <hi>for many
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107008:28"/>
Thousand years to come, he must soon conclude that this could not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leave to sin for so long time to come, which so far exceeds the term of mans life.</hi> But though it <hi>gives not leave to sin,</hi> it's sure a pardon for sin; and he can no more have a pardon for a Thousand years past, who has lived but fifty or sixty, than have an allowance for a Thousand years to come. And the Doctor said not that they grant by Indulgences <hi>leave to sin</hi> for many Thousand years to come, but that <hi>they granted Idulgences for many Thousand years to come.</hi> But what saith our Author to these prodigious numbers of years? <hi>It's,</hi> saith he, <hi>only the releasing of Penances, which being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd in proportion to the sins, for some sins three years penance; for others five; might with some careless Christians amount to that degree, that for fifty years of life, they might possibly have</hi> 5000 <hi>years penalties due to their sins.</hi> And we shall add for him, the 32000 of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> and the ten hundred thousand of <hi>John</hi> the 22<hi>th.</hi> Well, supposing this account of it to be right, and that an Indulgence is only a relaxation of such Penances as are due to the offence: Yet, what a <hi>leave,</hi> or at least encouragement is here given to sin, when a man that has deserved to undergo 5000 or 30000, or ten hundred thousand years of Penance, shall by a Bull of a Pope be discharged from all this for saying three short Prayers, or <hi>five Pater-Nosters, five Aves,</hi> and <hi>a Credo?</hi> But supposing the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is so <hi>careless</hi> also, that after that he has run up the score to so high a sum, he has not procured such an Indulgence, and that the 5000, and the ten hundred thousand years Penalties remain due, where is it that he is to undergo these Penalties? And where is it that the Church in his notion, <hi>appoints, assigns,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts them? After all, methinks he had better have said, with some of their own Church, that the Relaxation doth not avail, as far as is promised, but it's so declared, that the <hi>Faithful might be excited to give, and the Church deceives them.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107008:29"/>
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> comes near it, when it asserts, <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> 2. He saith, <hi>I am certain no man of what Church soever so guilty, can have admittance there, but by a sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and restitution. This is the received Doctrine of his Church, and I hope in their dealing they practice it as much as any.</hi> Here he turns off the case in hand from the publick to the private state of affairs, and has not one word in vindication of what the <hi>Apologist</hi> laid to their charge, especially in that notorious instance of the Pope's solemn Oration made in the Conclave in commendation of the Assassination of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As our Author has here broke one sentence of the Preacher's from another, and set in the midst what belongs to the Sermon of Alms: So he has wholly omitted Assertion 14<hi>th.</hi> in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> viz. <hi>If the Pope and his Emissaries say the right hand is the left, the Papists are bound to believe it</hi>; which is there made good by four several Arguments. But here our Author is modest, and has left it to shift for it self, and his Church under the heavy charge of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No man can be a Papist, but he whose eyes are blinded by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or he who puts his own eyes out by Atheism.</hi> It's in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>No man Therefore can be a Papist, &amp;c.</hi> which refers to what was there before said, and the description the Preacher had given of Popery, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Pope <hi>can dispence with the Laws of Nature, and against the Old and New Testament.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Serm. p. 31, 32, 33.</note> 2. That the Word of God is a <hi>Nose of Wax,</hi> a <hi>Dumb Judg,</hi> and <hi>dead Ink.</hi> 3. That the Pope is <hi>another God upon Earth,</hi> and that <hi>if he declares the right hand is the left, we ought to believe him.</hi> And then follows, <hi>No man therefore can be a Papist, but,</hi> &amp;c. The Question here is not about the Lives of Papists (as our Author would have it) but about the <hi>character</hi> of Popery: And then it remains to be considered, whether the Preacher was right in his representation of it, and in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities he produces for it. But instead of bringing the case to an issue, our Author in his <hi>Good Advice,</hi> left out what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the Marginal Quotations of what he cited from the Sermon, and now has offer'd no manner of Reply to, nor so much as taken notice of the <hi>Apologist</hi>'s Argument.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Council of</hi> Trent <hi>expresseth its allowance of picturing the Divinity it self, and accordingly the Pictures of the</hi> Trinity <hi>are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to be beheld in the Popish Churches.</hi> This is a new point our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has substituted; perhaps thinking this look's somewhat
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107008:29"/>
better than an Answer to that he has omitted; but yet I shall take it in my way. Here the Preacher, 1. Appeals to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and for which he quotes the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To their practice and use.</p>
               <p>As to the first, our Author saith, <hi>it's false,</hi> since the Council <hi>delivers just the contrary,</hi> taking care that <hi>if it happens that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of the Holy Scriptures be painted or figured, that the people be taught, the Divinity is not therefore figur'd or painted, as if that could be seen with corporeal eyes, or represented in colours.</hi> Sess. 25.</p>
               <p>Now here I observe, 1. Our Author represents the case as if the Picturing of God and the Trinity in their Churches was much like what <hi>Aaron</hi> pleads for the Golden Calf, <hi>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</hi>; as if it was what they find in their Churches, have been placed there by they know not whom, and are like those that are to be seen, it seems, <hi>in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispiece of some Bibles and Common-Prayer-Books of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that come from an obscure uncertain hand; but what they themselves do not regard. <hi>If it happens,</hi> &amp;c. saith the Council; thus far indeed our Author goes with the Council, but why did he leave out what immediately follows, and why did he not read it as the Council reads it? <hi>If it happens that sometimes the Histories and Narrations of Scripture be Painted or Figured (when that shall be expedient for the unlearned people.)</hi> So that it's not an accidental thing, but designedly done, as an Expedient for instructing <hi>the unlearned people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however the Preacher saith that of the Council, which the Council denies, that they <hi>picture the Divinity it self</hi>; but doth he say, that they picture what they themselves believe to be the Picture of the Divinity? No surely, then he had contradicted the Council, and made them downright <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi>; but he lays it to their charge that they <hi>picture</hi> and make Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>the Divinity and Trinity it self,</hi> as well as of Saints, that is, not sparing even the Divinity. O but, saith the Council, <hi>these are only Histories of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> But is there any History of Scripture that tells us God did so appear in any Form, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than in a Prophetical Scheme? And is not even that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden when an Image of God is forbidden, because God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be described in any way but by what he is not; and so is a reason against Images in all, as well as any one Instance; and of which none can be proposed but what fall under the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107008:30"/>
As for what he hath seen <hi>in the Frontispiece of some Bibles and Common-Prayer Books,</hi> they belong no more to our Church, than the Temple of <hi>Pallas</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, though existent in it. If indeed they were as commonly to be seen in our Churches, were allow'd, were set up by order, and ador'd; if he could find it defended, and the benefit they are of to the people, set forth in the Articles and Catechism of our Church, then he had something to say; but till that, he is guilty of a gross Misrepresentation, and in his common phrase, of an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Falshood,</hi> that saith, <hi>that the Preacher's Exclamation of, O hateful sight! may be as properly apply'd to any thing of that nature in our Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He prays to Images. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>is false too,</hi> for several Reasons: (1.) <hi>Because they are taught to pray to God alone, but to none else.</hi> Is that all? It must be acknowledged they go a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for <hi>they desire the Intercession of such holy persons as are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, whether in Heaven or Earth?</hi> But do they no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desire the Intercession of Holy persons in Heaven, than they do those in Earth? Do they ask, suppose, of a Confessor to <hi>be delivered from the chain of their sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Entretiens de Philalethe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 2. p. 160, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Orat. Propr.</note> 
                  <hi>to be preserved from spiritual mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Hell-fire, and to be prepar'd for Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> as they ask of the Saints? Or do they so much as pray to God, that he would <hi>grant that by the Merits and Prayers of their</hi> Confessor, as well as St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> they <hi>may be delivered from the Fire of Hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) He saith, <hi>For Images, we confess them to be nothing but wood and stone.</hi> Will he be so bold as to say this, <hi>nothing but wood,</hi> after they are Consecrated? Let our Author consult <hi>Papist Represented and not Misrepresented,</hi> Chap. 1. And will he deny that they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenters, and to be applied to as if the Objects Represented were present? If he doth, why has he not bestow'd a little of his pains in chastising the <hi>Apologist?</hi> But it seems the <hi>Apologist</hi> however has laid himself open in going farther, for he speaks of <hi>leaving prayers with an Image.</hi> And why not as well as pray to them? Let him state the matter, and confute this, and I'le pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him the <hi>Apologist</hi> shall then give up the former. But what's become of the <hi>Christus in Imagine,</hi> in <hi>Curtius?</hi> Surely the City of <hi>Lucca</hi> will take it ill at his hands, that he has not a word to say in behalf of their famous Image, and the veracity of their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian. Here I shall refer the <hi>Sayer</hi> to what has been already said, <hi>Char.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 2. I shall take his excuse that he makes; for his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107008:30"/>
perversion of the Preacher's sense, though it had been a little more sincere, if he had positively acknowledged his fault, rather to come off with an <hi>If,</hi> when the case is evident.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>He worships Bread and Wine, not as Representations of God, but as God himself. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>is false, since we worship only God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not the Bread and Wine, which we believe not to be in the Blessed Sacrament.</hi> And then he comes in with his charge of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing, and gravely adds a good Rule from a worthy hand. But all is spoiled for want of proof that the Preacher doth charge it upon them, that t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y believe first of all the Bread and Wine to be in the Sacrament: and <hi>yet worship it as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> But the Preacher speaks not of what they believed, but what they did, as is plain by the Negative he inserts, viz. <hi>Here you see the Bread and Wine are worshipped by them, not as Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God,</hi> which the Bread and Wine are, <hi>but as God himself.</hi> The Preacher shews the grossness of their practice, that what is indeed but Bread and Wine in their Substance, and a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of our Saviour, they worship as God himself. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is what the thing is in it self, the latter he charges upon them as their practice. And therefore the <hi>Sayer</hi> first mistakes the case, and then proceeds to spend a censure upon it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>He is taught, that the Passion of Christ takes away only the guilt of Mortal sins, but not the eternal punishment.</hi> Here the <hi>Apologist</hi> took some little pains to state the Case, and proceeded upon these Heads, to shew in their way, 1. That the Guilt may be taken away, when the punishment is not. 2. That the Guilt may be taken away by one cause, and the eternal punishment by another. 3. That the Passion of Christ only takes away the Guilt of Mortal sins, but doth not take away the eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here it might be expected our Author would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the Merits of the Cause, but instead of that, saith, <hi>it's false</hi>; gives us a short reason or two, and dismisses the point, and leaves the Apology without a word of Reply.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>He is taught the non-necessity of Repentance before the imminent point of death.</hi> This is another new point scor'd up to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Preachers, and was none of the twenty eight Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Advice.</hi> But however, I shall try whether the Preacher had not Authority for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:107008:31"/>
Here our Author offers two things: 1. <hi>That it's absolutely contrary to the Doctrine and general practice of their Church, whose Members are obliged to go to Confession once a year, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd without a beauty Repentance.</hi> 2. <hi>We hear nothing so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of in our Books and Sermons, as deferring Repentance to the last.</hi> I will not undertake for their Sermons, for I am not so conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in theirs, as he is in ours; but in their Books we find, 1. That they are taught that they are not bound to repent <hi>but in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or point of death.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. <hi>The bare saying of Prayers, without either minding what he says, or understanding it, is sufficient to the Divine acceptance.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Our Author observes here, that <hi>it seems by the Apologizer this saying of the Preacher is not charged upon us as a profess'd Doctrine of ours, but only as a consequence of his own Head; and from whence does he draw it? From this suppos'd principle,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Romish <hi>Church enjoyns the saying Prayers in a Language unknown to the Generality of the people.</hi> The Chain as here represented, is wholly a Fiction. For after the <hi>Apologist</hi> had charged him with a partial Relation of the Preacher's sense, he thus concludes, <hi>So that what the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viser quotes is</hi> (not a consequence infer'd from a principle, as he saith, but) <hi>a particular of the foregoing General, the Preacher telling his Auditors, that meer Works done in Acts</hi> of Devotion in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, in the opinion of that Church, sufficient to Divine Acceptance; This he fortifies with an Instance, as it is in bare saying of Prayers without either minding what they say, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding it. And he goes on: And <hi>agreeably hereunto the Romish Church enjoyns the saying them in a Language not understood, &amp;c.</hi> So far is it either from our Author's consequence, or a principle from whence it's infer'd. But here our Author slips away from the Argument of the <hi>Apologist,</hi> which brought him to the exigence of owning himself a Falsifier as to his charge against the Preacher;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107008:31"/>
or a Deserter and Condemner of his own Church. But why doth he now call [<hi>the enjoyning of a Prayer in a Language unknown to the People</hi>] <hi>a supposed Principle?</hi> Is it not enjoyned? There he is silent. But what if the Priests do not understand? So it has been; so <hi>Nic. Clemangis</hi> saith, <hi>We see Priests almost universally have much ado to read,</hi>

                  <hi>without understanding the Sense or the Words</hi>; so <hi>Billet,</hi> &amp;c. And what if the Priests do understand it? Is it therefore understood by the People? But why doth he instance in Missals translated for Vulgar use?

From thence our Author runs to the <hi>Mass,</hi> which he saith, <hi>being a Sacrifice ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Prayer, the Attention and Devotion of the People doth not so much consist in the Words, said by the Priest, as in what is done by him.</hi> But is there in the Mass nothing but the Oblation, nothing but Action? Are there no Prayers? That he dares not say, he only softens, <hi>it's not so much, it's rather.</hi> And what does this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to these parts of the Service, which are not of that kind? Where then is the Devotion and Attention, when there is no Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding? Where the Acceptance, when there is neither At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or Devotion? Let him consider what the Apologist said, <hi>p.</hi> 37, 39. and then he will find his Appeal to their Practice to be of no Service to him. When all is said, he has lost the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the Acceptance of Prayer not understood, and which the <hi>Apologist</hi> offer'd him Authorities for. But here he supposes he has him at Advantage; and tho he lets go <hi>Tolet</hi> and <hi>Salmeron,</hi> yet he charges him home with <hi>somewhat worse than Ignorance, for making the Representer an Abetter of such unreasonable Doctrine,</hi> [<hi>that to say Prayers well and devoutly, 'tis not necessary to have Attention not on the Words or Sense</hi>] <hi>when he has left out the following Words,</hi> [<hi>But rather purely on God.</hi>] It's an Omission, I confess, a fault fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with himself. I heartily wish our Author as clear of <hi>Abetting</hi> what he calls the <hi>unreasonable Doctrine,</hi> as the <hi>Apologist</hi> is of Contrivance; who may therefore justly return his own words in a charge somewhat worse, <hi>I can assure him, 'twas not design,</hi>

                  <hi>but mistake only.</hi> In justice to him, let us put it in, yet I don't see the case at all amended; <hi>Attention purely on God,</hi> being a distinct thing from Attention on the Prayers. And if he says his Prayers without attending to the <hi>Words or Sense,</hi> whether he <hi>thinks purely on God,</hi> or thinks on any thing else, yet he is no more at these his Prayers with his mind, than if he were not at Prayers. For what are Prayers in publick but the Words and Sense? And what makes them our Prayers, but Attention to the Words and Sense? So that Prayers without Attention, are much at one with Prayers without Understanding: And those are Prayers without Attention, where the Words and Sense of the Prayers are not attended to. Well, this saith our Author, <hi>is unreasonable Doctrine, That to say say Prayers well and devoutly, 'tis not necessary to have Attention on the Words and Sense.</hi> And I hope 'tis <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Doctrine</hi> then, that to say Prayers well and devoutly, 'tis not necessary to understand either Words and Sense. And yet this is approv'd Doctrine in their Church;<note place="margin">Sum. par. 3. tit. 13.</note> for saith <hi>Salmeron, Prayers are like the Words of a Charmer, they prevail even when they are not understood.</hi> I hope again, 'tis <hi>unreasonable Doctrine,</hi> that in Prayer,<note place="margin">Instruct. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. c. 13. n. 5, 6.</note> 'tis <hi>not necessary to attend to the Sense; nor so much as to consider he is present before God:</hi> And yet no less than Cardinal <hi>Tolet</hi> so determines. By this time, I hope both Preacher and Vindicator are set right in our Author's good Opinion as to this matter. Proceed we.</p>
               <p>Here I expected a round Charge against Assertion 20<hi>th,</hi> that <hi>they avowedly allow what God positively forbids.</hi> It's blunt and home, and what the <hi>Apologist</hi> makes good; but this is a dry Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so he substitutes a new one in the place.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Under this are reduced seven Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To cover his Idolatry he commits Sacrilege, steals away one of the Ten Commandments, and by their</hi> Index Expurgatorius, <hi>blots the two Tables themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a new Charge, brought to the Account, but I shall give it some Consideration. This Charge, he saith, <hi>is not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> 1. <hi>Because they have the Ten Commandments in their Bibles and Catechism.</hi> 2. <hi>If they are set short in some little Abstracts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine, it's in Compliance to the Weakness of some Memories and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107008:32"/>
Capacities, setting down only the Words of the Precept, without the Addition of Threats, Promises or Explications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first of these he would insinuate, as if the 2<hi>d</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is never expunged by them, which he dares not stand to. If it be expunged elsewhere, to what purpose doth he refer us to the Bible and Catechisms? For if it be in the Bible and Catechisms, but not in the Offices of the Church, it's still a true Charge against them. And I remember it was both shew'd, that it was not in several of their Offices, and it was put to him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrines and Practices,</hi> c. 25. p. 123.</note> to shew <hi>in what publick Offices of their Church it is to be found.</hi> But however, it <hi>is in their Bibles,</hi> but what is this to those that have not the use of the Bible permitted to them? However, <hi>it is in their Catechisms.</hi> Surely our Author is not <hi>sincere.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pap. Misrep.</hi> c. 25.</note> For he once confess'd it to be left out in their <hi>short Catechisms</hi>; or if he is improv'd since that time in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, I will produce Catechism after Catechism, where it is not; such as the <hi>Child's Catechism,</hi> 1678. And as for the Abstracts, even in those the two first Commandments are thrust into one, and often there is nothing at all of the second, but an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the place, as in <hi>the Abstract of the Scripture Catechism,</hi> An. 1675; which I suppose is that which he himself refers to, <hi>p.</hi> 57.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For his Absolution, 'tis not necessary he should be sorry for his Sin, but only for the Penance.</hi> Here I presumed our Author would have expatiated upon the point, and have clear'd their Church (if he could) from the Imputation charged upon them by the Preacher, and maintain'd by the Apologist, who shew'd from the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> their Catechism, and the Practice of their Church, that a Sorrow for the Penance alone (or Attrition) with Confession to the Priest, is sufficient without Contrition; but to all this, our Author gives no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If this should fail, 'tis but being at the Charge of an Indulgence, or Pope's Pardon; that is, to purchase so many penny-worth of other mens Merits: And this is what is requir'd instead of Regeneration, Sanctification, and a Godly Life.</hi> This, saith our Author, <hi>involves an absolute Falsity; whilst it supposes that a Papist, who is sorry nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Sins, nor the Punishment that attends them, has no more to do than to procure the Pope's Pardon; and that this is sufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Repentance. This is a most abominable Doctrine in it self, and most injuriously charg'd upon us.</hi> And yet as <hi>abominable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:107008:33"/>
as it is, it's found and prov'd upon them by the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist,</hi> from the Indulgences granted in their <hi>Crusado</hi>'s, and upon other Occasions. But saith our <hi>Sayer, The only ground for it, is the Practice of some prostigate Men,</hi> in the number of which he must then place several of his Popes. But to all the Evidence for this, our Author saith not a Word. Of this, let the Reader see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Char.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Auricular Confession, their great Intelligence, and</hi> Leiger Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, <hi>is the main Curb of the Laity, whereby the Clergy holds them in aw, in being admitted to all their Secrets of States and Families, thereby to work their Purposes and Plots: 'tis a matter of meer Interest; and were there no gain in it, they would be ashamed of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this, he saith, It's <hi>a most odious Character of an Institution allowed, even in the Church of</hi> England. What, is their Auricular Confession, as it's described from the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the Apology, <hi>an Institution of the Church of</hi> England? Doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> hold it necessary, <hi>jure Divino,</hi> to Confess to the Priest, all and singular mortal Sins, even the most Secret, whether Acts, Thoughts or Desires, with all their Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so far as may change the nature of the Sin; and without doing which, no Absolution is to be given? He may as well say, <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because they own the Eucharist, as their Auricular Confession is an Institution of our Church, because it allows and approves Confession in some cases. But, what saith our Author to the Charge? What to the use made of it in intruding into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of States and Families,</hi> and to work their Projects? What to the Allegations from their own Historians? Here the old Refuge is made use of, Silence. Of this, see before, <hi>Char.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of their Devotion, which they are bound to by Vow, and under the severest Penalties.</hi> This, saith our Author, <hi>is a great Calumny, and an empty Consequence of the Preacher.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks our Author should not be so brisk upon this Sermon, which he has made so extremely bold with, sometimes molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sense of it, (when it looks two broad upon them) at other times sharpning it, leaving out and altering, as it was here, when he made the Preacher say before, they are <hi>bound to vow Ignorance.</hi> This, he saith, <hi>the Apologizer pretends to make out.</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:107008:33"/>
But if it be but <hi>Pretence,</hi> why has not the <hi>Sayer</hi> expos'd him, and run down the Instances of St. <hi>Benedict, Francis, Ignatius Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ala?</hi> I acknowledg the Learning of many of their Fryers and Monks, but they are not beholding to their Vows and Rules for their Learning: For the more they keep to them, the less Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they will be; or else I know not why the Jesuits are not as strictly tied up to their Hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Benedictines.</hi> But what is become of Assertion 25. <hi>Their avowed Principles are to keep the People in Ignorance?</hi> Where are we to expect the Answer to what the <hi>Apologist</hi> there produced in Confirmation of it? That's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to a more convenient time. See before, <hi>Char.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Here again, we want an Answer to what was said on Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 26. <hi>They teach their People better Manners, than to rely upon the all-sufficient Merits of Christ.</hi> All which the <hi>Apologist</hi> did undetake to prove upon them.</p>
               <p>But instead of that, our Author throws in a new Instance to make up the Defect, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>They must wholly submit their Reason to an Infallible Judg, even so far (if one of their greatest Authors say true) as to be bound to believe Virtue to be Bad, and Vice to be Good, if it shall please his Holiness to say so.</hi> This, saith he, is <hi>a gross Abuse of</hi> Bellarmin. But first of all, what saith he to the general Proposition, That <hi>they must wholly submit their Reason to the Infallible Judg?</hi> Is that an <hi>Abuse</hi> of their Church? And setting aside <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for the present; Is there none of his gross Doctrine to be found elsewhere? What thinks he, if the Pope should <hi>declare the right Hand is the left,</hi> are they bound to believe it? This was once call'd a Misrepresentation in the Preacher, but their own <hi>Lyra</hi> was beforehand with him (tho our Author had the good manners to leave out the Quotation). What thinks he of the Rule of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> That <hi>if the Catholick Church define that to be black, which appears to be white, they are bound to account it to be black?</hi> Whats think he of <hi>meriting</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving an Heretical Proposition taught by his Bishop? These are Cases resolved by them in the Affirmative, as the <hi>Apologist</hi> shew'd in the place quoted by our Author; but tho nothing could be objected against those, and the like Evidences, yet it seems this is a most <hi>gross Abuse of</hi> Bellarmin, <hi>an inexcusable Aspersion,</hi> a <hi>Forgery</hi> of the Preacher. But, why all this? Because, saith he, these words are not his <hi>Assertion,</hi> but an <hi>Inconvenience</hi> he argues from, in proof of what he had before asserted, <hi>that the Pope is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107008:34"/>
Infallible.</hi> But if it be an <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> it's what he is contented should be taken for an Assertion. It's plainly a case he puts, The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proposition in proof indeed was, that the <hi>Pope could not err in things of themselves good and evil, as it's a matter of Faith (the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith teaching Virtue to be good, and Vice to be evil.)</hi> The next Proposition in confirmation of it is, that the Church is bound to believe according to the Pope's Resolution of the case, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless she would sin against conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is, supposing that the Pope should command Vice and forbid Virtue; then saith he, the Church <hi>is bound to acquiesce in his judgment in all doubtful matters, to do what he commands, and not do what he forbids; and lest perhaps she act against conscience, she is bound to believe that to be good which he commands, and that evil which he forbids.</hi> That the Pope cannot err, is the Principle he holds to; but yet to secure the duty of the people, he breaks off the Argument; and lets it all issue in the point of the Churches obedience and submission, lest they should at last find his Holiness has thus err'd. Well, saith he, however if it should be so,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>ac ut rem.</hi>
                  </note> yet, as he said before in another case, <hi>it belongs not to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to doubt of these things, but simply to obey.</hi> And how timorous soever our Author is to own it, how solicitous to bury it under the rubbish of <hi>Abuses, Aspersions,</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi>; yet others are not so bashful. Even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself elsewhere doth admit it, with some little qualification,<note place="margin">C. 13. in <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laium.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>In a good sense,</hi> saith he, <hi>Christ gave to</hi> Peter <hi>the power of making sin not to be a sin, and of what was not sin, to be sin. Bellarmin</hi> indeed saw further than our Author: he know well, that these Metamorphoses had been practised by the Papal Authority, and if they were bound to believe that to be good which he commands, and approve that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, when what was in it self unlawful was made lawful by his determination, there was no disputing. Of this we have a notable instance in Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antonini Summa.</hi>
                  </note> who after mature consultation, did dispense with one that had taken his Sister to Wife, because of the Scandals that otherwise must have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd upon their Separation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Their Church-men must live a single life, whether honestly or no, it makes no matter.</hi> Our Author after his wonted manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares this to <hi>be utterly false; it being no indifferent thing in our Church whether the Clergy live honestly or no.</hi> In this Assertion the <hi>Apologist</hi> observed there were two Points contained: 1. That
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107008:34"/>
the Clergy in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must and are obliged by the Order of their Church, and their own Vow, to lead a single life. 2. That there is more care taken that they live single, than that they live honestly. But this saith our Author is to <hi>fall much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Preacher</hi>; but why so, what mighty difference is there betwixt saying, as the Preacher, that whether they can do it <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, it makes no matter</hi>; or <hi>more care is taken that they live single, than that they live honestly?</hi> For certainly not much matter is made of that, which they take no reasonable care in. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will not allow the proof of it offer'd in the Apology; <hi>Which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is this chiefly, because the punishment for a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that marries, is much greater than for one that keeps his Concubine.</hi> The matter of fact he allows, and indeed it was undeniably prov'd against them. But this, he saith, is not <hi>to the purpose,</hi> it being <hi>as if I should say, that according to the Principles of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>it matters not, whether her Members turn</hi> Turks, <hi>or no: And then should bring this for proof, because she has severe penalties, even of death it self for such as become Papists, but none at all for those that turn</hi> Turks. But this is far from the case; for Laws are made according to the state and exigence of Affairs, and the Cases that fall out, or probably may fall out, and the damage done thereby to the Community: But where there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or damage in prospect, it's a ridiculous thing to make a Law. The danger here was from the Papists, and their practices against the Government, which was the reason of those Laws: but there is no danger of the Members of its Church turning <hi>Turks,</hi> which is the reason why there is no Law against it. And his Argument would be much as if it should be said, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church it matters not whether her Members turn Heathens; and then should bring this for proof of it, because she has severe Penalties, even death it self for those that turn <hi>Turks</hi> (for they that so turn are not received into the Church without as openly renouncing, as they profest <hi>Mahometism,</hi> which is death) but none at all for those that turn Heathens. If he had put the case right, it should have been thus, That by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> it is death to turn Papist, and a Fine of 10<hi>s.</hi> to turn <hi>Turk,</hi> in the same circumstances of danger; then it had look'd speciously enough that they took more care that they should not turn Papists, than <hi>Turks.</hi> And so we have brought the case home. For if when
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107008:35"/>
a Clergy-man is found married, he must be separated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd; but if he keeps a Concubine, he is Fin'd but 10 <hi>s</hi>; it's evident, which is the worst crime in the opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Our Author saith, This was the <hi>chief</hi> Argument of the <hi>Apologist</hi>; and if so, methinks when he had dismist this by a comparison, he might at once have blown off what remains. But though he has not thought fit to set the rest before the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet I shall offer them to his Consideration. In further confirmation of this Charge, the <hi>Apologist</hi> appeal'd to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances, as Priests Marriage is absolutely forbid without any Relaxation or Dispensation, but Concubinage has been openly allow'd and licensed; it's further confirmed by their Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Case, when they account Concubinage and Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a less sin in a Priest than Marriage. These, it seems, were inconsiderable; so neither the Argument, nor the Authorities vouch'd for them, deserved an Answer. And for company our Author has dismist also <hi>Assertion</hi> 28. viz. <hi>The reason why the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are bound to live single, is for fear lest having Wives and Children they should give the State security of their Obedience to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <p>I have now done with our Author's 14 Characters, which consist partly of matter of Fact and Observation, partly of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their own, and partly of Inferences from, and Arguings upon them. In the two former of which (which are the proper Subject of Representation) I have shew'd there has been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing charged upon them by the Preachers as to Principle, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or Fact, which they had not good Evidence for; and was so far from being a Fiction of their own, that they condemn them out of their own mouths. As for the latter, it belongs not to the Case before us; but yet that nothing might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give our Author satisfaction, the Arguments produced by the Preachers against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have been considered, and justified. So that in Conclusion I may here challenge him to shew that there is any Principle or Doctrine, which is not a Principle of theirs; or a Practice, which is not a Practice; or a Consequence which is not truly inferr'd from them. I do not think that a <hi>Misrepresentation</hi> can be justly chargeable upon a mere Mistake, no more than it is upon the inconsequence of an Argument: But it's a Wonder to me, that amongst the <hi>Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

Pulpits,</hi> (as he reckons them) and the multitude of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and under all the Provocations they have met with, and in the heat of Argument, there can be nothing material produced against them, notwithstanding the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most diligence could be used, and the reading of Volumes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on purpose to make a Discovery.</p>
               <p>Were they indeed guilty of <hi>Misrepresentation,</hi> and that there was No <hi>praying to Images in the Church of</hi> Rome; No <hi>compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Heaven for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nforsaken Sins</hi>; No <hi>worshipping Bread and Wine, as God himself</hi>; No <hi>saying Prayers without Attention</hi>; No <hi>Divisions among themselves</hi>; No <hi>renouncing their Senses,</hi> &amp;c. Yet we know where these would be match'd, when our Adversaries tell us, <hi>The Protestants have no God, no Faith, no Religion; but are meer Atheists, and worship the Devil,</hi> as <hi>Possevine</hi> and <hi>Prateolus</hi> teach.<note place="margin">See <hi>the View,</hi> p. 106, &amp;c.</note> That <hi>to run down Popery, tho he know nothing of it,</hi>

Monk's Letter to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> for it, may, for ought I know, think as he writes, and so his Representations of the Sectaries, and of the Profession of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Faith be equally true, and what he equally understands.</p>
               <p>But our Author is not alike excusable: For whatever he may know concerning the Days of <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, I know not; but what he writes about, belongs more to his own, and so if he falls in with Misrepresentation, his <hi>Conscience</hi> must be the more concerned: And which after all he is so far from making good, that he is forced to use all the Shifts that one conscious to himself of infirmity, and subtle enough to conceal it, can contrive; which for a Conclusion to the whole, I shall now a little enquire into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first Artifice he uses, is Disclaiming and Renouncing, after this manner,<note place="margin">Epistle to the Reader.</note> 
                  <hi>If to be a Papist, is to be that which is describ'd in these Characters; I declare, I am none, and that I am so far from undertaking Apologies for men of such Practices and Belief, that I here profess a hearty Detestation of all such Engagements.— If this was so, I concluded I had certainly fall'n into the very mouth of Hell-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sayings, p. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>I as much abhor, as Hell and Damnation it self. If this be to be a Papist; then certainly, to be a Papist, is to be the worst of Men. — And 'tis so far from being a doubt, whether he be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that 'tis certain he can be none; and that if he be bound to believe and live according to the Principles here laid down, he can have no right to Salvation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 56.</note>— <hi>Whatever Church would receive him with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all those scandalous Doctrines the Pulpits charge against us, I would be sure to be no Member of it; and if there were no other, but that Church amongst Christians, I would then begin to look towards</hi> Turky.<note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> Nay, he advances further, <hi>Whoever will be a good Papist, must instead of assenting to, disclaim every point that is here set down by the Pulpits, as Articles of his Religion.</hi> Let us now try our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in some one of these <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Abominable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> who comes thus arm'd <hi>Cap-a-pie,</hi> with <hi>Detestations, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrencies, Disclaimings,</hi> and see whether he be invulnerable.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107008:36"/>
would he behave himself in the Company of Cardinal <hi>Capisucci,</hi> who maintains that the Worship is to the Image? How in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who defended the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate's, <hi>to the Word, the Wood,</hi> against <hi>Imbert's, to Christ, and not to the Wood?</hi> Could he bear up to them, and tell them it's <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,</hi> that they are no <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>have no right to Salvation?</hi> Which doth he think would there be the Misrepresenter, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that Dooms this to the Pit of Hell, or those that defend it? Of this Artifice, see <hi>the View,</hi> p. 51.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Artifice is to confound the Consequences drawn by the Protestants from their Principles, with their Principles, and to make the Consequence to be their Principle. This he was formerly tax'd with in <hi>Doct. and Pract. and View,</hi> p. 63. And yet he proceeds still in the same order. So because they are accus'd of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, therefore he makes that to be part of the Character of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, and then disavows it. Thus he saith,<note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, p. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Were Popery so foul as 'tis in the Opinion of the Vulgar; did it teach Men Idolatry, to worship any Creature for God, to neglect the Commandments, I would chuse rather to be a</hi> Jew, Turk, <hi>or</hi> Infidel, <hi>than a</hi> Papist. All which signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unless the Papist should believe himself to be an Idolater.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We must beware again, that we follow him not too close, or think after all these Disclaimings and Abhorrings, that he is plainly to be understood; for there are certain Reserves and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions carefully couch'd in, that he may retire to upon occasion. Such as these, <hi>A Papist is bound to disclaim every point here set down,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, p. 1, 2, 3. P. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>as Articles of his Religion, and as they are obliged to the Profession of them, so to believe and live—according to the Form asserted in the Characters, as here set down.</hi> So that tho they are never so plainly prov'd upon them; yet if they are not <hi>Articles of his Religion,</hi> nor what they <hi>are obliged to believe and do,</hi> or agree not precisely <hi>with the Form,</hi> and <hi>as set down</hi> in the Characters, he may safely abhor, detest and damn them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If he be press'd home, and the Authorities come thick, or the Practice and use be urg'd a little too close; he has yet a relief. <hi>I found,</hi> saith he, <hi>a great number of Matters of Fact, as Massacres,</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107008:37"/>
of Cardinals, Bishops, Priests; their Ignorance, Simony, Oppression, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, Excesses,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then the loose and extravagant Opinions of many of her Doctors. Lastly, many Superstitions and Abuses found amongst the People, their being impos'd upon by some with idle Inventions, the noise of Relicks and Miracles, and being Priest-ridden a thousand other ways.</hi> This is in truth a Charge, as he saith, <hi>laid home.</hi> It's worth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, how he brings himself off; why, <hi>Here,</hi> saith he, <hi>I began to lay aside all Trouble and Scruples concerning my Religion, being now well satisfied</hi>; How, that all this was false? Not so quick, but <hi>that the frightful Character, which surprized me before,</hi> (the matter of which it seems is true) <hi>was not taken from her Faith and Doctrine, but only from the Vice and Wickedness of such, who tho perchance in her Communion, yet follow'd her Direction: And that 'twas rather a black Record of as many villanous Practices, as ever had been committed by any of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, sham'd upon the People.</hi> What, as false? That he dares not say; but <hi>for a draught of such things the Church taught, encourag'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.</hi> What work is here for a Protestant Representer? A Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll of Abominations! But saith our Author by way of Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Alleviation, It's a Character taken from the Vice and Wickedness of such, who were <hi>perchance in her Communion.</hi> How! Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, but <hi>perchance in her Communion.</hi> Has our Author at last got possession of the Keys of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can he bring even Popes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before his Bar? That may sound a little too harsh; therefore the result is, that <hi>it's sham'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, for such things the Church taught, encourag'd, and approv'd.</hi> So that, let the Doctrine prevail never so much, the Teachers be never so many, the Practice never so bad, yet here is a Shield, <hi>The Church has not taught,</hi> &amp;c. I remember it was once put to him, and I find it not answer'd,<note place="margin">Doctrin. and Pract. p 13.</note> 
                  <hi>We are often blam'd for charging parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrines upon their Church, but we desire to know what it is makes a Doctrine of their Church.</hi> He tells us, we are not to charge upon them <hi>every Opinion of Authors,</hi>

                  <hi>for the profess'd Religion of Papists,</hi>—Not <hi>the loose and extravagant Opinions of many of her Doctors</hi>; Not <hi>the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions of School-Divines,</hi> nor <hi>the Niceties a Parson designedly enters amongst</hi>; but if we come to set Authority against Authority, I know not why an <hi>Aquinas,</hi> a <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> a <hi>Suarez,</hi> &amp;c. may not vye with our Author, and as soon be heard. And why a Profession of his own,<note place="margin">P. 57.</note> That I <hi>have declar'd nothing as an Article of Faith, but what has been thus positively determined by the Church Representative, or is so acknowledged by the whole Body Diffusive,</hi> (which it seems he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107008:37"/>
has consulted) should bear down the Authority of <hi>many of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and School-Divines,</hi> when they both have come forth with the Approbation of their Church, and never were condemn'd by it, for teaching against it. And now the Controversy is depending betwixt them, and we are to attend which gives the most faithful account of the Doctrine and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; the Schoolmen of old time, or the Representers of this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When all other helps fail, he has one yet in reserve, <hi>for the ending of this Controversy,</hi> which is a <hi>Challenge</hi> he throws out to the Author of the <hi>Answer to the Representers Reflection upon the State and View,</hi> and <hi>not to him, but to all the Ministers; nay, to all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of this Nation:</hi> [<hi>Shew us the Papists to agree with those Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, that have been given them out of the Pulpits.</hi>] This is the Sum of no less than ten Pages he has wrote in Reply to this. But now, besides the uncharitableness of this Course, which is to enquire into the Lives of those of his Communion, and to make Descants upon them; and which when he appeals to, he gives a Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be very overly in: Besides this, it's of no use here; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's an Argument that is contingent, and (1.) which any sort of People may venture at. Thus the <hi>Turks</hi> may Challenge the Christians, whether they be the People the Christians represent them. Let them come and see (may they say) whether we are not as Temperate, as Just, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> among whom we live; and if Religion were to be judg'd of, as to its truth and goodness by such a comparison, whether we might not as well pretend to it as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>And if they find us in all things like the rest of Mankind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>without more horns and heads, then who are the Misrepresenter?</hi> And yet, thus our Author argues. This the Protestants may turn upon the Papists after this manner, <hi>Shew</hi> us the Protestants that <hi>agree with the</hi> Papists <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of them. There are few</hi> Papists, <hi>but have some Relations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Correspondents, Acquaintance, or Conversation with some</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. <hi>What I require of them then, is to compare these</hi> Protestants <hi>they know, with the Ideas, Notions, and Characters of a</hi> Papist-Protestant, <hi>that is, with the Notions</hi> that have been taught them by their Priests, Pulpits, and Books. <hi>Let 'em tell me upon due Consideration, whether</hi> they are <hi>meer Atheists, and worship the Devil, and act in defiance of their own Conscience; and Profess the Broad way leading to Destruction, and grant Libertinism to the highest degree of Wickedness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(2.) It's Contingent, as the same Persons and People may be good and bad, better and worse in divers States and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107008:38"/>
If this be a good Argument, it will always be so in all Ages and Cases; and go where you will, and take them where you will, you will always find the Papist to answer our Authors Character, and never to come up to the Pulpit-Character of him. But I dare say, our Author will not allow this to be a fair Method of proceeding; and that for Example, a Protestant should describe a Papist according to <hi>the great number of Matters of Fact,</hi> which with our Author he may find by Writers of their own,<note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> charg'd upon them, <hi>such as Massacres, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpations, Murders of Princes, Treasons, Plots, Conspiracies, Persecutions; the vicious and scandalous Lives of some of her chief Prelates,</hi> [Popes] <hi>their Pride, Covetousness and Luxury; as likewise, the ill Examples of other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Dignitaries, as of Cardinals, Bishops, Priests; their Ignorance, Simony, Oppression, Cruelties, Excesses,</hi> &amp;c. And I may add, the dissoluteness of manners prevailing throughout the Papal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in some Ages. Was ever this the State of the Papacy? If it was, as our Author cannot deny, then why may not we take the Character of a Papist from such an age, as well as the Age or Place where we live? Or, why not from another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as from our own? This indeed our Author some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times refers to. For, saith he,<note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, p. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>This</hi> [That <hi>'tis only mistake and passion makes Popery so deform'd a Monster</hi>] <hi>every one will conclude to be true, who has taken a prospect of</hi> Holland, <hi>and those Towns of</hi> Germany, <hi>in which Papists and Protestants live together in one Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, under the same Laws, and making use in some places, even of the same Churches too; and this with such Freedom, Amity and good Correspondence, that their different Communion cannot be easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and a man that should come out of</hi> England, <hi>with his Head glowing with our Pulpit-Popery, would not be easily convinc'd of the being of any Papists there. Now 'tis certain, the Papists here and there are of the same Church, Principles and Faith, and 'tis no Difference in this kind, makes them there like other Men, and here like Monsters; but 'tis because there the Papists are what they are, and here they are made to be what they are not, but what their Maligners please to render them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might here shew how far our Author is out in matter of Fact, that tho these live together, yet it is with great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. However, supposing what he saith to be true, yet that is no fit way to judge of their Religion by; since whatever <hi>Freedom, Amity,</hi> and <hi>good Correspondence</hi> they have or exercise, is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107008:38"/>
not from their <hi>Church, Principles and Faith,</hi> but from other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which are Political, such as Interest and Self-preservation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if it was from their <hi>Church, Principles</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> Popery would be all over the World the same Popery as it is in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the places of <hi>Germany</hi> he speaks of. But there is a vast difference betwixt Popery and Popery; betwixt Popery when it is alone, and Popery when it is diluted with Protestantism. And if we would know what it is, the fairer way to judg of it, is where it is alone; not as in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> but as in <hi>Italy, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and I may add now in <hi>France.</hi> For there is the <hi>Church, Principles,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> in <hi>puris naturalibus</hi>; and if we are to be referred to judg of what it is, by the Lives and Practices of its Professors, thither in reason we are to go; pass we over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, or indeed the narrow Seas, and there we may take a better View and Prospect, than in a few <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi> here; who yet I doubt will generally be found without being <hi>rigorously observ'd,</hi> not to <hi>have chang'd their Lives</hi> for the better,<note place="margin">Sayings, p. 7.</note> no more than their Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After all, this is not to the purpose. For the Question is, what is Popery, and whether the Pulpits have truly represented it or not? And Popery certainly was not there describ'd from the Lives of the present Professors of it in this Nation; but from its Principles, and the Practices of their Church in Conformity to those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Our Author surely will acknowledg that Popery is always the same, that it is what it hath been, and it hath been what it is; and if so, his way must conclude against it self; unless he will say in all Ages, and all Countreys, Men of that Religion have lived alike; and therefore, to know whether the Pulpits have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Popery aright or no, we must go not to the Lives of any Age or Place alone, nor to the Refinements and Expositions of a new Generation, but to the Authorities the Preachers went upon. But this is a troublesome task, and what suited not our Author's temper or design; and so he quitted the one for the other. It's a pleasant Entertainment to write a Character, or a Representation; the Pen runs smoothly along, when it has Comparison before it, and all the business is to describe, invite, or inveigh; but when there are Breaks and Interruptions; when it is to argue closely, to manage an Argument, or to Answer it, it requires another sort of Talent; and what our Author warily avoids. And if he is beat out of his Road, and the Artifice has been detected, yet it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107008:39"/>
shall go hard, if he finds not out some Retrenchments to secure himself.</p>
               <p>Thus has he proceeded from Representation to Reflection, from Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Protestation, from Protestation to Accommodation, from Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation to Reflection again, from Reflection to Caution, from Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Character; and at last, for the <hi>ending of this Controversy,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; that is, from the Principles and Practices of the Papists, he appeals to their Lives amongst us. This is his last Refuge, and if that fails him, it is but to find a new Title or Method, and then he appears without Wound or Scar. And he may in the Conclusion of his Book, tell the World what Feats he has done,<note place="margin">Sayings, p. 57.</note> what <hi>Religious Frauds</hi> he detected, and how <hi>unsuccessful</hi> he render'd them in his <hi>first Book.</hi> So that if his Reader be as credulous as he himself is confident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd secure in his own good Opinion, this may be a Windingsheet to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Answer to the Representers Reflect. on the View,</hi> p. 67.</note> he will see from Point to Point, how he has left the Cause to shift for it self. And whereas, now it had become him to have discharg'd himself from so gross an Imputation, we must be contented to have one answer to that, and all the rest, that they are <hi>too impertinent to deserve any.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sayings, p. 12.</note> Such we are to account the Charge of his Representing by halves;<note place="margin">

                  </note> of continuing his Misrepresentations without Replying to the Answers; of his not answering the <hi>View</hi>; of his common, but vain Allegation, that we pretend to know Popery better than they themselves; of his abusing Mr. <hi>Montague</hi>; of his Insincerity, particularly, when he offers to receive us into the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon his Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Terms; and when he professes to detest some Doctrines and Practices charged upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. But here he will say, I make too much haste, for the two last Points he has reply'd to in the Close. But truly it's after such a manner, and so faintly, as if he hop'd 'twould be overlook'd.</p>
               <p>As for Example.<note place="margin">Sayings, p. 55.</note> As to the first he Replies, <hi>This offer may be said to have been answer'd over and over. But the matter of Fact defeats all those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, and is a Demonstration that they are nothing but shuffling.</hi> Now what is <hi>this matter of Fact,</hi> and where is this <hi>Demonstration?</hi> That follows <hi>For whilst a man may be received upon those Terms, and yet cannot be received unless he assents to the Faith of the Church, 'tis evident, that in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the faith of the Church is truly Represented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any one that reads this, would be apt to think that the <hi>matter of Fact</hi> had never been questioned, or had been prov'd to a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond possibility of Reply. But besides what has been before answer'd to it <hi>over and over,</hi> as he confesses, it was particularly considered by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer to his Reflections,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Reflec p. 32.</note> and the offer, 1. shew'd to be a <hi rend="margQuotes">ludicrous one, made without good Faith, and with no other meaning than to put some colour upon his deceitful Characters of a Papist.</hi>

               <p>2. It was replied further, <hi rend="margQuotes">that suppose we could accept, and should be accepted upon the Terms he propounds, yet we have no security that when we are in, this Representer either can, or will, if he could, save us from being prest to profess and practice that Popery which he either denies or conceals. And that because on the one hand we are certain that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing part of his Church holds that, which he either rejects from his Faith, or says nothing of, and that agreeably to their Councils and publick Offices. And on the other hand, we have no reason to believe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

               <p>The Answerer shews further, that <hi rend="margQuotes">we have not any good reason to trust him, he having not given us any reasonable assurance that himself rejects that Popery,</hi> which he exclaims against.</p>
               <p>And last of all he puts this question, <hi>Whether he would refuse us, if we desired to come into the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, with that which we call old Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which our Author replies after this manner:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Our new Adversary has one cavil here to put in,</hi> viz. [<hi>That the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Papist represented, is not a good Character, because the Faith of a Papist as stated under each Article, is not All his Faith.</hi>] Our Author has been so unkind as not to refer us to the Page for these words he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to quote from the <hi>Answ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>; and I think after a careful perusal, I may safely lodg them at his own door, as an instance of his Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faculty. Any one that knew the Answerer, and is conversant in his way of writing, knows well he had too clear a head to express himself in so insipid and nonsensical a way as our Author would fasten upon him, and so as to argue against the truth of the Character, <hi>because the Faith of a Papist, as stated under each Article, is not all his Faith.</hi> But however the Argument is not so obscure, as his Answer to it is impertinent, as might be shewn, were it to the purpose before us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He proceeds, <hi>This man has still another scruple,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sayings, p. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>That (if he should come into our Church upon the terms I have proposed, whether I will be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that he shall not be prest to profess and practise that Popery, which I have either deny'd or conceal'd)</hi> To this our Author answers after a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing manner: <hi>Marry</hi> (saith he) <hi>if he means by that Popery, the Pulpit-Popery, I'le give him the same security I have my self,</hi> viz. <hi>the Assistance of the Holy Ghost promised to his Church, which will never permit it to lead her members into such Abominations. He may have the security too of a good conscience, which cannot be prest to the profession of so much evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is his security worth; or how can he plead the Holy Ghost's Assistance for not being led by her into such Abominations, when she pleads it for their belief and practice? Our Author would be understood, that he calls not an Image or Crucifix out of its name when he saith it's an Image of wood or stone; and that he speaks consonantly to the sense of his Church, when he saith the Image is not adored or pray'd to, but Christ or the Saint in the Image. And yet the <hi>French</hi> Physician was clap'd up in the Inquisition for the former; and the <hi>Condomian Imbert</hi> was imprison'd for the latter. And surely the Inquisitors of <hi>Goa,</hi> and Archbishop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> are themselves of that Church which he saith has <hi>the promise of the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> And who shall decide this case, or what security have we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>n come in, the Church will oblige you to, profess abominable things; however Conscience is free, and the Inquisition it self cannot force it; and if you be sincere, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>prest</hi> by that or any external violence, to the profession of so much evil. It's well our Author is not at <hi>Goa</hi> to have his sincerity try'd.</p>
               <p>But yet he hath not done. For he adds,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In this</hi> (the Answer above given) <hi>he may see his other Material Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion answer'd, [Whether he may be admitted into our Communion, with that which he calls old Popery?] For if his old Popery be the Pulpit-Popery, he sees we reject it; and I tell him, that whatsoever Church would receive him, with the profession of all those scandalous Doctrines the Pulpits charge against us, I would be sure to be no member of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here our Author slinks away from the Case. For as soon as ever the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer had put the Question,<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> he proceeds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Will the Representer take us by the hand and present us to his Church, if we should come with the</hi> Lateran <hi>Popery about deposing Soveraigns for Heresie, and with the</hi> Trent-<hi>Popery about the Worship of Images, as it is understood by</hi> Bellarmin, <hi>or rather by</hi> Capisucchi, <hi>and as it is practised by the</hi> Tartuffs <hi>of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and with all that old Popery, which the former Answerer gives an account of?</hi> Why has not our Author laid the case as it was put to him? Why not the old Popery of <hi>Lateran, Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Capisucchi,</hi> as well as Pulpit-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery? And when he has thrown the Cover of Pulpit-Popery over it; yet why must he needs add, with <hi>All</hi> the scandalous Doctrines the Pulpits charge? For surely if there be such abomination in them, any one of them should be sufficient to an honest soul to fly the Communion, where the belief or practice of it is requir'd. Well, let Schoolmen and Cardinals, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus, Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Capisucchi,</hi> let old Missals and Rituals, nay let Councils, the old one of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and the new one of <hi>Trent,</hi> be call'd in, they are but <hi>Tartuffs</hi>; for Exposition and Representation are now the Standard of <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrine. And if the <hi>Tartuffism</hi> of Deposition of Princes, and Adoration of Images, and the rest of the once old and new Pulpit-Popery be part of its Faith and Doctrine, we have our Authors word for it, <hi>I would be a Turk as soon as their Papist.</hi> A very gross affront sure to those Venerable Heads;<note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> and if he hath not some reserve, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Art of Cardinal <hi>Capisucchi,</hi> may throw him into bad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and he would do well to keep from <hi>Goa</hi> or <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> left a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation or somewhat worse be the effect of such a frank declaration.</p>
               <p>But it seems after all the Protestations, and Abominations, the Answerer was not satisfied in our Author's sincerity, and would bind him to hard Terms, which is to tell us in particular what those Monstrons things are that he so frequently declares against; which because our Author answers only in general to, I shall remind him of, and conclude. Its this, <hi>Here I challenge you to declare what those particulars are,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Reflect. p. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Those Monsters, Those Doctrines and practices which you do detest and abominate; And if you refuse so to fasten upon you the mark of insincere and juggling, for offering that all be received into the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>without them.</hi>
