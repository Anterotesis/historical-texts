            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Know it will appear strange &amp; preposterous, to many, to see a Poem of this nature, in these distracted and confused times (when scarce the iron hand of Warre is ceast: but like a fearefull and prodigious Commet stil hangs over us, threatning ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to this royall Kingdome) set forth to the view and Censure of the World. For, noble Gentlemen, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously confesse, it had beene much more sutable to the Times, had it had its birth in our Halcyon dayes, when blest peace and prosperity reigned in our happy <hi>Albion</hi>: but since 'tis so unhappy to breathe life in this unnaturall age, let it begge your favourable and candid censures: not of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive,
<pb facs="tcp:101815:3"/>
but a Posthumus. And now to vindicate my self from foule detraction, which the envious and carying Zoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusses &amp; Momusses of all ages (by their virulent tongues &amp; pens, to prejudice and traduce the workes of others) have too frequently, but most falsely cast upon Writers: I shall endeavour to give you some satisfactory reasons of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this my Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>As first, because I never heard or read of any booke of this subject, set forth in the English tongue, although in all other languages they are most frequent.</p>
            <p>The next is for the benefit, pleasure, or delight of the Reader, especially now in these sad and disconsolate times, it being a great refreshment, and recreation to the minde of man, (by way of divertion) to take him off from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these danger-threatning times, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his thoughts, sometimes with sweete variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to that saying: <hi>Interpone tuis, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum gaudea curis, ut posses animo, quemvis sufferre laborem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, although this Poem is but a collection of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sentences, phrasers, &amp;c. as appeareth in the Title, (not methodically composed or digested) it being unpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a subject of this nature, so to doe) but promiscously intermixt with variety and delight) which many yeares since in times of my better prosperity. I gathered out of some hundreds of Authors, never having the least thought of putting it to Presse. Yet now, by the importunity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the commands of some noble friends, to whose endeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their noble favours, I owe my gratitude: I have adventured, or rather presumed, (under your noble patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and protection) to put it into print: And noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, let mee indulge your favours, not to reade it with
