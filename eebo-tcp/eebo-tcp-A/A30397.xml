            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is very seasonable to put us in
mind of the most proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
that we can make for
them. When we have the
Pledges of the pardon of Sin and of a happy
Immortality given us, it becomes us also to
<hi>bring our Gift, and to leave it on the Altar.</hi> What
can we render unto God? <hi>Our Goodness extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to him:</hi> but it may reach him in his
Members, for he reckons that what <hi>we do to

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65286:4"/>
As this season of the year is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for calling on those whom God has bless'd
with a full measure of the good things of this
life, to <hi>give a portion to seven,</hi> and also to <hi>eight;</hi>
that is, to give not only according to regular
proportions, but even beyond them, to <hi>lend a
little to the Lord,</hi> for all the good things that
he has given to them, and after such a harvest
of spiritual things, as they have been reaping,
to call on such as want that with which they
overflow, to let them reap of their worldly
things: So this <hi>time</hi> or <hi>season,</hi> in a larger sense,
seems to <hi>provoke us to love and to good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have pass'd through great and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Dangers; as well those of a long and
slothful Peace, with all the surfeits of luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Plenty, as the more critical Turns of a
devouring War, with all the Charge and Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that have accompanied it: while great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of wicked Men engaged in a most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Conspiracy at home, were at work in the
corrupting our Coin, to undermine us, or to
blow us up. We have got through all this,
though perhaps the scars that remain, and the
ill effects that follow it, will not be so easily
worn off. We are now like a man recovering
out of a long sickness, that had a great variety
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65286:4"/>
of symptoms with it; these will hang about
him, even after the happy Crisis is past; and
the seeds of life, being much weakned, they,
in that tenderness, will soon take a new ill ply,
and contract diseases, as dangerous as those
were, out of which he thinks he is delivered.</p>
            <p>It may seem a very improper time to call
on a City to a new Harvest of Charity, that
is yet struggling with great Difficulties. The
Losses that many have suffered, the Taxes that
all are charged with, and the stop in the Gains
of most, are such discouragements, that unless
the strength of the Argument for Charity were
to be trusted to, one could scarce hope to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in it, where the Objections are so many
and so sensible. But if the <hi>Sinner</hi> will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that he may <hi>redeem his iniquities by giving
alms to the poor;</hi> if even the <hi>Covetous</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how certain a Fund he deals in, when he
trusts his Wealth to God; Both will conclude,
that the surest way to secure to us those Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
that we still enjoy, as well as to procure
new additions to them, is to make the best use
of what we do possess, and so form the most
generous Resolutions upon what further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
God may bless us with.</p>

we ought to <hi>do good,</hi> and that in the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

with this specialty, that the fullest measure of
it, and the tenderest care in it, ought to go to
the <hi>Houshold of Faith:</hi> that is, to the Christians,
who in those days were but a small and select
number. Now indeed all pass for such; but
if we may judge of those of the <hi>Houshold of
Faith,</hi> either by him who is the <hi>Author</hi> of it,
or by that Rule which he has made the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, we shall soon find, that among those
who carry the name of Christians, and pass
for the <hi>Domesticks</hi> of this <hi>Houshold,</hi> there are
few, very few, who deserve the Name, or that
answer the Obligations that belong to it.</p>

               </item>
               <item>4. This we ought to pursue, <hi>as oft as we

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65286:5"/>
It is needless to dwell long on the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of Beneficence in general. Nothing makes
a Man so truly great, for nothing makes him
so like God as to do much good. Nothing
is more useful and amiable to all the rest of
Mankind, than a chearful and diffusive boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Nothing gives a Man a more solid Joy,
a truer Title to what he has, and a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of what he enjoys, than a large and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Heart, with an open and liberal Hand.
This is the best use Wealth can be put to, and
is the noblest part of the Distinction between
the Rich and the Poor; that the one must
submit to the Humility of <hi>receiving,</hi> while the
other has the Blessing as well as the Glory of
<hi>giving.</hi> In a word, he that does not feel
the Manly Pleasure that arises from doing
good, or that needs to be pressed to it, has
a Soul of a very degenerate Make, and is not
like to be moved much by Argument. Vanity
or Interest may draw somewhat from him,
but if he has not this Principle of Charity
within him, though he should <hi>give all his Goods
to the Poor,</hi> yet he is <hi>nothing</hi> in the sight of
God, and he has nothing, he has no reason
to expect the rewards of true Charity, if what
he does is only to be seen of Men, or to trade
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65286:6"/>
and truck with God. To be good, and to
do Good, is the greatest Perfection of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, as it carries in it the highest
Idea that we can form of the Divinity.</p>
            <p>But though the Characters of this noble
and heroical Temper of Mind seem very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting,
yet the extent that is here given to it,
may justly affright us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To do good to all,</hi> is too great a compass for
any Goodness that is not Infinite. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a peculiar Character to which no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can arrive, that God's Goodness is over
all his Works. We are limited Beings, and
have a narrow Sphere as well as a short
Time. It is true, the Charity of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
of our good Wishes and our Prayers,
of our Bowels, and our Compassions, ought
to be enlarged to all Mankind: We ought
to pray for the whole Race, and to be tender
when any Object is before us that may be
either relieved by us, or at least comforted
by our Sympathy. We ought to exclude none
by Prejudices, Aversions, or Passions; but
must carry about us a constant Disposition to
do all the good we can, and that to as many
Persons, and upon as many Occasions as it is
possible for us to overtake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65286:6"/>
The <hi>Iews</hi> thought they owed a great deal
to all the Race of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
that sojourned among them, by whom
they understood such Proselites as came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Obligations of their Law. There was
a liberal Provision made of a whole Tenth,
with the Gleanings in Harvest which were
copious, for the <hi>Poor,</hi> the <hi>Widow,</hi> the <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
and the <hi>Strangers,</hi> besides the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that was every Seventh Year of all that
sprung out of the Earth. But this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to their Country, or to their Religion,
to such as were Strangers to both, they were
so sullen, as not to do them the most common
Favour; to <hi>shew</hi> Travellers the way, or tell
them where a Spring of Water might be
found. This Inclosure is pulled up by the
Christian Doctrine; we are not to confine
our Charities to any Religion, or Country,
or to any Form or Division in Religion; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man has a right to some share in them.
For though in the larger Effusions of our
Bounty, we may prefer some to others, yet
in the Supplies of pressing Necessities, none
ought to be excluded, all have the Human
Nature in them, and some degrees of the
Image of God on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65286:7"/>
The more enlarged our Inclinations and
Dispositions are, it argues the greater Extent
and Elevation of Goodness. We have indeed
a small proportion of help to afford; but
there are several Channels in which that may
flow. Those of great Talents may subdue
the World by their Reason, they may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over Men by Argument, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them by Persuasion: Instruction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and Advice, are Charities that cost little
to him that gives them, and yet may be more
beneficial to those who receive them, than
the profusest Liberalities. Men of Authority
can protect and encourage the oppressed, and
that often at a small cost: A little counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and some distinction of Behaviour may
be of more use than a large Distribution. So
there are great varieties of <hi>doing good</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Mens different Capacities and Stations.
He who studies to do all the good he can to
the Neighbourhood, by setting a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in it, and maintaining Love and Peace
among Men, by observing order, and living
regularly, is a great Benefactor, how narrow
soever his Fortunes, and how small soever
his Capacity may be of doing great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65286:7"/>
Besides all this, such as abound in Wealth,
chiefly if they have not a numerous Posterity
to share it to, most particularly those whose
Wealth has been of their own acquisition;
that is, the Effect of the Blessings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
favouring their Endeavours, ought to
be, of all others, the most forward in the
largesses of Charity. Those who see many
who did set out with them, and that perhaps
upon great Advantages beyond them, and
who have been both as skilful and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as themselves, and yet have long struggled
with great Difficulties, and have at last sunk
under them, ought, when they reflect on their
own happier Circumstances, think <hi>who it is
that has made the difference?</hi> and for what end
has he made it? They ought to consider,
that in all accounts, a Balance must be sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
between Receipts and Disbursements. They
must give an account, not according to what
others have received, but according to what
they themselves have received; and to the
Charge they stand under, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
they are in.</p>
            <p>Much will be required of them, to whom
much is given; and if we expect a <hi>full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
a measure shaken together and press'd down,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65286:8"/>
we must <hi>abound in the riches of our liberality.
The liberal man deviseth liberal things, and by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
things he shall stand.</hi> These may seem
at present to dissipate his Stock, but they
bring large Returns. There cannot come a
nobler Meditation into the Mind of a Man
whom God has eminently bless'd, than to
think often within himself, <hi>What shall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto God for all his benefits towards me?</hi>
Our first Returns ought to be Praise and
Thanksgiving: but our next ought to be, to
lay out our Plenty in the best manner, and
to the best uses we can. Many have such an
abundance, that it is a trouble to them either
to keep it, or to use it. They might ease
themselves of the trouble, and trust it to
God's keeping; who will either return it to
them again, or preserve it to set it to their
account, in that great Reckoning that all must
come to.</p>
            <p>Happy they who to their strength, yea and
beyond their strength, are ever imployed in
doing Good. The heighth of Charity, is to
give not only of our <hi>abundance,</hi> that is, out
of that which is over and above what we
need, but to give out of our <hi>penury;</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
a narrow condition, and study to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65286:8"/>
without many things that we thought we
needed, but find we can live without them;
that so shortning even a scanty allowance,
we may give some relief to those who lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
under the Extremities of Want.</p>
            <p>After all the good we can do to any that
are oppressed with Misery, there is a strain
of doing good that is far above it: and to
this the Charity to their Persons may be a
great furtherance. The greatest Charity is the
delivering Men from the extreamest Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
If to save a Life is a noble piece of
Charity, how much more to save a Soul? If
we can be the happy Instruments of bringing
those who have gone astray, to love the
Truth, and to follow it; if we can allarm an
impenitent Sinner, or reclaim one that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in ill Courses; if we can help Men to
live Religiously, and to die comfortably, then
we may reckon that we are exalted to the
greatest Honour that our Natures are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, in being Instruments of the greatest
Good, that either we can do, or that others
can receive. This is indeed to be managed
with discretion, and without affectation; with
zeal, but without heat. Happy those who
find out the best Methods, and the properest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65286:9"/>
Times for it! This is both the greatest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and the noblest Employment we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
            <p>But since our Capacities as well as our
Fortunes, and our Strength as well as our
Time, are limited, we ought to see what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as well as what Acts of Charity we must
prefer to all others. That proportion of our
Time, of our Talents and our Fortunes, that
we can bestow on others, ought to be so well
managed, that it may be applied both to the
best Persons and the best Purposes that may
be. While therefore all Mankind have title
to such a share, as extream Misery may give
them a right even to demand of us, there is
still a great distinction to be made.</p>
            <p>There is somewhat of the Image of God
on all Men; but there is a more peculiar
measure of it on those who are made <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to Christ.</hi> All men have the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Nature; but the Regenerate have in
them, besides that, a participation of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature.</hi> We who are Christians, are <hi>born
again,</hi> and in that we acquire a new relation:
We are all Brethren, <hi>joint-heirs of the same
common salvation:</hi> We are members of the
same <hi>body;</hi> we have <hi>one head,</hi> and ought also
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65286:9"/>
to <hi>have one heart.</hi> We are all sharers in one
common <hi>Baptism; The bread that we break is
the communion of his body, and the cup that we
bless, is the communion of his blood,</hi> by whom
we are called. We hope to live to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
together, <hi>partakers of the Inheritance of the
Saints in light.</hi> These are Relations of so
close a Nature, that as they tie us much
more firmly to one another, so they ought
to give us a more particular concern in one
another, and therefore there is a peculiar
strain of Charity that ought to be reserved
to such as we have reason to believe are of
this Houshold. In the beginnings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
the number was small, but their
Zeal and their Charity was then in its first
fervour. Then the Widows and the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
were supplied by a <hi>daily Ministration:</hi> Such
was the Zeal of their Charity, and such
were the Necessities of that time, that the
Rich <hi>sold their lands and possessions, and laid the
price of them down at the Apostles feet.</hi> That
seems peculiar to that time and place, for
in the Epistles to the other Churches, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is oft made of the <hi>Rich</hi> that were among
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65286:10"/>
The Enemies of our Faith made this a
part of their Satyr against it, that the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with which the Rich supplied the Poor,
made that the Poor seemed as hired to come
among them. They acknowledge the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Christians was not restrained to
those of the same Faith, but was extended
even to Strangers and Enemies. If the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the name Christian, or the being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into it, makes all to be of the <hi>Houshold
of Faith,</hi> then we have no more this restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our Charity. All, or almost all, among
us are of this sort. But this is more the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Law or Custom, than of Choice:
therefore we must now take other measures,
for judging who are of the <hi>Houshold of
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can those who are a Reproach to it by
their most unchristian Lives, and who seem
weary of the very Name, which they are
ready to throw off, if they could do it without
hazard to their worldly Interests, be esteemed
a part of this Houshold? If they are, then
this is fulfilled, <hi>that a mans enemies are those of
his own houshold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, the Venom that is daily thrown out
by them against that Faith which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65286:10"/>
form and save the World, if it were sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed and follow'd by it! They judge
of it by the effects it has on themselves,
and on such as themselves: and having never
felt more in it than a Form of Words, or a
Set of Rites and Performances, they call it
<hi>foolishness:</hi> But let them Blaspheme that
Worthy Name as much as they will, <hi>Christ is
to all who are called of God, both the power and the
wisdom of God.</hi> They discern a Wisdom in his
Doctrine, and they feel a Power in it, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
their Hearts, subduing their Appetites,
changing their Natures, and governing their
Actions.</p>
            <p>Those of this <hi>Houshold</hi> do not only wear
its Livery, and carry its outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;
they are faithful to their Trust, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the Honour of their Master, and
careful of every thing that concerns the good,
either of the whole, or of any particular
Member of it. They study to keep it in
Peace, and to maintain the Honour and
Dignity of their Profession. They endeavour
to resemble the Master whom they serve,
and to walk in all things, even as he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In a word, whensoever we see these
Characters in any that calls himself of this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65286:11"/>
Houshold, even though they are yet but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
we ought to judge charitably, and to
conclude that such a Person either already is,
or may become truly one of this <hi>Houshold;</hi>
and that therefore he has a right to the more
endearing specialties of our Love. We ought
not to judge too severely of any, nor quite
to exclude them, though we may see good
reason still to give others the preference, and
a double Portion in our Charity. If we love
our Brethren from the Motive of the Love
of God, and from Principles of true Charity,
we will feel the Consideration of a higher
measure of God's Image, and a nearer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to his Nature, the strongest of all
ties.</p>
            <p>This will melt and overcome every devout
Mind; and that the rather, because such
Persons are not clamorous and importunate:
they do not publish their Necessities till the
last extremity forces it. Nor do they attack
us with violence. They are patient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
hardly brought to trouble others, and
soon dashed when they do it: And indeed a
great deal of what of right should be reserved
for them, is oft intercepted by the noise and
importunity, the affected Looks and Voices
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65286:11"/>
of a sort of people, that go about, with too
much success, while others are starving at
home in silence. This is one of the justest
Reproaches of our Nation, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Authority that Law gives to
Magistrates for correcting it, yet a false com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
and a feebleness of good nature,
proves too hard, even for the Law, in its exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
It is the Honour of Magistracy to be
vigilant and severe in executing Laws, that
how unacceptable soever the first prosecution
of them may seem to be, yet are as Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
as they are Just. There are tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that are Cruel, as well as Severities that
have Charity and Kindness in them.</p>
            <p>Among all the Objects of Charity, as there
are none that are more helpless, or more cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than young Children, who are initiated
into this Houshold, and have not yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
that Innocence to which the sacred
Rites have restored them; so there are none
from whom we may so reasonably expect the
Returns of thirty, sixty, or an hundred-fold:
A Child well educated may become an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious,
vertuous and religious Man. His
Education may follow him down through
the whole course of his Life, and go to his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65286:12"/>
Posterity after him. This is always the most
hopeful and most fruitful Application of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Next to these, the most pressing are
those who are under the double Misery both
of Poverty, and of Sickness or Pain: who
may be near the giving their last accounts;
and therefore need more than at any time, to
be freed from Temptations, and every other
burden except that which the ill state of their
Body brings them necessarily under; and even
in that, need most of all to be so supplied,
that they may be either quite relieved, or at
least that their burden may be lightned, and
their last Agonies made less dreadful and more
tolerable to them. The reducing ill people
by the severity of discipline to a better course
of life, is a Charity well becoming that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which regards the good of the Soul in
the first place. And the care of the Lunaticks
and Franticks has so much of a just Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
in it, that humane Nature is at first
sight struck with it.</p>
            <p>The Pious Provision, and Royal and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Endowments for these Ends, are to be
reckoned among the chief Securities, as well
as the fairest Ornaments and Glories of this
Great City. But the overflowings of Charity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65286:12"/>
here, which support these Foundations in an
Expence far beyond their certain Revenues, is
the peculiar Glory of the present Inhabitants,
as well, as it is the City's chief Preservative.
What but some such Acts of Love could co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
such a multitude of Sins, secure us so
long from the Returns of sweeping Plagues
and consuming Fires? What has preserved
us from all that Train of Mischief, both from
within and without, that had long ago
wrought our Ruin, if the happy Interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Providence had not been always at
hand to give us a fresh Deliverance, as often
as we were threatned with a new Mischief?
What could resist so loud a Cry of so much
Impiety, such bold Attempts against our God
and his Christ, as are too common? What
else could keep off those Judgments, which our
adding new and unheard-of Abominations to
the old stock of our former crying Sins, must
have brought down upon us, even in Fire and
Brimstone? In opposition to all these, by
which we are filling up the measure of our
Iniquities, we have still the Tears and Prayers
of many in and about this Great City, which
support and preserve it, more than even the
Trade and Industry of the Citizens. We have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65286:13"/>
the Noble Charities of those whom God has
bless'd among us, which ascend before the
Throne as a sweet-smelling Savour; We have
the grateful Prayers and Thanksgivings of such
as having no other Returns to make for what
they receive, may be supposed to offer these
up heartily for their Benefactors, and for this
City in which they find such mighty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Relief. These do still keep off the
Judgments that otherwise we should long ago
have smarted under; and therefore here is a
proper place to make a stand, and to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you what the Worthy Governors of
those Endowments have done for this last
Year, that so those whom God has eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bless'd, may see what is reserved for them
yet to do.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A True REPORT, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>It remains now to consider the Measure by
which we ought to pursue our Charity: <hi>As
we have opportunity,</hi> or according to the other
Reading, <hi>While we have time.</hi> Every time of
our receiving special Blessings from God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our Spiritual or Temporal Concerns,
chiefly when unlook'd for, and great Successes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65286:13"/>
in our Affairs, do as it were surprize us, we
ought to reckon a special Opportunity for
doing Good: We have then a new Capacity
put in our hands. If those who meet with
particular Blessings are yet so straitned, that
they having nothing to spare, express their
willingness to give liberally if it were in their
power, even that will be accepted by him
who in such a case does certainly take the <hi>will
for the deed;</hi> but that is never to be expected,
when it is in our power to do as well as to
will: then not to do, and only to pretend
to will, is but to mock God.</p>
               <p>When fit Occasions and proper Objects
come in our way, at a time when we feel
we have it in our power to do good, we
ought to look upon that as a determination
of Providence, to lodge the Good that we
are disposed to do, on such Objects: When
at any time we re-double our Prayers with
more than ordinary Vehemence, for any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
or Blessing, we ought to proportion
some overplus in our Charity, to the Grace
that we then beg from God. We may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that our Prayers shall be best heard,
when we open our Ears and our Hands to
those who call to us. As we would desire
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65286:14"/>
that God should prevent us with his Favour,
we ought to seek out the Necessitous, chiefly
the Domesticks of this Family, to prevent
them with our Liberality. We ought not to
shake off pressing Occasions, that call for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Help. In such cases often a Delay is a
Denial; the Opportunity may be lost for
ever. The Invitations of Providence, in
some happy Encounters, are to be tenderly
received as special Favours, and to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
managed. So far we ought to be from
letting them slip from us, that we ought to
seek them out, and to wait for them. The
improving these, is as it were the putting God
in our debt, or rather the putting us out of
his. We ought to reckon it a Favour when
he sends any of his Family to us in his Name.
We ought to receive them well, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
them the better for his sake, in whose
Name they come. Under all our Plenty, we
cannot have a surer Indication, that it is
sent to us, and bless'd of God, than that we
have it in our Will as much as it is in our
Power, or rather more than our Power reaches
to, to do all the Good with it that possibly
we can. This is one Article in making up
our accounts, which we may then do with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65286:14"/>
joy, when we feel a heartiness in our Bounty;
that we part with it, not only easily, but
cheerfully; that it is not extorted from us by
Importunity or Decency, but is given with a
willing Heart; and that in the Measure of it,
we feel a disposition to give rather more than
less than our Condition can afford. Nor are
we to complain that Opportunities return too
thick upon us; but are rather to rejoice, that
when we have dispersed abroad, a new Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
returns soon after that sowing. After all,
there is Prudence and Discretion even in this,
and Bounds must be set to it, within which
we ought to restrain our selves: but so few are
apt to exceed on this hand, that there is little
occasion to insist much upon it.</p>
               <p>The other reading of the word is, <hi>While we
have time:</hi> As long as we live, and have the
free use of that Plenty with which God blesses
us. Death will quickly come upon us, and
then perhaps a fraudulent Man or an Usurer,
when he can enjoy his Wealth no longer, will
think of <hi>redeeming his iniquities</hi> by some Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which he may intend both to gratify
his Vanity, and to quiet the Horrors of his
Conscience; but Restitution were the better
and the more necessary Cure, since it is as it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65286:15"/>
were a calling God to share with them in
their unlawful Gains, when they offer him
some part of them, before they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make restitution to the righteous
Owners, whom they had defrauded. Such
Endowments coming from defiled Hands,
will not be accepted.</p>
               <p>It is true, if a special Restitution, after a
Life of numberless and small Injustices, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made, a liberal Distribution will be
accepted of God, if made without the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Conceit of compounding with Him:
Yet that which is made by Men in Health,
who outlive their parting with it, looks liker
a willing Sacrifice, than that which is only
let go to pious Uses, when they can hold it
no longer. It savours too little of Charity,
and too rankly of Vanity, to hoard up and
to give nothing during one's Life, that he
may have wherewith to leave some splendid
piece of Magnificence at his Death. While
<hi>we have time</hi> therefore, that is, while we live
and are in Health; while we see Objects that
call aloud upon us, and that perhaps perish
for the want of that which is in our power
to give them; Let us shew a Pleasure as well
as a Zeal in Good Works; for this is the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65286:15"/>
only part of our Wealth that we may be said
in some sort to carry along with us into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World; <hi>our works will follow us;</hi> and the
<hi>Friends</hi> whom we have made by our <hi>Mammon,
will be ready to receive us into their eternal habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another view of the word <hi>while we have
time,</hi> is, In this <hi>our day, knowing the time.</hi> We
are now again in Peace, and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
in a high degree of Plenty. We do
not know how long the present Quiet shall
continue, or how soon the Clouds shall return
after all the Rain that is fallen. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our Dangers or Difficulties have been,
they are now over, and we forget them,
and take little care to provide for the Evil
Day, which may be much nearer than we
will suffer our selves to think it is. A shaking
may come that may drive us from our Seats
and our Wealth: It is not hard to apprehend
from what Accidents, and by what Hands the
Evil Day may come.</p>
               <p>The best way to prevent it, is to think
often that it may come; and instead of hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a great deal, which may prove only
the heaping up of Treasure, both to invite
and to glut our Enemies, instead of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65286:16"/>
of Waste and Riot, of Luxury and
Vanity, to be laying it up in such Acts of
Charity as will stand us in more stead in the
Evil day, than the best secured Wealth we
have; we will then the more easily bear Want
if we use our present Abundance well. Have
other National Churches been plucked up
by the Roots, and scattered all about in
strange Countries, and why may not we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
some such dreadful Sentence, <hi>Cut it
down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> It will be
the easier to us to encounter some such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
if while we have now both Time
and Plenty, we use it prudently, and bestow
it Charitably: We may then with confidence
trust that God will raise up, even in strange
Countries, Benefactors to us, if we do now
<hi>deal our bread to the hungry, and hide not our
selves from our own flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, it will be the more easy to
part with the Remnants of our Wealth when
we have accustomed our selves before-hand
to make liberal Distributions out of it, and
to live upon a small part of it, especially
for those who have secured the best part of
it, where <hi>neither rust nor moth doth corrupt, nor
thieves break through and steal;</hi> and so have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65286:16"/>
the <hi>promises both of this life, and of that which
is to come.</hi> To conclude with the Words
that go before my Text, <hi>Whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his flesh, shall of his flesh reap corruption:
but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
reap life everlasting. Therefore let us not be
weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not.</hi>
