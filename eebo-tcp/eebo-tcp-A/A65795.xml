            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this <hi>Piece,</hi> which makes, as it were, it's proper appeal to the integrity of your un-bias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed soul, singling you forth as the most competent <hi>Patrone,</hi> not only of your <hi>sex</hi> but <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> You have often, <hi>Madam,</hi> whilst his forrain language rendred him unfit for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, heard much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about this <hi>Treatise</hi> and it's <hi>Author</hi> (for what <hi>English man</hi> is there, concerned never so little in the behalf of <hi>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> whose heart and mouth is not filled either with <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> or <hi>Censure</hi> of this great <hi>Country-man</hi> of ours?) whom if none hitherto hath presumed to vindicate to your <hi>La<hi rend="sup">p</hi>.</hi> he is therein nothing the less happy, being now to speak for himself, a task scarce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable by any, but himself.

To conclude <hi>(Madam)</hi> this small <hi>Treatise</hi> having served me for an excellent <hi>Country-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime,</hi> I could not but take the boldness to recommend it to you <hi>both,</hi> at your entrance into the same state of <hi>Vacancy,</hi> assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self, that, when you have <hi>maturely</hi> perused it, you will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow with me that they have

little reason, who tax the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> with requiring his readers assent, purely and barely upon the accompt of his own credit; for, in my poor judgment, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any assertions were better fortifyed; at least I heartily wish it were in my power as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly to demonstrate the truth of my being</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Shall entreat thee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that, had I the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or vanity, to entertain thee with something of my own, I should not have taken this occasion, when I am to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thee with an employment, so much more advantagious to thy self, so disadvantagious to me. The Painter that hath some petty design of his own to put off, suffers it not to appear with a master piece of <hi>Raphael</hi> or <hi>Titian.</hi> Nothing but necessity could have extorted these few lines, at least in this place, which two dedicatory addresses al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready take up and overburthen;
<pb facs="tcp:53895:5"/>
a necessity I say, of giving the world some account of this my enterprize.</p>
            <p>It is now about five years, since this small Treatise first came forth in the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue. I was a witness of the manisold contradictions it then encountred, and consequently ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to foresee that it must now expect farre greater. If it were then a crime to treat somewhat severely (though as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the curtain, and in sight of few only, that is, the learned) a certain luxuriant Devotion, what temerity may it not be thought, to unveil now and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it's nakedness to the weak and soon scandalized eyes of the vulgar? They from whom I expect this reprehension, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, many of them, so generally friends to vertue, so particularly to my self, that I am bound not only to receive it with modesty, but thanks; and, in requital, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their zeal, to endeavour to lend some light to it's War<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53895:6"/>I beseech therefore both them and thee (gentle Reader) in the first place to observe, how through the opposite means, they of suppressing, I of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this little Volume, we all pursue the same end, that is, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to wipe off a scandal from our common Mother the Cath. Church, led thereto by the same motives, the welfare first of those within, secondly, of those without Her.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> they contend, that it savors of <hi>pride,</hi> not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our private reasons upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of never so much demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative evidence, to the opinion of the <hi>Church;</hi> of <hi>Disobedience,</hi> to vary from Her common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: consequently that it must needs inure Catholicks to the neglect of their long gloried-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>captivation of their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and this by degrees, from matters of <hi>opinion,</hi> to matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> As to the <hi>second,</hi> they urge, that all discovery of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb facs="tcp:53895:6"/>
in the Catholick Church, more and more occasions, and legitimates the common reproach of her adversaries, to wit, that no greater union is to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Her <hi>children,</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those whom she styles <hi>Hereticks;</hi> consequently well may they be disheartned from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any secure repose in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. Both these charges I shall briefly, and, I hope clearly, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</p>
            <p>First, as to the disedification of <hi>Catholicks</hi> from ill example, of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>disobedience,</hi> I answer, that an humble and obedient du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline this present task. <hi>Obedience</hi> consists in <hi>execution</hi> of her known commands; her commands in this matter, are pronounced Con.

               </hi> that is, testifying the present Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of his time, avowes them. Again, has that Doctrine, which takes away all the extrinsecal authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> interpreting places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which relate to <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;</hi> That which debars souls, granted to be perfect in <hi>charity,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53895:7"/>
from the sight of <hi>God:</hi> That which puts God to inflict punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to <hi>better</hi> the creature, but to <hi>revenge</hi> himself; That which violates all<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
               <hi>Philosophy</hi> by confounding the natures of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> That which makes the evil of <hi>pain</hi> spring, not from the sinful <hi>defects</hi> of creatures, but from the all-good-<hi>Will</hi> of God; That which is impossible to be maintain'd, but by legitimating <hi>extrinsecal imputation,</hi> which is fundamentally opposite to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicism:</hi> That which by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Purgatory</hi> not <hi>purge</hi> at all, destroyes it's very <hi>notion</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and makes even it's name breath contradiction; Hath, I say, that Doctrine, which is the ground of these, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other absurdities, <hi>no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of falshood?</hi> And lastly, as for their <hi>uncertainty,</hi> is there so much as one <hi>Demonstration</hi> pretended on <g ref="char:punc">âª</g>their behalf by their Patrons?

But, God be thanked, they do not, they cannot, they dare not.

            <p>This then shall be my aime in the following Treatise: <hi>First,</hi> to illustrate the nature of <hi>Purgatory</hi> from the sacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> and monuments of holy <hi>Fathers;</hi> next, immoveably to establish it by <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> evident in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but before all, give me leave to summe up and state the whole controversie, as it is on both sides asserted.

            <p>The Vulgar modern Divines<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries explication of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> embrace in a manner generally this position, That the deficiences of men are some <hi>mortal,</hi> and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable with eternal misery, others <hi>venial</hi> and expiable by temporary sufferings. Mortal lapses, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented they absolve from eternal, condemning them notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to time-limitted torments. So that suppose an imperfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian departed, whose venial sins no satisfaction at all hath cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whose mortal an imperfect one hath diminished; these Doctors admit him not to the <hi>beatifical vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> but provide for him a subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous <hi>cave,</hi> fill'd with <hi>flames</hi> and horrid <hi>instruments</hi> of torture, which his there confined and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd soul must, till expiated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. And these pains they thus far suppose like to those we here experience, that they are inflicted by <hi>extrinsecal</hi> Agents, and <hi>against</hi> the will of the patient, conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

moreover that they take their proportion from the measure and nature of the crimes committed in the body, according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate of <hi>Divine Justice.</hi> Nor can these torments by any indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry or force of the soul it self be evaded, though by our prayers, who survive, they may be miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and before the otherwise due and prefixed time determined. The same relief they fancy from the satisfaction or merits of the <hi>Saints,</hi> if by the <hi>Church</hi> to that intent apply'd.</p>

But I place not this imperfection, in that the <hi>Sin</hi> is totally cancelled the <hi>pain</hi> only remaining, but in the change of an <hi>Absolute</hi> into a <hi>conditional</hi> affection, as it were instead of <hi>I will,</hi> substituting, <hi>I will not, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Being therefore by the operation of death, as it were new moulded and minted into a purely <hi>spiritual</hi> substance, he carries inseparably with him the matter of his torment in the like manner as he also doth who takes leave of the body with his affections only <hi>venially</hi> disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

            <p>IN the very front whereof I fix<note place="margin">The first Text from 2 <hi>Mach.</hi>
               </note> two evident testimonies of the sacred Writ. The first from 2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 12. where the discourse is, that <hi>Judas Machabeus</hi> sent mony to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to procure sacrifices for the sins of his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers slain in battel; the holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter testifying that he did this act,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53895:17"/>
               <hi>Well and religiously, thinking of the resurrection; for unless</hi> (saith he) <hi>he had hoped they should rise again, it would have seemed super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and vain to pray for the dead.</hi> For <hi>vain</hi> the Greek Text hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>foolish</hi> or <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</hi> It appears that even then when this book was written, the errour of denying the resurrection had insinuated it self amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the commixtion of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> so that the Writer was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to reprove it, by occasion of this signal action of <hi>Machabeus.</hi> His argument runs thus; 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (saith he) that Prayers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avail the dead unless there be a <hi>resurrection:</hi> But as by this illustrious Example of <hi>Machabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> we learn, Prayers do avail them, Therefore there must be a resurrection.</p>
            <p>We affirm that from this Text, it is easily convinc'd, that souls before the resurrection are not delivered from their Purgatory-sufferings or State. For if they are,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53895:17"/>
our prayers working that haypy effect, it were great benefit and great wisdome to pray for them though there were never to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny resurrection<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Either the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writer therefore is mistaken, or they who free such souls before the resurrection. Nor is their conjecture of any moment, who suppose it may be therefore said, <hi>unless he had hoped they should rise again,</hi> because the denyal of the resurrection would have at once destroy'd the beliefe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the soul, at least as to the <hi>Jews;</hi> first, because 'tis known that the <hi>Heathens,</hi> by whose conversation the <hi>Jewish</hi> tenents were corrupted, did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <g ref="char:punc">âª</g>them admit souls to be <hi>immortal,</hi> notwithstanding they deny'd the <hi>resurrection</hi> of bodies: and secondly, because this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is too frank and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, engaging a Writer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least ground, against an opinion, which, whether it had at that time any assertors, is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53895:18"/>
altogether unknown, and that at the peril of making a frivolous consequence, and the assuming a proposition <hi>in it self</hi> false. Nor doth it advantage them to alledg that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (against whose Progenitors this disputation may be thought to be levell'd) deny'd <hi>spirits.</hi> The Stoicks did the like, yet at the same time they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the soul's superviven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and transanimation after the decay of the body. Clearly therefore, if souls may be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their suffering before the <hi>resurrection,</hi> this proposition, <hi>It is superfluous and vain to pray for the dead unless there be a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> is both false, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose alledged.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>New</hi> Instrument keep<note place="margin">The Second Text, 1 Cor. 15. exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> time and harmony with the <hi>Old.</hi> Let S. <hi>Paul</hi> be heard preaching to the same effect. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>What shall they do</hi> (saith he) <hi>who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again? to what end are they baptized for the dead?</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53895:18"/>
Some understood by baptizing, <hi>affliction</hi> or <hi>mortification</hi> of the body; others a certain ceremony of <hi>washing</hi> themselves for the dead: which way soever you take it, his discourse is the same with that of the Writer of the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi> Where that Writer affirms, <hi>it were superfluous to pray for the dead,</hi> the Apostle cryes out, <hi>What shall we do?</hi> what benefit shall they reap? how will they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected seeing themselves depriv'd of the hopes of assisting their friends? What the one calls <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>foolish,</hi> the other phrases, <hi>To what end are they baptized?</hi> what do they mean? what do they aime at? nothing; they are fooles or mad men. It is therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that pious and wise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons used this custome (whatever it were) of baptizing themselves, whose action and example the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle commending it, urgeth as of sufficient authority again the <hi>Corinthians</hi>

nerves of this discourse, it being perfectly the same with the first Text; to wit, that it were folly to be baptiz'd for the dead, if they were not to rise again. No be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit therefore is obtain'd by such Baptisme before the <hi>resurrection,</hi> nor by so doing can the souls till then be released. So that from this argument it appears, that the solution offered to the first was of no consequence; for no man that I know alledges that the Doctor of the Gentiles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes here against the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> with whom his arguments would not have any force at all. For neither would they regard the Example of those who baptized themselves in behalf of the dead, as being <hi>Pharises;</hi> neither would what the Apostle urgeth of <hi>Christ</hi>'s resurrection, or his own predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation make any the least impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in them.

            <p>In the third place I cite the<note place="margin">The Fift Text, 2 Tim. 1.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. Where the Apostle thus prayes for <hi>Onisiphoris, Our Lord grant him to find mercy from our Lord in that day.</hi> An <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> may perhaps smile at the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this text to justifie prayer for the <hi>dead,</hi> and pretend a great difference between praying for those who are living that they may be saved after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and praying for their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who are already departed. But I shall entreat him to reflect more advisedly on the expression. Was it not said, <hi>that he may find mercy in that day?</hi> Is not that day confessed to be the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53895:21"/>
Let us consider <hi>Onisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> now dead; will you affirm that he hath already found that mercy, which the Apostle prayes he may find in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Why do you hesitate? If now he hath receiv'd it, how shall he then find it? If he have not yet receiv'd it, the wish of the Apostle is not yet accomplished. It hangs therefore still in suspence, and if so may be reiterated, and if it may be reiterated, then must it be lawful to pray for the <hi>dead.</hi> For Prayer is ever seasonable till the effect be granted; and consequently pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the dead is from hence also cleerly proved.</p>
            <p>But methinks I see our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern pretenders to <hi>Divinity</hi> full, and longing to be delivered of this objection, That if effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">Ton. 2. lib. 3. lect. 4. par. 11. &amp; lect. 5. par. 8. &amp; lect. 3. p. 15. 16, 17.</note> this be so, we must pray for the Saints also, they being to obtain likewise a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by that day (as in our <hi>Sacred Institutions</hi> may appear)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53895:21"/>
which notwithstanding any one may perceive to differ from the common practice of the whole Church. I am not of so weak a stomach as not to digest this morsel. What do you expect I should reply? That S. <hi>Paul</hi> presum'd <hi>Onisiphorus</hi> should not be happy before the last day, whereas himself desired to be immediately dissolved and dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the enjoyments of Christ? I dare not. How then? Shall I say he prayed not that <hi>Onisiphorus</hi> might find mercy, even after his soul was beatify'd? The Text on all sides confess'd forbids me. What then? will our Adversaries say this was not to pray for the blessed? Common sense permits them not. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did it; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity did it.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53895:23"/>I am not ignorant, that <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> from the bare considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>antiquity,</hi> have not that force which other writings of the same Authors have, since as they are of publick use, so can we not almost doubt, but somethings in them might, by succeeding prelates of the same Churches, by additions or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions be altered, as it were of course. But give me leave withal to observe, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is more then supply'd by their being the publick instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Churches, the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which in so many <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> is delivered, being justly to be accounted as the constant tenet of all ages, unless so great an authority can from elsewhere be undermined. Let us then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus. So many <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Churches, continually in their publick <hi>Liturgies,</hi> beseech God in general terms to give salvation to all the faithful departed, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing them a place of ease,
<pb facs="tcp:53895:23"/>
light, and peace; and where none are excepted, all are included; and in our case eminent Saints particularly named, as it were by foresight and obviation to this objection. We cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doubt but that prayer was anciently offered for the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us consider more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.

Nazianzene,</hi> &amp;c. in whom those universal experssions are found.</p>
            <p>But because the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy seemes to speak less clearly then the rest, let us examine her own best interpreters. S. <hi>Ambrose De ob.

S. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself in his book <hi>of Sacraments,</hi> saith, <hi>We have received, O Lord, the divine mysteries, which as they avail thy Saints to the encrease of glory, so we beseech thee they may benefit us for the cure of our infirmities.</hi> The same may be likewise gather'd from the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to pray for those who depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so holily, that be affirmes them to be presented to the Priest as to the distributor of their crowns.

rejoycing and triumphs for the dead; cleerly declaring it to descend from the Apostles Doctrine and command to offer sacrifices for the dead. It was therefore anciently lawful and customary to pray for the <hi>Saints;</hi> nor is it in our dayes less, the Church her self instructing thus to pray, <hi>Receive what we offer to the honour of thy Saints, that to them it may be an increase of glory, to us of safety.</hi> Nor is it infrequent amongst the more pious, when they name a <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Martyr,</hi> to adde, <hi>Whose glory God increase.</hi>

we are almost at a loss how to excuse the Church from the same crime.

            </p>
            <p>I dare not take upon me to justifie them in all circumstances, but as to the substance I avow, that (setting S. <hi>Bernard</hi> aside, and <hi>John</hi> the 22. if you please to reckon him amongst the Fathers) not any one of them (for ought may be gather'd out of their writings) spoke even ambiguously in the case.

them did deliberately deny the <hi>Saints</hi> to be <hi>in Heaven,</hi> which by inadvertency is become our vulgar phrase to signifie <hi>Beatitude.</hi> But S. <hi>Bernard</hi> reflecting on the<note place="margin">How <hi>S Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> came to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therein.</note> difference, affirm'd them to be <hi>in Heaven,</hi> as to their <hi>substance,</hi> but not so as to enjoy the <hi>vision</hi> of the Deity. Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he light upon this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, whilst he wholly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd his speculation to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til reach of the mistical speeches in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> not by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his predecessors, so that unawares he let go the <hi>Churches</hi> sense, retaining only her words.</p>

The latter carries too much evidence to find an opposition, since we are speaking of men, and those who are never so little spiritualiz'd know that to be in <hi>place</hi> suites only with <hi>bodies.</hi> These two things then those holy Fathers maintain, and by their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies<note place="margin">What the Fathers mean when they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed souls to be kept in certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles till the last Day.</note> foreprize our exceptions. When we hear them say that Saints or their souls are detained in certain receptacles or store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses till the day of Judgment; conceive them to mean that they have not yet received their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial places of <hi>Beatitude,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> alone to opine that they are indeed already possessed of their proper and material places, but so that the humanity only of <hi>Christ</hi> is represented to them and made their object. For as we term that to be in darkness which is not in the light, and in a manner alwayes explicate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationsby in compossible positives;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53895:27"/>
so those Doctors phrased the not being <hi>locally</hi> in Heaven, by the being in other <hi>receptacles,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accommodating their expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to the vulgar capacity, though conscious of the <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or by the force of fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves beguil'd into that unwary perswation.</p>
            <p>This reflection alone beats<note place="margin">A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of most of them.</note> back most of the calumnies darted at those Saints. For <hi>Ireneus, Justin, Tertullian, Clemens Romanus, Lactantius, Origen, Vistorinus, Prudentius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, Oecumenius,</hi> pronounce no more then that the souls are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained out of Heaven, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at the last day their remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and future glory. Yea, most of them follow those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions with others, which at least permissively insinuate that they enjoy God as to their souls. So <hi>Ireneus</hi> explicating the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi> resurrection to be that of <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> So <hi>Justin</hi> affirming them to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53895:28"/>
enjoy <hi>Paradice</hi> with the sense of <hi>Intelligence,</hi> that is, those joyes of Paradice which pure Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences are capable of. So <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> allowing them rest and joy. So <hi>Origen,</hi> declaring them to be as it were in a Schoole or Auditory, that they may make judgment of the future, that it may sore-run, and mentally taste the joyes they are awayting; sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover that they expect those which can receive no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encrease. So <hi>Victorinus,</hi> confessing them to be in a state of repose, free from pains and flames, where they attend in the last times, a perpetual, that is, not mutable or increasable reward. <hi>Prudentius's</hi> words may well sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Heaven,</hi> unless the use and acceptation of his Age otherwise determine them. The sentiments of S. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> are elsewhere sufficiently cleared. <hi>Arethus</hi> saith, they have a certain conjecture, that is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or pregustation of the future.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53895:28"/>Having so great an evidence of the thoughts of most of them, we are not to doubt but that the rest, whose words are somewhat harsher, were yet of the same judgment. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks ambiguously when he saith that the soul after this life is still in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the future Judgment; but I conceive him to speak inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, not intending that any one in particular remaines doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether she shall be happy or otherwise, but that all are not to be happy, but some happy, some miserable. The place is taken out of the 10. Chapter of his Book, <hi>De bono mortis,</hi> where treating more at large of this Doctrine, he seemes to explain this part of his opinion in this sort. <hi>Therefore whilst the plenitude of time is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi> (saith he) <hi>the souls waite their just remuneration, some shall have punishment, some glory.</hi> Besides what he had before af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the soul of <hi>Valentinian, Gratian, Theodosius</hi> and his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53895:29"/>
Brother gives ample satisfaction concerning his Judgment. To which you may adde if you please, out of his 59. Epistle, <hi>de obit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Theophilact's</hi> speech is likewise somewhat difficult, maintaining the <hi>Saints to have yet obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing of the celestial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi> But S. <hi>Chrysostom's</hi> pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which he adheres to) relieves him, giving us occasion to understand by <hi>Celestial</hi> those promises which are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and which <hi>Oecumenius</hi> calls the <hi>term</hi> or <hi>period of goods.</hi> S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> himself declares that the souls unless the body rise again shall remain excluded from the Celestial Beatitude; that is, shall

So that at last it appears to have been not a famous Doctrine of the Fathers of the Church, but an infamous calumny against them, to impose upon them the denyal of the sight of God before the universal resurrection.

               <p>The Fifth proof from Scripture is again urged and two others added.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOtwithstanding all which, I<note place="margin">Why the rewards of the day of Judgment are so much inculcated.</note> should think my pains well rewarded, if I could learn the reason, why the holy Doctors with so much earnestness have inculcated to us the rewards and punishments of the last judgment, since they well enough understood that pure souls might have an immediate fruition of God. The first Motive may be that the <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical</hi>
               <note place="margin">First Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> 
               <hi>Vision</hi> is more perfect with the body resum'd, then without it; which S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly favours. Yet I am not convinced by it; first, because nothing of this reason appears
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53895:30"/>
amongst most of them, though the <hi>Thesis</hi> be common to them all; and secondly, because no proof thereof is brought by him, nor by S. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself, though he affirms it certain that the soul of man devested of the body, cannot so behold the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commutable goodness as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do, and the said souls expect the redemption of their bodies, since in his <hi>Retractations</hi> he seems to acknowledg the obscurity of the Consequence. The reason we have given for it in our <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Institution</hi> is singular, and by few valued or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The next Motive may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Second<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Reason<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </note> Corporeal goods, which are first attained by the Resurrection, are more esteemed by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Christians then spiritual, as being better understood by them. But this reason is too dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to Christianity it self; for it being the designe of it's profession, and task of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorin
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53895:31"/>
to take off the minds of men, from terrene goods and place them on celestial, 'tis alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improper to permit corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real advantage, to be preach'd and inculcated more vehemently then spiritual; nor doth it stand with those encomiums of Beatitude, <hi>That eyes have not seen, eares not heard,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the passions of this time are not condign to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory; that there is good measure heaped together, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed down and overflowing,</hi> &amp;c. Lastly, Because we are taught, that they compared to spiritual pleasures, principally to the <hi>Beatifical Vision,</hi> have the proportion of finite to infinite; so that it little imports the satisfaction and contentment of the person whether he hath then or not.</p>
            <p>The third reason then must<note place="margin">Third and chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> take place. That therefore the <hi>Retributions</hi> of the last day are so inculcated, because they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, whereas the <hi>rewards</hi> which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53895:31"/>
before that are given, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and as it were <hi>priviledges.</hi> I shall endeavour to explicate my self. Mankind or humane nature is not integrated by a few wise or extraordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious persons, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty and universality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Them therefore God, and Christ in the predication and propagation of the Gospel, hath respect to. These things then in the bulk and body of Catholick faith are to be promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed which concern the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind. And truly whether we cast our eyes on the old or new Testament, we shall find our Faith founded and<note place="margin">The Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the basis of all Faith.</note> rooted in the resurrection. Let us examine the hopes of <hi>Job,</hi> the threats of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> the menaces or promises of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> the comfort of <hi>Toby,</hi> and instructions given to his Son: Lastly, either the valour of the <hi>Machabees</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or their patient suffering,

every where we meet with the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Is the <hi>New</hi> stile dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent? Do not all the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, parabies, promises, denuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord sound forth the <hi>Resurrection?</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out that all Faith is at an end and frustrated, if you take away, the Resurrection. S. S. <hi>Peter, Jude, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> repeat the same lesson. This is the Theam which both affrighted and allured all the world; this made the proudest necks to bow, and both already hath and shall subjugate all Nations to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Laws of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now behold us on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den revolved, I know not how,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Pau's</hi> prayer for <hi>Onesipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> to the solution of the difficulty which begat this discourse; for by this clue we readily acquit our selves of all intricacy in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles wish of mercy to <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> not simply in the next world, but expresly in the day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> For though the vertues of the person
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53895:32"/>
permitted him to hope no less then that his last breath would wafte him to the regious of <hi>Beatitude,</hi> yet he chose rather to express his affection in terms sit to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to all the Brethren and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the common condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, least he might be thought to have entertain'd too good an opinion of <hi>Onesiphorus's</hi> well-doing. And that this was the form of prayer for the dead among the <hi>Jews,</hi> those that are conversant in their rights do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie; and our selves have a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech not much unlike, when challenging our due, we threaten to demand it <hi>at the day of Judgment,</hi> if it be not restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And if I mistake not, Christ<note place="margin">The Sixt Text Mat. 5.</note> our Lord gave us the hint, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us <hi>to agree with our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Seventh Text Luke 12.</note> 
               <hi>in the way, least he deliver us to the Judg, and the Judg to the Executioner;</hi> who shall with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour exact the debt. You see then that both <hi>Matthew</hi> 5. 26.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53895:33"/>
&amp; <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 58. we are taught that we must smart for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the last day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and then make satisfaction to those we have injured. Which passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges if they be urged will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that there is a remission of sins, and that not without fire and torments in the day of judgment. Especially <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who not believing punishment due for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the least breach of neighbourly charity, are compell'd to admit an expiation of such lighter tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes in the day of Judgment, when the adversary will be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with us, and <hi>Christ</hi> sitting the common Judg, to whom he may deliver us. These two Texts then conclude the same. But what stand I enumerating every particular Text? If the whole face of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if the universal Assembly of <hi>Saints</hi> and holy <hi>Doctors,</hi> if the belief of all <hi>ages</hi> look upon the day of <hi>Judgment</hi> as the time of general <hi>reward,</hi> certainly unless we avow

that the greatest part of Mankind is then admitted to <hi>Beatitude,</hi> the Majesty and utility of that grand day is annihilated, and the ostentation of those great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses rendred inconsiderable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of what was conceived of it. From the main stock there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Christian Faith springs the certainty of this truth, <q>That whoever are once in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that is, the greatest portion of the faithful can never be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the Kingdome prepared by the Father, till they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves at the supreme and august Tribunal, that it may be fitly said <hi>to them all,</hi> what is to take effect in the <hi>greatest part</hi> of them.</q>

            <p>THe next Text which occurrs<note place="margin">The Eighth Text 1 Cor. 3.</note> is so special an evidence, that I cannot omit it without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Reader.

               </gap>re which he had rebuked them for making comparisons among their preachers, to which also he' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards returns. From whence some are conjectured that these speeches refer rather to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Teachers, then works of the Auditors. But the contrary appears; first in that the <hi>Builder</hi> comes after the Apostle hath done his work, whom we may well suppose to have delivered to the faithful the whole and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Law of Christ, as himself testifies, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dding adieu to the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, that he had withdrawn nothing, that was profitable from them. Secondly, what kind of tryal can there be of Doctrines <hi>by the day of our Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Latine</hi> Translation hath it, or <hi>that day,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> reads, if the Article be

                  </gap>ey,</hi> that is diuturnity or length of time, wherein the builder may receive reward or detriment? Thirdly, who shall be saved by suffering detriment? The Preacher or Hearer? There is no work in the Preacher by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration whereof he may suffer detriment, and if the Hearer suffer it, then is he also the Builder, and not only he, but whoever destroyes the Temple of God within himself, him will God overthrow, that is, severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punish. But to return. The Apostle proceeds to enumerate three sorts of good, that is perfect works, and as many which abide not the trial, and adds, that of which <hi>of these kinds every ones works are, it shall be made manifest.</hi> Why? <hi>Because the day of our Lord will declare it.</hi> How? <hi>By being revealed in fire,</hi> a fit examiner of the several alloyes. After this he goes on, <hi>If any ones work remain, he shall receive</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53895:35"/>
               <hi>reward,</hi> that is, more good shall be added to him. <hi>But if any mans work burn, he shall suffer loss,</hi> that is, he shall be punished, and that which he seemes to have shall be taken from him. But because his foundation is solid, to wit, the lively faith of <hi>Christ</hi> in him, he shall be saved, but as a brand snatch'd flaming, and charred, from the fire.</p>
            <p>This is the literal sense of that place, in which it is evident that<note place="margin">Which must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial sins and of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the discourse runs of <hi>Venial</hi> sins, it being plain that <hi>Mor tal</hi> ones cannot be built upon <hi>Christ,</hi> since by their very being in our souls they expel from thence life and Christ. The next thing we are to reflect on, is, that according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation we have given, the <hi>day</hi> of which the Apostle speaks, musts be the day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> which appears partly because the Latine Text hath <hi>the day of our Lord,</hi> which shewes there have

For if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated thus, <hi>Every ones works shall be apparent, because the day of tryal will be revealed in fire, a fit instrument of bringing them to the truth,</hi> the discourse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds fair and smoothly. But if it be brought to this, <hi>Every ones work shall appear, for Day, that is, length of time will clear the truth, because the work shall be reveal'd in fire, and the fire shall try every ones work of what kind it is:</hi> the discourse is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obscure, interrupted and with unnecessary repetition. Finally can the distribution of rewards and sufferings be more properly refer'd to any other <hi>day</hi> then the Day of Judgment? Or is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at least by <hi>fire</hi> given in any other?<note place="margin">Though S. Augustine sometimes otherwise extounds.</note>

of this world. But if I deceive not my self, from the literal, he falls to the moral sense, a thing not unusual to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For if the Text be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood primarily of temporal affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it is too obscure and allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical; first, to call tribulation, the day of our Lord is an unusual phrase, and though sometimes in the Prophets it may be so taken, yet that is only when the glory and majesty of God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Justice in reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedness is described. Next, this part of the Text, <hi>because it shall be revealed in fire,</hi> must be understood of the works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. <hi>And of what quality eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones work is, the fire shall try,</hi> becomes a meere tautology: and moreover there begins a new alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of fire, without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle determining it. And again what signifies this, <hi>He shall receive reward?</hi> That is properly called the reward which is given in the

end of the day, or accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole work, not in every part or moment thereof, as particular tribulations are to be accounted. In like manner, <hi>if any ones work burn, he shall suffer damage,</hi> what can it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? That the pleasures which inveigled his affections are now taken away? They were not his workes but the matter upon and about which he did work. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>he shall suffer damage,</hi> must signifie, he will be troubled or sorrowful; but that the rather by impotency, to sin a new, and freshly, then to be amended. Lastly, <hi>He shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</hi> Shall regret and sorrow for the loss of things temporal save him? Or the loss it self by means of that sorrow? It must be then understood that this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation must conect and reform him, which though sometime it happens, yet not alwayes, or indeed for the most part, which nevertheless is requisite to make

therein they fail; for whatever venial stains the departed soul had contracted, those they absolutely declare to be by a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to God, in the very first instant, cancelled. <hi>Purgatory</hi> therefore according to them doth not <hi>remit,</hi> but <hi>chastise</hi> sins; and consequently they have no right to alledg this place, since remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins there is none accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if the affections to sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after death, and in the day of Judgment are rectifi'd, 'tis evident, there must be a remission of sins in the next world. And thus by the whole series of this discourse it is made appear, that no one text of holy writ is or can be urged for <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which by some circumstance or other, does not at the same time prove, that it is no otherwise a part of <hi>Christian</hi> belief, then as we have already explicated.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>IT is now time to take the votes of antiquity, and observe whether the suffrages of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers are more numerous and propitious to our adversaries or us. And first, let us interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate those, who by application of holy Writ, rather then by their own proper motion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, declare this Purgation to be made in the day of Judgment. S. <hi>Basil,</hi> Ch. 15. on <hi>Esay,</hi> calls the baptisme of fire that probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is made in the day of Judgment. S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> upon the third of <hi>Matthem,</hi> saith, <hi>In</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53895:39"/>
               <hi>this world we are baptized with the spirit, in the future with fire; the Apostle also giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing testimony, that of what sort every ones works are, the fire shall try. Theodoret, Ephrem</hi> and <hi>Rufinus</hi> explicate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Malachy,</hi> wherein <hi>Christ</hi> is said to purge the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> of the last judgment. S. <hi>Augustine, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>de Civit. Dei,</hi> conjoynes the place of <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> and applies them both to the same day; and <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>c.</hi> 24. <hi>de Civ. Dei,</hi> he in like manner expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the passage of the fifteenth of <hi>Genesis,</hi> of the smoaking fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and flashes of fire passing through the midst of the divided carcases to be the fire of the last day, <hi>which shall discriminate the carnal persons who are to be saved by fire, from the carnal ones to be damned in fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we may thus argue. The Fathers interpret those places of holy Writ
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53895:39"/>
which speak clearly of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of sins, and that by fire to be meant of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore they teach that the purging of souls from their sins by fire, is performed in that day, and consequently that that is the Purgatory fire. Whoever then confesses and acknowledges the purgation of souls in the day of Judgment by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration, defends <hi>Purgatory</hi> in the sense of the Holy Fathers, nor can any thing from their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be alledged for the cessation of, or exemption from <hi>Purgatory</hi> before that day, when they teach that souls are purged by fire.</p>
            <p>And hence also are they easily silenc'd, who cry out that such like Testimonies are to be understood of some few remaining alive to the very last hour. For the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> waving those passages which speak so in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral termes, will find it no small difficulty to make a Father or two speak out for them,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53895:40"/>
and so the whole extrinsecal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority fit to maintain <hi>Purgatory</hi> will be lost, both the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves (as hath been shewn) being a verse to that conceit, and absolutely respecting the day of Judgment, and the holy <hi>Fathers</hi> refusing to own it. Besides most of the Patrons of this interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial fire conceive that all men shall be dead before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so that the same flames may serve to expiate them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of those of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration and Judgment; and whatever is otherwise affirmed by them, clearly is not a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their Doctrine, but an invention to elude the evidence of the Fathers. Let as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispel this mist also with the clear attestation of such of them as speak plainly and positively in the case.</p>

            <p>St. <hi>Denys</hi> of <hi>Areopagus</hi> shall usher them in, who tells us that those <hi>Psalms</hi> were wont to be sung for the <hi>Dead</hi> which make mention of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> as also such lessons as contain the promises thereof. And speaking of the secure estate of good men departing, he saith, they perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand that all will go well with them in the life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, through their total resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. From whence it is evident that the hope which they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally had for the dead, and which was therefore fit to be expressed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53895:41"/>
in the Office for the dead, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the resurrection for its effect, and this in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> is yet more clear in his third Homily on the 36. <hi>Psalm. As I conceive,</hi> saith he, <hi>we must all be brought to that fire</hi> (it went a little before which is prepared for sinners) <hi>though he be a</hi> Peter <hi>or a</hi> Paul, <hi>he must come to that fire; but such as they shall hear it said, though you pass through it, the flame shall not burn you. But when such a sinner as my self shall come to the fire as</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>did, he shall not pass through it as</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>did.</hi> In the end of the eighth book of his Commentaries on the Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> he saith, <hi>But he, who neglects to be purged by the word of God and Evangelical Doctrines, is reserv'd for sad and penal purifications, that the flames of Hell may cleanse him, whom the Apostolical Doctrine and Evangelical speeches could not.</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53895:41"/>
And in his thirteenth Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily upon <hi>Jeremy; But if any one be saved in the second resurrection, he is a sinner who needs the baptisme of fire, who by burning is purged, that the fire may consume whatever he had of wood, hay, or stubble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but foresee that my adversaries will except against <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi> because he is thought to have exempted all men from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal punishments. But their excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are unjust. For what do they aime at? Because elsewhere he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the truth, must he be thought never to have defendedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? Because in some one thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from others, must he not be heard in those things wherein he agrees with others? If this be so, let him deserve no place or credit in antiquity, and let them likewise be deny'd any use or advantage by him.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Origen</hi> hath in this particular, the rest of the Fathers not only for his applauders but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so followers, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53895:42"/>
sufficient witness, who in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Psalms</hi> is esteemed to have borrowed this sentence from Origen. <hi>Thou hast exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined us with fire,</hi> Saith David; <hi>we shall all therefore be examined with fire,âWith fire therefore shall the sons of</hi> Levi <hi>be purged, with fire</hi> Ezckel, <hi>with fire</hi> Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Though our Lord save his servants, we shall indeed be saved through faith, but so as by fire; if we are not consumed, we shall at least be burnt. How some remain in the fire, others passe through it, the Divine Scripture tells us.</hi> And on the 118. <hi>Psalm. This Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme shall be after the consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, the Angels being sent to segregate the good from the evil, when iniquity shall be burnt up by the furnace of fire, that the just may shine as the Sun in the Kingdome of God.

no sin whatever can be remitted before the resurrection? The same hath S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 32.

For if you substract those testimonies of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which either expresly speak of the day of Judgment, or in such general terms, that it is evident they ought to be applyed to it, by consent, and in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the rest, you must from them expect no authority at all for the establishing of<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

            <p>After S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> let S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> himself be heard, a person beyond exception, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the opinion it self.

that <hi>England</hi> embraced it upon the credit of a miracle wrought on a certain soldier, whose chains fell off, when <hi>Masse</hi> was said for him, as supposed <hi>dead.</hi> We may therefore conclude that this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be accounted new, and no wayes comparable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of purgation of souls in the day of Judgment, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it self to all <hi>Christian</hi> times and regions.</p>

Whence it is evident, that axiome takes place only in this life, the reward of which we expect in the future; and we grant, that the sins, which escape in this, are to be expiated in the other world, but by such punishments as naturally spring from the sins themselves, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of <hi>Beatitude</hi> till the day of Judgement, and the dissention and intestine warre of <hi>Appetites,</hi> which in our <hi>Theological Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are declared.</p>

For how? did he suffer it willingly or against his will? If against his will, he was not omnipotent, who had a desire to hinder it, but could not. If willingly, it was no injury. Besides the Phylosopher denies <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> to have place betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> betwixt <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Servant;</hi> but where no <hi>justice</hi> is, there can be no <hi>injustice.</hi> But of this more in our <note n="*" place="margin">Tom. 1. lib. 1. lect. 5</note>

            </p>
            <p>Let us consider the other part of the charge. We have deprived God of some measure of extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal good or honour due to him. Let us, I say, examine attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:53895:60"/>
what this means. Doth our<note place="margin">The dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of Gods hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, what it signifies.</note> adversary really think God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes not now so much honour, as he would have done if <hi>Peter</hi> had not sinned? Or only that from <hi>Peter</hi> himself he receives not so much, though perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, or by some other means, he had as much, or more? If the latter, I cannot perceive any diminution on Gods part, since he hath thereby as much or more honour, then if <hi>Peter</hi> had not sinned. For the honour of God consists in this, that his work, that is, the universal fabrick, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its ultimate perfection: So that, if that become more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by occasion of <hi>Peters</hi> sin<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> then otherwise it had been, more honour redounds to God from <hi>Peters</hi> sinning, then from his wel-doing, and this from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himselfe. But if the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, by this sin of <hi>Peter,</hi> be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to become lesse perfect, it cannot be understood that God should do better in permitting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53895:61"/>
then impeding his sin, the lawes of wisdome absolutely obliging him thereto<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
            </p>
            <p>But if the intent of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be, that <hi>Peter,</hi> not <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> but as much only as in him lay, did derogate from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>honour,</hi> then is there no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of <hi>restitution,</hi> where, though there wanted not <hi>will,</hi> yet it took no effect. You will urge, that though in truth and rigour, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> took away no honour from God, yet did he not effectually pay that honour to God which was due, and consequently, by reserving it to himself, did in some sort deprive him of it. I answer,<note place="margin">The true ground of well doing.</note> that properly speaking, a sinner hath no other obligation then to live well, and that, because an evil life of its own nature, leads him to eternal misery; other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are <hi>metaphorical.</hi> But to continue the metaphor howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if it were true that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Gods honour occasioned by <hi>Peter,</hi> were supply'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payr'd

by some other, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would carry some shadow of strength. But now that God from <hi>Peter</hi> himself, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar punishments in this world, or such as spring from the sin it self in the next, or by drawing <hi>Peter,</hi> by means of the said sin, to do for him greater things, hath made himself amends, it can no wayes be thought that <hi>Peter</hi> is still tyed to restitution of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or that God was injur'd by him, or can inflict any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, upon the accompt of loss of honour.

               <p>Two other exceptions, from the supposition of these pains to be unvoluntary and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUr next consideration must be, whether pure <hi>spirits</hi> are truly capable of such <hi>pains,</hi> as they stand committed to <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> there to undergo. For if they really be found incapable thereof, all this intermedial <hi>fire</hi> vanishes instantly into <hi>smoak.</hi> Let us therefore examine what <hi>pains</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies<note place="margin">Of Pain, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to us here immers'd in our <hi>bodies,</hi> and we shall presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the notion of <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> differs herein from that of <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>torment,</hi> that it does not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53895:62"/>
necessarily include <hi>griefe,</hi> as <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> do. For we proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, account it <hi>punishment,</hi> if any one for his offence-be taken away by the hand of Justice, though <hi>sleeping</hi> or <hi>insensible</hi> of pain: But properly <hi>pain,</hi> at least according to the <hi>Latine</hi> accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, imports some <hi>dolorous</hi> punishment inflicted on us against our wills, in which <hi>torment</hi> agrees with it, though it differ from both in regard of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,</hi> or the hand of the infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. For whatsoever griefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us against our wills, though it proceed not from our merit, or the infliction of another, but from nature or accident, is still a <hi>torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the native and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine differences of the <hi>words,</hi> though they are oft by negligence confounded, as in this occasion we may perceive. For the nature of that <hi>pain</hi> which here we search af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath no respect <g ref="char:punc">âª</g>to <hi>merit,</hi> but consists of these two notions, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53895:63"/>
it is <hi>dolorous,</hi> and inflicted from an <hi>external</hi> Agent, on a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and <hi>unwilling</hi> sufferer. And from <hi>torment</hi> it either differs not at all, or only in this; that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an <hi>extrinsecal</hi> Agent, whereas <hi>torment</hi> may take its rise from <hi>within</hi> us. Contemplating then this sort of pains, we find that by how much weaker and more obnoxious to griefe the minds of those that suffer them are, the higher and more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they become. Not only History, but our own memory assures us, that some have expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the defence of secrets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, without consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reveal them; others endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Gout,</hi> the <hi>Stone,</hi> the twisting of the gutts, without a sigh. And Philosophy teaches us, that <hi>grief</hi> is heighten'd by thinking on it; the sharpest tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if there be constancy and manliness enough to employ the spirits upon other objects, either vanishing or decreasing. So that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53895:63"/>
               <hi>pain,</hi> that is, such an action as is<note place="margin">No extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent can annoy us, but by our body.</note> apt to produce <hi>griefe</hi> in us, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise obtains that effect, then by our unableness to busy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the spirits elsewhere. From the body then, and the course of its spirits, it is that an extrinsecal Agent gets power to annoy us. So that deliver but the soul from the body, and you have secur'd it from outward passion; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the spirits of the departed, which are to be purged, are clearly exempt from all such pain as may be caused by any outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            <p>Again let us inform our selves even of these very men, who are the maintainers of this opinion, whether the <hi>Will</hi> can, by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be <hi>drawn</hi> to consent? they perfectly disclaim it, firmly build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this fair ground, that, since the will of its own nature, is a will, or spontaneous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no act thereof can be but<note place="margin">Every act of will must needs be voluntary.</note> voluntary. We subsume; But in pure spirits <hi>griefe</hi> or <hi>pain</hi> is an
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53895:64"/>
act of the <hi>Will,</hi> therefore all the <hi>suffering</hi> of abstract'd spirits is <hi>voluntary,</hi> and consequently not from <hi>without,</hi> seizing upon them <hi>against</hi> their wills, as they use to imagine.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>pain</hi> of souls that are purged, is either <hi>rational,</hi> and flowing from the understanding, by connexion of discourse, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding to our syllogistical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; or a pure <hi>affection</hi> of the Will, by some other means instil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. If the <hi>first,</hi> it is genuine, and the same which we assert, there being a plenary knowledg in a separated soul, and its nature requiring, that it's motion follow the understanding. If you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>second;</hi> first, you defend an <hi>impossibility,</hi> because the <hi>Will</hi> clearly includes the <hi>understanding,</hi> and <hi>volition,</hi> or an act of <hi>Will,</hi> an act of <hi>understanding,</hi> either formally, or at least by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the entity of the soul being one, that is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in her self both the said pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53895:64"/>
it is manifest there cannot be in the soul an act of the <hi>Will,</hi> without a preceding act of the <hi>understanding,</hi> into which it is, as it were ingrafted, and without which it cannot be understood. We have therefore evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>pains,</hi> extrinsecally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and not as it were, spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously springing from within, cannot reach spirits, devested of their bodies.</p>
            <p>Our third exception against them is, that they affirm these purging pains to be inflicted by <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>corporeal</hi> instruments, which is a fiction vain and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<note place="margin">Corporeal Action, that is, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation cannot reach indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> impossible. For all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal action requiring space, can by no means be exercised on an indivisible subject. Again, the quality of a <hi>Body</hi> extends not it self beyond its own subject, whence no corporeal action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without a sallying forth of parts, which touch and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themselves into some other body, which how it can be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53895:65"/>
to spiritual substances, is above humane capacity. Further, the action of <hi>bodies</hi> is performed by <hi>division;</hi> and involves <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Condensation,</hi> from which the very Patrons of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion we reject exempt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge<note place="margin">No, not Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</note> pure spirits. Nor is it any thing to the purpose, to cry out that the <hi>corporeal</hi> action which they require is only <hi>instrumental;</hi> for all that endeavour to speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly, make that to be the <hi>instrumental</hi> action, which is the <hi>principal</hi> action of the <hi>instrument</hi> abstracted from the principal <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> which being directed by the principal Agent, or by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of its action, changed, acts otherwise then naturally it would have done.

if an <hi>indivisible duration</hi> be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed it, equal to any part of time, the very supposition it self constitutes it of a superiour and more noble order, and exalts it above the reach of all or any <hi>time</hi> assignable.

               <hi>Philosophy</hi> is demonstrated.

            </argument>
            <p>BUt because the Philosopher hath instructed us that for the utter eradication of any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, it is necessary we should retrive the causes of it, that is, whence, and by what steps the assertors were led into its snare, we must not desist our pursuit till
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53895:71"/>
we have obey'd his commands. In order whereunto, let us first reflect, that <hi>God,</hi> in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his World not as a Prince but as a perfect Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect.</note> of humane things, may be considered either as a <hi>Monarch,</hi> with precepts and punishments ruling his people, or as an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer</hi> or expert <hi>Engineer,</hi> so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving every part and movement of his machin, that of it self it may perform and attain the end for which he designed it. The first way, though one of the most eminent within our ken, yet by reason of the imperfection of the subject (the weakest of all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual substances) <hi>Man,</hi> whose providence is short-sighted, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so weak and imperfect. For Princes, amongst men ordain such rewards, both for well and ill deserves of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as of their own nature, have no relation to the quality of merit or demerit, but are meerly connected with their <hi>Wills</hi> and commands, and which they are forced to execute with their own,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53895:72"/>
that is, their ministers strength. And besides, commands of that nature suppose, in the subject, an ignorance of his Prince's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and an acceptation of what is to be done or suffered by him, from the sole motive of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders power.</p>
            <p>The latter proclaims the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable wisdome of that <hi>Architect,</hi> who could so artificially frame at once his work, that it should of it self, perform all operations without supplement, or future mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute alterations in any of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or organs. His fabrick is in all respects compleat, rewards and punishments therein being not only conformable to, but also originiz'd from their merits; the precepts which are given, are directed to the promoting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and increase of science, and are accepted through a sight and knowledg of their causes and uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>Evident therefore it is, that, however the first way, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves

the truth in <hi>Allegory,</hi> may be more adopted to those under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, which being but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately enamour'd of truth, bend not their whole strengths to obtain it; yet the latter is both necessary, and much more satisfactory to those, who rending the <hi>parabolical</hi> veyl, fix their contemplations on the naked discovery of the thing, as it is in it self. For they easily perceive, that God being the Author of Nature, which flows from him as from its proper cause, must contradict himself if he act any thing against it, and guide not every thing according to its own nature, especially men to <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> But it is clear, that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary assign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What then can be more evident than
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53895:77"/>
that punishment remains due after the sin is cancell'd? So that it may well be concluded, that <hi>mortal</hi> sins, though remitted, still challenge their reward in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi> and <hi>venial</hi> ones, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, are there, by those grudging flames, to be <hi>expiated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, Almost in all things which fall under our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">How sins are said to be remitted.</note> we are forced to distinguish, in the same propositions, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing predicated sometimes <hi>simply,</hi> sometimes <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or according to some one respect or notion. And so in our present case; treating of the remission of sins, we must acknowledg an <hi>absolute</hi> and a <hi>respective</hi> remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which I shall presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to explicate. If first I be permitted to admonish the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a danger he may easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur of being drawn into errour by the manner of our conceptions or apprehensions of things. For, experiencing in our selves that we then properly forgive an injury,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53895:77"/>
when our exasp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rated minds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from their commotion to an even and calme temper, we are apt to expect the same should happen in the remission of our sins in Gods part: Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding is quite otherwise. For since there neither is, nor possibly can be any temporary or indeed any relation at all in <hi>God</hi> to his creatures; 'tis evident, that as well all relation, as all change, to which relation is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, is on the creature's side<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> A <hi>sin</hi> therefore to be or to have been <hi>remitted,</hi> signifies nothing else then that the <hi>sinner</hi> himself is or was <hi>converted.</hi> From which animadversion we may easily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our selves against the errour into which many are un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53895:78"/>
But if we look upon this remission as made on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures side, then by how much, and, by what degrees the soul is <hi>perfected</hi> and <hi>corrected,</hi> as to the object of <hi>sin,</hi> by so much and by the self-same degrees will the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of the sin be wrought.</p>
            <p>And since we have already<note place="margin">Simply and respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> said, that the remission of sin is twofold, <hi>simple,</hi> and according to <hi>some respect;</hi> it followes evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if <hi>sin</hi> be destroy'd, as to that wherein its <hi>essence</hi> consists, it is to be termed <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> destroy'd. But if it be only destroy'd as to <hi>certain things</hi> which are <hi>accidental</hi> to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>sin,</hi> we must say, that it is in <hi>some respects</hi> remitted, but <hi>simply</hi> remaines; and contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it may perhaps remain in <hi>some regards,</hi> though <hi>simply</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd;<note place="margin">What sin prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

a created good, as is apt to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the ultimate end of that man; so that during that affection he cannot have a will to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish it, or esteem himselfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if deprived of it for ever. All other <hi>affections</hi> towards the said <hi>good,</hi> are not properly sin; as for example, the <hi>habitual</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to desire it for it self, and the <hi>conditional</hi> appetency by which we should be actually carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards it, unless it deprived us of our <hi>Beatitude;</hi> and whatever other way a thing may be said to be a sin.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53895:79"/>
a new equivocation springs, which darkens the subject we have in hand, unless we steadily fix our eye on the several senses which overshadow one the other.

But it is apparent, that upon every actual, internal, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sin, an eternal privation of the <hi>Beatifical Vision</hi> must of its own nature ensue, together with those griefs, which spring either from the loss or impotence

is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>lucidated, and the seeming contrariety opens it self into a faire distinction. For when God professes, that <hi>in whatsoever hour the sinner shall repent of his wickedness, in the self same he will remit and pardon him,</hi> it is spoken of the <hi>internal</hi> sin, and its proper punishments. For the <hi>Church</hi> acknowledges<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that a <hi>perfect</hi> act of true <hi>contrition</hi> quits the scores of <hi>punishment</hi> as well as <hi>guilt;</hi> I mean, if it arrive at that degree, that, as <hi>demonstration</hi> chaseth away at once all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and staggering incertitude, so the firmness of its <hi>resolutions</hi> cuts off all manner of <hi>tendency</hi> towards the formerly beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Such seemes to have beene that noble one of holy St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> who after that sharpe and violent conflict of the <hi>Flesh</hi> against the <hi>Spirit,</hi> was suddenly translated into so perfect a quiet of mind, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he felt no attempts upon the superiour part of his soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:53895:81"/>But if the resolution be not so strong and generous, but that new assaults of temptations shake it, and though they cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, yet make the soul, as it were, to reel or stagger, as most commonly it happens; then is the sin <hi>simply</hi> remitted, but <hi>in part</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and in <hi>this</hi> world it is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by evils following this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of mind, either <hi>sins</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,</hi> or whatsoever other <hi>griefs</hi> proceeding from them; but in the <hi>future,</hi> by the fruit &amp; offspring of those evils, till in the last <hi>Judgment</hi> day, that <hi>tepidness,</hi> and, as it were, <hi>rust,</hi> with which the soul by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of that sin was infected, be <hi>burnt</hi> off.

that the <hi>stiffness of neck,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> so oft exprobrated and complained of, continued in that people, till their utter extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that (as <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord assures us) all the just blood spilt through the world was punished in that last generation.</p>

Lastly, from the same principles it appears, why for the most part the sins of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons cease in the <hi>third</hi> or <hi>fourth Generation;</hi> to wit, because their memory and imitation is, for the most part, lost; the respect of kindred growing weak, and the permixion of forreign blood, in the several Mothers, rarely suffering the great Grand-fathers blood to boyl with any notable vigour in the veins of his Great-grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.</p>

Judgment, and lastly, that this is <hi>evident.</hi> But this <hi>evidence</hi> makes rather against our <hi>Adversaries.</hi> For, since, in the very next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but one, he affirms, that it may be true, and that he is not satisfi'd <hi>whether their spirits are purged both here and there, or only there; or here only, that they may not be purged there;</hi> it is manifest, that his evidence falls only upon this, that their souls are somewhere purged, and not to be delivered over to eternal chastisements; and that for all the rest S. <hi>Augustin</hi> was uncertain, save only that in the day of Judgment at least they were to be purged, which assurance of his we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove made good.

The difference betwixt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53895:96"/>
the two explications is this: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Saint's meaning to be no other, then that such souls are purged by pains preceding the day of Judgment, and finished ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or in that very day; but the Adversaries will necessarily have the purgation ended before the day of Judgment. But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors incertitude thereof both in <hi>this</hi> book, as also in his book to <hi>Dulcitius,</hi> and in the 69 <hi rend="sup">â¢â¢</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> and his constant perswasion that sins are purged in the day of Judgment, compel the reception of our expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and convince any unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd Judgment.</p>

            <p>The second thing, which in<note place="margin">That the former are not attested by any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> these <hi>Visions</hi> may be observed, is, they are not armed with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick testimonials of <hi>Events</hi> and <hi>Miracles.</hi> For all that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be seen, being acted by <hi>invisible</hi> substances, no event can confirm the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>vision,</hi> nor is it proper any <hi>miracle</hi> should be wrought to that end: Nor for the most part is there any occasion of demanding them, or any custome in history of alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.

of trees, or stones, or other things, which striking, in a fit line, my eye, would perswade me that things were otherwise then in tuth they are, unless ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience did undeceive me. But all this is so notorious to every one, that no man of common sense will oppose it.</p>

               </note> that these deluding <hi>apparences</hi> are oftentimes more <hi>lively</hi> and penetrating than the <hi>impressions</hi> themselves which are caus'd by our <hi>senses.</hi> When I was yet a child, and had the small pox, I imagin'd I saw little birds pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up crums about my bed, so distinct and strongly, that to this very day their shapes and colours are fresh in my memory.

showes, that, many dayes after her frenzy had totally left her, she did conjure me to tell her, truly whether it were so or not. I was present at another time, when a youth of fourteen years of age at least, waking out of his sleep, had so fixt an imagination of a boy in white garments stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him, that notwithstanding the light which I brought in, and the presence of several of his companions who lodg'd in the same chamber and all spoke to him, he continued to sweat and fear, unable, through the fright, to close his eyes again.

Now it is evident, that, by sleep, the gates are lock'd against this busie troop without; so that if any one thing chance to slip in, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd, it strikes the Organ with a great force, totally filling and possessing it, and immerging it self in it.</p>

is the <hi>sphere</hi> of their activity, and the <hi>instrument</hi> by which they move other things, and they were <hi>Angels,</hi> if they could work upon separated bodies.

            <p>The other example is of the <hi>Monk.</hi> He declares that <q>it were well with him, he had now received the Communion, though<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

formally tormented in fire.</q> It seems he was restored to the <hi>Church</hi> not to <hi>Heaven.</hi> But if his sin were <hi>absolved,</hi> why was he deny'd <hi>Heaven,</hi> according to our modern definitions? Again, why was he not admitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Communion</hi> after the <hi>first,</hi> as well as after the <hi>thirteenth</hi> mass?

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the remission of sins after <hi>thirty</hi> dayes is neither agreeable to the <hi>ancient</hi> nor <hi>modern</hi> stile, this supposing it to be in the <hi>first</hi> moment, that in the day of the last Judgment. Finally what an uncouth thing is an <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> reaching to the next world? would they have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that those, who dy'd in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sin, were snatch'd out of the jawes of Hell?

            <p>There is but one little sentence<note place="margin">And V.

<pb facs="tcp:53895:108"/>
joyntly seem to pronounce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>sin,</hi> debars and secludes abstracted souls from the <hi>Beatifical Vision.</hi> The same may be said of all other <hi>Revelations;</hi> for if they are not meerly frivolous and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, they commonly in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or other shock the purity of Ecclesiastical Doctrine. Some of them will tell you of souls kept in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for the payment of <hi>debts</hi> among the living; others that a prefixed time was set them for begging and procuring assistance. The great <hi>Odilo,</hi> and strong asserter of this opinion, is said, by his own and the prayers of his <hi>Monks,</hi> to have freed <hi>Benedict</hi> the eighth out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a second alms should be given by his successor <hi>John,</hi> because the first was out of treasure ill gotten. What can we make of this? Are the prayers of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> men frustrated, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual if their Alms come out of an <hi>Usurers</hi> purse? 'tis very hard to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53895:109"/>
oblige them to search into and discover this, unless perhaps it want not its convenience, if they be, in like manner, permitted to retain the first, and demand the second benevolence in case it be found to be so.</p>
            <p>But to speak ingenuously, all this passage is inextricable. For what shall we say? That the <hi>rich</hi> man shall in three <hi>dayes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which must cost the <hi>poor</hi> as many <hi>years.</hi> Without doubt a convenient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for accumulating riches; but such a one as I have not yet met with in all the Gospel, or Christian directions. And yet what else do they seem to regard, who make it either only care and business to accompany the <hi>Dead</hi> with a multittude of <hi>Masses?</hi> some such conceits as these the <hi>Schools</hi> have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exibitated, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have disappear'd in all succeeding <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that you may see they

I have observed, in the narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some holy women, no small agreement between the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their <hi>Phantasy,</hi> and the wonders which are said to have past within their brests.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53895:115"/>
we pray not, as little need we be sollicitous. Let prayers, let good works from henceforth cease. Why so? Because all things are accomplished by vertue of their being so decreed. This they confess; but they will not have us pray for those things which we are certain will come to pass. We are still where we were. For how ignorant soever we are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what we ask be predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or no, yet are we satisfi'd, that unless it be predestinated, we shall not obtain it. We know then, that only which is prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated shall come to pass; and consequently it alone is worth our asking. So that the Apostle doth not vainly exhort us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, <hi>by good works, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Vocation and election cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> that is, to take care to put<note place="margin">By shewing that the means are predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well as the end.</note> it in execution. The errour then of the <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Arguer</hi> consisted herein, that he so look'd upon the <hi>effect</hi> as <hi>predestinated,</hi> that he saw not its <hi>cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> or the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53895:116"/>
               <hi>means,</hi> by which it should come to pass, were also predestinated. So that, pure Inadvertency begat this objection.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may have<note place="margin">In what manner and sense our Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit the dead in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> an easie step to the other part of the Argument. For when they urge, that nothing ensues upon the account of their prayers for the Dead, we reply, <hi>all</hi> depends upon them. For if their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from their pains, whensoever it happens, be a requital of their supplications, and that delivery be nothing else then the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of glory and celestial joyes, all this, is, in the day of Judgment, granted to <hi>their</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. What then? shall they have any thing more then what their pious conversation in this life promerited? Not at all. Behold the Riddle. A great Lord saith to his <hi>servant,</hi> behave thy self faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in my house seven years, and at the marriage of my <hi>son,</hi> I will make thee <hi>steward</hi> of his family. The servant dischargeth his duty;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53895:116"/>
is he therefore <hi>Comptroler</hi> of his young Lord's house? No, unless his Master be first married He then that shall procure a <hi>Match</hi> for the young <hi>Gallant</hi> shall do a good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the old servant, and deserve great thanks at his hands. So he that is chastised in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> did in his life deserve to receive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that <hi>Christ</hi> should come he did not deserve<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> For that, as it is an <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal</hi> good, so is it due to the merits and supplications of all, and not of any one Particular.</p>
            <p>For this reason it was answered to the <hi>souls of the slain, resting under the Altar, and crying out to have that day hasten'd,</hi> that it depended upon the rest who had not yet suffered, but were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the number. Whosoever then desires and loves the coming of our Lord, either for his own sake or any others<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> as every one does who prayes for the retribution of the dead, accelerates that day. And thus you see, that the time, which
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53895:117"/>
was said to be predestinated, will notwithstanding never arrive till the number of the <hi>elect</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. From whence it follows, that whatsoever is predestinated, so obtains the stability of it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable <hi>arrest</hi> (the liberty and contingency of second causes, by which it is brought about, not impeding) that if any one of them should fail, that very thing, which we term predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, could not come to pass. And applying this assertion to our present purpose, if Prayer should not be made for the Dead, they would never be deliver'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the irresistible force of predestination, through the imbecillity of causes by which their delivery is promoted. He that prayes then supplies what was wanting to the sufferings of the departed, without which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement they could not be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>They reply, this supposed, it<note place="margin">And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</note> is all one to this particular friend
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53895:117"/>
departed, whether fewer or more prayers are said for him, since the last day will break assoon to one as to another. It is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they cannot deny, but at least he who is the occasion that more prayers are offered to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hath, as it were, a greater right to that day then he for whom fewer are offered. Whence to him it will arrive more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honourable, then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who less contributed to its advance. But besides, these pious offices and affections of others towards him, being known by the person departed whom they concern, beget a disposition in his soul, by which, when time shall serve, his love to God, and consequently, his <hi>Beatitude</hi> shall be encreased. Moreover<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> by way of impetration, they become oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to the Divine Providence, of so disposing many things, which otherwise would be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ordered, that in the day of <hi>Harvest,</hi> they may inlarge
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53895:118"/>
his either essential or accidental happiness. If any thing of this happens through the good deeds of the person himself departed, it is to be accounted amongst his merits, or the rewards due to his merits; but if such prayers spring not from any root which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did, whilst living, plant, but purely from the charity of some propitious persons, they are an effect of God's <hi>Providence,</hi> whose mercies are numberless.</p>
            <p>One objection only remains<note place="margin">That it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fancy they may have who pray for the dead, as to the relief given thereby.</note> unanswer'd, That this is not the thing which those who pray and are solicitous for their dead, do look for. But neither ought we regard what they expect, but what they ought to expect.

what can they signifie but the<note place="margin">Which una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously respect the day of Judgment.</note>

            </p>
            <p>I easily foresee it may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that the <hi>Dead</hi> have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity no incertitude or hazard even in that <hi>Day,</hi> wherefore these <hi>Prayers</hi> must on both sides be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have their impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties. My answer is twofold. First, in our way, we coyn not a new <hi>Metaphor,</hi> but prosecute that which Christ and Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have furnished us with. For if they have styled it a <hi>Judgment,</hi> not in order to an <hi>investigation</hi> or <hi>disquisition</hi> of things doubtful (for what can be obscure when God himself is judg?) but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53895:122"/>
to signifiy the effect of the said <hi>Judgment,</hi> that is the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive destribution of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments</hi> to good and bad, which then is made, is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Ecclesiastical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech (that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the sacred and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary expressions) must speak as it were of a dubious sentence, whilst there is yet an affection to, or expectation of punishment, or reward? These speeches then sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie just the same, as if the Church should plainly say, <hi>suffer them not to be cast into Hell, but grant them eternal happiness.</hi> And so is that particle also to be understood, of <hi>passing from Death, of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though there be also another way, in which the souls in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> when they become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the <hi>Beatifical Vision,</hi> may not improperly, be said to <hi>pass</hi> from <hi>Death</hi> to <hi>Life:</hi> For those souls, having (according to what hath been explicated) an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in themselves, debarring them
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53895:122"/>
from true <hi>life,</hi> which is perfect <hi>Beatitude,</hi> clearly, if death be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to life, they are truely said to pass from <hi>death</hi> to <hi>life,</hi> when they are freed from their <hi>sins</hi> and that <hi>impediment.</hi> I am not ignorant, that <hi>Divines,</hi> taking it from the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> suppose in these souls a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Beatitude,</hi> by which they are rendred partakers of <hi>life.</hi> But these <hi>expressions</hi> abuse us, when besides an <hi>allegory</hi> we expect <hi>propriety</hi> in them. Nor indeed doth right <hi>to</hi> a thing make a man owner of it, but right <hi>in</hi> the thing; and in reality those holy souls have not <hi>right</hi> to <hi>life,</hi> but <hi>seeds</hi> of it, to wit, the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> which works by <hi>charity,</hi> and which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly will (through the last judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>fructifie</hi> to life eternal. As then <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>My second answer is, that, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this kind are altogether <hi>inexplicable,</hi> according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, which is a certain note that they mistake the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> sense.

a limited time, let us suppose ten years (as a <hi>Divine</hi> famous enough hath opined,) the <hi>Church</hi> ought in reason to prescribe a cessation from thenceforward, of duties for that soul, that others may be benefited by what to it is now superfluous.

indeed on our side, from motives both of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>antiquity,</hi> which ever prayed for all without exception.</p>

the account due to those sins in the sight of God, and put him in the same condition, as if he had actually performed the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselves. And S. <hi>Paul</hi>

            <p>To this purpose the Apostle; wherein he unfolds to us the whole business of <hi>Indulgences;</hi> That their matter is that <gap reason="foreign">

two causes of <hi>remission,</hi> the first, the incapacity of the subject's bearing such <hi>Rigours,</hi> who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would be swallowed up by <hi>grief;</hi> the second, the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> lest the Devil by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of too great severity, or the like, should provoke or stir up some to murmur and make a <hi>schism.</hi> So that two things in the infliction and moderation of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> chastisements are to be regarded, the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But the Apostle explicates moreover the <hi>efficient</hi> cause, which he makes to be three-fold; the <hi>Church, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> us a Prelate of the Church, and <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord. For he saith, that what he indulged he indulged in the person of <hi>Christ.</hi> Had he spoken only of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>himself,</hi> it would have pass'd for a <hi>Rule,</hi> that as the <hi>Church</hi> knoweth not the interiour things, so neither doth she judg of them, or pretend to remit them.

the person of <hi>Christ,</hi> he seems to extend it to all that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord doth or may remit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to infer, that the sinner is no longer, as to that particular, obnoxious to the Judgment of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the fathers seem to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;<note place="margin">And some passages in the Fathers.</note> both universally, in as much as they apply to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discipline that famous speech of Christ, that <hi>sins are remitted or retain'd in Heaven</hi> proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the <hi>severity</hi> or <hi>mildness</hi> of <hi>Apostolical</hi> proceedings upon <hi>earth.</hi> And particularly, S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> who affirms, that <hi>Penitents</hi> may be aided before God, in the abolition of their sins, by the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation and prerogative of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Yea <hi>Celerinus,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Lucius,</hi> beseeches those who were designed for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which of them soever should first be crown'd, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the sin of two women who had deny'd their Faith.

Father more <hi>merit</hi> then all the <hi>sins</hi> that ever shall be perpetrated can require; nor indeed could he possibly do otherwise, every least merit of his being perfectly <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi> So that Christ's <hi>merits</hi> must absolutely be taken out of the scales, if there must be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality and exactness of <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative</hi> Justice. For it is simply impossible, even in respect of God's absolute power, that so little should be offered to God of <hi>Christ</hi>'s merits, as not infinitely to overweigh all that enters the ballance with them.

            <p>And if our discourse have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been rightly pois'd, we can no longer doubt of the two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which ballance sinks down with it's gravity, which flyes up with its levity. For first, whereas<note place="margin">Of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.</note> they put <hi>Ecclesiastical penalties</hi> to be such as <hi>equalize</hi> the <hi>crime,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:53895:135"/>
that may be understood two wayes. The first, that they should equalize the <hi>pains</hi> due in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which if it were in it self true, what messenger could assure them of it? For S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> bears us witness, that the <hi>Revelations</hi> which discover'd the state of souls at that time were new, and consequently unknown to the Apostles and their successors. But besides, it being confessed, that the lightest pain of <hi>Purgatory</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyes all the sufferings of this world, how can some determinate quantity of <hi>these</hi> be equivalent to <hi>those?</hi> The other explication then of equivalence, is, that such a penance, inflicted and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">How such a Penalty may be said to corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond or be equivalent to such a crime.</note> would, by its exemplarity, cause such reparation in point of Ecclesiastical <hi>Discipline,</hi> as the fault had caused miscarriage and transgression. And this evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may well be determin'd by the discreet arbitration of prudent censors of manners. So that hence also it is apparent which opinion is to be embraced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:53895:136"/>Let it be then established, that Ecclesiastical <hi>Indulgence</hi> remits no more then what the <hi>Church</hi> imposed, or thought fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, for the restauration of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> and that it affords no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for remission of <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> either in <hi>this</hi> world or in the <hi>next,</hi> other then the <hi>change</hi> which is made in the <hi>sinner</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or the <hi>Church</hi> scandalized by him.

            </p>
            <p>The places of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> are<note place="margin">And some Fathers.</note> of more easie solution; For he clearly seems to teach, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> have power to obtain that <hi>remission</hi> be made in <hi>Heaven,</hi> conformable to the <hi>Indulgence</hi> exercised by the <hi>Church</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi> He doth not then imagine, that by force of the <hi>Church</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission the sin is remitted also in the sight of God; but that the prayers of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> especially after their appearance before our Lord, are effectual to that end. And for those expressions of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> that <hi>remission</hi> made on <hi>earth</hi> is <hi>ratify'd</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> they suppose the <hi>Church</hi> made a right judgment of the <hi>Penitent;</hi> which clears the dispute. The design of

                  <hi>Answer,</hi> There are three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of them; the first from suspicion.</note> what <hi>opinion,</hi> what <hi>Church</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.

                  </gap>mes</hi> which if you narrowly scan, you easily perceive them to incline doubtfully to either part of the contradiction, though at first they inclined you only to one.

            <p>The <hi>second</hi> degree is, when the<note place="margin">The second, from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</note> verisimilitude or <hi>probabilities</hi> are very great, and which perswade a man through their difficulties or multitudes, that it is not worth his farther inquisition; but according to the <hi>proportion</hi> of consideration which every thing challenges more

or less in this life, he hath bestowed pains enough in the question. He therefore so satisfies his mind in that point, that he rejects not him that shall oppose it, but if he bring any thing new and unheard of, is ready to give ear to him, and if his proofs merit it, <hi>assent</hi> also. The <hi>third</hi> and last degree of <hi>assent</hi> is his, who will not endure any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,<note place="margin">The third, from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but is certain that nothing can solidly be alledged to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Now I ask of my adversary, whether the first degree be of that quality, that if the Church be supposed upon any occasion to suspect one part of the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be true, this suspicion must prejudicate the opposite? I cannot think any one who is so much as fit to pretend to <hi>Divinity,</hi> can be so foolish as to deny that hitherto it is lawful to <hi>opine</hi> the contrary. For as yet there is properly no <hi>assent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first, rather obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Church to a farther Inquiry.</note> and the <hi>Church</hi> by the very positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the case, resolves on a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÃ¹s inquirendum.</hi> Nay he that should forbid an <hi>opposition,</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:53895:143"/>
would bind the <hi>Church</hi> to a most evident danger of <hi>erring,</hi> and that even in her own Judgment, by which she is carryed to a further enquiry. This being setled, we may observe, the second degree is so compared to the first, that as the first <hi>exacts,</hi> so the second <hi>admits</hi> of an <hi>inquisition.</hi> The same inconveniencies therefore<note place="margin">The second still admits it.</note> recur again, though their danger be less manifest and more remote. It is then an injury also offered to the Church, to prohibit <hi>investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> in this second degree, or to alledg the said <hi>opination</hi> of the Church, to the prejudice of the opposite Doctrine, since, by her very <hi>opining,</hi> she confesses a readiness to thank those who shall take the pains to clear the truth. For she ought not to be thought <hi>opiniastre,</hi> but a Lover of truth, whereever it be found.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> degree cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise<note place="margin">The third is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in the Case.</note> be attained to but by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>authority,</hi> or evident <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;</hi> for a professor of <hi>reason<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

cannot resist the force of either of these. If then our adversary shall be pleased the declare, which of these degres he honours with the <hi>Churches</hi> opinion, it will hence soon appear what answer he ought to receive.</p>
            <p>As for the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, of the Church <hi>supposing</hi> or <hi>opining</hi> any thing, I thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish; that the Church may either be said to <hi>opine,</hi> because she hath established something by a publick and solemn <hi>decree,</hi> or by <hi>private</hi> suffrages: If by <hi>private</hi>
               <note place="margin">An opinion may be held by all the men of the Church, and yet not by the Church.</note> suffrage, then she did it either as a <hi>Church,</hi> or as so many <hi>men.</hi> As when all her members ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg <hi>Columbus</hi> for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of the West-<hi>Indies,</hi> they do it not as parts of the <hi>Church,</hi> or as <hi>faithful,</hi> (for <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> do the same) but meerly as so many <hi>persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the arguer, amongst these three significations of the <hi>Church thinking</hi> or <hi>opining,</hi> choose which he conceives most to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53895:144"/>
If the <hi>first,</hi> let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>decree;</hi> which if he could do, we should not hear so much of the Church's <hi>opinion.</hi> If the <hi>third,</hi> he exposes himself to <hi>deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> for how doth it concern faith, what the Church's senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in matters of <hi>History</hi> or <hi>Philosophy?</hi> The <hi>second,</hi> as it were only useful to his intent, so is it absolutely <hi>false,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> being a congregation of <hi>faithful,</hi> that is, of <hi>believers,</hi> that is, of such as have accepted the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to this day conserved it. But clearly this opinion began about <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi>'s time, was unknown and unthought of in the dayes of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> of little credit before the <hi>Schools,</hi> not yet proposed to, or if it were,<note place="margin">That is by them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that is grounded upon and preserving inviolate Tradition.</note> rejected by, the <hi>Oriental Church.</hi> So that by what other means soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may have speciously insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated it self into the <hi>men</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>Church,</hi> it can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no sway over them as they

are a <hi>Church,</hi> that is, as <hi>believers,</hi> that is, as grounded upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we see how vainly they laboured in forming the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed argument: For be it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>peoples</hi> opinion is the same with their <hi>pastors,</hi> and the <hi>pastors</hi> the same that the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> and consequently the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the men of the <hi>Church</hi> the same that the <hi>School-mens;</hi> it followes not, that it is in the <hi>Church</hi> otherwise then in the <hi>School men.</hi> So that if it be but <hi>opinion</hi> in the <hi>School-men,</hi> and such as may be <hi>changed,</hi> it's being dispers'd through the <hi>Church</hi> will not add to its <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but by consent of the whole <hi>Church</hi> it will be alwayes <hi>subject</hi> to change, and, if suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason be brought, justly to be changed.
